    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is difficult for the Opposition at any time to speak on a Bill of this kind because it is merely implementing the provisions outlined in the budget by the Minister for Finance.  I recall listening this time last year to members of the multi-purpose front bench of the Labour Party being critical of Fianna Fáil and its attitude to employment.  One Deputy asked for specific and detailed explanations as to how exactly the measures contained in the Finance Bill would be implemented so far as employment was concerned. Members of the House do not need to be told what the subsequent results of the provisions in that Bill were.  We created 23,000 new jobs in 1978.  We have taken people off the dole queues.  We have renewed confidence in the people generally.  The community at large is grateful for the amount of work and the <Col N="1855" /> success of the programme and targets set by the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was the single largest increase in employment since the foundation of this State.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting where the jobs were created.  In the public sector the concentration was on the greatest need.  The number of new posts created, mostly in the health services, was 12,500.  In the last general election one of the major issues was the need to provide extra teachers and extra support for schools. The pupil teacher ratio was something that needed to be taken care of.  To a large extent the Government's programme in this area has been an enormous success.</P>
      <P>Additional jobs were created in the prison service, the Garda and the Revenue Commission.  This budget has provided for 500 extra jobs in the Revenue Commission for examination of accounts and in an effort to bring to heel those people who have made a profession of avoiding paying tax.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Barry yesterday when he accused us once again of being anti-family and anti-farmer.  My view is that they cannot have it both ways.  If the Opposition are reduced to attempting to drive a wedge between the urban and rural communities they have the wrong end of the stick.  It is reasonable to point out that we are not a nation of begrudgers but of survivors. We have come through good times and bad together as a people.  We will not accept any policies based on envy or greed.</P>
      <P>Last year the Government set a target of 5,000 new jobs in the building industry and this target was exceeded by 500.  The major contribution to the Government's job creation programme for the construction sector came from the industrial, educational and hospital building projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our commitment to youth has been far ahead of any of the Opposition parties. We were first to recognise the importance of youth and we gave them a special place in our movement long before Labour or Fine Gael or any other party recognised the strength and the needs of young people.  On assuming <Col N="1856" /> office one of our first tasks was to tackle the problem of school-leavers who could not find jobs.  Many parents found themselves unable to support their families as they left school.  Times were difficult.  The Government initiated work experience programmes and environmental improvement schemes in addition to the construction industry apprenticeship scheme and the Ballyfermot community survey.  This involved almost 4,000 participants.</P>
    <P>At the time the Opposition took office the overall level of taxation represented about 40 per cent of national income: by 1976, in their first full year in office, that figure was marginally below 46 per cent. At the outset this Government set up a plan to reduce taxation with the result that the overall tax burden is now about 41 per cent of the national income.  That speaks for itself, but we have not finished.  We recognise that a radical change is needed, that the PAYE sector has a legitimate grievance.  In my view that grievance should not manifest itself in endangering employment prospects for those who need work and have not got it.  That is one of the dangers of what we saw yesterday and before that.  We must not forget those with no work, those on social welfare, the pensioners, the old people, the sick, the disabled who are all living almost on the breadline. Many of them have great difficulty in coming to terms with the position in which they find themselves.  Many of the older pensioners find their existence very lonely and unhappy.</P>
    <P>The nation cannot be managed without reasonable taxation.  Fianna Fáil recognised and did not need anybody on the streets to remind them that the taxation system in some ways is inequitable particularly in regard to distribution and fair incidence of tax in sectors other than the PAYE sector.  But changes cannot be made overnight: I do not think even Opposition parties would pretend that they can be.  The Government are committed to radical change and have shown that they have the will and the ability to bring about such change leading to a fair distribution of wealth in the whole community.</P>
    <P>Substantial reliefs have already been given to taxpayers over a wide spectrum <Col N="1857" /> covering income tax, rates, car tax and so on.  This has put a great deal of money into taxpayers' pockets.  Also, we provided the greatest-ever increase in personal income tax allowances in the two years we have been in office.  We have increased the value of the single persons' allowance as much as 68 per cent and the married persons' allowance by 103 per cent, in effect doubling that allowance.  That does not take into account acceptance of the national understanding. All that is well ahead of inflation. Fianna Fáil have never been behind in dealing with social welfare recipients, the poor, the elderly and so on.  Albeit slowly, but more rapidly than any other party, we have dealt with social welfare children's allowances in the budget and introduced fully pay-related social welfare contributions.  These are only two examples.  In the budget the Minister for Finance provided for an average increase of 28 per cent in expenditure on social welfare children's allowances.  The Minister and the Government deserve credit for that.</P>
    <P>In passing, I may say that I spent some time recently in two of the public social welfare offices in Dublin city and I could not speak too highly of the personnel employed there in their dealings with the public.  Their job is most difficult but their service, their patience and the work they do are outstanding and they deserve the highest possible praise.  The management of these offices is also worthy of praise.</P>
    <P>If all the changes I have referred to are taken into account in regard to income tax allowances, social welfare children's allowances and pay-related social welfare contributions, it is obvious that the Government are making a significant contribution to increasing the take-home pay of all employees, particularly those at the lower end of the scale, which is where the emphasis should be.  For example, a married person with two children earning £60 per week will now have his net income increased by over 6 per cent before acceptance of the national understanding. A man earning £50 per week will have a net income increase of over 8 per cent, which are certainly reasonable increases.</P>
    <P>One thing that worries me is the <Col N="1858" /> desperate efforts of the Opposition parties to drive home an advantage that they themselves think they have in the matter of taxation.  They attempt to drive a wedge between the urban and the rural communities.  They appear to be indulging in the politics of greed and of attempting to separate one section of the community from the other in an effort to gain party advantage.  That is regrettable. It ill-becomes political parties to indulge in such behaviour.  In my first speech to the House I indicated that I considered each Deputy here should be guided by what is for the best interest of the nation but when I hear speeches such as those we have heard from Deputy Barry and others I get the impression that these people thrive on the difficulties of the nation.  However, they have a long way to go before they will be able to dance on our graves.  Such an attitude on their part will not reflect well on them in the future.</P>
    <P>The changes in taxation this year will mean that 21,000 married people and 19,000 others will be free of taxation. The rural community have indicated their willingness to pay their fair share of tax.  The much more moderate approach now of the farmer representatives indicates a willingness on the part of farmers to participate in negotiations with the Government for the purpose of ensuring that a fair share of taxation is paid by farmers, that they contribute like the rest of us to the expenses of running the nation, in maintaining schools, hospitals and so on.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal of talk today about tax evasion.  The policies of envy have entered into the area of the self-employed who are now the subjects of much criticism in regard to tax.  I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the many fine people who worked hard for up to 16 hours per day on each day of the week to make a living for their families.  I am thinking, for instance, of the small shopkeepers who, when times were difficult, extended credit and acted as banker, friend and adviser to many of the people who are now looking over their shoulders in envy at these business people.  It is to their credit that they have expanded their businesses as a result of our improved economy.  The <Col N="1859" /> materialistic society can be seen in terms of a disadvantage to the nation as a whole.  The self-employed, too, are prepared to pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>Recently a plot of land at Monkstown was sold for a figure in excess of £1 million. It was sold to a builder who indicated his intention of building flats there.  This man, according to newspaper reports, made it known that his mother had worked as a waitress in the hotel that had stood on that site.  Here is an example of the son of working parents becoming successful.  It is to our credit as a nation that we have people like him who are prepared, having made a lot of money, to come back to Ireland, invest here and create employment and wealth. Such people, too, pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>The year 1978 was a success.  Perhaps it might have been more successful but we had an overall growth rate of about 7 per cent.  This equalled our best previous performance.  In addition, for the second year in succession Ireland had the fastest rate of economic growth in the EEC. Our inflation rate fell to below 8 per cent or, in other words, it was almost halved compared with the previous year.  These factors were accompanied by a strong upsurge in the volume of investment which last year showed an increase of about 15 per cent.  However, the most important change in 1978 and also the most satisfying was represented by our performance in the field of employment &mdash;an overall increase in employment of 17,000, allowing for redundancies and the previous figure I mentioned of 23,000.  That is a fair record in one year. I do not think that any Opposition Deputy will be ungenerous enough to deny the contribution we have made in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods dealt with the comparisons in employment between 1973 and 1978.  When the Coalition were in power they felt that nothing could be done to bring about a change in employment. Things could have been better last year if we had not had strikes, particularly unofficial strikes.  The Post Office and Are Lingus disputes caused disruption <Col N="1860" /> and cost the nation a great deal of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have provided jobs and tax reliefs.  The provisions in the Finance Bill should help to provide more jobs, greater tax reliefs and a fairer distribution of tax.  When Deputy Kelly and others speak I hope they will speak on the record.  The Deputy cannot deny that there is an air of confidence in the community which has been brought about by the fiscal policies of the Government.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, has been attacked for various statements which, it is said, he has made.  In the history of the State we have not had a harder working, more sincere and better Minister for Finance than Deputy George Colley.  Never before have we achieved such satisfactory results in such a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an invidious comparison because the Taoiseach occupied that office on one occasion.  I know it has been forgotten but he was Minister for Finance for a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand by my statement. The Minister, Deputy Colley, has given the people confidence.  The feeling <Col N="1861" /> that had this nation on its knees two years ago has been removed by the fiscal policies of the Minister for Finance.  Two years ago people were wondering when they would be given a chance to bring about changes in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should get back to the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Finance and to others for the work they have done over the past two years.  The Government have achieved a great deal in a short time and the people will be in a position to recognise their achievements on 7 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>After such a reasonable and temperate speech I suppose it would be ungenerous if I did not say something agreeable.  Let us admit that the Minister is hard working.  Let me go a bit further and say that when that Minister was in Opposition he was hard working there, too.  I also think that he got nothing like a fair deal from the media during the early years of Fianna Fáil's career in Opposition, when he was carrying the weight of his party virtually singlehanded. He was universally sneered at and made little of by the press.  Although he is not my kind of man&mdash;I do not especially admire him&mdash;he is hard working and does his best.  Unfortunately, his best is not good enough, partly because of a peculiarly rigid, party-oriented, somewhat supercilious frame of mind which is a native to him, and partly because of the party to which he feels he has to belong.</P>
      <P>When I find that he introduces a Finance Bill, as he did here yesterday, by reference to the Government's overall targets in relation to the creation of employment and the rescue of the economy, and when I hear that he is held up to admiration as a man who has got this country moving again at a time when there is almost nothing in the country working, I have to ask myself whether he and his colleagues, including Deputy N. Andrews, are living in the clouds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some features of the Finance Bill which I warmly welcome. <Col N="1862" /> They are ones which I urged; and I can nearly claim to be responsible for one of them, one which does not attract much notice.  I raised it here a couple of times during Question Time, and the Minister showed a sympathetic interest to which he has now given expression in this Bill. I made the suggestion that the premiums on permanent sickness and accident policies should be deductible for tax purposes. The Minister has now done that, and I think it is an admirable change. The claim for such premiums to be tax deductible is as strong, if not stronger, than the claim for the tax deductibility of VHI premiums.</P>
    <P>In addition, I must recognise, as I think everyone on this side does, that the introduction of reliefs for residence-related work is welcome.  I do not claim to have been alone in urging this relief, but I have urged it for a couple of years, particularly in the context of energy conservation. I have said repeatedly that the work of insulating old houses which are very wasteful of energy would not only show benefit in our balance of payments and energy conservation but would also give considerable employment.  I hope this measure which the Minister has announced will be adequately publicised and that the small building, decorating or renovating firm which might be given an opening here will be encouraged to go out and look for this work and put money into advertising this facility so that householders will take advantage of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of garden work in this concession although I had not thought of it myself and hope this is not too trivial a matter to mention at the beginning of a speech on the Finance Bill.  When do-it-yourself shops and garden centres are flourishing as they are in every suburb, there must be an opening for enterprising small firms, which could easily be run by very young people, even school leavers, to take up contract gardening on a small scale, advertising themselves by reference to the relief which the householder will now enjoy.  If I understand the Bill correctly, it means that up to £450 can be claimed in a year in regard to this relief.  Someone in the highest band of taxation could be approached on the basis that it would cost <Col N="1863" /> him only £200 approximately for this work.  A great deal of outdoor work could be done for that amount of money. If this concession were properly advertised, I have no doubt that it would lead to a very visible improvement in the standard of visual amenities in our cities and surburbs and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The policy of the State in regard to advertising benefits seems to be obscure. A benefit not just to the individual but to the whole economy, such as I recognise this to be, ought to be properly advertised. Money should be spent on it and I will come back to that point later in a different context.  One must contrast the somewhat neglectful and sloppy approach of the State in telling people about the sums available to them with the enormous sums of money pumped into advertising campaigns, in some cases of a shaming absurdity and futility, such as the unspeakable campaign to persuade us that a few scraps of kitchen Irish&mdash;that is all they are&mdash;are part of what we are.  They may very well be part of what Fianna Fáil are with the self-satisfaction induced by being able to speak three or four words of Irish that everybody's granny knew, even though she knew nothing else.  About 95 per cent of people in this country have spent long years learning Irish at school and we are asked to pat ourselves on the back and regard ourselves as something special if we understand three or four phrases in regard to which hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent. This is a shaming campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is departing from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I want to draw a contrast between the brazen absurdity of this campaign, which is only at home in the leprechaun mentality which the party opposite have displayed since the day they were founded, and the possibilities in a modest improvement which has been introduced by the hero of Deputy Andrews.  Let us see some money being put into that; I will not begrudge it.  However, I very much begrudge the hundreds of thousands of <Col N="1864" /> pounds being spent to persuade me that it is part of what I am if I am able to say &ldquo;la breá&rdquo; and &ldquo;An mbeidh cupán tae agat?&rdquo;  Having spent 12 years at school learning this language, just as Deputy Andrews did, I am supposed to think more of myself if I speak a few phrases which are less than my granny knew.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  These things get under my skin and they should get under your skin as well.  With respect, you should throw up as well when you see that kind of advertising being conducted at public expense.  It is a shame and a disgrace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You are a highly regarded Member of this House in your own right, even though you are sitting in the Chair, and since I address my remarks through you, allow me to draw you into the web of my own rhetoric in this matter.  I appeal to you to ask yourself whether you have stomach for that advertising campaign. I do not believe you have.</P>
      <P>The burden of what Deputy Andrews said was rational and temperate enough and I do not find fault with most of it.  In relating the Finance Bill to the over-all approach of the Government towards their professed targets and towards the desire of the Government to secure full employment, he is not standing back and looking sufficiently closely at what is being done in his name.  The Government are having difficulty even in finding new words to describe agreements.  They have tried the words &ldquo;contract&rdquo;, &ldquo;compact&rdquo;, &ldquo;harmony&rdquo;, and &ldquo;concord&rdquo; and now we have a &ldquo;national understanding&rdquo; in the vain hope that this will suppress everybody's cupidity and everybody's anxiety to get as much as they can.  The Government feel that this &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; will defuse this cupidity or relegate it to a neutral area.  That will not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there has been up to this point a reasonable degree of peacefulness and reasonableness in industrial relations and a willingness to settle for, perhaps, a <Col N="1865" /> good deal less than one originally set out to seek, it is because until lately the feelings of greed and cupidity, so roundly castigated by Deputy Andrews, were not triumphant.  They were suspended like a chemical element in a solution in which ordinary Christian charity and neighbourliness played a part, but in which a part was also played by a kind of muddled conviction that the Government, even though one might not have actually voted for it, were in a kind of way doing their best to play fair with all sides.</P>
    <P>That kind of muddled conviction was part of the elements which kept the cupidity and greed suspended.  But, if I am making chemical sense, those feelings of greed and capidity have now been precipitated into a thick and bloody-minded sludge at the bottom the metaphorical container I am talking about.  The agent which has precipitated them is the realisation that we are now being ruled by a Government who have not made a fair effort to maintain fairness between all sides and to show responsibility, even at the cost of popularity and votes, in distributing benefits and imposing burdens.  Visibly they have not made that effort.  They created a mood during the election campaign and immediately afterwards which guaranteed, as the present Opposition said it would, an absolute intransigence on the part of the very sectors now being ticked off so roundly by Deputy Andrews.  One cannot tell an industrial worker to moderate his wage demands when all he has to do is look around and see, as <i>The Irish Times</i> said yesterday, the people with tans in the middle of the winter.  I will not multiply these examples.</P>
    <P>I agree with the objects the Minister mentioned here yesterday, and which have come through again in the national understanding in regard to wage moderation.  I agree we have to have moderation in wages.  Otherwise we will price ourselves out of this and that. Otherwise, so far as the public sector are concerned, we will impose a burden on the State's back which will break it.  But I have not got the heart to say that to a man on £60 or £70 a week.  How can I say it to him when he knows that three-quarters <Col N="1866" /> of capital gains tax has been remitted and that the wealth tax has gone?</P>
    <P>I see now there is something called a resource tax.  Now that we are talking about Irish being part of what we are it may interest the House to know there is only one Irish word for both &ldquo;resource&rdquo; and &ldquo;wealth&rdquo;.  It is &ldquo;maoin&rdquo;.  In our native language, as that advertising agency would have us believe, the resource tax would come out pretty well as a wealth tax, as a tax on wealth or property.  When that man sees these things being done, what are we to expect him to do?  What reaction is he expected to have to the Taoiseach bleating that we must all pull together, that we must all co-operate, and that we cannot expect the Government to do everything? Before the election, of course, it was a different story.  What is his reaction supposed to be to that?</P>
    <P>He comes home every week with his wage slip from which several pounds are missing out of the total sum he has earned.  No matter what he earns, assuming he does not cheat, he will be paying tax.  I have a lot of sympathy with the farmers, at least in regard to the levy, but many farmers have gone through their lives and never had the experience of seeing so much as a red halfpenny chiselled off a £ note.  For the industrial worker on £70 or £80 a week it is a weekly experience.  What is the use in talking to him about moderation?</P>
    <P>There is no use in denying that a Coalition Government in which one party can lose one or two seats and the other party can lose 12 seats have forfeited a great deal of their popularity. I am not complaining about that.  They may have made some of their own mistakes for which they can be justly blamed.  We did make mistakes.  But one of the things which forfeited popularity for us was the firmness with which we maintained a certain course in regard to running the economy at a time of desperate difficulty.  It is all very well for Deputy Andrews, Deputy Woods and other Government Deputies to talk about things which happened in 1974 and 1975.  There was no economy in the world which was not shaken to its foundations in those years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1867" /> We came through that time with a lot of the Government's popularity forfeited.  There is no question or doubt about that.  It is absolutely true.  But at the price of forfeiting our popularity we achieved a certain understanding with the people that there would be even treatment across the board.  In 1975 and 1976 we sweated here for long months and sat four days a week, until 10.30 at night on three of them, putting through a Wealth Tax Bill, a Capital Gains Bill, and so on.  All for what?  So that the next Government could throw away these things and give them as a present to a slice of wealthy supporters who undoubtedly responded by taking the Fine Gael seats in Kildare, in North Tipperary, in Laois-Offaly and in Louth.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we have the bleating about moderation, about all pulling together, and about a national understanding.  It simply will not wash.  It simply will not do.  The Government look like entering a penitential phase now.  Of course it is a bit late in the day for them to be penitent. Although there is a national understanding on which the ink is scarcely dry, every section in the country is up on its hind legs shouting.</P>
    <P>In conditions like that I would have thought the job of the Minister for Finance was nearly impossible.  I am not just playing politics or beating a drum, but I honestly think the complaints from which this country is suffering will not be put right until there is again a Fine Gael Minister over there and a Fine Gael Government with or without the support of the Labour Party.  They cannot be put right by a Government who have done as good as setting out to ensure the ungovernability of the people.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, evening Deputy Woods was speaking about envy between householders.  He was talking about tax evasion and he said he thought it was sad that since the facts about tax evasion are now so widely known any self-employed person is an object of suspicion to his neighbours.  He mentioned a self-employed man who is most meticulous about reporting every £ he makes and insists on paying tax on everything.  This man was dismayed and hurt and wounded, as naturally he would be, when his next door neighbour assailed him, in words only I suppose, along the lines that he was one of the gougers or the scroungers who are getting away with murder by not paying tax on what they are earning.  He reported to Deputy Woods that the same next door neighbour frequently did nixers in the evening on which he believed he paid no tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very taken with the use by Deputy Woods of that example.  When that kind of spirit gets going it is very hard to stop it.  Far from doing anything to stop it the Government have done their best to inflame it by the measures they announced before the election and which they carried out on getting power in regard to making things light and easy <Col N="1869" /> for the wealthier sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The wealthier sections of the community will be interested in this Finance Bill.  I want to relate the situation in the Finance Bill, which has been published for a week or two, to something which the chairman of the Allied Irish Banks said at the annual conference of the Irish Management Institute in Killarney last week end.  He said he considered that the incidence of personal taxation was so severe that it discouraged the enterprise of the individual and acted as a disincentive to the individual in taking responsibility and trying to work harder for himself and trying to get himself on in life, and so on.</P>
    <P>Naturally I do not want to quarrel with an individual outside this House.  I have no idea what his politics are, and I do not care.  But I want to remind that bank chairman, and the stratum of society for which in a rough sense he may be taken to speak, that the upper limit of personal taxation, severe though it is at 60 per cent or 60p in the £, was 17p higher than that until the National Coalition Government reduced it.  In other words, in 1973 when the National Coalition Government were elected this gentlemen was paying not 60p in the £ on the top slice of his earnings but 77p.</P>
    <P>In saying all sections should be dealt with fairly, I do not mean to say any section should be hammered.  I do not believe in hammering any section.  I believe in making them all visibly carry their fair share of the burden.  Since there has been so much talk about what the Minister has done for the PAYE tax payer it is fair to point out to the people at the top end of the PAYE scale that the whizz executives, the bankers and all these people who laid on such a ferocious lobby about the wealth tax four or five years ago, were relieved to the extent of 17p in the £ on the upper slice of their income, which in many cases would be the bigger slice, not by Deputy Colley but by Deputy Richie Ryan.  They are better off by 17p in the £ thanks to the National Coalition who were supposed to have been so death down on these monied interests.</P>
    <P>I was interested in another thing Deputy Woods said.  It accords with my <Col N="1870" /> own opinion which I voiced here on a parliamentary question a couple of weeks ago in regard to the amount of savings interest which is allowable for tax deduction purposes.  On 28 March I asked the Minister what was the limit of tax deductibility on savings interest and how long it had been at that level.  The answer I got&mdash;and I was sure it would be something like this&mdash;was that it was £70 and had been £70 since 1967.  The paddy-whack syndrome is too familiar to need stressing again but I comment on the fact that, by a curious accident &mdash;and I speak ironically&mdash;it is £70 in Britain also.  I have not the least doubt that it was slavishly copied from the British.  Naturally, anything the British do is more than good enough for the Irish Republic.  That is the philosophy which is held on the benches opposite.  I do not subscribe to it and never did.</P>
    <P>It has been £70 since 1967.  If you multiply £70 up by the degree to which the value of money has fallen in the last 12 years, you will find that the allowance in regard to savings interest should be now well over £200.  Perhaps I am wrong.  I guess roughly £200, perhaps something more than that.  It is high time that that level was increased, and Deputy Woods said so, though not so offensively to his own Minister.  There would be a unanimity on both sides of the House, that savings are a very important feature of an economy, that people should be, for all kinds of long-term reasons, encouraged in the savings habit. It is time that the incentive, so far as it is an incentive, of making savings interest to some extent tax deductible was looked at again.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that that is not contained in this Finance Bill.  I wonder whether the Minister opposite me will recognise that this is a serious suggestion. He knows it to enjoy support from both sides of the House.  I would ask the Minister to consider what the cost to the Exchequer would be of raising this level in conformity with the inflation over the last twelve years and incorporating that in an amendment to this Bill at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There was another provision in the Bill which I thought was a very ill-judged and very ill-timed measure, considering <Col N="1871" /> that the Government is anxious to achieve some kind of peace in industrial relations and trying to damp down excessive wage claims.  This is the provision in section 9 which scales down the relief attributable to interest payments on mortgages, where that interest is being paid at a preferential rate.  I know it is a privilege, and cannot be called anything else if a bank employee or building society employee or insurance company employee is getting his mortgage at 2 or 3 per cent&mdash;I think that 3 per cent is common enough&mdash;while other people are paying 12 per cent.  That is a privilege which is part of the conditions of employment of the banks and insurance companies.  I suppose they use that as bait in order to attract a high level of interest, as indeed they get, from school-leavers looking for employment.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that this is so unjust.  I quite agree that if the State were doing this, there might be some injustice.  I cannot see that a private employer, which is what the bankers and insurance companies are, should not be free, without having the State breathing down his neck, to make what arrangements he chooses with his employees, in regard to preferential rates of interest on loans.  I may be wrong about that.  Perhaps ordinary equity would require that the State should not be treating these people on a level of equality with others who are paying a much higher rate.</P>
    <P>But even if I am wrong about that, I think I am right in saying that this is not the right time to make this change. Figures have been provided for me by some people who have been advising me on this point and it was clear from those figures that this change, although not much publicity has been given to it&mdash;depending on the kind of mortgage a man has and also depending what tax-bracket a man's income puts him into, because obviously somebody at the top of the tax ladder would be relatively much more relieved by this concession than someone who is not paying tax in the highest bracket&mdash;will mean a difference in visible pound notes of between £3 and £4 at the bottom of the ladder <Col N="1872" /> and maybe £7, £8 or £9 a week at the top.</P>
    <P>There is this fairly harmless-looking provision in section 9&mdash;and mind you, there is nobody better able to calculate, although they talk about the extra burden of work implied by the EMS, what this will mean to their pocket if the tax allowance on mortgage interest is scaled down, than these same bank employees, insurance company employees and building society employees.  How do you expect that their trade unions&mdash;I think some of them are too grand to call them trade unions &mdash;their professional associations, in formulating wage claims are going to miss the fact that a Government measure has taken that much money out of their weekly or monthly salary?  They are not going to miss it.  It is visibly going to bump up, soup up their wage claims by at least a corresponding amount.</P>
    <P>I imagine that the Government are making only a trifling saving by this change and, if so, they will pay dearly for it at the other end because its effect will be, undoubtedly, to add a further edge, a further bit of thrust to the wage claims, some of which are already on the table, which are to be, in due course, advanced by employees who will be affected by this revenue adjustment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general objects of this Finance Bill and in regard to the connection which Deputy Andrews made, in his speech here this morning, between these general objects and things which were happening which tended to frustrate them, he spoke about the visible social discord, about the wedges being driven between the different sections of the people, and paid high tribute&mdash;and I acknowledge, a not entirely undeserved tribute&mdash;to his own Minister for his hard work in trying to get things right.  It is not possible for the Minister, because of his position and because of his party allegiance, to get things right, nor will they be got right until his party leaves office. However, within those very severe constraints, these, admittedly, impossible constraints he is doing his best.</P>
    <P>In the course of saying these things, Deputy Andrews actually accused the Opposition of conducting what he called the &ldquo;politics of envy&rdquo;&mdash;a glittering <Col N="1873" /> phrase, indeed, if he had been the first to think of it.  He said we were conducting the politics of envy and, apparently, driving these wedges, fomenting these discords between various sections.  This is something which he must have heard from his hero, Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, because I heard the Minister saying that self-same thing a month or six weeks ago, immediately after the big PAYE march when 200,000 people demonstrated.  The Minister was here in very foul humour on the next day that the Dáil sat and he roared across to these benches: &ldquo;Who was it that was setting up these demonstrations?&rdquo;  He said, in the tone of a spiteful schoolgirl&mdash;he would like to know he said&mdash;in a way that he did know very well who it was&mdash;who was setting up these demonstrations and setting the people by the ears.  The implication which I and everybody else on this side took from his tone was that he was accusing the Opposition of fomenting these strikes and demonstrations.</P>
    <P>I do not speak for the Labour Party. No one seems to speak for them at the moment.  It is possible, though I frankly do not believe it, that Deputy Cluskey or some of his merry men were saying: &ldquo;Now, lads, lay on a massive demonstration and we will get this crowd out the sooner.&rdquo;  This is possible but I do not believe it happened.  It is possible that some people who are behind the organisation of that, more than likely, in fact, were concerned with the Dublin Council of Trade Unions which called for that first demonstration. They may be Labour Party supporters but to accuse the formal Parliamentary Opposition of fomenting discord was outrageous, only understandable in a man who was under stress, overworked and a rather up-tight, rather unrelaxed personality to begin with.  A personality like that, placed under stress and seeing the economy falling into ruins all around him, under the pressure of industrial disruption would be driven to extremes of opinion of that kind, but it was a nonsensical thing to say.  As far as Fine Gael are concerned, some trade unionists who are connected with these demonstrations may have been people with allegiance to our party, but if the <Col N="1874" /> Minister means that there is anybody on these benches who had any privity with the organisation of these demonstrations or with industrial disruption he is wrong. Possibly there is a caucus in my party busily organising disruption, but if so, they have left me out of it and I am not aware of its existence.  They must have excluded me from their councils so far as that dimension of the party's operations is concerned.  The Opposition are not fomenting any discord.  Naturally, any Opposition will use whatever material is lying to hand in order to make a political point.  We had a good example of that from Fianna Fáil when they were in Opposition. We have all done that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Wyse, and his colleagues have done that too in their time; but there is a big and important distinction between doing that on the one hand and actively encouraging discord on the other.  We have not done that.</P>

      <P>The budget debate is not part of what I am talking about.  I am talking about the allegation made by the Minister for Finance and repeated here this morning in somewhat different words by Deputy Andrews in the course of an otherwise unobjectionable speech, that the Opposition were fomenting the politics of envy by encouraging the setting of sector against sector.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister opposite seriously think that when the farmers talk about the mob rule of the PAYE earners and the PAYE earners talk about the farming lobby, these organisations or their members are so dim that they are not able to see with their own eyes what is happening?  Does he think that it requires Deputy Harte and myself or some Labour Deputy to go down and explain to them how they are being dealt with by a weak and shambling Government?  Of course they do not require that.  They have their own leaders at non-political or extra-political level to give them the lead in protests about the tax situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> Let us get this straight before it fades into the mists of time.  The reason for the PAYE demonstration, which has subsequently been characterised by the farmers as mob rule, was the fumbling and cowardly foostering over the farm levy announced on 1 February.  It was not Fine Gael who laid down that levy nor was it the Labour Party.  The main cause was the visible and conspicuous sight of the farmers taking their boots to the budget, and making the levy negotiable within 24 hours when nothing else in the budget was negotiable.</P>
    <P>It was that national spectacle&mdash;and it was a spectacle because it never happened in this country before and never will happen again when the Government changes sides&mdash;which caused the PAYE people to lose their patience.  It was not Fine Gael or the Labour Party who did it.  It was the spectacle of the Government climbing down in 24 hours to the farming boots.  If the thing was negotiable, what other section of the community was invited to come in and say what they would do instead of paying tax?  I pay tax on every penny I have, earned and unearned.  I have never been invited, nor have any of the professional associations to which I belong or the interest groups with which I can be identified, to say whether we think we should be let off this item of tax in exchange for paying tax some other way, I was a ratepayer all my life until rates were done away with.  I was never once consulted by any Government, neither were any of the ratepayers' associations that I ever heard of consulted, as to how we would like to pay rates in respect of the property that we lived in; but the farmers were able to do it.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the farmers and I think the levy is a crude and blunt instrument. It is as primitive as the old window tax or the salt tax, and the Government are going to pay dearly for having introduced it.  They are going to pay even more dearly for not having the courage to stick to it from the first day they introduced it up to the present. They have fumbled, foostered, and let themselves be seen to be cowardly and indecisive.  That is something which, with <Col N="1876" /> all our faults&mdash;and we had faults&mdash;was never said about the Coalition Government. You might not like Deputy L. Cosgrave, Deputy R. Ryan, &ldquo;the Cruiser&rdquo; or any of the others with whom I worked and who remained together for four-and-a-half years, but you knew where you were with us.  If a measure was announced it was proceeded with. We paid the penalty for some of these measures.  I do not whinge about that; unless you are willing to be out as well as in, you have no business to be in politics.  But the people do not not know where they are with this Government, and that is the reason they are becoming ungovernable, not because of Deputy Harte, myself or the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews was talking about the politics of envy.  It is only a little over two weeks since the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was leaping around the country&mdash;when he was in the country at all, which was not often&mdash;posturing about his down-facing of the oil companies.  The oil companies were represented as being universally a collection of villains.</P>

      <P>I admit, Sir, that you have been generous with me but I want to relate it to what Deputy Andrews said. He accused us of fomenting the politics of envy.  What would he say then about a Minister who covers up his own inefficient fumbling in regard to the oil situation by holding up as criminals the oil companies who employ thousands upon thousands of Irish people and on whom thousands of Irish families depend? They are no more saints than is anybody else.  They have the same commercial standards as any business, as an Irish national oil company, a private sector company or any other kind of company would have.  In other words they want to maximise their profits.  That is what business is all about, and I thought that was the message of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They were going around as great <Col N="1877" /> apologists for the profit motive over the last couple of years until it ceased to suit them to do that.  Then suddenly multinationals were the villains in order to cover up the failure of the Minister to stay long enough in the country to get a grip of the situation before flying off on totally unnecessary so-called promotional trips to America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say now is a general thing about the revenue and the money which a Finance Bill aims to raise.  On 28 March last I asked the Minister for Finance a short series of <Col N="1878" /> questions about the proportion of State revenue devoted to various heads of expenditure. There is nothing very revolutionary about this.  It is reported in the Official Report of 28 March 1979, Volume 313, columns 599 and following. I asked him if he could tell the House:</P>
      <P>...the amount of State revenue which will be absorbed by the payment of (a) wages and salaries, ...in the current year as a proportion of £1.</P>
      <P>I also asked about pensions, but we are not concerned about that.  The figure is so staggering that it is important to stop and think about it for a minute.  The proportion of the money which the State raises <i>via</i> the budget and the Finance Bill in the year which will be devoted to the payment of State wages and salaries is 41.6p in the £.  It is not a surprising figure, in a way, because everyone knows that wages and salaries are a heavy burden on the State.  But when we think that more than £2 in every £5 that the State takes in is paid out in wages and salaries to a rapidly growing army of functionaries and their attendant bureaucratic substructures, surely we would all be spared a great deal of bad temper about taxation if the State would see where, not by any drastic measure, they could economise in regard to the rapid expansion of the State services.</P>
      <P>There were times, and not so long ago, when Ministers from both sides of the House would apologise for the overrapid expansion of the civil service and would expect to get credit for keeping the numbers down.  So far have we come from those days, when it was regarded as a virtue in a Finance Minister if he was conserving State resources by being careful not to expand the public services beyond strict and pressing necessity, that we now see in the national understanding published last week the Government saying that, if there is a shortfall in the growth of employment, the State together with the private sector would take up the slack by creating perhaps 5,000 more public service jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either public service jobs are needed or they are not.  Either the public require the services of these further 5,000 people or they do not.  If we require them, let us <Col N="1879" /> by all means have them; but if we do not, let us spare ourselves the expense and spare the people concerned the indignity of employing them in useless duplicatory work.  Surely that point of view is not so old fashioned as to be completely unorthodox and undeserving of a hearing.  When the State finds itself paying out more than £2 in every £5 collected, in wages and salaries, it is insane for it to be thinking of meeting politically-expressed and politically-generated employment targets by pulling a figure out of the air and saying that another 5,000 people will be taken into the public service.  Let us know which Department is short of staff and we will agree to fill up the gaps, but let us not expand the public service irrespective of whether the people are needed or not.  That would simply mean that the next time a Deputy asks a question about the amount of public service salaries the figure will be even bigger than 41.6p in the £.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister to tell us the amount of State revenue which would be absorbed in interest payments on the State debt in the current year expressed as a proportion of £1.  This was again a staggering proportion.  Deputy Colley on 28 March said that the amount of revenue collected which must go out to keep down interest payments is 21.9p in the £.  Surely we are in an absolutely crazy situation where we find ourselves paying out more than £2 in every £5 in wages and salaries and more than £1 in every £5 in interest payments.  I know that the public debt has existed as long as the State, and that Governments borrow for expansionary objects and so forth; but they also borrow just to keep election promises and throw the money away recklessly.  I would be very attracted towards any Government who would commit themselves towards reducing the debt, who would not promise to do this, that and the other to raise a facile cheer.  The Government should commit themselves towards reducing the debt over a term of 15 or 20 years on the assumption that the plan will not be changed, even if they are not in Government that long.  There are EEC countries which have no national <Col N="1880" /> debt.  Belgium, for instance, finances all its expenditure from current revenue.  It will not be easy to get out of this habit, but when we find that we are paying more than £1 in every £5 just to pay the interest on the loans, apart from the principal sums which become due at varying times, it is time to ask ourselves if we could not ease this burden, naturally not immediately, may not in ten years, but surely we should plan to close down the national debt over a period of perhaps 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is near enough to the throne to hear the swish of satin, and he should ask himself what could he do in regard to job creation and in regard to the provision of the infrastructure that we are all shouting about, the roads and the telecommunications, if he had another £1 for every £4 to spend, which he no longer had to hand over to the holders of the public funds.</P>

I am asking the Minister to raise himself to a dizzier height than the Board of Works and ask himself what could he do for public welfare generally if he had an extra £1 for every £4 he had to spend.  The Minister would make himself immortal, he would get himself a deathless name as a politician if he had that extra money to spend.  We should aim at giving ourselves that money.  A Government which can get people to half believe that they are keen on doing away with unemployment should ask themselves whether they might not also plan, in the long run, to do away with the public debt as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to upset the Chair.  I will refer to the bearing that this Finance Bill has on the national understanding which along with the Finance Bill is part of an historic epoch.  The national understanding is based on a wage increase figure of 15 per cent spread over 15 months.  If I were anxious to cause disruption and set sector against sector in the way Deputy Andrews thinks the Opposition are busily engaged in, I would speak my mind contentiously and aggressively, intending to stir up dissatisfaction. However, I will speak my mind temperately.  The 15 per cent in 15 months is too much.  I will not lecture an industrial worker or anybody else, least of all the people at the bottom of the scale looking for that.  It is not enough for them in the sense that, in order to reach the aspirations they are entitled to entertain, 15 per cent is not enough.  But nationally it is too much.  The Minister opposite, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Taoiseach all know that it is too much.  It is roughly three times the figure which was tacitly understood to be the figure on which plans were being made a year ago.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development admitted here on many occasions that the settlement figure is only a paper figure, that what actually happens in the end due to the phenomenon called wage drift is that one ends up with something like twice the agreed figure because of special agreements and so on. That happened last year.  The agreed figure was 8 per cent but we ended up with 16 per cent.  What will happen when we start on paper with 15 per cent?  Will we end up with 30 per cent?  That is why I say, among other reasons, that 15 per cent is too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to damn the national understanding, but I should like to be on record as holding that opinion, and to say the reason the Government and the FUE have been driven to accepting a figure of that level is directly related to the fiscal policy of the Government and <Col N="1882" /> to their divisive activities since their return to office in July 1977.  I am not saying that there might not be a 15 per cent wage round if the National Coalition were still in office&mdash;there might well be; we had bigger wage rounds when we were in office&mdash;but it would be within the limits of what could be afforded, not outside those limits.  It would not be a figure that was conceded against the background of thousands of marching feet and abuse being hurled against one section of the community by the other.</P>
    <P>Those are the conditions Fianna Fáil set out to create and we pointed this out. While I do not wish to damn the national understanding, I must say I am not optimistic about it in the long run, not because of its terms but because of the atmosphere generated by the Government who are presiding over it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>Yesterday when the Minister for Finance spoke on the Finance Bill he said that the main thrust of budgetary policy in 1979 was towards growth of employment, productivity and output to assist in achieving the Government's objectives for economic and social development.  That is the message of the budget and the Finance Bill and I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Finance who has been under severe and unfair attack.  Indeed, some time ago the Leader of Fine Gael accused the Minister of falsifying the figures.  I was surprised by that attack.  It showed the paucity of thought in the party that they had to make that kind of attack in order to gain some advantage over the Government.  That attack did not serve democracy and Fine Gael did not gain any kudos.  Democracy can only take so much.  If statements are made to undermine the authority of Government we are sowing the seeds of grave discontent. Even at this late stage the Leader of Fine Gael should withdraw his remarks.  Not only did he cast doubts on the integrity of the Minister but he also cast doubts on the civil servants in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has done more than any Minister for Finance from the Opposition benches to put the national finances in order.  In addition he has looked after the weaker sections of the community.  This is the kind of commitment <Col N="1883" /> that keeps people in the Fianna Fáil Party.  During the years our party have shown real concern for the weaker sections and in our budgets we have introduced enlightened social programmes. We converted Fine Gael and Labour to forward thinking in the area of social welfare.  We never offered an increase of 10p per week to social welfare recipients.  We gave the pensioners sizeable increases; perhaps they were not enough but they meant that these people did not have to live in poverty. We intend to continue on the course we have taken.  I am sure the Minister will not worry about all the criticism directed at him.  He is carrying out the essential message of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In this Finance Bill we are endeavouring to set the economy on a fair course. We intend to create national wealth and to distribute it fairly.  This is what democracy is about.  I know that many people do not think our taxation system is equitable.  There are defects in it but there are defects in every system.  Edmund Burke said that no man was wise enough to tax and to please.  We have to face that fact.  We have an opportunity now to discard the &ldquo;them <i>versus</i> us&rdquo; mentality and to work for the common good.  That may sound hackneyed but it is sincerely meant.</P>
    <P>It is futile to try to carry on in the present atmosphere.  Yesterday someone referred to political strikes.  In any strike those who are hardest hit are the weakest section.  Every morning I go to the office shortly after 8 a.m. and I see people queueing to draw their pensions because of the present disruption.  I am not going to apportion blame for the present state of affairs because that is futile. There are centres where members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply wish to pay tribute to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for what they have done in helping out in <Col N="1884" /> this situation.  In our taxation system and our budgets we must find a recipe to help us surmount our present difficulties. I have often thought that we should have a State council composed of Government, trade unions and employers.  This could be a permanent fixture that would monitor all the economic trends.  It could be the instrument by which the national wealth would be distributed.  Through this body wage and salary claims could be submitted and instead of people having to strike in order to force an issue their claims could be considered by the board.  The board could examine each claim, including those of pensioners, as well as examining the economy and they could show where improvements could be made.  Many people get far too much by way of dividends and high salaries while there are families and individuals who find it very hard to maintain themselves in even frugal comfort.</P>
      <P>I have seen the energy which has gone into organising demonstrations.  One would not deny people's rights in this respect and when I saw the two recent big marches I said to myself that here were people really concerned.  The vast majority of our citizens want a change in the taxation system and if we are to protect democracy, all of us, the Government, trade unions and employers, must do some serious thinking about where we are going.  Every day public representatives and other concerned people come across cases of extreme hardship.  I am told many hotels in rural areas have almost been put out of business because they are not on the automatic telephone system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxation system must be studied carefully and in this respect I submit that this is not a problem for the Government alone: trade unions and employers must also study the tax system and suggest alternatives.  Old age pensioners are not all that concerned about the tax system because their main problem is to make ends meet.  They say, &ldquo;A plague on both your houses&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Internationally, we have not got the <Col N="1885" /> worst record in regard to strikes and industrial disputes.  Many other democratic countries are worse.  Here, people should consider what the Government have done in each budget to improve social welfare benefits and to make genuine efforts to provide better living standards for pensioners and other less well-off people.  All of us must have a greater concern for the weaker sections, whose interests must be safeguarded.  I can recall a time in this city when such people were extremely badly off.  This Government have done something to ease that situation, but we have not done enough to distribute the country's wealth more equitably.</P>
    <P>Our taxation system has been geared towards making industry more efficient: the Government have been generous in their company taxation policy and consequently large profits have been made.  I am not against private enterprise and the profit motive.  This week the Taoiseach made one of the most important speeches in his career when he pointed out the danger of monopolies in the private or the public sector.  That speech should be studied carefully because monopolies can inflict hardship on our society if they are not controlled properly. The Taoiseach did not belabour private enterprise and monopolies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to relate monopolies to taxation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that it may be because of our company taxation policy that monopolies have been enabled to function in the private sector. However, as I have said, unless we can distribute our national wealth in a more equitable way we will be in trouble all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to make significant progress economically we must attract more foreign investment here, capital from abroad which would be used to the best of our ability.  Reverting to the taxation system, it is no good blaming the Government all the time for all our ills. As I have said, the unions and employers in the private sector also have a duty to consider the taxation system.  I appreciate the concern and the anguish <Col N="1886" /> felt by the PAYE people, but we here are part of that sector.  As Deputy Kelly said, we are taxed on every penny we earn.  We are in the PAYE sector and therefore it astounds me that we have one sector which cavils at paying a fair amount of taxation.  I am not going to indulge in farmer bashing because I do not think it serves any purpose.  However, we would appreciate a more realistic approach from them because they are part of the nation, and a very important part. There is no use in trying to score points off one another, whether it is the farmers scoring points off the townsman or <i>vice versa.</i>  It has got to stop.  There is no use referring to the mob rule of one section. There is no such thing as mob rule of one section.  There are people in the PAYE sector who are concerned over what they see to be inequality of the system and we are behind them in trying to remove these inequalities, but we should examine the beam in our own eye before trying to remove the mote in another's eye.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly took Deputy Niall Andrews to task because of his alleged accusation this morning that the Opposition were contributing to the unrest here. I did not hear Deputy Andrews' remarks but, if Deputy Kelly says he did, I accept his word.  The point I am making is that the agitation directed at the moment against our taxation system can be resolved.  But there is no use in threatening and insulting the Government-unless we are all prepared to find out what is really wrong with the system.  Some people may feel that they are paying too much tax, but then we have to think of the man who has no job.  Should he not be our first concern?  Instead of pulling down any figure who appears to be too affluent we should raise the standards of the family.  I have heard it said even here that there are people who do not want to work.  There may be a very small section who do not want to work but the vast majority of the people want to work; they want to take part in the development of the nation.  Perhaps we as politicians have failed.  We have failed to point out that the road is hard and that nobody has yet discovered the perfect taxation system.  There is an onus on us. We all have a social contract with our <Col N="1887" /> neighbour.  We must use whatever intelligence and ability we have in perfecting the taxation system which, after all, is the basis for development or nondevelopment.</P>
    <P>We have seen huge changes in the last few years.  We can say that emigration is practically finished.  We have a shortage of craft workers in many areas.  This gives an idea of what we could be doing if we were to get goodwill from all sides. We should be working towards a system which will be fair and equitable, with the Government playing their major part, the trade unions playing their major part and the employers playing their part.  Let us always remember that, as trade unionists, most of us have jobs.  The employers have their jobs and the Government have their job.  However, there is a section of people who have no jobs, including many of our young people. If we are to sustain democracy here, we have to ensure that the Government are given every backing in their job creation programme.  I would urge the people studying our taxation system and calling for reform to give the Government that backing.  I am not saying reform is not necessary&mdash;it is, of course.  But I appeal to the people on prolonged strikes to reconsider the whole position in their own interests and also in the interests of those who are suffering so much because of the strike.  I am not trying to apportion blame for the strikes; they are much too complicated for that.  Whatever benefit is given through our taxation system would be much better used if our people at work would co-operate.</P>
    <P>This Bill deserves support.  It may well be that the Opposition parties will oppose the Bill, and that is their right, but I suggest that if they are opposing the Bill they might also recognise the fact that in successive Government budgets our taxation system has been perfected to a great degree.  There is no good in any section demanding more of the national cake than the country can afford.  Each section must pay a fair proportion of tax.  I have heard the farmers say that they are willing to pay their fair share.  I do not know if we have any willing tax payers or not, but the point is that the Government, in their steps to ensure that <Col N="1888" /> all sections pay a fair tax contribution to the national Exchequer, deserve the support of every section.  While the Opposition parties may be tempted to make capital out of the present situation, their advantage will be short-lived and it is going against the democratic spirit of the country.  We must remember that democracy is the best system we know of, but it is a very delicate thing, something to be nurtured.  If there is not sufficient goodwill on all sides, we can do nothing.  The trade unions have shown tremendous goodwill in relation to the national understanding.  They have worked very hard towards it and the same can be said of most of the employers.  It would be far better if we could have said on May day, the day of Saint Joseph the Worker, that we would all aim towards a new deal in taxation so that we can all avail of the benefits given in this Finance Bill.  We could show that a small country like ours, with its traditions and beliefs, can create a society with a fair taxation system, with the weaker sections being our first concern. It would be outside the ambit of this debate to deal with the social services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I shall not pursue that line.  The present Minister has produced ample evidence of his ability and desire to improve the lot of the weaker sections and, indeed, all sections of the community.  I would plead that he be given the full backing of all sections, representative of the trade unions, employers, indeed each one of us, because we have a great deal of strife at present causing people unnecessary suffering. We might all decide that we will endeavour to change this order of things and revert to an ordered system of negotiation.  If the council I suggested could be established, or even given consideration, then we would have a permanent body monitoring wage claims, and adjudicating on them, with an almost utopian situation in which workers of all categories could enjoy satisfactory wages.  At the same time such a council could be monitoring economic trends, ensuring that there was no deviation <Col N="1889" /> from the standards achieved.  All that is needed is more goodwill for such an ideal, when I believe we could have a fairer deal for everybody who wants to make a living in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What a sad spectacle the country presents at present as we discuss this Finance Bill.  Normally the Finance Bill is simply the noncontroversial vehicle for the provisions of the budget.  This year the Finance Bill has a social background for discussion in the House of unparalleled discontent with the country's taxation system.  It is true that persons or groups taxed are never very happy with the provisions under which they are taxed.  But never before in the history of the State since Independence has there been the present outcry on taxation, one which is not confined to the PAYE sector.  We have our farmers protesting against provisions which they say should not apply to them.  The marches, demonstrations, the parades in the streets of cities and towns throughout the country have been fuelled by the deep indignation felt by PAYE wage and salary earners that they bear a disproportionate weight of taxation; that nine-tenths of taxation is collected from them.  That is the justification tion, as they see it, for their demonstrations; they feel that other sections of the community are not as penalised by taxation. Therefore, a general demand has arisen for tax reform, a demand the Government say they have attempted to meet by introducing increased allowances. But back comes the answer from the PAYE representatives, the trade unionists, that a married man with no children on a gross income of £70 a week will have £13.42 deducted from his income between taxation and social welfare contributions, amounting to 19 per cent of his income.  Back comes the answer from the PAYE representatives&mdash;when told of the Government's concern for their predicament&mdash;that the increased allowances afforded them do not keep pace with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we discuss the taxation provisions of this Finance Bill there are many uncertainties to which there are no definite answers at present.  For example, we have no information on the order for the <Col N="1890" /> 2 per cent levy; we do not know exactly where that is to fit into the scheme of things, that is, in relation to the talks with the farmers.  Neither do we know&mdash;and this bears more closely on the protest about the inadequacy of allowances which have been expressed by PAYE representatives, wage and salary earners&mdash;what the annual rate of inflation will be.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has selected a fortunate quarter, the last quarter of the year, and he says it will be less than 5 per cent for that quarter.  There are others, for example, the ESRI, the Central Bank, who predict that over the entire year the annual rate of inflation will be over 12 per cent.  If one were to take a less sanguine view of international oil prices than the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy one might conclude&mdash;taking the effect of such increases into account in our domestic economy&mdash;that one would not be too far off the mark in maintaining that our annual rate of inflation this year would be 15 per cent.  Therefore, the expressed grievance of trade unionists and others on behalf of PAYE wage and salary earners takes on added justification when one concludes that the allowances granted in the budget will lose their value, or will not retain their real worth, if inflation runs at that kind of figure and if the cost of living goes up by that amount.</P>
    <P>Though the general demand for reform of taxation has been made over this period by the marchers and demonstrators&mdash;and the Minister in this Finance Bill attempts to answer how the Government have been seriously concerned to meet this general demand for reform&mdash;I contend the Government have not met that demand at its heart merely by tinkering with the allowances. Basic to the PAYE demand for reform is the undoubted fact that the majority or too many of our average wage earners, those on or near the average industrial wage rate, arrive at the highest rate of taxation too soon in the tax year.  That is basic to their demand.</P>
    <P>In other words, when the Minister for Finance in the budget, behind the plan of increasing allowances to the various groups, abolished the lowest tax band of <Col N="1891" /> 20 per cent and substituted that of 25 per cent as a starting point, at one stroke he cancelled out a great deal of improvements in the allowances given to our wage earners.  He also ensured an earlier passage than before for them into the higher tax bracket.  The average industrial worker is well-informed as to his tax situation and is no longer taken in by cosmetic figures.  Those workers are aware that two-thirds of their overtime goes in taxation.  As they put it: &ldquo;We work for the State at weekends and when we stay to work at night.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are plans to curtail overtime and a suggestion that legislation will be introduced in relation to this matter. However, the dilemma of the average industrial worker is that, with the increase in the cost of living, rising prices, the colossal rise in the price of new houses and rents, he is forced to work even longer hours for overtime money even though he realises that two-thirds of it will go into the Government coffers.  One can easily visualise the extent of this discontent and indignation among such workers.  How many self-employed people would work late nights or at weekends realising that two-thirds of the income would go to the State?  The people I am speaking of include those who constitute a large proportion of our work force, young people who are contemplating marriage and they are forced to work overtime for the one-third purchasing money they consider necessary.</P>
    <P>Knowledge of this kind brings home to us the futility of the notion that somehow the present wave of tax discontent will go away.  There is the feeling that with the approach of summer and, hopefully better weather, all the discontent, the fog and bitterness of the winter will evaporate and be replaced by happy sunny days to the satisfaction of the Government.  That will not happen. Yesterday's march may have attracted only 20,000 people but that was an enormous number of marchers to protest once more against the existing tax system.  I do not believe that the discontent, which the Minister for Finance dismisses so airily, will pass.  The Minister's <Col N="1892" /> optimism is misplaced.  I regret having to say that because I do not get any satisfaction in mentioning any of the discomfitures faced by the Government on the tax system, although the Government richly deserve it when one thinks of the multi-coloured programme produced by them in order to get a majority here. With the tee-shirted manifesto-ed programme the country had no problem in bringing the warriors back and restoring confidence.  As one member of the Cabinet said, there would be no problem if the mighty Government team were returned to office.</P>
    <P>Events have given the lie to that view. I take no satisfaction in noting the present level of discontent, but my fear is that the Government cannot realistically gauge the level of discontent.  It appears that as they look around their 84 Deputies they take the view that they are fire proofed against popular discontent until 1982.  In the meantime they feel that the public will be satisfied with allowances like those given in the budget. That is not the way things are viewed in the streets or in the factories.  Our people are bitter at this administration.  The Government must return to their plans to decide how to head off this discontent and meet it constructively.  We suggested earlier that the Government's faith in increased allowances was misplaced.  They must revise the bands if they hope to meet the discontent squarely.  The too rapid ascent into the higher grades as it bears on PAYE earners at present must be eliminated.  PAYE was never devised to bear so heavily on the average wage earner.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Government's temptation in relation to PAYE, because in one sense inflation will improve buoyancy and assist the finances of the Government.  However, increasing inflation in the economy puts jobs in jeopardy.  We have been told on many occasions&mdash;it was repeated by the Minister in his speech&mdash;that the creation of jobs is the national objective.  We have been told that there will be a massive increase in the public capital programme of 22 per cent over the 1978 outturn. That will not be so massive if the inflation rate is about 15 per cent for this year.  The Minister has told us that the <Col N="1893" /> main thrust of budgetary policy is towards growth in employment with a drive to increase the number of jobs by 25,000.  One does not have to be partisan to be sceptical of that figure.  We cannot see that increase coming about this year.  It is certainly unwarranted when one looks at the inflationary elements which are now present in the economy.  When I was on the benches on the other side very often members of this Government on this side of the House spoke about how much our destiny was in our own hands, that it was useless blaming the Arabs, that the rest of the world did not count, that all was achievable within the three green fields of the jurisdiction of this State.  Certain things which are within the territorial jurisdiction of this State have now got out of control and the Government cannot blame anybody else except themselves.  To what extent have their actions, budgetary, distributive and general economic policies contributed to doubts on whether the national understanding will find acceptance?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated that the implementation of the terms of the national understanding was conditional on acceptance of the provisions of the pay policy for 1979-80.  He said he hoped that the terms of this understanding would be accepted by all concerned. What have the Minister for Finance and the other members of the Cabinet done to get acceptance that a national understanding is needed if the country is to achieve employment objectives? What leadership have the Government given to make the national understanding a reality?  Have we had leadership from the Government that would make it possible to gain acceptance of that understanding?</P>
    <P>I was in this House when the late Seán Lemass was Taoiseach.  I did not agree with many of his policies but he and his Government gave leadership.  I cannot say the same for the present Taoiseach. We have had absence of leadership.  We have had policies which have lead to wider divisions than ever occurred in the history of the State.  I believe that those who represent the PAYE marchers have resisted the temptation to make a town <i>versus</i> country quarrel of the taxation <Col N="1894" /> question.  They have refused to engage in attacks on farming organisations but the same cannot be said for certain farm leaders.  The Government cannot be cleared of the charge that they are chief authors of the kind of potential division which we have at the moment between town and country.  This Government of 84 Deputies have fomented division and discord between town and country.</P>
    <P>The Government backed down on the original budgetary proposal of 2 per cent.  Opinions differ about the justice of that measure.  The Cabinet decided on it and then reversed their decision.  They executed a U turn in full public view in three stages.  There was the Ard-Fheis, the half way turn, the middle of the road turn by the Minister for Finance.  It was to stop at sheep and the handicapped areas.  It was to include the vulnerable areas of beet, Tuam and west Galway, the heartland of the support of the Government.  We then had the complete U turn some days later.  That understandably enraged the majority of the PAYE wage and salary earners.  It is to the credit of the trade union leaders and the PAYE representatives that they did not rise to that bait and say that their sole enemies in this matter were the farmers.  They sought instead to put their case for tax reform in a wider and fairer setting.</P>
    <P>They said they had a general demand for tax reform which should include improving the allowances, their indexation, examination of the bands and some immediate alleviation.  They said that if they were to be taxed so also should all other sections of the community.  Their appeal was addressed to a Government who saw nothing wrong in their policy. Deputies on the Government benches broke into spontaneous applause when the Minister for Finance on the occasion of that first glorious budget of theirs, when the sun shone bright on all their promises and each week witnessed another present, abolished the wealth tax.  That is the type of Government the PAYE representatives appealed to.  They saw nothing wrong with abolishing wealth tax under the slogan of increasing employment.</P>
    <P>We know what happened last year in regard to increasing employment in <Col N="1895" /> manufacturing industry.  The figures sought by the Government were not achieved.  When they were not achieved by private industry the Minister for Economic Planning and Development hinted darkly at a Cuban solution.  We have not heard any further details about that particular plan of his.  The abolition of the wealth tax could scarcely have been calculated to enhance understanding and get agreement for some kind of national contract.</P>
    <P>We also had the additional intention of cutting corporation profits tax 10 per cent without tying that massive concession to any condition that the companies getting it should increase their employment. I have no criticism to make about giving as many concessions as possible bearing in mind all our expenditure and all our programmes.  I have no objection whatever to assisting industry if industry responds with the additional jobs.  The logic escapes me how we may hand out concessions to industry without linking the concessions to the need for more jobs.</P>
    <P>This administration is probably the most right wing in Europe.  The leader of the party of reality in Britain, Margaret Thatcher, might like to introduce their taxation policies but she lacks the political nerve to introduce them.  She is on trial before the British public in their election tomorrow but I doubt if she would embark on some of the policies embraced with such gay abandon by the Government here who pride themselves on being a central party, a party representing the average man.</P>
    <P>I referred to the abolition of the wealth tax.  While high in his proverbial ivory tower the official ideologue of this Government, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, might be convinced of the economic sagacity of abolishing the wealth tax, seeing it as an incentive and encouragement, as Adam Smith would have seen it some centuries before, anyone with an understanding of how our people think could have told him that that measure would not bond society together but would rather divide it, that whatever the merits of its <Col N="1896" /> economic usefulness, that measure must increase the forces of envy and suggest to the PAYE wage and salary earners, labouring under their burden of taxation, that some were getting it light while other were getting penal taxation.</P>
    <P>Far from acceding to the general demands for tax reforms by PAYE wage and salary earners, the Government are extending the PAYE tax net to include categories which have been excluded up to now.  Section 10 makes liable for tax the benefits of the disabled, the unemployed, maternity allowances and even the deserted wives benefits.  Over 100,000 persons who depend on such benefits for income maintenance will now become liable.  There was no reference to these harsh measures made by the Minister for Finance in his recent budget.  No Government with the least pretension to a serious commitment to social justice could have embarked at this time of unparalleled discontent with our tax system, at this time of rising prices, on the course of extending the tax net to the benefits of the disabled, the unemployed, maternity allowances and deserted wives benefits.</P>
    <P>At one time there was a saying that a leader of that party merely had to look into his heart to know what the Irish people thought but, I do not know whose heart this Government are looking into. As a person closely acquainted with the way industrial workers think and feel about the tax issues, I must tell the Government that their present reform, tinkering with the tax system, will not allay the present wave of discontent and that they should console themselves with the idea that because yesterday's march was not 100,000 strong somehow the discontent will go away.  It will not.  The Government may get their think-tank into operation, they may bring them back from semi-retirement soon because the next general election will be fought on taxation.  It is an issue as big as that and will last in full strength until that election.  I believe it will be a factor in other elections which are approaching. This matter lies outside the scope of our discussion here; it bears on it only marginally.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance and his Government believe that they have <Col N="1897" /> worked hard to achieve national understanding, they are suffering from a very severe form of amnesia.  They forget the general tenor of the action of this Government since they came to office. We know how they came to office.  They propagated in the manifesto what I refer to as the philosophy of the pig trough: the group with the biggest snout got the biggest reward.  The group with the biggest electoral clout got the biggest selection of sweets and so they brought back 84 Deputies.  If one does that in election time and follows that bible through in office, one cannot have a community which is bonded together.  One gets what we have now: a community divided as never before with all the elements of a large town and country split, with the leader of the farmers, calling the PAYE section &ldquo;that mob&rdquo;, with the Government vainly in the middle attempting to quell the rising storm, with mayhem in the industrial relations situation.  I know something of mayhem in industrial relations. When I was on the other benches, day after day I heard charges from these benches asking what I was doing about this strike or that strike.  The answer now is that one does not do anything about strikes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Government are ambitious to gain support for their policies, not simply at election time but when in Government, their policies must be seen to be transparently fair.  That is the failing of this Government's policy. The regressive nature of our taxation system, as a result of this Government's policies, has been reinforced rather than reduced over the 18 months.  Now the PAYE wage and salary earners see the cumulative effects of the action of the Minister for Finance&mdash;the full weight of the entire Exchequer bill falls exclusively on their shoulders.  They see themselves suffering a major rip-off in our tax system and have authoritatively expressed the view, through their trade unions in their peaceful demonstrations, that they will not tolerate this situation much longer.  That is the situation which this Bill refuses to face.  As I have said they increased the net rather than reduced it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowances, such as they be, are inadequate if account is taken of rising inflation.  The only resort the overtaxed wage earner has is to seek higher wage claims with obvious consequences for industrial relations and we have seen some of these.  Other sections of the community may resort to avoidance by the use of accountants.  We may not know the effects of that&mdash;there may be missed <Col N="1899" /> revenue there but it will not take any public form of discontent.  That is the path they take but the path the PAYE wage and salary earner takes is to lodge a pay claim.  It is logical when one considers the situation.  What should the overtaxed young wage earner do when he wants to buy a house which has gone up by over 30 per cent in the last one-and-a-half years?  One logical way is to lodge a wage claim and to him and others like him what does it suffice if a Minister says his wage claim is unjust and will make his product uncompetitive? The answer from the wage earner is that he is overtaxed and what is he to do.</P>
    <P>The Government have not really gauged the extent of the present discontent. Their complacency is misplaced. Their 84 Deputies can fade overnight if this discontent is not quelled.  We live in a strange period in which there are no longer the old certainties and loyalties. The whole tax controversy and reform campaign needs far more radical answering than is given in the Finance Bill.  It will not go away.  Increased allowances is an inadequate response.</P>
    <P>We must avoid wage settlements that will not assist us especially in conditions of our membership of the European Monetary System.  It is clear that if wage earners are forced into lodging high wage claims we can only look forward to an increase in unemployment which none of us want.  We are not pretending that tax can be abolished.  It cannot. However, we are all claiming that the system is unjust.  Anyone who looks at the plight of the PAYE earner will accept in fairness that by comparison with other groups he is unfairly taxed and his sense of injustice is grounded in fact.</P>
    <P>What has been increased as part of the national understanding?  The ceiling has been increased to £7,000 for health coverage.  What does one say to a man who is forced to do excessive overtime and because he had a good year goes over that figure and is not covered? What do we say of the man who is forced to contribute under the new social insurance plan and is deprived of the benefits?  What do we say of the double <Col N="1900" /> taxation under which he labours?  His gross income is taxed and is also deducted for insurance purposes on a percentage basis and yet he is not covered.</P>
    <P>Wage earners have done their sums.  It is no longer possible for a Minister for Finance to carry off the illusion successfully that increasing the allowances in a budget is adequate to keep tax levels within reasonable bounds as they affect the PAYE earners.  They are all aware from their pay packets how the allowances work out.  They see how, if children's allowances are no longer deductible for tax purposes, the increased allowance is devalued as a result.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we will be looking for the incorporation of the principle of indexation as it relates to allowances so that at least they will keep pace with inflation and retain their real value.  It is not a new principle.  It has already been incorporated in the corporation profits capital charges.  One can get credit for rising inflation in terms of set-off in relation to capital profits.  We will be looking for the inclusion of a similar principle when it comes to indexation of allowances.  It is one thing for them to retain their real value but the heart of the matter lies in the review of the balance of tax and in a more graduated tax band system so that those on middle incomes are not taxed at the highest levels too rapidly, as is the case at present.  The obvious and most dangerous consequence from our point of view is that the too rapid ascent into the highest brackets of taxation for a great number of middle wage earners must have adverse consequences on industrial relations.</P>
    <P>As I said, the resourse of the overtaxed wage earner is to seek remedy in higher wage claims.  He has no other remedy.  We know that in many cases these claims lead to stoppages, disruption and many difficulties.  Would it not seem logical that our taxation system should supplement and improve the chances of good industrial relations? That has been my fundamental criticism of this budget and this Bill.  The question I asked on the budget is the question I ask on the Bill: what does it do to improve the climate for industrial <Col N="1901" /> relations?  The Minister hopes that the national understanding will be successful. I believe that the Government in their own actions has not assisted the emergence of sufficient support for the national understanding.  In their general budgetary policy they have not been fair. They have spread the opinion abroad that they favour certain sections of the community, that they are ready to negotiate with one section and do a deal. We know that the talks with the farmers have broken down but we still have not the actual legislative instrument in respect of this Bill before the House so that we can discuss it here.  However, the Government have given the impression that generally speaking their policies are not directed to eliciting the kind of support necessary for the employment policies which they say are necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the bad state of industrial relations is sought by the Government but I suggest that the Government have a direct responsibility to assist in bringing about good industrial relations and more particularly in the area under their own jurisdiction, the public service.  We know the public service has been experiencing a degree of militancy unknown for a considerable time.  While one may not ascribe one single comprehensive reason for the high level of conflict between both sides in industry and throughout the public service at present, if one were asked to give an opinion about one comprehensive reason I would say that the Government's taxation policies have a great deal to do with the degree of unrest.  In any negotiations a wage claim is considered in the light of insurance deductions, the net take-home pay after tax deduction.  These are the normal calculations for negotiators.  This trade-off between tax and pay is, I think, the correct procedure; but the trade-off idea must come from a Government which are seen to be fair in their treatment of all sections and seen to be pursuing a distributive role in taking that oad.</P>
    <P>This is not a Labour Government, but as a national Government they must seek to represent all sections and they are not doing that at present.  I agree that the ideal route to concord in regard to <Col N="1902" /> the Government's economic policies as they influence taxation is that there should be a trade-off.  There should be accord between those policies and wage negotiations.  That was my aim in a previous effort at national understanding when&mdash;in 1976, I think&mdash;we had the tripartite meetings between Government, employers and unions.  On behalf of the Government at that time I made an offer of £100 million, half of it for job creation and half for tax reform.  There followed the national agreement in 1977.  It may have had its critics.  Government spokesmen who were then in Opposition were critical of it, but when people look at that agreement in retrospect they will see that it made a not inconsiderable contribution to the rise in exports and the improvement in the jobs situation in 1977 and 1978.</P>
    <P>We are now back, as inevitably we must come back, to another attempt at the same kind of tripartite arrangement. That is what the Government have embarked on in this national understanding. I make the reservation that this attempt at national understanding comes from a Government which have given a leadership which seems to set society at odds with itself.  They inherit a state which is now at war with itself.  That is not surprising because Fianna.  Fáil achieved Government by setting society at odds with itself.  In the cynical term of the advertising industry, they segmented the market: each man had a price, each section of the community was given a present.  Now the Government seek to restore unity to society and seek national understanding half way through their term of office with double digit inflation returning.</P>
    <P>One does not know how many tricks are left in the lockers of this Government but it is a national tragedy that, at a time when this economy, with other economies, has been experiencing improvement in growth, all that precious time has been squandered in policies that have set society at odds with itself.  It is a national tragedy that the Government with their overwhelming mandate were not able to give adequate national leadership over this period.  They failed to provide that leadership and they ran from the problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement was reached on 24 April last between the Government and representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of employer and industry organisations on proposals for a &ldquo;national understanding for economic and social development&rdquo; which incorporated proposals on a policy for pay.  I had the document laid before both Houses on 25 April. Implementation of the national understanding will be conditional on ratification of the pay provisions.  Should these provisions be rejected by either party or if, despite being accepted, they are widely disregarded in practice, the parties to the understanding will not be obliged to honour the commitments in it.  The various organisations concerned are making their own arrangements for consideration of the national understanding, including the policy on pay, in accordance with their respective constitutions.</P>
      <P>The understanding represents a new approach on the part of the parties concerned to employment, economic growth, industrial relations, pay, welfare and related matters.</P>
      <P>I believe that it can bring about a new sense of national purpose and commitment and offers a prospect of a new unity, a new stability and a new attitude which will focus on co-operation rather than confrontation.  I would therefore urge on all concerned to accept the proposals in the national interest.</P>

    <P>While in recent weeks there has been a short-fall in some oil products I do not accept that there is a crisis as such in oil supplies.  There have been and still are problems in meeting our full requirements. The information available to me indicates that there have been considerable increases in sales of most oil products, including motor gasoline and gas/diesel oil, in this country in the first quarter of 1979.  So far as the future is concerned I would like to assure the Deputy that everything possible will be done to improve the security of our oil supplies.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he is aware that a diesel only filling station in County Meath (details supplied) had its supply allocation cut from 6,000 to 3,000 gallons per week; whether this cut reflects the general scale of the present diesel shortage; and the steps it is proposed to take to have this station's requirements filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  I am informed by the oil company concerned that they have been supplying the filling station in question only since October 1978 and that it is not correct to say that an allocation or quota of 6,000 gallons of gas/diesel oil per week was made.  They also inform me that the average supply to the station in the period 1 October 1978 to 30 April 1979 was approximately 1,700 gallons per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that sales at this station were affected seriously because of the weather during January and the first half of February which affected the routing of traffic, and that in the latter part of March the station was receiving and selling 6,000 gallons a week, that it retained that level and that that was the amount being allocated to it and sold by it?  Is he aware that that amount has now been cut to <Col N="1910" /> 3,000 gallons?  Why has a cut on that scale been made?  Why has any allocation been based on what happened last October, considering the current rate of sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The station in question never received the quantities suggested by the Deputy.  The maximum amount that it ever received in any one month was 15,300 gallons in the month of March 1979, which is a long way short of the figure of 6,000 gallons a week which the Deputy mentions.  In April 1979 it received 12,000 gallons which is well above the average of what its sales were since the company in question began to supply the station in October 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the weather improved so much in February that sales to this company increased sharply between the first and second halves, that the 15,000 figure for the month does not reflect the rate of sale for the latter half of the month, and that it has been cut back by half?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it only got going since October and as the weather diverted traffic it was a self-evident proposition?  Is the Minister aware that the station was selling 6,000 gallons a week and that it has been cut to 3,000 gallons a week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I am aware that there have been press reports about shortages in petrol supplies though such reports have been few in the past week or so. Reports of petrol shortages in some areas still come to hand but investigation of such reports recently has revealed the existence of special factors at local level. In all such instances my Department have taken steps to have the situation remedied.</P>
      <P>I should add, however, that in present circumstances it would be unrealistic to expect that oil supplies of all kinds, including petrol, will continue to be in unlimited supply.  It should be clear to all by now, having regard to reports by oil companies of shortages of one kind or another, that maximum economy in use of petrol and other kinds of oil is necessary by all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister see a report in <i>The Evening Press</i> as recently as last Saturday to the effect that petrol was being sold at a filling station in Drimnagh at £1.20 a gallon, the reason being that the station could not get their ordinary supplies at the usual price, and that the owner of the station was quoted as saying that they had a contract with Shell for a monthly allocation but, like many other stations, they had been running short before their next allocation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will publish a White Paper on oil supply in advance of the legislation proposed in regard to a National Oil Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structures and functions of State oil organisations in the EEC and <Col N="1915" /> elsewhere, have, of course, been considered in relation to the proposed legislation and I have no doubt that the text of the Bill, when published, will contain a number of provisions similar to those in the legislation of other countries.</P>
    <P>However, the fundamental considerations as regards structure and functions which I have in mind for the national oil corporation are the energy needs of the Irish economy and, in particular, the security of future oil supplies.</P>
    <P>Given that the discussion document &ldquo;Energy-Ireland&rdquo;, published in July 1978, contained information on oil supply in the context of over-all energy policy I do not propose to publish a White Paper on oil supply at this stage.</P>
    <P>I expect to introduce the legislation later this year at which time Deputies will have the opportunity to discuss all aspects of the proposed corporation and the general question of oil supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Green Paper to which the Minister referred only contains a small section on energy, would the Minister consider that by now his reflections on this matter might have reached the point where he could tell the House for example whether it is envisaged that this national oil corporation would have any private sector content, or would it be a purely State-created body?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1928" /> I would refer the Deputies to the recent statement I made concerning the Government's decision about the ESB nuclear project.  That statement made it clear that special legislation dealing with the building of nuclear power stations in this country and providing, in particular, for the setting up of a special tribunal to hold a single comprehensive inquiry, in public, into all aspects of the ESB project will be introduced in the Dáil.  While the precise terms of the Bill have not yet been settled, it is intended that the proposed inquiry will permit consideration of the environmental and planning aspects presently covered by the Planning Acts and the Water Pollution Act and also such matters as health, economics, safety and security.  The necessity to provide for appeals to An Bord Pleanála will not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental committee comprising representatives at senior level of relevant Departments is being set up to assess the ESB nuclear proposals in detail, as well as investigating all other relevant aspects of the project such as energy demand forecasts and all alternative means of meeting this demand.</P>
    <P>Three meetings of the inter-departmental committee have already taken place and it is my intention that the committee will report to me before the tribunal sits so that their report can be published and presented to the tribunal.  The proposed tribunal will, of course, be free to consider evidence from other sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that experts who have experience in the building and operation of these nuclear power stations will be invited by him to give evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for the tribunal as to who gives evidence. I would envisage that certainly one person at least with knowledge of that kind might sit as a member of the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he has available to him an estimate, in current money terms, of the cost of building a nuclear power generating station of the capacity proposed for the Carnsore site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the ESB have only recently been authorised to proceed with completion of the preparatory process of bringing the nuclear project to the stage where complete draft specifications and estimates of costs will be available.  Until this stage has been reached it will not be possible for the ESB to furnish to me an estimate of the cost of building such a station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got a definitive estimate in current cost terms and I do not think it would be possible for the Department or the ESB to give that with any reasonable degree of accuracy until, for example, it has been decided which type of reactor will be used in the station, because I presume the costs of reactors of different kinds vary considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not a planning application been made in respect of the power station, and surely that application must have told the county councils in round terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy probably knows, the figure estimated by the ESB in 1973, when the then Government approved of this proposal, was £126 million.  For a slightly larger, 650 megawatt station, the ESB estimate was £350 million in 1977 terms.  I gave an estimate towards the end of last year: in terms of costs at that time&mdash;I was given this figure as indicative rather than definitive&mdash;it was £400 million.  It is probably a bit more now.</P>

    <P>17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1930" /> Industry, Commerce and Energy if, in order to expedite the work of the inquiry into the proposal for a nuclear power station, he will contact the groups and individuals, of whose interest his Department is aware, formally advise them of the impending inquiry, and invite them, even in advance of the establishment of the inquiry's precise terms of reference, to prepare such written or oral submissions as they wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the wide publicity given to the Government's recent decision about the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry into the nuclear project, I do not consider it necessary to contact or advise any particular groups or individuals as proposed.</P>
      <P>It will, of course, be a matter for the tribunal itself when established to decide whether to invite specified groups or individuals to make oral or written submissions to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would the Minister not agree it would be wise for him to lean over backwards if necessary in order to show courtesy, which has been conspicuously lacking until now, in his dealings with these groups, even to the extent of writing to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little reason to doubt that the groups concerned, numbering five or six, are well aware of the announcement I made of the Government's decision in February.  The reason why I have little doubt that they are aware of what I said is that they have all commented publicly on it.</P>

    <P>The company shortlisted a number of locations in Ireland for the project. Limerick was very seriously considered as a location but following a detailed study of possible locations the company selected Dublin.  The decision on where a <Col N="1934" /> new project is to be located is taken ultimately by the promoters.</P>
    <P>A decision has not been taken, so far, on where the laboratory should be located but it may be desirable to have this facility near the new project.  The new laboratory will assist in the specialised training of graduates and technicians for this and other electronic companies.  It would also provide research and development facilities for these companies.  Irrespective of where the laboratory is established the benefits would not, therefore, be confined to any one region.</P>
    <P>Establishment of the laboratory at a location other than Limerick is not seen as likely to affect development of the electronics programme at the NIHE.</P>

The payment of capital grants approved by the Industrial Development Authority when its new industry programme is made on foot of certified <Col N="1935" /> expenditure on eligible fixed assets and not as new jobs are created.  There is a time-lag between the installation of new plant and machinery and the creation of new jobs on the factory floor.  On the other hand employment on occasion may precede the payment of grant.</P>
      <P>The average cost in grants per job of projects approved under the authority's new industry programme in recent years has been as follows: 1976, £2,970; 1977, £4,368.  Although final figures are not yet available, the estimated cost in 1978 was only marginally in excess of that for 1977.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>A number of redundancies have been announced by the company but these are very substantially below the figure of 170 mentioned in the press report early in March.  I am advised that the problems that have given rise to the present situation are essentially marketing ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, on application from the company, approved technical assistance grants totalling approximately £5,000 to the company recently to help them to undertake consultancy projects designed to improve efficiency.  The relevant State agencies coming within my sphere of responsibilities, are the IDA and Córas Tráchtála.  The company received help in various forms, including financial, from Córas Tráchtála to help it to develop export sales and other requests for assistance of a similar purpose are at present under consideration.  No approach for grant assistance was made to the IDA in the past 12 to 18 months but large grants were made to the company at earlier dates.  The authority have been in constant touch with the company in recent years and have been monitoring the position through a <Col N="1937" /> nominee director on the board.  While the company were in touch with Fóir Teoranta some considerable time ago no application for financial assistance was in fact made.  The company have received about £61,000 under the employment maintenance scheme administered by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>As regards other industries in Offaly which may be threatened with redundancies the position is that State assistance or advice for firms in difficulties is channelled mainly through the appropriate State agencies, notably Fóir Teoranta and the IDA, and any appeal to these agencies for assistance will, I am sure, be considered as sympathetically as possible by the agencies within the limits of their statutory powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Were all the grants that were due to this firm by the IDA paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can see from the information here it is very complicated, and there is a great deal of it, but very large sums of money were paid to this company.  The only grant that I can see which was not paid in full was a technical assistance grant where £73,569 was approved but £68,691 was paid.  From the way it is set out here it is not clear whether the approvals were any higher at any stage.  I would imagine that they were not in fact.  So far as I can see the full amounts were paid.  Certainly in the last 18 months the payments are higher than the approvals because they were carried forward from the previous approvals which took place outside of that time.  There are some applications on hands for grants from CTT which are not yet paid but they are small amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowan Mr. Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the number of redundancies that have taken place in the company was a lot smaller than originally was thought. On the basis that ten years ago 900 people were employed in Clara and that figure is now down to around 500 notwithstanding the fact that the Minister by letter recently informed me that the IDA were actively involved in procuring a further site for an advance factory in Clara, I would request the <Col N="1938" /> Minister to ensure that this is done as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

I do not know the exact up-to-date figure but I know that in one area alone which I visited they told me the area was 1,500 acres. Therefore, presumably the total area is a good deal greater.  I speak purely as a layman but it may not be very economic to grow this sort of waste type timber that is suitable for biomass on cutaway bog.  Cutaway bog may be a great deal more valuable than that and it may be that it would be more in the national and general economic interest to plant more valuable crops on cutaway bog than biomass-type timber which might be more usefully grown on poor quality western hills and bogs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point before Question Time that the economic climate of receptivity for the terms of the national understanding has not been improved by the measures of this Government in their budgetary strategy over the last few years and notably the most recent one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our tax system, far from becoming more progressive, has instead become regressive.  In fact, the burden of taxation being carried this year by the PAYE sector will be greater than last year.  Despite the benefit of the allowances mentioned by the Minister in his budget, PAYE earners generally will continue to pay a larger amount of their income this year by way of tax.  Far from that discontent being dispelled rather I see it remaining a potent factor embittering industrial relations in this next year or two unless there is a constructive response by the Government in this Finance Bill.  I do not believe that the Government in their budgetary strategy have helped to encourage a climate of support for the national understanding. It is important from the country's point of view that an agreement along those lines should be won from the trade unions.  But this Government in their general policy have not assisted <Col N="1952" /> the winning of that understanding and support.</P>
    <P>There is a question I should like to ask.  We do not know yet why the terms of agreement with the farmers have not been included in this Bill.  We do not have them before the House.  A question that must be asked also is why the provision in the national understanding for this increased grant at Christmas of £175 is not in the Finance Bill before us. I am not aware at this point that there is any such provision in the Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister whether there is any intention to introduce such an amendment to the Bill.  This is the figure of £35 million referred to earlier.  I should like to know whether there is any such intention to include it in the Bill.  It will be said that there is no point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am pointing out is, then, that it would be the Minister's intention to amend that element of the Bill in the event of no understanding being reached.  I presume that would be his intention.  That is one question answered.</P>
      <P>The other question I should like to ask is in relation to the agreement with the farmers' leaders.  While we do not have details of it here the point will be made that since it will not take effect until next year we do not have any reference to it here.  The same logic does not appear to obtain in relation to the taxation of the new social welfare categories.  Again, in their case it will not take effect until next year, but we do have reference to it in section 10 of the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> Section 10 of this Finance Bill makes liable to tax the benefits of the disabled, the unemployed, maternity allowances and even the deserted wives' benefit.  It is true that on the passage of this Bill the 100,000 people who depend primarily on these benefits will be liable to tax next year.  The logic does not seem to hold up that there is provision in this year's Bill for their liability to taxation next year, whereas we have no provision in the Bill, as yet, for similar arrangements in relation to the farmers.  One wonders what is the reason for this inconsistency, whether it lies in the fact that there is no final position in relation to the farmers' situation generally.  I have referred to the obvious unfairness of making liable to taxation the benefits of these 100,000 extra persons and I do not see how any Government with a serious commitment to social justice could have embarked on that course.  Surely, the point can be made that this Government, far from acceding to the demands for tax reform, have extended the tax net to ever new categories.  Apparently it is all part of the philosophy of this Government of making the poor pay for the services even more extensively than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The criterion I have adopted in relation to this budget and Finance Bill is: what constructive contribution the budget and the Bill would make to improving industrial relations.  I answer that I cannot see the nature of the constructive contribution because it has not brought the kind of relief generally sought by PAYE wage and salary earners.  It has left them the sole recourse of making increased wage claims. Therefore, the budget, since it did not lighten their tax load, does little to improve industrial relations.  That has been my major criticism of the budget and this Finance Bill.  In context there has been a good deal of criticism of individual members of the Government for their handling of industrial relations issues.  I think the present Minister for Labour at times has been unfairly criticised in this connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That Minister has not been assisted in his task by a budget and Finance Bill which does not lighten the burden of taxation on those liable to PAYE.  The discontent will not disappear and the trade unionists who marched recently to express their dissatisfaction with the present tax system will continue to look for relief in their tax burden.  The Minister is fooling himself if he thinks that a cosmetic exercise in increasing allowances will meet the case.  I do not believe it will because the allowances he has given will be eroded by inflation during the year.  Many people believe that inflation this year will be in excess of 12 per cent and may be nearer 15 per cent.  There is no point in selecting a quarter and saying that inflation is less in that quarter.  Increases in commodity and oil prices, factors which are, admittedly, outside our control, will help erode the increased allowances granted by the Minister in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the actions of the Government such as abolishing the subsidies on food have worsened the inflationary situation.  Many of the Government's policies are in conflict with each other. If, in an effort to make the budget terms more attractive, the Government attempted to raise revenue by removing the food subsidies and increasing indirect taxation they did so at the cost of embittering many of the lower paid workers with families.  It is reckoned that the removal of the food subsidies meant an extra £2 to £3 per week to the food bill for families of four or five children. The proportion of such a family's budget spent on food is higher than that spent by families with higher incomes.  That is another illustration of how one aspect of the Government's policy is at variance with over-all Government policy which has been described as an effort to improve industrial relations so that the new <Col N="1955" /> national understanding will be accepted by all sides.</P>
    <P>There is a contrast in the budget between an administration that had all the answers and one that now appears to have very few, between an administration that seemed to be action-packed and one that now appears to be paralysed by inaction and between promises beforehand and disappointment in office.  They now have a community at war with itself.  With their over-all majority they raised expectations beyond realistic levels at one point and at another point, in an effort to maintain consistency with their preelection behaviour, were forced into giving rewards which could not be defended on economic grounds.  We must all depend on the Government to give leadership at a difficult time.  They are dealing with a difficult issue, that of tax, but so far, by their maladroit handling of the situation, they have contributed significantly to dividing town and country.  If that division does not become a permanent one it will be due more to the maturity of the leaders of the PAYE sector than any action or leadership on the part of the Government. Because of Government decisions the increasing growth of previous years has been wasted, leadership has been squandered.</P>
    <P>The Government now seek a national understanding between unions and employers at a time of rising inflation when their manoeuvrability on the tax front is severely limited.  In the Bill there is evidence that the Government still do not understand the gravity of the situation because they have extended the tax net and brought in new categories.  I do not think the PAYE sector will be satisfied that the Government are serious about coming to grips with their quarrel.  Nobody is seeking the abolition of income tax, and that was made clear, but people are seeking a fair deal all round.  They have not been getting that from the Government who have been partial in their treatment of sections of the community as we know from their action in relation to the wealth tax, the reduction in capital gains tax and the <Col N="1956" /> penalties in the form of the abolition of the food subsidies.  At a time when we are looking for moderation in wage expectations the standard of living of lower income families is attacked by the abolition of food subsidies.  That was deliberate Government policy and they cannot blame external forces for that increase.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has hinted that if the rate of inflation is as high as predicted by some forecasters the policy of phasing out food subsidies may be reviewed but, as far as we know, the policy of continuing to phase out those subsidies will be carried out.  That does not enhance the Government's reputation for fairness in their dealings with various groups.  The discontent over the tax issue has been spontaneous.  It arose as a mass manifestation of discontent. The Government have proved to be insensitive to the issue and it remains open to question whether their lack of understanding on this issue means that they cannot give leadership during the present troubled times.  It is in the interest of the country that we get an agreement on orderly wage negotiations in the coming year.  If the Government want the PAYE sector to accept their concern about their plight they should undertake a greater review of the tax system.</P>
    <P>The Government who are planning to control overtime are forcing employees to seek more overtime even though two-thirds of the pay paid for it will go in extra tax to the State.  Employees must do this because of the increase in the cost of living.  If the failings I have mentioned are not rectified by the Government the winter of industrial discontent will be followed by a summer of a similar character.  None of us wants that.  I do not envy them in their task of attempting to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>There is widespread discontent in the public service.  The Government have attempted to rule the wages system in the public service in a different way from the way the private sector have been allowed to operate under the last national agreement. The Government on all sides face a good deal of trouble and they will be tested in the months ahead.  They inherited <Col N="1957" /> an economy which was improving on all fronts.  Now they have come to the half-way mark in their parliamentary life.  They face a great deal of difficulty, much of which is of their own making. They will be watched very critically in the weeks ahead for the kind of leadership which has been so sadly lacking up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>The interesting thing about the debate taking place at the moment is that it is not about poverty or the lack of money but relates to wealth and the distribution of wealth.  Any debate which concentrates, as this one has done very markedly, on taxes and on the payment of taxes can mean only one thing, that people are working and that they are concerned about what is happening to the money they pay into the central fund for the running of Government.  This is in marked contrast to budgets under previous regimes and is in marked contrast to the evolvement of the country over many years.  It is very heartening for any Minister for Finance to find himself in the position of seeing the aims of the budgets introduced by him having an effect and the people pouring back to work.  We are now in a situation where people are more worried about taxation than about looking for jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manifesto put before the people is seen to be taking effect by the budgets which have been introduced since Fianna Fáil came back into office.  Workers all over the country knew that would happen when they went to the polls. Fianna Fáil recognised that and will continue to do so.  The poor, unfortunately, will always be with us and, conversely, the wealthy will always be with us.  The relativity between wealthy and poor has been harped on in this debate.  A man earning £2,000 a year might consider a man earning £4,000 a year extremely wealthy, while a man earning £4,000 a year might consider a man earning £8,000 a year extremely wealthy.  A man earning £8,000 a year would obviously regard a man earning £16,000 a year to be in a different category altogether.  All those people are worried about the rate of taxation they have to face up to and what is happening to their money.  The <Col N="1958" /> man earning £2,000 a year could in his own way be wealthier than the man earning £16,000 a year.  Our society gives the individual an opportunity of expressing himself and of expanding.  No budget can legislate for that expansion.</P>
    <P>We have evolved a system of house ownership and of house tenure which is perhaps unique in the world.  It gives an opportunity to the man in the very lowest income group to own his own home.  We can contrast the person on a relatively low income with a happy family life running his house and garden in a satisfactory manner with a man on a very big salary working extremely hard, perhaps dissatisfied, very seldom at home and joining the rat race of monetary compensation rather than being able to live his life in conformity with his situation.</P>
    <P>All budgets are an attempt to improve the society in which we live.  The budgets presented by Fianna Fáil have attempted to improve everybody's life.  We cannot improve anything by legislation.  We cannot say to a person that he or she must do this or must do that.  We can suggest to that person that if he or she does such a thing it will improve his or her standard of living.  The Government can give people an opportunity but it is up to them whether or not that opportunity is taken.  We can lead the horse to the water but we cannot make him drink.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have presented two budgets since they came back to power and have created special conditions for people.  Those who have taken advantage of them have improved their way of life.  Fianna Fáil have been spectacular in the conditions they have offered to the farming community.  The larger farmers have grasped this opportunity and have found a place in the economic sun after many decades in the shade.  Fianna Fáil have given this sector an unrivalled opportunity to improve their lot.  This has led to total confusion within the farming ranks in relation to what they want.  The Government in their wisdom have recognised this and have tried to ensure as far as humanly possible that whatever taxation system was devised and implemented was suitable to the progress of that industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> We have had various protests and observations by the farming community. One is justified in saying that they hardly know what they want.  One section want one form of taxation while another want a different form.  We have had various observations in relation to levies, rates, the keeping of books and everything else in relation to what a just form of taxation for that sector would be.  The Government have always consulted every section of the community, not least the farmers.  They may have been unwise to consult them after the budget announcement but, aware as they are of the need for democracy to be seen to act and for every possible chance to be given for the ordinary progress of our society, the Minister for Finance offered to implement a taxation system which might be more acceptable.  The underlying factor must be recognised, that a just contribution must be made by the farming sector to our taxation system.  This was construed as being indicative of weakness.  It was in fact indicative of concern.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the concern of the Government for the progress of the farming industry, on the one hand, and, on the other, ensuring that that industry contributes its just share of taxation have been recognised.  I am sure that responsible farmers will face up to their social obligations and will contribute to our progress in an orderly fashion.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is the unions' legitimate function to improve their members' conditions.  The Minister in his wisdom obviously consults with the trade unions involved and looks on them in the same impartial light as he looks at other sectors of the community when formulating policies in relation to worker taxation and to the contribution of the PAYE sector to our economy.</P>
    <P>In this context it is legitimate to observe that there has been a marked difference between the two PAYE demonstrations which took place recently.  Yesterday's demonstration was not in the same vein as the earlier march.  To an impartial observer it seemed that the more recent demonstration, while reasonably substantial <Col N="1960" /> in number, was not substantial in representation.  Yesterday's march seemed to have a preponderance of unions which were not Irish based.  It is legitimate to ask members of such unions where their allegiance lies.  Does it lie with this country or with the unions which are controlled by outside interests?</P>
    <P>The majority of our trade unions, our farming and management institutions are Irish controlled.  This is something to be proud of.  It is a lamentable situation if a telephone call from another country can bring workers out on the streets to object to our taxation system.  It is regrettable that these skilled men do not have the ability to control their own unions and their own destinies.  It would benefit everybody if the situation were rectified.</P>
    <P>We all know that English interference in Irish affairs has always been disastrous. This type of interference is equally disastrous in relation to industrial relations and attitudes towards budgets which Governments have to implement. This point should not be glossed over.  Many of these trade union leaders have made a mess of the situation in England.  Are they to come and do the same here?  This is something which no Minister for Finance can budget for, but it is something we must recognise.</P>
    <P>I know that many of the people who marched yesterday did not want to but they did so on the instructions of people who do not live on this island.  This should be questioned and should also be a cause for concern.  Is there a sense of responsibility towards the whole community within the trade union movement?  The trade union movement caters for people who earn relatively small incomes and those who earn substantial salaries&mdash;from £2,000 to £16,000 a year.  All are catered for by different sections of the trade union movement.  It is regrettable that certain sections of the trade union movement say that because their managements are making very substantial profits those profits should be immediately dispersed among the members in that business. <Col N="1961" /> There are methods available within budgetary control to make sure that profits are dispersed and used for the benefit of the whole community.  If a business or trade is capable of generating substantial profits I seriously suggest that that should not be a spur to the workers in that industry to look for sectional advantage.  There is a heavy responsibility on the more affluent sections of trade unions to look objectively at this situation in relation to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on certain professional attitudes to work and taxation. I make no apologies for referring to the attitude of certain sections of teachers.  Recently we had children sitting down to do examinations not knowing if they would be corrected.  The excuse put forward was that the pay for these duties was not adequate and that the teachers were taxed at an undue rate. This is in stark contrast to the attitude of that profession a decade or two ago when it was considered an honour to do this type of work.  These payments are over and above the substantial salaries of these teachers and are obviously subject to taxation.  Taxation of this kind gives teachers an opportunity to make a contribution to the community at large.  I would ask the teaching profession to have another look at their attitude in this regard.  This is a profession of the highest standing and it can only remain so as long as teachers recognise their pupils' requirements.  The children cannot fight back.  They do not have a lever to use when teachers refuse to mark examination papers.  I exhort teachers to refrain from that type of action and to look again to their professional standing.</P>
    <P>I say the same about some civil service grades.  The Minister has claims for salary increases of up to 40 per cent. This is totally at variance with the attitude of any budget.  We have the sorry spectacle of people in the same grades earning the same money, but in one Department they are working efficiently and happily, while in another Department they are extremely militant and looking for something which it is not possible to give them.  It is a pity this sectarian difference has evolved and that <Col N="1962" /> this attitude has developed in our society.  The budget that we have put forward has as its underlying theme the opportunity of giving everyone a chance to progress.  It is a pity that certain sections look for things which are totally out of line with what is happening in other areas.  It throws the whole system out of gear and no budget can legislate for that type of attitude.  Certain sections of professional people are undoubtedly making very large sums of money and one questions where those sums are being invested.  Anyone who is in a privileged position has a moral duty to himself and to the country to look to performance in relation to income and expenditure to ensure that he takes note of the needs of society and not just of himself.</P>
    <P>One section of the community has not been mentioned in the budget.  In Irish we call them Duine le Dia, the unfortunates who may be mentally handicapped, geriatric cases or those who have no ability to look after themselves but are dependent on the taxpayer and on the dedicated people who give their lives in the service of such people.  I refer to the religious in institutions who are so conscientious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of taxation naturally is in order but the Deputy is going outside it at times.  These matters should be related to taxation as this is merely a taxation measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making is that the people who provide these services save the taxpayer considerable sums of money.  If people were not prepared to devote their lives to this type of activity, taxpayers would be faced with heavier bills than they are at present. Instead of talking of 30 or 40 per cent we might be talking in terms of 60 or 70 per cent taxation in order to provide this type of service to our people in need.  I suggest, with the Chair's consent, that this is within the realms of taxation and is relevant to the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a complex society and what one person does may have an effect on ten people around him.  If we have a position where a man is prepared to <Col N="1963" /> work for nothing he is saving another man, who may be extremely selfish, from paying heavier taxes.  Recognition is due from the House to such people. Anybody paying tax must look at the services that are being provided for his kith and kin.  We cannot legislate for tax for every human contingency.  Society is dependent on the good qualities of people who are not self-seeking and are prepared to sacrifice themselves in the service of the community.  There are many people with no other thought in mind but what they can get out of the system.  During the debate we have heard of nothing but the cutting up of the cake.  We hear people saying they want something else and something extra. Very seldom do we hear of the person who is prepared to give his life without complaining in the service of the community. That is relevant to taxation and budgetary presentation.</P>
    <P>Very few comments were made about the Minister for Health's scheme.  That is rightly so.  It is so successful that no criticism can be justified.  In relation to the provision of money, the Minister's scheme has meant that very often there has been a real lift in income to those on the lower income levels.  If a man is on a salary scale where he is paying a relatively small amount of income tax and is able to benefit from the scheme it puts him on the same income level as a man on a higher income level who would have to pay for these services out of his salary.  This attitude towards taxation is a human one which we can be proud of and which elevates people in different ways.  These are all relevant points in a discussion on taxation.</P>
    <P>We are a caring Government.  That is seen in the various presentations of the budgets and in their operation.  There is no doubt that this will continue to be so. In the presentation of this budget we must take account of our entry into the EMS.  The immediate and dramatic effect of our entry was the repatriation of external assets and a very substantial inflow of currency.  It meant a dramatic turnaround in the availability of funds to building societies and enabled Irish money to come back home and be used <Col N="1964" /> for the benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>Future budgets can take account of the fact that money will now tend to stay at home and local investment will undoubtedly take precedence over investment abroad.  It will help to contain inflation and give an opportunity for investment in local business.  It will help to stabilise our economy in general and make us more self-reliant.  The variations in the value of our currency abroad will be of less effect when these things come into being.  There is no doubt that there are many areas for profitable investment of funds at home.  This, taken into consideration with the attitude towards trade unions, farmers, money and our social attitudes, adds up to what we hope will be a national understanding that will give an opportunity to all to participate in the progress of the country.  Without these complexities coming together in an orderly fashion there can be no progress.  When one section of the community gets out of line with another it leads to an imbalance.  It is like a car running with one wheel flat and three wheels pumped up.</P>
    <P>We have the ability to create conditions for smooth running and this is taking place at present except for people who look to their own selfish interests. The response necessary in order to enable this budget to be successful must get away from self-interest and get back to a sense of dedication to the progress of the country.  Consumer interests, living wages and proper taxation are all things which any budget must take note of.  This budget undoubtedly does that in every degree and its implementation will mean the improvement of our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to ask a question which, following Deputy Fox, I think is very appropriate&mdash;are we a nation or a state?  Are we living in the island of Ireland or in a separate nation from the northern state?  Deputy Fox, for example, spoke about &ldquo;the affairs of this nation&rdquo;, &ldquo;this little country of ours&rdquo;, &ldquo;our country&rdquo;, &ldquo;this country&rdquo;.  He spoke of our entry to the EMS.  We have the Government talking about a national understanding. Is it a national understanding or do the Fianna Fáil Party understand what &ldquo;national&rdquo; means?  I, as a <Col N="1965" /> northerner, am sitting here totally confused. I have often heard that people north of the Border had a crisis of identification not knowing if they were Irish or British; I do not know if I am part of the Irish nation or what I am part of, listening to Fianna Fáil speakers.  I am satisfied they do not know.  My clear understanding is that I am Irish and that this island consists of 32 counties.  We listened to Deputy Fox and Deputy Moore earlier using such terms as &ldquo;this nation&rdquo;, &ldquo;this country&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Irish people&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Irish economy&rdquo; and &ldquo;this little island of ours&rdquo;.  Then we hear the Government talking about a national understanding. In what direction are we going?  The taxation system of any country is the basis of an economy and the economy is so interwoven with its politics that it is impossible to separate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Fianna Fáil title of &ldquo;national understanding&rdquo; indicates that they do not understand what &ldquo;national&rdquo; is about and that this narrow definition of the word exposes the pseudo-republicanism that party pretends to possess.  There is no point in their saying that these are merely loose terms. Paisley uses a loose term when he says he is proud to be an Ulster man and excludes Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan. He knows what he means.  The sooner the House and a Government party mandated to lead this country in the right direction economically and politically, understand this the better, so that the societies in the island of Ireland will learn to live with each other.  There is no use in running away from the politics of this just because there is an economic advantage.  That is the role of a coward.  Our contribution to the development of the Irish nation in the fullest and broadest sense can never get off the ground if we talk as Deputy Fox did about &ldquo;our country&rdquo;, &ldquo;this country&rdquo;, &ldquo;this little country of ours&rdquo; and so on and so long as other Fianna Fáil Deputies follow that line of thought and so long as the Government in their attempt to come to terms with their taxation troubles and the unrest in the country produce a white or a green or any colour paper called &ldquo;national understanding&rdquo;. It is not national understanding. <Col N="1966" /> The nation covers the 32 counties, the entire island of Ireland and the Irish people and this is the nation of Ireland.  The Government should make up their mind in what direction they are going.  Is it one of two states in Ireland or is this the nation?  I have my mind made up.  It is totally inconsistent and downright bloody dishonest and the height of hypocrisy to talk about nationalism in one sense and using the term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the Chair is disputing about is that this is a taxation debate and nothing else.  The Deputy is getting into a political debate as to how we should address the House, whether we call this &ldquo;our country&rdquo; or not.  A Deputy from any part of the House may speak about &ldquo;our country&rdquo;; what he means or does not mean is his own business.  That has always been accepted. I ask the Deputy to get on to the Bill before the House.  I do not want to interrupt him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is quite entitled to draw attention to the fact that he thinks I am out of order, but I believe that I am very much to the point because trading, taxation, economics <Col N="1967" /> and policy are so interrelated that there is no way in which one can separate them in this small island and be logical. For example, take the matter of breaking with sterling, a matter that was rushed through the House.  I believe that, whatever the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development knew about it&mdash;and I have grave doubts about their degree of understanding of it&mdash;no other member of Fianna Fáil fully understood what it was about.  We had the brilliance of Deputy FitzGerald and the information he could give to Deputy Barry and whatever information the Labour Party could extract from the media, from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and this House took a decision which affected everybody living in the State.  It took a deliberate decision which affected the value of the pound in one's pocket.  Is this not taxation, foreign trading, economics and policy, or would the Chair explain why I am not in order? That one mistake will cost not alone individuals huge amounts of money, but also every small business trading with Britain or Northern Ireland, importers and exporters, will be paying less income tax to the Government because their profits will be cut due to the fact that the amount of money they need to pay more for imports will be greater and the value of their exports will be less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals with corporation profits tax, income tax and every other type of tax.  In our trading with Britain last year we imported £1,830 million worth of goods and we exported £1,395 million of goods and in the first week of the break with sterling that cost the Republic of Ireland £90 million.  Because of that decision, firms paying income tax or corporation profits tax will have less profit.  I am in order in saying that the break with sterling has caused economic convulsions that counties here are not yet aware of.  When I cross the Border or when anyone else crosses the Border and wishes to buy simple little things such as a box of matches and puts down a punt on the counter, the shopkeeper must make up his mind if he will charge 6p for the punt and then 2p for the box of matches or if he will accept the punt at its full value and give 98p change.  An ordinary cross-Border visitor who wishes to buy an ice-cream for his child and leaves down an Irish punt may be charged for the punt as well as the ice-cream.  When I gave an example some Deputies on the other side said that I was too emotional about this. I was exposing, as I call it, the pseudorepublicianism, this green nationalism that no other group of people outside of the soldiers of destiny possess or have the right to possess.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make, one that the Chair has difficulty in following, is this: trading and economics, taxation and politics are so interwoven that one influences the other.  If we cannot see that clearly ourselves let us look at some other country that is far removed from us, a non-aligned country such as Yugoslavia.  That country puts forward the argument that unless the West buy goods from them and unless they buy from the West, if they are compelled to do their trading with the East they cease to be non-aligned.  That picture is clearly seen by everyone who listens to the argument from this distance. I am trying to relate that thinking to the natural trading between this part of the country, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  I am saying that if we start to interfere with the economics of the matter without considering the politics we are not fully committed to the mandate which the people of this State have given us not alone to have proper taxation but to build a society that is fair, reasonable and open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair will see my difficulty in trying to bring the Chair along my way of thinking.  If we do anything that makes it more difficult for industries, traders and manufacturers to deal with our fellowcountrymen north of the Border, not alone are we destroying the politics but we are charging that manufacturer, trader or commercial business with extra <Col N="1973" /> taxation.  This point is relevant.  Fundamentally, it is the most important issue in the debate.  If it is not relevant to talk in a Finance Bill about the pound note in one's pocket, will the Chair tell me the meaning of &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;?  I am talking about £1, one punt, which is no longer worth 100p in the Six Counties of Ireland.  That must be relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is embarrassing but I will come back to it.  For the sake of 30 pieces of silver the Government have lost interest in the politics of a quarter of the Irish people and for that they do not deserve my respect or the respect of those who put them there.  I will go on to taxation.  We have had 150,000 people marching in the streets of this city and in the country about taxation. Is it relevant to say that in another part of Ireland people have marched for different reasons but they were not listened to?  I will repeat what Deputy O'Leary said: piecemeal attempts, like saying &ldquo;We will give you an increased personal allowance&rdquo;, will not chase away the threat of street politics.  The first civil rights march in Northern Ireland was well conducted.  It brought on the streets professional people, self-employed people, traders, as did the anti-PAYE march in the streets of Dublin a couple of months ago.  They did not march for the sake of marching but because they had grievances.  If we do not learn from the mistakes of Northern Ireland, unless there are radical changes in the taxation system in this part of Ireland those people will come out to march again and the next march might be as orderly as yesterday's or the one a month ago and the following ones might be as orderly but, mark my words, when people start street politics there cannot be orderly walks all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the point.  Why have people all of a sudden changed? Why are they publicly demonstrating?  Why have they changed in the short period since this Government came into office?  Is it not because the floodgates were opened psychologically by the infamous Fianna Fáil Manifesto of 1977 which stated that there were no problems, that there was no need for Deputy Cosgrave's Government to have hairshirt budgets?  Fianna Fáil had all the <Col N="1979" /> answers.  They would provide the jobs and give cuts in taxation.  They would do away with farmer taxation.  They would do away with every other form of severe tax that the Coalition Government imposed.</P>
    <P>Any fair-minded person asked to write an account of the politics of the 1970s would record that the year 1974, internationally referred to as the year of inflation, caused economic crisis not alone here but in every part of the world, and particularly in western Europe.  It was not of our doing; it was not of Fianna Fáil's doing.  But that party are not terribly interested in the economics, the politics, the trading or the relationship between North and South.  Their deep concern was to get back into office&mdash;as Deputy James Dillon used to say, to get close to the loot.  That has been the experience in the two years since Fianna Fáil came into office.  There was no unrest prior to 1977.  There were no protests in the streets.  There may have been people looking for jobs, but they are still looking for jobs.  The only jobs that have been created that I know of are in the public service.  Any Minister for the Public Service could open the floodgates and employ 100,000 more people in the public service.  What of these other jobs that were to be created?</P>
    <P>It could be argued and argued successfully that our pound has held strength with most of the currencies in Europe.  But psychologically the break with sterling not alone affects the politics and the economics of this country but also its whole well-being.  There is now a currency curtain between North and South which every day of the week people on both sides of the Border experience. A farmer who sells his cattle may be getting a few shillings more, but he is reminded that the pound in the North is worth more than his.  The shirt manufacturers who manufacture shirts and send them to Northern Ireland or Britain will not benefit to that extent. They will be told that an agreement was entered into and that they will be paid what it says in the agreement, but when they go to buy the materials to make those shirts they will cost more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> Deputy Fox said that the Fianna Fáil Government were a concerned Government. I wonder how concerned they are when the few leaves of misunderstanding are pulled off and one tries to get down to the nitty gritty.  Last week a constituent of mine, a small farmer, came to me.  He told me that his unemployment assistance was reduced by £10 per week. I would imagine he did not vote for the Government the last time because I know his politics.  I wonder how caring a Government they can be when they allow situations such as this to exist? Take for example this small farmer who lives on a small holding, the PLV of which is £3.50.  His rates would have been £42 last year.  The new Government's manifesto said that they would do away with rates but he had already got 25 per cent off, so he had been paying £32.50.  He drives an old secondhand car with £50 taxation.  That has gone as well under the Fianna Fáil Manifesto. Any person who was not committed to politics, as this man was, would have been tempted to vote for Fianna Fáil because no tax on motorcars and no rates on houses would mean a saving of approximately £72.  But now, because this man's unemployment assistance has been reduced, it is going to cost him £500 a year.</P>

      <P>I am merely saying that Deputy Fox talked about a caring Government, a Government who would watch over all the needs and cares of the people of this State.  That sounds nice. Most people would say that is right, that all the Ministers in the Cabinet are decent, honest-to-goodness people.  They would not&mdash;and I say this most sincerely&mdash;maliciously attempt to harm anyone.  I am not suggesting that they would.  I am merely saying that the Cabinet have lost direction, that the Taoiseach appears no longer to want to lead, that the Government are adrift and so far away from reality that we have decent Deputies like Deputy Fox saying, and believing he is right, that his Government are a caring Government.</P>
      <P>Let me say that when Deputy Fox was speaking he was speaking with a balanced fairness that I could not take exception to.  However, in case there are other people who might say that Deputy Fox is right, I am merely pointing out that I do not think the Government are a caring Government after all.  That is why people are marching in the streets.  That is why farmers are objecting to the taxation being put on them.  This Government, who Deputy Fox says are so caring, have given presents of millions of pounds to the wealthy here.  Yet the ordinary person who pays tax under the PAYE system and who until now paid his motor tax and his rates and may have been persuaded or tempted by the Fianna Fáil Manifesto in the last election to change allegience, all of a sudden discovers now that by the taxation method the Minister for Social Welfare has introduced he stands to lose £500 a year.  That is not very caring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody could accuse the Coalition Government of not doing their best in the years between 1973 and 1977.  I do not believe that anybody could dispute the great effect which the oil crisis of 1974 had on everything we <Col N="1982" /> do, on the electricity we burn, the transport we use, the clothes we wear which are manufactured from man-made fibres.  It was the effect of the oil crisis which caused the difficulties of the inflation period between 1974 and 1977. When the Government were in Opposition they had no sympathy for the Coalition Government.  The only thing they thought of then was getting back into power.  The young Deputy from Kildare is a backbencher of the Fianna Fáil Party and is one of the 84 cogs in the Fianna Fáil Party machine.  He will soon realise that there are people closer to the loot than he is who do not have to stand for election, who parade the corridors of power.  Politics is not about how many seats a Government get and whether that Government get into power with a few extra TDs.  This all boils down to the system of taxation where the wealthy can be excused large payments while the young man with 12 children, one of whom is being educated as a priest, has his dole cut by £10 a week because the Minister for Social Welfare says that his standard of living is too high.</P>
    <P>Some day Deputy McCreevy will understand what I am talking about.  I heard more senior Members than I making the same points in the House 15 years ago.  One of the weaknesses of the system we operate, which is called democratic but should be more properly called political, is that the democracy which backbench Government Deputies in this Dáil talk about does not exist. They are part of the political system.  If the Minister for Finance pushes a Bill like the one before the House at the moment he pays very little attention to the claims of his backbench Deputies. Courtesy demands that he listen to them but the tacateers, the people who push buttons and throw switches, who can stop the economic growth or accelerate it will be listened to.  They are the faceless men whom nobody knows. They do not have to stand for election or face defeat.  They do not have to be elected but they are always around.  I believe they were around when the Fianna Fáil Party were in Opposition and they felt the draught because they were not close to the loot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Finance Bill should represent one of the most important documents laid before the House because it sets forth any changes the Government make in the taxation system.  While the budget debate gives us an opportunity to discuss general Government policy, the creation of jobs and so on, the Finance Bill is better dealt with on Committee Stage and on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>People are concerned about the level of taxation they are paying.  Therefore this year's Finance Bill is more relevant and controversial than ever before. While it is fair game for Opposition speakers to make political points against the Government, each speaker so far has referred to the radical changes in taxation which are needed to prevent people from taking to the streets.  As the last speaker said, the danger of street politics is all around us if changes in our taxation system are not made.</P>
      <P>If people want to pay less tax they must accept fewer services.  There is no point in any politician promising that people will pay less taxation and later saying that there will be increases in social welfare, better health services, better roads and so on.  As politicians we may have failed the people by giving them the impression that they can have these services free.  We should tell them the truth.  They get nothing free. Anything provided by the State is paid for by taxation.  For short-term periods the Government may finance their budget deficit by borrowing from abroad or internally.  All that money must be repaid.  The only way this can be done is by taxation.  Whether this taxation comes from companies, individuals or some other way, ultimately it will be paid by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future general elections will be fought on the basis of what &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; the people will get.  I am very concerned about this.  If people think that by putting out one Government and putting in another they will be better off overnight, they are on the wrong track.  If we encourage people to think like that we cannot expect them to do anything but rebel when we put harder options before them. For as long as I am in politics my message <Col N="1986" /> to the people I represent will be that services provided by the State are paid for by taxation.</P>
    <P>It galls me to hear the Opposition speaking about changes being made in the PAYE taxation system and saying that people are paying too much taxation when they had four years to do something about it.  A few figures at this stage would be relevant.  While people can prove anything by juggling figures, there are certain figures which are indisputable. When the last Government came to power for the tax year 1974-75 the married allowance was £800; in their last year, 1977-78 it was increased to £1,100, a 37½ per cent increase.  The cost of living in that period doubled.  These people talk about indexation of allowances but that was the time to do something about it.  If allowances had been indexed to the cost of living, the tax-free allowance in 1977-78 would have been greater than £1,100.  As a result of this budget the 1978-79 tax-free allowance for a married person has been increased to £2,230.  In the 18 months since we took office the cost of living has fallen.  While people may dispute that inflation was reduced because of world markets or because of Fianna Fáil policies, no one can dispute that while we have been in office inflation is lower that it was when the last Government were in power.  While the Coalition were in power they increased the tax-free allowance by only 37½ per cent and so far we have increased it by 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the tax year 1976-77 the average industrial worker paid 16.6 per cent of his income in taxation.  As a result of this budget the average industrial worker will pay 12.6 per cent of his income in taxation. That is an improvement in the level of taxation for these workers.  If this is true one might ask why the people are taking to the streets because of taxation. Apart from any specific matter which may have caused their anger and brought them to the streets, we as politicians, have to face certain facts.  In my opinion, the people are marching because they want more personal disposable income&mdash;to spend more in the public house on Saturday night, or at the races and so on.  They do not feel they <Col N="1987" /> are getting value for the money which is being taken out of their pay packets every Friday night.  I am sure that if PAYE taxpayers saw their money going to feed an old age pensioner or to a deserted wife or people in need, they would say their money was well spent; but, unfortunately, people see an evergrowing amount of money taken from their pay packet and going into the Exchequer coffers.  They do not feel they are getting a proper return.</P>
    <P>A lot of people feel that the civil service is grossly over-staffed and these people have to be paid for out of taxpayers' money.  The taxpayer does not think he is getting the best return there as services are getting worse.  The PAYE taxpayer feels that he is paying more than his fair share of tax.  I suppose we all feel at one stage or another, whether in politics or business, that we are paying more than the person beside us or that we are getting a hard deal from the Opposition or the press and the others are getting it easier.  That is a normal reaction.</P>
    <P>PAYE taxpayers are saying that they are paying more than the self-employed and farmers.  I have heard people say that the PAYE system is not working. Unfortunately for the people on the system, it is working too well because they are the only people it is easy to collect tax from.  They have no way of avoiding paying tax because it is collected at source.  They never get the money into their hands to do anything with it.  It is paid over by employers at the end of the month.  For the self-employed and for companies the method of calculating their income is not as exact and the same set of rules do not apply.  Unfortunately, what people and trade unionists are saying when they say that the self-employed are not paying their fair share is that if they had the same opportunity they would try to fiddle their tax as well.  We must ask ourselves why people think like that. People think that the self-employed, who have the opportunity of calculating their own income in a different way, abuse that calculation and fiddle as much as <Col N="1988" /> they can.  That is a symptom of our society.</P>
    <P>There may be ten out of 100 people who abuse the social welfare system but they give the whole system a bad name. People are inclined to say &ldquo;Look at the abuses in the social welfare system. There is John X who has a job and is drawing unemployment assistance&rdquo;. They forget about the 90 people who are genuinely unemployed and are not abusing the system.  The same applies to taxation. It is the 10 per cent of self-employed people who do not pay their fair share of taxation who give a bad name to all the self-employed.  I do not say that 10 per cent is an exact figure.</P>
    <P>The self-employed have a lot of problems.  They do not have the same regularity of income as people on the PAYE system have.  Their tax is computed by a different system, but by and large the self-employed person, who is the bane of the PAYE taxpayer, is paying the correct amount of tax.  I would not be so innocent, as an accountant, to say that some people who are self-employed do not evade tax.  However, the number is grossly exaggerated.  It is impossible for a self-employed person who might evade tax by off-setting his receipts to accumulate a large amount of money because the tax inspectors are very much on the ball and if a person has shown his income as being only £5,000 and then turns up with £40,000, £50,000 or £100,000 out of nowhere, he is hammered on that.  He has to pay not only the tax he should have paid on it but interest and penalties as well.  To accumulate large sums of money when one is self-employed is simply not on.  The abuse of the taxation system is not as great as is imagined.</P>
    <P>The figure given for taxation paid by those on PAYE is in the region of 85 per cent and the self-employed usually contribute only a very small amount. Included in that figure are directors of all types of small private firms.  In theory, if all self-employed people formed themselves into limited companies, the companies would pay corporation tax and the money taken out by directors would be taxed under PAYE directors' tax.  No taxation at all would be collected from the self-employed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> The figure of 85 per cent grossly distorts the amount contributed by the self-employed because included in it are large amounts of money collected by directors of private family-owned companies. When people speak of self-employed people they usually mean those who run their own companies. Such people also pay PAYE and are included in the figure, but that is a point which is always forgotten.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to speak about the Finance Bill without referring to the national understanding.  Since the budget and the national understanding there has been a greater crack down on people who do not pay tax, namely, the self-employed. I read recently that the Revenue Commissioners are considering publishing the individual returns of groups of people.  I do not mean that they will publish any individual's tax but rather the income of certain people in society&mdash;for example, doctors, solicitors and accountants.  By doing this they hope to encourage people, who see Mr. X, a doctor down the road, with an average return for income of say, £10,000, who has a very high standard of living and goes on a continental holiday twice or three times a year, to report this to the Revenue Commissioners and that this will help the Revenue Commissioners in catching up with tax evasion. What I have seen and heard from the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners is to the effect that this should help and that the ordinary person who pays his correct tax has nothing to fear but that the person who is evading tax should worry about it.  Consequently, there is nothing for the man who is not breaking the law to worry about.  In the past few months also there have been reports in the papers about tax spies and people giving information to catch out their fellows.  I am totally opposed to such an idea.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the publication of returns of groups of people is the way we should approach the tax evasion problem.  We do not allow people to drive while drunk because the police are not able to catch them.  We make laws more stringent and get more police and hope they will be able to catch them.  I <Col N="1990" /> am not prepared to advocate a system by which everybody will be a tax official and be writing letters to the inspector of taxes saying that Mr. X. or Mrs. Y have bought new coats or cars.  That is not the way an economy should make progress. It is part of what I call the politics of envy.  Whether it is the farmer who is getting better off or our neigbour we should encourage people to become better off and not try to knock them.  It may even make the burden of the Revenue Commissioners more difficult.  If we want to catch people who are evading tax I suggest that we should have more tax inspectors, but I would not advocate a system of people rushing in every day to the local inspector, in effect spying on their neighbours.  Whether this is oldfashioned or not, the whole idea is abhorrent to me and I do not agree with it.</P>
    <P>There are many points in the Bill which perhaps can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I welcome particularly section 6 which gives allowances for expenditure on residential premises.  I understand the idea is that the householder who does some improvements to his house such as installing insulation will get tax relief on the labour element in that expenditure.  That is a worthwhile scheme with the relief extending to the excess over £50 subject to a maximum of £450.  While I commend the idea in reading through the section I doubt very much if the scheme will get the support it deserves.  A person who wishes to claim for this expenditure must first apply to the inspector of taxes on the prescribed form.  Section 6 and the Second Schedule must be taken together as the Schedule sets up the system and procedure.  I feel that while this is a good idea it will become bogged down in massive bureaucracy.  In the Second Schedule we have almost five pages setting out various ways to prevent the system being abused.  I sympathise with the Revenue Commissioners in trying to device a system that will not be abused but I think the complicated bureaucracy involved may render this worthwile idea inoperable.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> Where an individual wishes to claim a deduction under section 6 in respect of the labour cost of qualifying work carried out or to be carried out by a registered person, he shall&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  make an application on the prescribed form to the Revenue Commissioners for a form on which to claim the deduction (in this paragraph referred to as &ldquo;a claim form&rdquo;) bearing the name of the registered person, and</P>
    <P>(b)  complete the claim form (which shall be issued to him by the Revenue Commissioners if they are satisfied that the form ought to be issued to the said individual), </P>
    <P>This is an application on a prescribed form to the Revenue Commissioners to get a form on which one can make a claim.  It is not the claim form.  There are about three pages dealing with the claim form.  The Revenue Commissioners may not even issue the claim form: they will not issue it unless they are satisfied that a form ought to be issued.  Nowhere in the section or the schedule can I find how they will decide whether it should be issued or not.  I should like to know why it should not be issued.  According to my reading of the section a person who wants to get his improvements done and make a claim must first get a prescribed form from the Revenue Commissioners. He then makes applications for what I shall call the claim form on which to make the claim.  That form will not be issued unless they are satisfied it ought to be issued.  This is before he begins to get down to his claim.</P>
    <P>When he gets the form he has to do a lot of things set out on pages 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36.  Presumably most of this expenditure on residential premises will be carried out by ordinary people on PAYE who wish to improve their houses.  Since it is subject to a maximum of £450 it will not be a very big job.  They must contend with this bureaucracy before they get started.  The allowance will not be paid at all unless the work is done by a registered contractor.  I have a good deal of experience of contractors dealing with taxation problems.  These registered contractors, <Col N="1992" /> as far as I can ascertain, are not the same people as contractors to whom a sub-contractor's certificate of authorisation is issued.  There is very involved legislation in relation to sub-contractors. Under section 6 of the Second Schedule, we are now creating a new form of contractor, a registered contractor, to whom people will be able to go to have a house repaired and they would possibly qualify for tax relief. There will be so many types of contractors and so many different certificates that builders and other people will be totally confused.</P>
    <P>In order for a person to become a registered contractor he must go through an elaborate process.  The procedures are listed out in a number of pages and the penalties if he does not fulfill all his obligations are also listed.  Paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule sets out in very simple terms how a person can become a registered contractor.  Paragraph 5 (1) says:</P>
    <P>5.  (1)  The Revenue Commissioners shall on application to them in that behalf on the prescribed form by a person issue to the person a certificate (referred to in section 7 and in this Schedule as &ldquo;a certificate of registration&rdquo;) if they are satisfied that the person or, in the case of a partnership each partner, is resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 (2) states that the Revenue Commissioners will keep a record of these people and that a list of them will be displayed at each office of the National Manpower Service and also in the offices of the Inspector of Taxes.  According to paragraph 5, the Revenue Commissioners will issue to each person who applies to them a certificate of registration provided he is resident in the State.  It seems quite simple, yet there are three pages showing how this person can get the certificate, why it will be taken from him and various other things.  If it is so simple to obtain a certificate why are all these paragraphs necessary? Paragraph 7 relates to the reason for the cancellation of a certificate.  What is the reason for paragraph 7 (a), which says:</P>
    <P>(a)  a certificate of registration was</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> issued on the basis of false or misleading information,</P>
    <P>Surely it is not an elaborate process to discover if a person is or is not resident in the State.  Paragraph 7 (b) says:</P>
    <P>(b)  a certificate of registration would not have been issued if information of which they became aware subsequent to its issue had been available to them at the date of its issue,</P>
    <P>What information is referred to here? What information could the Revenue Commissioners become aware of?  The only qualification is that a person must be resident in the State.  Paragraph 7 (c) says:</P>
    <P>(c)  a person, to whom a certificate of registration was issued has permitted it to be misused, </P>
    <P>I cannot see how these certificates could be misused; there would be no reason for misusing them.  They are not the same as subcontractors certificates, because anyone can get these certificates if he resides in the State.  However I am prepared to concede paragraph (c). Paragraph 8 also refers to false or misleading information and so on.  This goes on for pages.  The kind of contractor who would take on small jobs will not go to the Revenue Commissioners for a certificate of registration.  People in the subcontracting business who have been hassled about subcontractors certificates and who have been unable to obtain sub-contractors certificates will not go through the same procedures to secure a registered contractor's certificate.  These certificates are not needed by people who work on small house extensions and improvements because they are dealing with people who will pay them straight off.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, this section was put in to get tax evaders into the tax net. The idea behind this will fail because the ordinary individual will not go to the bother of getting a registered contractor's certificate.  The big contractors will not do this type of work which will only be done by the small contractor.  At the end of the year we will find out that the amount of money saved by the taxpayer <Col N="1994" /> through the section will be negligible because people will not go through all these procedures relating to the issue of certificates of registration.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage will the Minister cut out this paraphernalia in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 and leave in only paragraph 5 setting out how they will be issued?  The Revenue Commissioners are trying to guarantee against the failure which they had when they issued subcontractors certificates in 1970, when so many were issued and the system was so widely abused.  It is now almost impossible to get a subcontractors licence because the legislation is so tight.  The Revenue Commissioners are trying to do the same thing here to guarantee against failure.  If the section is to work the Minister must cut out a lot of these thinks about how a subcontractor gets a certificate of registration.</P>
    <P>In this Finance Bill there is no provision about legislation regarding sub-contractor's certificates of authorisation.  The certificates were introduced in 1970 and the idea was to prevent the &ldquo;lump&rdquo; system on building sites.  Until that time very few people who worked for builders paid any tax.  A few building companies operated PAYE but most of the people were &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and were classified as self-employed.  They worked in groups and moved from job to job. The Revenue Commissioners never caught up with them and, consequently, the people concerned never paid tax. Following legislation enacted in Britain, in the 1970 Finance Bill the Revenue Commissioners were authorised to bring in certificates.  It was easy to get the certificates in 1970.  All a contractor had to do was to promise to submit his accounts at the end of his first year of trading and he got the certificate.  I do not think the figures were published but in the case of the 7,000 certificates issued in the Dublin area only 20 per cent sent in their accounts.  The system was so widely abused that it became a joke.  In 1973 the Revenue Commissioners withdrew about half the certificates in the Dublin area and various Finance Acts tightened the legislation making it difficult to get a certificate of <Col N="1995" /> authorisation and also making it difficult to abuse the system.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the inspectors of taxes.  Because there was such abuse of the system I accept that there was a need to tighten up the legislation.  I do not blame the Revenue Commissioners for withdrawing the certificates but we have now reached the stage where we have gone to the other extreme.  The Revenue Commissioners now have a practically foolproof system regarding the certificates. Any person who has a sub-contractor's certificate can get jobs from builders and local authorities because the person paying him does not have to worry about the tax.  If a person has not got such a certificate and does a job for a builder or a local authority, the principal contractor is obliged to deduct tax at 35 per cent before he pays him.  Some people are prepared to work that system but the majority of larger builders and employers prefer if a person has the certificate. The Revenue Commissioners are quite severe on the principal contractor and if he pays without deducting the tax he has to pay tax on the sub-contractor's behalf.</P>
    <P>Since 1976 a better system has been in operation.  Now a principal contractor has to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a construction payments card and if the Revenue Commissioners change their minds they can refuse to issue the certificate.  The principal contractor is not allowed to pay the sub-contractor until he gets the construction payments card.  The Revenue Commissioners have an exact record of the whereabouts of each sub-contractor. After 5 April the principal contractors who are issued construction payments cards are obliged to return them to the inspectors of taxes.  It is practically a foolproof system and I wish to commend the inspectors of taxes on their foresight.</P>
    <P>The system is working well but it is almost impossible to get a sub-contractor's certificate of authorisation. The Minister may tell me that if a person has an established place of business, if he has a satisfactory tax record and if the Revenue Commissioners are <Col N="1996" /> satisfied that he will comply with the rules they will issue him with a certificate. Unfortunately the position is that it is a difficult job for even the most genuine person applying for such a certificate to get it.  Perhaps it is because of the bad experience of the Revenue Commissioners but they make it nearly impossible for a person to get a sub-contractor's certificate.  Anyone with such a certificate knows that he must comply with the rules because the certificate is of considerable value to him in that he will get work that would not be given to him otherwise.  The certificates are like pieces of gold.  Even if there was abuse it would be for only one year because after 5 April the Revenue Commissioners can take it from a person.</P>
    <P>The issuing of these certificates and the rules made have meant that many jobs that could be created are not being created.  I know many sub-contractors who are willing to keep books properly but they are not able to get the certificate. It is all very well for the inspector of taxes to say that if a person has not got the sub-contractor's certificate he can get the tax stopped and that he can come each month to get back his money.  It is not possible to pay wages and to pay for materials throughout the month when one gets only 65 per cent of the money that one should get.  It is not possible to do this in any medium or large business.</P>
    <P>I put to the Minister that at least 5,000 new jobs would be created in the private sector overnight if inspectors of taxes had a more relaxed way of issuing certificates, if they did not turn down applications straight off.  The system used is keeping down the numbers who could otherwise be employed.  The Minister should bring to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners that they should ask inspectors of taxes to have regard to the job-creative potential of issuing certificates quickly.</P>
    <P>There are sections in the Bill relating to the taxation of farming profits.  The main change in this regard is in the lowering of the liability threshold from £60 to £50 and increasing the multiplier from 90 to 125.  All this has been overshadowed by the announcement on <Col N="1997" /> Tuesday that from 1980-81 there will be a new taxation system for farmers.  Since 1974 the taxation of farming profits has been a recurring budgetary problem, and I admire the previous Government for tackling farming profits.  Sooner or later some administration had to set about doing it.</P>
    <P>Talking about farmer taxation, the majority of people living in Dublin have the impression that Irish farmers drive around in large cars, have big houses and make plenty of money.  That impression has been created by the sight of a few farmers coming to Dublin for big matches, but unfortunately the majority of them, 90 per cent, do not drive around in big cars and do not enjoy a high standard of living.  Many farmers would like to have the incomes city people think they have.  People have misconceptions about farm profits.</P>
    <P>Until 1972 there was no reason to tax farm profits: although technically they were liable for tax since 1969, the tax had never been collected.  It is only in the last ten years that farming has developed properly.  People are inclined to think of the £900 million farmers have got since we joined the EEC and of the big prices they get for cattle and other agricultural produce.  However, if a person had £10 a week and he got a 100 per cent increase in his wages, he would still have only £20 a week.  The base from which farmers started was very low.  Farmers' profits have increased rapidly in percentage terms, but if recent studies are anything to go by, it is only now that average industrial wages and average farm incomes have become about the same, though perhaps farmers are still a little behind.  We should remember that before we go off half-cocked talking about the millions farmers are making.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is not fair for the farming organisations to be all the time saying the opposite, that farmers are not making money, and crying and whinging no matter what kind of increase they get.  Up to seven or eight years ago farmers were not enjoying a reasonable living.  My people are farmers and, although I am not a farmer, I live in a farming area and I understand about work on a farm.  I know that farmers do <Col N="1998" /> not like union leaders and people in cities week after week giving out about taxing farmers who, they say, are making millions, and treating them as public enemy No. 1.  On the other hand, they do not particularly care for leaders of their own organisations saying they are not doing well enough.  The ordinary farmer is a very balanced and fair-minded person.  If he makes money he works hard for it. We have had a hard winter.  There is no great joy in getting up at 5.30 in the morning with snow on the ground and going out to milk 30 or 40 cows or going out to feed cattle through the snow.  Of course there are some substantial farmers with a large labour force, but they represent not more than 5 per cent of the total farming community.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised that the amount of tax collected from farmers is not in proportion to the tax collected from other sectors.  Last year the income tax collected from farmers with valuations of more that £20 amounted to about 5 per cent of farmers' incomes, and the percentage collected from other sectors of the community was 17.  A Government could not allow such a situation to continue.  If a farmer makes a profit he should pay income tax, but if he does not he should not pay income tax.</P>

      <P>The only fair system is to tax farmers on accounts.  I say that 90 per cent of Irish farmers are prepared to accept that system.  All people should be on the same tax system.  Otherwise we will have continuing trouble.</P>

      <P>If farmers are not taxed on the same basis as everybody else the finger will always be pointed at them. Nobody will deny that tax at 50 per cent is a disincentive, whether it be the TD, the industrial worker or the farmer who pays it.  If we are all paying tax on the same basis then we all have the same crib and we cannot say that another section of the community are not paying their fair share.  I have always advocated that farmers should pay tax on accounts. <Col N="1999" /> The recent proposals of last Tuesday go some way towards that.  In principle I do not object to the lowering of the threshold to nil because then we will be operating on the principle that if a person is making a profit he pays tax.  It was proposed to drop the threshold to £40 in the year 1981.  There are farmers with valuations well below £40 making a lot more money than farmers with valuation in excess of £40.  Therefore, I am in favour of dropping this system altogether.  On previous occasions I have said that it would not be worth the trouble of collecting such a small amount of money.  I have no objection in principle to the lowering of the taxation threshold regarding farmers' profits down to £20 or even less but because of the administrative costs involved in collecting a relatively small sum of money I am in favour of doing away with the national system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notional system is very attractive to farmers who are in intensive production of some sort.  They are usually the most hardworking people who are more often not involved in farmer politics. When the discussions were going on between the farming organisations and the Government, the farming organisations came up with the idea that if before 1 May they could agree on another system of taxation the idea of a levy could be dropped.  The farming organisations had meetings with their branches throughout the country.  About 10 per cent of farmers in the various organisations favoured the retention of the notional system but 90 per cent of the farmers were in favour of the accounts system.  In my own county of Kildare and probably in county Meath also the majority of farmers were in favour of the accounts system.  Farmers agree that they pay far more tax under the accounts system but that it is the only fair way.  The notional system is attractive to farmers in intensive production, particularly in dairying, who make large amounts of money.  We would all like to have a notional system in all our businesses.  If in my business I could pay my tax by multiplying my age by a certain figure I would know each year what <Col N="2000" /> I had to pay but if everybody else is paying on the basis of their profits they are going to point the finger at me and say I am not paying my fair share of tax. Equity demands that all farmers be on the same system of tax and that the notional system be done away with.</P>
    <P>There was another announcement last Tuesday concerning a resource tax.  I strenuously opposed the idea of a wealth tax although I was not a Member of this House at the time and I am against the idea of a resource tax.  The amount of £3.50 per £ of valuations over £70 is not going to break anyone and it is only going to bring in £7 million out of the total expected return from farmers in 1980 of £100 million, so really we are speaking about a small amount of money.  I know farmers are not too worried about the amount of money; they will regard it as an extra form of rates although it will be paid as tax.  But I do not like the principle and I would not like to see it extended.  I say that regardless of the fact that some of the more prominent members of the IFA are in favour of a resource tax in principle.  A resource tax has some merits.  It would lend itself to approval by the Government because we could calculate each year the amount of money that would be brought in.  It would be very easy to administer and we could show exactly how much money we could get each year.  But the logic of a resource tax is that it may prove very attractive because there will be greater movement of land which is not in production at the moment; it will be worked better or sold to more productive farmers.  It will also mean that the higher the resource tax goes the more will farmers engage in the more profitable enterprises such as milk production.  One would want to be mad to engage in the winter fattening of cattle where the gross return would be about £30 per head and at the same time have to pay a high resource tax; the small return as against the large amount of money that has to be put into winter fattening of cattle would make this very unattractive. In fact many farmers are getting out of it and going into cereal production and other farming activities. If the idea of a resource tax is pursued to its logical conclusion and we keep putting <Col N="2001" /> the amount up people will get out of the low-profit ventures, the winter fattening of cattle and, since milk is at the moment the highest yielder, they will go into milk production.  But there is an over supply of milk in the Community.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, if we are to create the jobs that we have been speaking about in budget after budget and in economic debate after economic debate, we will have to encourage industries which have some relation to agriculture, and the production of cattle is the area where we will have the greatest amount of by-products so far as the creation of jobs is concerned.  Consequently I do not like the idea of a resource tax at all.  I am glad I heard the Minister say that if farm accounts prove that tax can be collected from farmers he would not be too keen on the introduction of a resource tax either.</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to speak about is the restriction on capital allowances. At the moment normal wear and tear is allowed on machinery, buildings and so on, but if a person buys a new machine he can write off as much of it as he likes in the first year.  It is proposed to restrict this in 1980-1981. The impression has gone abroad that this is going to kill off all kinds of initiative. It simply means that a person will not be able to write off the whole value of a new piece of machinery in the first year but he will still be able to write off the normal wear and tear throughout the life of that machine or whatever it may be.  Some farmers who know the principle of this a little better than other farmers do not think it is a bad idea at all because the idea of free depreciation is a slight contradiction when one talks about the creation of jobs.  Free depreciation was brought in in 1971 and the idea was to encourage farmers to reinvest in new plant and new equipment. On the other hand if one invests in new equipment one is cutting down on the labour force.  We want to create more jobs but by giving firms and companies access to free depreciation we are really inviting them to replace men by machines.  In the budget of 1971 farmers benefited like everyone else.  This new proposal is not the traumatic thing <Col N="2002" /> which farmers think it is going to be.  All it means is that after claiming free depreciation the farmer will still have 30 per cent of his taxable profit.</P>
    <P>It depends on the cost of the machine whether or not it is 30 per cent.  If a man has a taxable profit of £12,000 and buys a new tractor for £40,000, under normal depreciation he is allowed write off 25 per cent, that is £10,000.  This means that he has £2,000 taxable profit, which is probably wiped out by personal allowances, so that he probably pays no tax that year.  As far as I understand it, the restriction on those capital allowances means that that man is able to claim his normal wear and tear but the discretionary element is restricted. Therefore after writing off the discretionary element, a man will still have 70 per cent less taxable profits.  This will probably come up in next year's Finance Bill.  It is causing a lot of confusion among people throughout the country.  I should like to emphasise that people will still be able to write off the cost of machines as they have always done.</P>
    <P>The announcement about farming taxation should have been accepted by the farming organisations.  I would go along with them if they said that they would accept this system but that they would talk about cash allowances and that the idea of a resource tax would be postponed.  The Government possibly might have been influenced by this.  The resource tax is estimated to bring in only £7 million, which is not such a large amount.  I believe the farming organisations did a disservice to our farmers in not accepting the package.  I have put on record my reservations about one item of it.  When farmers understand it better I am sure they will find that the cash allowances are not really a big thing.  I believe it is only a technical matter and could be open for negotiation.  The majority of farmers are in favour of having all farmers on accounts and of the abolition of the notional system.  The IFA and the ICMSA could have said they were willing to accept this package with some reservations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not get that choice.  They had to accept it all, including the resource tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the farming organisations did not say anything good about the package.  The farmers I know were willing to accept accounts and the abolition of the notional system.  They were a bit confused about the capital allowance and some of them were not too happy about the resource tax, even though this year it is not too bad.  They felt, however, that it would be bigger next year and also the year after.</P>
      <P>My impression is that farming organisations did not welcome the package.  Perhaps they have their own reasons for that.  I am sure that the leaders of those organisations do everything in the interests of farmers but I believe they were mistaken in not accepting the basic principle of the taxation, which is lowering the threshold to £40 and putting all farmers on accounts. We would not have had the reintroduction of the levy last Tuesday if the farming organisations had accepted the package.  I do not like the levy.  Before there was any amendment to it I said I was against the idea of it.  The Minister for Finance agreed earlier this year that the levy would not come into force on 1 May if the farming organisations accepted the new system of taxation, but they said they would not.  I am afraid the reintroduction of the levy is because of their attitude.  The farming organisations could have accepted the package without any loss of face or without any serious injury to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only logical way we can progress is by the accounts system for farmers.  If a farmer makes £50,000 a year he pays a large amount in taxation, but if he does not make any money he does not pay any tax.  I believe that the amount of money which will be collected by the abolition of the notional system will at least equal the amount of money collected from farmers in 1978, even though I understand that there are less than 20 per cent of them on the notional system.  The people on the notional system are making big money.  Nobody seems to have any sympathy for the man who can fatten his cattle and who has a large acreage but who might not be making the same amount of money as <Col N="2004" /> the man who has half that acreage but has very intensive milk production.  If everybody was in milk production we would not have any meat factories.  I believe that there are far fewer cattle in the country than the number given in the official figures because there are cattle being killed in factories which are not fit for killing.  Our cattle numbers have deteriorated.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture will do something about increasing the number.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of the levy, although it will only be for one year, will likely result in a number of redundancies in meat factories.  I believe there will be some spinoffs to the Revenue Commissioners by the introduction of full accounts for all farmers.</P>
    <P>Many agricultural contractors will be brought into the tax net.  Since farm taxation was brought in only the big agricultural contractors, who were registered for paying tax, did all types of work.  There are thousands of agricultural contractors doing jobs for farmers who are below the tax threshold. The first thing those agricultural contractors ask farmers is whether they are paying tax and if they are not they will do the job.  This might lead to a number of them getting out of contract work, which will probably mean that the cost of agricultural contractors will go up because there will be fewer people in the business.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the Revenue Commissioners will gain more money from rent from the letting of land.  At the moment if a person is on the notional system of taxation he will not be claiming the rent he pays for his land.  In 99 cases out of 100 the person receiving the rent is not returning it and the Revenue Commissioners are none the wiser. Under the full account system that money will show up in the lessor's books and the lessee will have to pay tax on it.</P>
    <P>There will be a spin off in regard to farming taxation.  In Ireland there are a large number of split rateable holdings. A farmer may have a £100 valuation in three different rate demand notices, £45, £45 and £10.  As the Revenue Commissioners only work off the rate notices, these people have not been caught but <Col N="2005" /> now they will be caught in the tax net. This will put more money into the coffers of the Minister.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers have jobs in factories and have farms with valuations of less than £60.  They do not usually return this land on their PAYE forms but they will be caught by the account system for their jobs and their farms. The introduction of full accounts for farmers should mean that farms will be better managed.  Most progressive farmers have kept accounts for years, but the ordinary farmer has not.  When they have to keep an account system for the taxmen most farmers will adopt a better accounting system to tell them how their various enterprises are doing. This should lead to better farm management.</P>
    <P>The media have done the country a disservice by trying to forment the division between urban and rural Ireland.  It is not in anyone's interest to try to create such a division.  Nowadays people do not have time to read the leading article or the full report and are inclined to form their opinions from the headlines in the various papers.  It does not do anyone any good to see a headline like &ldquo;Who Runs The Country&rdquo; one day and the following day the headline &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo;. That has improved neither the lot of the PAYE worker nor the farmer.  All it has done is to give the people in the towns and cities a hate figure&mdash;the farmer.  I am a firm believer in the freedom of the press but it is not responsible journalism when editors print such headlines.</P>
    <P>Section 38 refers to the increased penalties on illegal bookmakers from £100 to £500.  This is a subject in which I have an interest and I agree that the penalty should be increased.  The £100 penalty has been in existence for a number of years and is not realistic. Why are there unlicensed bookmakers? The reason is that if you bet off-course you have to pay a 20 per cent off-course betting tax.  On a £5 bet that is £1.  That is a bet in itself.  That 20 per cent tax does not go back to racing; it goes directly into the coffers of the Department of Finance.  There is a case for reducing this tax.  If the Government cannot reduce it to 10 per cent, a <Col N="2006" /> proportion of it should go back into racing. The only money the Racing Board get comes from the levy on course bookmakers&mdash;6 per cent.  If a portion of the 20 per cent tax were given to the Racing Board, racing, prize money and facilities could be improved.  As I said, I would be in favour of the Government reducing this tax to 10 per cent.  If the off-course betting were so reduced I am sure more money would be collected by the Revenue Commissioners because an immense amount of money is spent on illegal betting.  People are not prepared to pay this 20 per cent, but they are prepared to bet illegally.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned the PAYE protest.  These people are campaigning about the present tax system because they feel they are not getting a fair deal. A PAYE worker should be allowed travelling expenses to and from his work because the self-employed get this concession. Most people who have to travel distances to work have to spend a great deal of money maintaining their car&mdash;petrol, repairs and so on&mdash;and these should be tax deductible expenses. They are deductible for a self-employed person.  There is a very strict definition for allowing travelling expenses to the PAYE worker.  Among other things, they must be necessarily incurred in the performance of his duties.  It is that phrase &ldquo;in the performance of his duties&rdquo; which has rendered it impossible for the appeals commissioners to give a decision in favour of allowing them. That phrase means that, whereas one needs a car to get to one's place of employment, one does not need a car in the performance of one's duties.  The self-employed come under a rule which says &ldquo;wholly and inclusively incurred for the business&rdquo;.  It is a different section and allows certified people to claim travelling expenses.  The Revenue Commissioners might say that it is a difficult job to police allowances for travelling expenses, but that it not a reason why it should be thrown out.  People who have to incur travelling expenses in order to get to their work should be allowed for it.</P>
    <P>Short-term social welfare benefits are also to be brought into the tax net.  I <Col N="2007" /> have no objection to that in principle because some people work from April until September, then find some reason to be unemployed and claim back tax.  It might help to stop that situation.  If we tax short-term social welfare benefits we should allow the amount taken out of the person's pay packet as an expense in computing his net income.  Until this budget, a person was allowed a very small part of the social welfare stamp as a tax free allowance.  Last year it was £64 and a few years ago it was £48.  I have never understood why it was so low.  It represented the pension part of the social welfare stamp.  Now there are no social welfare stamps.  Since we have extended the principle of taxing social welfare benefits we should allow them as an expense in computing a person's income. A person who has a gross wage of £80 has at present to pay tax on that and he then has to pay his social welfare contribution.  His social welfare contribution of £6 or £10 should be deducted from his gross income and he should only pay tax on £70.  It should be regarded as a superannuation contribution. It was not possible to do this before, but now that a person will be taxed on social welfare benefits they should be allowed as an expense in full against that person's gross tax.</P>
    <P>That principle is extended further in this Bill.  What is income for one person is an expense on another person.  In this Bill we will allow the contribution for permanent health benefit schemes to be a tax free allowance but we are going to tax those as well.  Since we are going to tax benefits payable under the Social Welfare Acts we should allow the total social welfare contributions as an expense. I would commend that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters which are better dealt with on Committee Stage, including losses.  A single parent family will now get an extra allowance of £250.  That is only fair.  When a married man who has a large tax free allowance dies his widow, who takes over the reins, gets a very much reduced tax free allowance.  I would make the case that the opposite should happen and that the <Col N="2008" /> widow's allowance should be at least equal to the married allowance.  That is something which has puzzled me for a long time and I do not see any reason for it.  I commend the section which increases the widow's allowance and also gives an extra £250 to a widow who has children.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for increasing the interest from £2,000 to £2,400, but it is not high enough.  In 1973, when this relief was allowed, a special consideration had to be taken into account.  There was no capital gains tax legislation at this time.  That was one of the reasons why the interest restriction was put at £2,000.  Prior to that one could have unrestricted interest relief.  There was a tax avoidance measure where a person could make a large capital gain, pay no tax at all and during his income in the previous year have unrestricted interest relief and end up paying no income tax or capital gains tax.  When the capital gains tax legislation was introduced I thought the case would have been made that this should be increased, but it was not.  Irrespective of that, interest relief of £2,000 in 1973 represented a borrowing by which one could buy a very large house, but nowadays the interest relief of £2,400 would not buy a large house at all.  There is a case to be made for increasing the limit above £2,400.</P>
    <P>I would like to feel that, when we are discussing measures such as the Finance Bill or other matters, the contributions by the Government back benchers and by the Opposition would be taken into account in shaping future legislation. Since I came into the House I found that Government decisions put legislation on the table.  The Members of the Opposition get up and ridicule and make as little as they can of them and it often seems more important to score cheap political points off one's opponent whether on the Opposition or Government side of the House than to make any constructive kind of contribution.  I would like any good points I have made in my contribution to be taken account of and whereas it is fair game to make political capital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as I can recall, when moving the Adjournment last night I was discussing the efforts made by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to justify the withdrawal of food subsidies.  I recall giving figures which indicated a sharp increase in inflation in recent times.  The most disturbing aspect of this is the inequitable burden it places on the less well off sections in that since New Year's Day we have subsidies partially withdrawn on basic food items.  As a result the Government will receive by the end of the year over £22 million from consumers.  This approximates the amount they gave out in the form of car tax abolition in 1977.  There are people now paying for the abolition of car tax who would never aspire to owning a car. They are asked to pay for the benefit of other people who can well afford cars to keep their car tax paid.  This is the inequitable aspect of the across-the-board application of the partial withdrawal of food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said last night that we were now receiving information on a regular basis from the media on the price levels of different commodities in different areas.  That is so to a degree, but it is a far cry from the promise made in the manifesto that Fianna Fáil would ensure the dissemination of information on a weekly basis in newspapers, radio and television.  This is not happening <Col N="2011" /> because, as the Minister said last night, it is the prerogative of editors to decide what is published.  That admission should have been made in 1977.</P>
    <P>In the past I put down Parliamentary Questions to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy seeking up-to-date information on price increases sanctioned by him prior to the publication of the appropriate National Prices Commission Report.  For about nine months this information was forthcoming from the Minister in tabular form, but after a time he saw fit to discontinue this practice and actually refused to give this information.  He told me in his reply that this information would be available to me when the NPC Report was published.  This is a blatant abuse of his powers, stifling requests for information by a Member of the Opposition.  I objected at the time, but so far I have got nowhere with my objection.  I consider it an abuse of power, and wrong, to act on those lines and refuse information.</P>

Deputy O'Toole and other Opposition Members made play on the whole question of prices and price changes, and therefore it is only reasonable to consider closely some of these prices and the changes that have taken place in the past two years since Fianna Fáil came into office and compare that situation with the first two years of the Coalition period of office from March 1973 to March 1975&mdash;the first two years of each administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at some of the most important commodities I find that bread during the Coalition period increased in price by 55.6 per cent.  For the Fianna Fáil period the increase was 31 per cent. In the case of cheese, the increase in the <Col N="2012" /> Coalition period was 70 per cent compared with 28 per cent in the Fianna Fáil two year period.  In the case of sugar the increase was 112 per cent compared with 25.5 per cent in the Fianna Fáil period.  Tea, butter and milk are three other important items.  In the case of tea the increase was 22 per cent in the Coalition period and 6 per cent in the equivalent Fianna Fáil period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in butter was 61 per cent in the Coalition period and 30 per cent in the Fianna Fáil period.  Finally, the increase in milk was 60 per cent in the Coalition period and 43.8 per cent in the Fianna Fáil period. These increases on the Fianna Fáil side actually include the removal of part of the subsidies which had been added during the depression period.  In the case of cheese there was a removal of 10p; in the case of butter 8p and in the case of milk 2p.  Even after taking away that amount of subsidy on these major items in the first two years of Fianna Fáil Government, the rate of price increase has been only one third to one half that experienced in the first two years of the Coalition.</P>
      <P>I make these points because they were raised in the debate last night and it is only reasonable to put the record straight in regard to Fianna Fáil's performance during their first two years in office.  A great deal has been said about the removal of portion of the subsidies. Again I find an extraordinary thing on the part of the Opposition.  I refer to a speech by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, on 27 June 1975 in Dáil Éireann.  He was the Leader of the Coalition who at that time under pressure from Fianna Fáil introduced these subsidies. The then Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Our aim must be to reduce the rate of inflation to a single-digit figure within a reasonably short period and thus to bring about a situation where subsidies will no longer be necessary. No one believes that subsidies are a desirable method of dealing with a situation.  They are justified in very exceptional and limited circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" /> It has been repeatedly said that they have many and substantial drawbacks. They are a wasteful way of helping those in need because they apply equally to everyone.  They involve a substantial increase in public expenditure when its size and financing are already exerting their own inflationary pressures.  They increase the proportion of public expenditure devoted to current consumption rather than to investment.  In this way, they are, in the long term, inimical to employment. But in the conditions of today, which are unique in our country's history, the Government are convinced that subsidies are essential to begin to get the rate of price increases down.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say in relation to our present economic Ministers that they made no attempt to reduce the subsidies in any way until the rate of inflation was down to single digit figures.  It is somewhat hypocritical for the Opposition to come along now and paint a different picture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition also claimed in their motion that the Fianna Fáil Government has not delivered on all their promises in the manifesto to date.  They criticised the proposals in relation to the National Prices Commission and various other aspects of the Fianna Fáil policy at the time of the election.  What they did not refer to was the report of the National Prices Commission issued in June 1973 which strongly recommended that the Coalition Government should reform the Sale of Goods Act.  The reasons for that recommendation are spelled out in page 65 of this report, which was presented to the Government in June 1973.  That Sale of Goods Act was not reformed during the Coalition period, but the Minister since assuming office has already put before the House a very comprehensive <Col N="2014" /> Sale of Goods and Supply of Services, Bill 1978 which has passed through the Second Stage in this House.  The Minister has certainly delivered on the promise in relation to the protection of consumers.  Before that Bill was introduced, the Minister introduced a Consumer Information Bill which was designed to ensure that the consumer would have protection from misleading descriptions about goods and services, in various ways.  The two measures were seen as a consumer charter which would have a major influence on prices and on the performance of the market in relation to the consumer.  There is no need to go into the detail of these Bills, but it is important to bring to the attention of the House the fact that these are accomplishments of the Minister, that we are not just talking about these desirable measures, but that we accepted the recommendations made in the report of the National Prices Commission in 1973 which should surely have been acted upon long before this Minister came to office in 1977.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole referred to inflation and I have a table on inflation here, so, happily, I can respond to his request.  At mid-November 1973 inflation was at 12.6 per cent, in mid-November 1974 it was at 20 per cent, in mid-November 1975 it was at 16.8 per cent and in mid-November 1976 it was at 20.6 per cent. In 1977, the year in which we had a change of Government, there was a considerable improvement in the rate of inflation, which was down to 10.8 per cent, and in mid-November 1978, the period during which the budget was prepared, inflation was at 7.9 per cent.  I am sure that Deputy O'Toole is aware that this was the position at that stage.  It is quite clear that in relation to inflation, which is one of the major factors affecting the price of various commodities, and reflecting how the Government are performing in that area, they have brought it under control.  The Government are committed to keeping inflation within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>Another aspect in relation to this is the purchasing power of the £.  Referring to the Central Bank report during the period of Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977 if we take 1973 as 100p <Col N="2015" /> per £, 1974 was 85p, 1975 was 71p, 1976 was 60p and 1977 was 53p.  It is vital, in any consideration of prices, to consider what can be purchased for a £, and at the rate at which the purchasing power of the £ was declining it is extraordinary that the Coalition representatives should come into this House and criticise Fianna Fáil on their performance since then, since the rate of inflation and loss in the purchasing power of the £ has been only a mere fraction of that recorded during their period in office. In this respect the Fianna Fáil record is good and we can be proud of it. Needless to say there is a great deal of work to be done here, and the Minister is very conscious of that.</P>
    <P>As far as the National Prices Commission are concerned, the Minister of State indicated clearly last night that the promise of reviewing the National Prices Commission has been fulfilled and the review was reported on previously in the House.  As a result of that investigation the National Prices Commission were strengthened.  They are regarded as a watchdog committee and have produced excellent reports over a very long period. These reports have been very valuable and are vital to all concerned with the development of our economy, the changes in prices, in inflation, or in the operations of middle men, or various sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Another item mentioned specifically in this motion is the investigation of middlemen's margins, and it implied that the Minister is not investigating these.  Here, I must point to a report specifically requested by the Minister, the monthly report number 74 for June 1978.  This is a comprehensive report on middlemen's margins.  There is a report on retail margins, wholesalers and importers' margins, on margins in meat, in poultry, in fruit, vegetables and in fish.  It is a comprehensive report which covers this whole area.  On looking at the facts I find that the Minister has delivered here too, he has instituted a study of middlemen's margins and this study was made available publicly in June 1978.</P>
    <P>The details of this would be worthy of further separate study.  The commission's conclusions showed that the study on <Col N="2016" /> fruit and vegetables bore a close similarity to that on poultry margins published in January 1978.  In both cases the consultants found that margins were not excessive in the earlier stages of distribution in smaller retail outlets.  The supermarkets were the only exception. In the report of April 1978 it was indicated that the results of the price margins on fruit and vegetables for transmission to RTE suggested that the prices in major supermarkets at least in Dublin were more often than not higher than in other outlets.  This pattern has continued since then.  The Minister pointed out that An Foras Talúntais are engaged in a further study in this area in much greater detail.  The Minister has been very active in this area.  He has instituted a study, has given a report and has ensured that further studies will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The question of oil has been mentioned repeatedly in this debate.  The Minister has come to a positive and definite conclusion on this matter.  He has said that as a matter of strategic policy he believes that a State oil company should be formed.  He has committed himself clearly on this and has said that he is setting about to prepare legislation on the matter.  Here, again, the Minister has been quite decisive and the people recognise this.  All of us must admit that this is a most complex and difficult situation.  I cannot agree with the suggestions in the motion put down by the Opposition in relation to the Minister's performance.</P>
    <P>When we look broadly at the Government's approach we must bear in mind that there is a great deal more to price control and the influencing of price than publicity, argument, debate and even watchdog committees.  The Minister and the Government have strengthened the National Prices Commission.  They have given more publicity to price reporting. Last night the Minister of State gave us a detailed account of the work in progress in that area.  Information about prices has increased and here the Minister and the Government have delivered on their promises.</P>
    <P>However, this information does not solve the problems.  On the question of prices and the stability of prices, far <Col N="2017" /> more important is the economic and structural measures taken to stabilise prices.  The economic and structural measures cover a wide range.  They include the control of inflation, the control of the power of the £ and the influencing of the power of the £.  One of the major measures taken by the Government in relation to control of inflation was our membership of the EMS under which we are permitted a very limited variation in the exchange rate of the £, a limit of 2¼ per cent up or down.  While this measure at first may not seem to have a direct bearing on the price of commodities, because it affects the purchasing power of the £ and inflation it has a direct bearing on prices.  So long as we maintain stability in our currency, automatically we will maintain a high degree of stability in price inflation.  This is one of the fundamental measures taken by the Government which is far more important than the cosmetic operations or the more minor steps that can be taken to influence prices.</P>
    <P>Of course the Government have also taken steps in relation to social welfare recipients by giving direct increases greater than those necessary to meet the rate of inflation anticipated in the current year.  Social Welfare recipients have been protected in this way at least in the short term and I am confident that if it is necessary to give them further direct protection the Government will do so.</P>
    <P>The stabilisation of agricultural prices is an important aspect of price control and here it is clear that we will not see very high rates of increase in agricultural prices in the coming period.  We can expect much greater stability in this area.</P>
    <P>Another major structural measure the Government are taking is to encourage reorganisation of the markets.  This is quite clear from statements made by Ministers and in the actions that have been taken.  This measure has a fundamental effect on future price relationships.  It is not the easiest one to get across to the media and to the people but it has long-term benefits for the consumer. We have talked about the middlemen's margins.  We can study them and find out what is happening but if we want to influence them directly we must increase the strength, cohesion and information <Col N="2018" /> among the producer groups. In recent times the Government have encouraged the establishment of a number of producer groups.  These will affect the structure of pricing and will ensure that where middlemen's margins are involved these people will give an efficient service or else they will not survive.  They have an important part to play but too often they are inefficient and the costs incurred are greater than they need to be.  By strengthening the producer groups, by increasing the information about prices on a continuous basis, and particularly by strengthening the groups who use the services of the middlemen it is possible to reduce wastage.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Government to the co-operative movement has been one of encouragement.  They have encouraged the strengthening and development of the co-ops for the same reasons. Here, again, there are the basic producers, the handlers of food materials, and if they are efficiently operated benefits will accrue to the consumers not only by way of improved and efficient pricing but also by way of higher quality, better presentation and packaging.</P>
    <P>The Government have been putting a considerable effort into the co-operative movement in this way.  Deputies will recall that economic Ministers have been urging the trade unions to look at the possibilities attached to co-operatives in Europe with a view to becoming involved in the movement here, both themselves and their members.  Structural changes will take place in this area to the great benefit of consumers, here much more than in Europe.</P>
    <P>In looking at the Government's performance we must consider the entire package.  It is useless to look at one aspect without looking at the whole complex.  We must look at Government measures in regard to job creation, prices, inflation and the targets which have been set in regard to increasing our standards <i>vis-á-vis</i> our European partners.  The recent national understanding, by guaranteeing incomes against CPI increases, is a great step forward.  An inflation rate of 7 per cent is assumed and for each percentage point above 7 per cent which the inflation <Col N="2019" /> rate actually reaches, a 1 per cent wage increase would be incorporated up to 11 per cent, and thereafter a 0.5 per cent increase in wages would apply to each 1 per cent inflation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government are bringing in, in a comprehensive way, fair and reasonable control, an assurance and a guarantee to the worker and the consumer generally that they will not again have to face higher levels of price increases such as they have had to suffer in the past few years.  The Government now have these matters well under control. In the terms of the national understanding, consumers can rest assured that there will be considerable stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Government speakers last night and to Deputy Woods this evening saying that the Government had prices under control and that this had enabled them to finalise a pay agreement, I wondered whether I was living in the same country.  Perhaps Dublin is different from Tipperary in this respect.  The CPI in the past two years has not risen at a slow pace but at a gallop.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach at Question Time on 21 March was asked by Deputy Horgan about the percentage increase in the CPI between mid-May 1977 and Mid-May 1979.  I will select from the reply the percentage price increases in three basic food items from the point of view of the ordinary worker, the old age pensioner and the social welfare recipient.  In that period the price of bread increased by 29.9 per cent, butter by 29.1 per cent and milk by 43.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before June 1977, no matter which part of my constituency I travelled, in supermarkets and shops or outside them, I met Fianna Fáil canvassers with their fabulous food basket lists.  The people were conned by those lists.  Any housewife or shopkeeper will confirm that these days there is not a budget once a year but once a week.  Indeed I am afraid to ask my wife about the cost of living because her budget becomes demolished day by day.  People are frightened at the rapid rise in the cost of living, and the most important contributory <Col N="2020" /> factor has been the partial abolition of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>We may be accused of frequent repetition of this but, as a Deputy who knows so well the needs and the demands of the ordinary people, I cannot repeat too often the staggering effect the abolition of the food subsidies has had on the living standards of lower paid workers and social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods spoke about how these people were looked after in the budget.  Bread, butter and milk are the stable diet of the ordinary people, and who will stand up here and say that an increase of 29 per cent in the price of bread and 43 per cent in the price of milk are not substantial increases?</P>
    <P>Last week we heard of the national understanding, of the three sides getting together.  The low paid worker is not coming too well out of it.  Crocodile tears have been shed for years and promises have been made to those workers.  How can anybody suggest that a wage increase of £4 per week will be sufficient to look after their needs in the next nine months?</P>
    <P>We are living in a state of great industrial unrest and questions are being asked in editorials in national and provincial newspapers about what has gone wrong.  One should think about the situation on Friday evening when the man on a low income takes home the wage packet and the unfortunate wife has to try to fend until the following Friday on £50.  This is one of the basic reasons why there is not industrial peace here.  One must relate to the situation as it is.  It is a matter of existence for many families.  The Government's partial abolition of the food subsidies has contributed to this industrial unrest and we must lay the blame in the proper place.</P>
    <P>I would like to take it a stage further and talk about housing and housing land and the building of houses.  The Minister for the Environment, in a housing directive last August, highlighted the idea that every man should be able to own his own house and I applaud that idea.  That is what is needed; it must be the fundamental right of every man and woman and their family to own their own house. In the same circular, while the exact figures were not outlined, guidelines <Col N="2021" /> were issued that any man on around £4,000 per year approximately, irrespective of the number of children in his family, should be able to build his own house.  With all due respect to the Minister, he is living in cloud cuckoo land if he thinks a man on a gross wage of £4,000 a year can build his own house at the present cost of building land and of building houses.  Housing has gone up by about 40 per cent in the last two years.  Building land has also gone up. What we are talking about is a man on a gross income of £4,000 a year which in 1979 is not a high income.  He is being told&mdash;and I know it from experience at county council level&mdash;that he should be in a position to buy his own site and build a house to his own specification and we are talking about a man who is also debarred from a council loan to build a house.  Here we have a most peculiar housing anomaly where a person with £4,000 per year is told that he cannot have a local authority loan but must go and build his own house.  So out of a gross of £80 a week the Minister says a man should be able to buy a site which can approximate £4,000 and build a house now costing in the region of £17,000 or £18,000.  That is a total of £20,000.  Surely there is something wrong somewhere when we start talking about building one's own house on £80 a week.  How can any Government expect a man on that low income to be able to provide the money and meet a repayment of approximately £30 a week on a house if he were to build his own.</P>
    <P>I would take it a stage further and go from building land to agricultural land. In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 April it is stated that land values have increased at a phenomenal rate and although there was a slight easing of prices for farms in the past six months they are still away above the economic value of the land for production purposes.  Here again we have the situation where another small man, the small farmer, is not in a position to buy land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other aspect of this motion that I am concerned about.  I refer specifically to the question of roadside trading.  We have been promised legislation to control the invasion of every road in our country by this type of trader and nothing has been forthcoming.  I can assure the house that this is a matter that is getting completely out of control.  I cannot speak for the nation but I can speak for my own constituency. Every town in my county is under siege from this type of trader. They are interfering with trading in the area and, while it is not in the motion, I will have it said before the Chair can stop me, they are also destroying the country.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, to treat this as a matter of grave urgency as people are living in peril because of these people.  I know areas where groups of vigilantes are being formed to protect the sheep and young lambs from straying dogs.  These traders are paying nothing and contributing nothing to the economy but they are going around in Mercedes and in fabulous mobile homes.</P>
      <P>On the question of food subsidies I would like to take our minds back to the wage agreement of 1976.  One of the inbuilt conditions of the agreement was the continuance of food subsidies.  We are now in the process of finalising a wage agreement which we all wish for for the good of our people and our country but surely cognisance must be taken of the fact that four months prior to the discussions going on at present this Government partially abolished food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another important matter and that is the question of the abolition of the road tax and the almost instantaneous massive increase in motor insurance.  This surely must bear some investigation.  It has a vast impact on the workers with so many needing cars to <Col N="2023" /> travel to work.  What was gained in the abolition of road tax was submerged in a massive increase in motor insurance.</P>
    <P>If the wage agreement is to be concluded there must be a re-institution of the food subsidies that were abolished last January or a promise at least that no further interference will be made with the way of life of the ordinary worker and the old age pensioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 15 minutes available to conclude I want to refer to a number of points made during the course of the debate.  Last evening I was critical of the proposed minimal restructuring of the National Prices Commission because, apart from the appointment of Mr. Patrick Lyons, nothing else has been done.  The other changes referred to by the Minister were not of a fundamental nature.  I am afraid I must take issue with the Minister when she said that in my comments I implied he was a Fianna Fáil Party hack.  No such implication was made by me in my comments if the record is read properly.  I know that person for many years and both of us would agree that the comments made by the Minister in that regard were rather silly.</P>
      <P>The second comment the Minister made was in relation to my colleague in the west.  It was a rather irrelevant comment but I have to take issue with it.  It is perhaps better to get the contentious matters out of the way first and then I can get down to replying to the other aspects raised.  The Minister took umbrage to the idea that certain vehicles belonging to the Post Office were carrying election posters for the chairman of the Labour Party who happens to be a Euro-candidate.  That is a bit ridiculous and rather silly.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody in the engineering side of the Post Office in the exuberance of his support of the chairman of the Labour Party put up a poster on an official van I do not consider <Col N="2024" /> it has to be brought into this House, because all it does is to increase support for the chairman of the Labour Party.  It is quite ridiculous, with due respect to the Minister, to imply, as she did, that it was in the interest of some parties in the Opposition to help to prolong the Post Office dispute.  That is stretching one's ministerial imagination a little bit far.  Nobody in the House wants to see the Post Office dispute carried on for one second longer than it is being prolonged.  I and my colleague, Deputy Corish, who is spokesman for our party on P &amp; T, would be only too happy to see an end to this dispute.  So far as the Opposition can take any action in a matter like this, we have done our best to try and bring about a settlement. I regard that comment as not being of ministerial standard.</P>
      <P>There are genuine criticisms contained in the Labour Party motion.  The Government are now two years in office and on the assumption, even if the Minister for Agriculture resigns, that the Government are not likely to fall, they have another two and a half years to go. It is only right that half way through their term of office we should pinpoint the manifesto promises in regard to prices.  In regard to the statement made by the Minister last night there has not been any great restructuring in the National Prices Commission.  I am not so certain that it requires massive restructuring, but for a party to go around the country telling the people to put them back into office and they would really get the NPC on their hind legs chasing after price increases and then to do nothing about it is to &ldquo;con&rdquo; the public at large.  Secondly, nothing has been done in regard to investigating the middlemen's margin.  There have only been some cursory examinations. The Minister did not deny that there was a promise made during the election campaign to publish on television and newspapers comparative prices of supermarket goods.  That has not happened. The Government have not kept their promise in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the seven-day ruling arising out of the UK Outer Zone agreement, there was naïvety here in regard to the defence offered by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2025" /> Party.  The Minister of State said last night:</P>
    <P>When the Minister assumed responsibility for price control in 1977, he decided to retain the link with the UK Outer Zone for the time being simply because it suited us to retain it.</P>
    <P>The boot is now on the other foot.  At the moment it suits the oil companies to retain it because they are seeking substantial price increases in accordance with changes in the price structures in the UK Outer Zone.  That has not been given to the oil companies.  We cannot say here that we want something because it suits us and, when it does not suit us, turn around and tell the oil companies that we are afraid it cannot suit them.  I find a contradiction of policy here.  The oil company executives throughout the country have a very cynical view about the way in which the Government handle their relations with them.</P>
    <P>I am probably the last person in the House who would be regarded as a fan of the multi-national oil companies, but I believe that in commercial relations between a Government and any multinational there should be straight dealing. I am afraid that has not happened. We still have winter in the first week in May.  We are hardly likely to blame the Government for that, but domestic heating oil cannot be got.  Many of my constituents are furious that, because of mishandling by the Government in relation to the price increase in recent weeks, granted to the oil companies many of them have not any domestic heating oil in the present inclement weather.</P>
    <P>There are some other items I want to refer to.  There should be a far more through examination in relation to a number of areas, in particular bank charges.  The Central Bank monitor bank charges and I know that they are outside the ambit of the NPC at the moment. I am very dissatisfied with the charges made, the hours of opening and the general services provided by our commercial banking institutions.  I believe that, with the tremendous profits they have made in recent years and with the colossal profits they are now making out of the EMS, it is high time that a fullscale <Col N="2026" /> investigation of banking charges was brought within the ambit of the NPC.</P>
    <P>I met a constituent of mine the other day who was going to visit her daughter in Wales.  She went down to Dún Laoghaire to get £150 sterling.  She had to pay £156.50 between commission and the difference between the Irish punt and the UK pound.  We have had very strong complaints about the actions of commercial banks in the UK at Heathrow Airport and elsewhere, where there were charges of anything up to 8p or 9p on the Irish pound.  The commercial banks are making a substantial killing in relation to ordinary money changing.  Their operations should be brought more firmly under the ambit of the State.  The Central Bank should not have exclusive review in relation to bank charges or to be notified by commercial banks of their charges and get away with it scot-free.</P>
    <P>The NPC should be more closely involved with house construction costs. Bearing in mind the colossal increases in house prices in recent years, particularly in the past two years, I am not satisfied that a more rigorous control and intervention on the part of the State could not be brought about.  It is outrageous that in an industry which charges people anything up to £25,000 or £30,000 for a new house, some people are making a great deal of money.  The State should not tolerate such a situation.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult and complex situation to come to grips with because the cost of building materials is very high and 50 per cent of the cost of building a house is spent on labour and there is the perennial problem of land prices.  Here again the Government have been negligent.  They have been two years in office; they have a massive majority of 20 and can take on any group in the State with equanimity, and there is no way they can be voted out of office. Still the cost of a site to build a house has been allowed to escalate out of all proportion.  Speculators and get-rich-quick merchants dealing in building land have made massive killings in recent years.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why the implications of the Kenny report and the <Col N="2027" /> necessary legislation should not have been brought in long ago.  This is an outrageous situation.  It means that in my constituency, South Dublin, the cost of new houses is above the national average.  The ordinary industrial worker, married, aged 23, 24 or 25 years, earning an average of £75 to £85 a week in a factory has not a hope in hell of buying a new house.  He has to depend on the local authority.  That is not a healthy situation.  It is undesirable socially that newly married young people with one or two children should be so cynical about their prospects of having a home of their own.  In the greater Dublin area the average earnings of a man in an industrial factory is £90, including overtime and shift allowances.  After tax in many cases his take-home pay is around £70.  He finds it impossible to pay £20, £30 or even £35 or £40 a week for a house mortgage.  As a result the local authorities are obliged to have a large number of such persons on their housing lists.  This is very costly in terms of State subsidy and social structures.  The Government could do a lot more in this area.</P>
    <P>Many people, from the Minister for the Environment down the line, attempted to come to grips with this problem but they have not brought about a situation where house prices would rise at a level of, say, 12 or 15 per cent per annum.  That would be a normal increase rather than, as is happening at present, an increase of the order of 35 per cent.  If I were in Government I would have a radical rethink about the £1,000 house grant which is payable direct to the builder.  Most builders have put this money into their pockets and increased the price of houses by £1,000.  In a buyer's market one finds builders being cynical and saying that the £1,000 is given to them.  Of course, it is contingent on a certificate of reasonable valuation being supplied but apparently the £1,000 first house grant has been, if anything, inflationary and certainly has been of no great benefit to the ordinary wage and salary earner or the person in the middle income group who is trying to buy his own house.</P>
    <P>The Government could bring greater <Col N="2028" /> pressure to bear on motor insurance.  I feel very strongly about this.  We are reaching a situation similar to the demands which were made in relation to health eligibility in this country.  I never thought I would see the day when a government could cave in so rapidly, as they quite rightly did in relation to the current proposals for the national understanding, and bring on a straight limit of £7,000 in relation to health eligibility. Minister after Minister came into this House and Minister after Minister went to Fianna Fáil cumann meetings and said that that could not possibly be done.  They said that £5,500 was the limit but when democratic pressure was exerted by a particular group in society in the context of national pay negotiations, Deputy Haughey, Minister for Health, was sitting in amazement in his office while the Cabinet in Merrion Street said that the new health eligibility limit would be £7,000.</P>
    <P>Likewise I believe pressure will develop in this society because our motorists are sick to death having to deal with commercial motor insurance organisations and they will demand a kind of VHI motor insurance structure, a kind of occupational injuries motor insurance structure, a national system of motor insurance.  In Austria if a person does not display his motor insurance certificate the police simply remove the number plates from the car.  To drive a car there without number plates would mean that one would get six years in jail. Some people here drive around without any motor insurance.  They take colossal risks, maiming people, and are involved in a massive number of car accidents every year.  There is a fairly rigorous enforcement of the insurance provisions by the gardaí but there are people of utter and total social irresponsibility who still drive around in cars which are not insured. With the gardaí having so much on their hands nowadays to protect money, not to mention life and limb from uninsured cars on the road, there is a situation where some people still manage to get away with uninsured cars.</P>
    <P>The Government should seriously contemplate bringing in a State sponsored body for motor insurance.  With the postal dispute now in its tenth week <Col N="2029" /> people will say that they posted their cheque to the insurance company to insure their car and the gardaí will have a job finding out where the truth lies in checking on individual cases.  Motor insurance should not be in the hands of private organisations, whether they be so called corporate or so-called provident societies.  There should be a similar system to that which operates with VHI, the national health service, social insurance and occupational injuries. Motor insurance should come within that ambit.  I make that point strongly to the Minister and also that such an organisation should be run on a nonprofit making but break even basis.  In Canada and other countries such State organisations are run at no cost whatever to the Exchequer.  If someone drives a car on the road he should pay the full economic cost of insurance. There is no question of a State subvention being involved in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some comment on the role of the NPC in relation to hotel charges, lounge charges and so on. We have a major tourist industry.  There are many times when I seriously question whether we deserve to have as large, as profitable and as buoyant an industry as we have had in the past two or three years.  Many of our so-called lounges are, for tourists and for the natives, unsanitary, unhygienic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am genuinely disappointed with the performance of the Government in relation to the prices situation.  Whether it is houses, motor insurance, food subsidies or ordinary heating oil at home there has been a lack lustre performance by the Government.  Nobody is more acutely <Col N="2031" /> aware than I am of the extreme limitations facing any Government in relation to the control of prices.  The best any Government can do is to exert an influence over the situation.  The element of control is extremely limited but, in so far as there devolves on the Government the obligation to exert that control, I get the impression that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, apart from flogging it to death in the run up to the last election, forgot about the NPC as soon as he was in office and put it under the gentle wing of the Minister of State.  I am afraid it will languish there for the next two and a half years.  I hope the Minister will not also languish in the process.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil election address <Col N="2032" /> flogged around Dun Laoghaire there was a slogan which said Fianna Fáil will end this chaos.  A fair amount of chaos has been created by the Government and is with us now.  I know the Government might be in the extremity of decision about the Minister for Agriculture in relation to an entirely different matter but that should not cripple them altogether in terms of taking action in the area of prices where they have a major role to fulfil and where they have done nothing much in the last two or three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 February I put down a question for written reply but I was not happy with the reply I received.  Newcastlewest is the county capital in my area, which is a designated area.  So far we have not received a direct dialling system in spite of the fact that there are 600 subscribers in the immediate area.  Many smaller towns and smaller areas have that service.  I do not know why we are denied it.  This town was to have an automatic service at the end of the year but for some reason that project has been put back indefinitely. There was a site for this automatic exchange at Rathkeale and the erection of it was begun.  Building has now been stopped and the people in the area are anxious to know why.</P>
      <P>The town has 15 industries employing approximately 1,500 people and approximately 30 per cent of their total output is for export.  That speaks for itself.  The population of the area is approximately 15,000.  The absence of this service has had a bad effect on industry.  One can well understand how difficult it is to interest industrialists in an area which has no automatic exchange.  That lack creates a handicap for industrial development.  West Limerick is literally starved of industry because of this and this was never so evident as during the present postal and telecommunications strike.  Only during the past ten weeks have the people of Newcastlewest fully realised what they are being denied.</P>
      <P>The IDA has a very difficult task in trying to induce industrialists to come to west Limerick.  The people feel that without this basic service there is no hope for the future.  The lack of adequate telecommunications services has literally isolated west Limerick from the outside world.  We have no contacts and no hope of new industry because of this fact. Other areas such as Rathkeale, Kilmallock and Kilfinane suffer from the same inadequacy.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister of State to make a commitment tonight, to give us this service.  Over 400 subscribers have signed a petition, which I received, requesting the Minister to give an early indication of his intentions.  They have set as a dead line 16 May to hear from the Department.  These people are not easily roused, as has been proved by the fact that there is little trouble in these areas and few grievances have been expressed. There have been no protest marches or anything like that.  However, people are only prepared to put up with a certain amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2035" /> Industrialists find it very hard to reach, for instance, the managers of their firms in Newcastlewest, and there are very long delays.  That is the reason I am asking the Minister here tonight to give me some information about what is happening. About two years ago these services were promised for Newcastlewest. I understand that something has happened to the site.  Some people tell us that it has to do with dampness but I would like to know why we were not told anything.  On behalf of the people of west Limerick I ask the Minister of State to say why this service has not been provided.  I do not want to be told it will be provided in one or two year's time which was the reply I received to a question I put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien has outlined the situation adequately and I should like to support what he said.  A few nights ago, with Deputy O'Brien, I met a deputation from the Newcastlewest Chamber of Commerce, which deputation included businessmen, industrialists and public representatives from the Newcastlewest area who are gravely concerned about the situation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Brien has pointed out, the situation has been exacerbated by the unfortunate prolonged dispute in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Newcastlewest is the centre of a fast developing industrial and agricultural hinterland.  It has a number of important industries that are export-orientated and it is adjacent to the major Alcan development on the Shannon estuary. There are other projects planned for that area.  Newcastlewest is not merely a dormitory town but it is an important regional town in relation to the Shannon estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen examples of industrialists in successful industries with a high export content trying to operate under very severe handicaps.  The manual telephone service is not suited to modern industry or business.  I understand from the deputation we met in Newcastlewest that expectations had been raised that something was going to happen about this matter in the current year but judging <Col N="2036" /> from the reply of the Minister of State to Deputy O'Brien recently there appears to be a change of attitude.  There is a slowing down in the programme.</P>
    <P>The future economic development of Newcastlewest and its large hinterland will depend on the provision of automatic telephone facilities in that area.  I live in the Kilmallock area where there is no automatic telephone service. The absence of this facility nowadays is very serious.  I ask the Minister if there is any reason for delay in the provision of automatic telephone facilities for Newcastlewest. If there is a reason we want the Minister to tell us.  Industrialists in the area are operating under severe handicaps because of the absence of this modern facility which they were led to believe would be provided in the current year.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whatever difficulties may have arisen, I urge the Minister to put the provision of an automatic telephone service for the Newcastlewest area high in the Department's programme of work.  I am sure the Minister of State appreciates fully the gravity of the situation.  I am concerned about the cases put to me by people who are operating successful industries in that area.  Some of them are in food processing or engineering industries.  As Newcastlewest is adjacent to the Shannon estuary we hope there will be spin-off industries coming to Newcastlewest, Rathkeale and other towns and villages. I urge the Minister to take immediate action to ensure that the much-needed automatic telephone facilities will be provided in Newcastlewest as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> First, I wish to say that I accept readily the desirability of converting not just the four exchanges in question but all the other manual exchanges in the country. However, I should like to explain that it is a major undertaking to convert all exchanges to automatic working and that this task could be undertaken only on a piecemeal basis.  Therefore, an order of priority has to be set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> This was arranged broadly on the basis of dealing with the major centres first, where this was practicable, and with the smaller exchanges dependent on them.  Altogether, more than 500 exchanges catering for 90 per cent of existing subscribers have automatic service but the remaining 10 per cent are served by some 500 exchanges.  Arrangements for the conversion of these exchanges are being pressed forward as quickly as possible but, regrettably, it will take some years yet before they can all be converted.  Naturally, we must have an order of priority in this matter.</P>
    <P>Turning to the four exchanges referred to in the Deputy's question, I propose to deal first with Newcastlewest and Rathkeale.  Rathkeale is the critical exchange in so far as the conversion of other exchanges in this area is concerned as trunk calls from other exchanges in the area will be switched at Rathkeale exchange.  Therefore, the other exchanges cannot be converted to automatic working in advance of Rathkeale.</P>
    <P>The position of Rathkeale is that the building required for the automatic exchange was due to be completed in April 1978, not the indefinite period suggested by Deputy O'Brien.  Unfortunately the contract completion date for the building was not met and the work is only now being completed.  The automatic exchange equipment has been on order for quite some time but installation could not begin until the building was completed. Work on installation of the exchange is to begin as soon as the building is available but it is likely to take up to the end of next year before the exchange is ready for service.  When Rathkeale is ready for service the other exchanges mentioned by the Deputy will become automatic at the same time.</P>
    <P>A building is available at Newcastlewest but, as I have said, this exchange cannot be converted to automatic working in advance of Rathkeale.  The installation work there will go ahead in parallel with that of the Rathkeale exchange and both should be converted to automatic working at about the same time, namely, about the end of next year.</P>
    <P>As regards Kilmallock and Kilfinane, <Col N="2038" /> both of these are in the Rath Luirc group and the Rath Luirc exchange will be the automatic trunk switching centre for these exchanges.  Rath Luirc in turn is dependent on Limerick exchange for the routing of much of its onward traffic. The trunk exchange at Limerick needs to be extended.  Work on the building required there is in progress and will, it is expected, be completed about the middle of next year.  The new trunk exchange there is, however, unlikely to be available for service until mid-1982.</P>
    <P>The existing automatic exchange at Rath Luirc has also to be replaced before Kilmallock, Kilfinane and other exchanges in the area can be converted to automatic working.  The building at Rath Luirc is nearing completion and the aim is to have the new exchange ready for service shortly after the Limerick exchange.  Conversion of Kilmallock and Kilfinane will follow this, but because it has not been possible so far to get a suitable site for the exchange building at Kilmallock, we cannot be reasonably assured of this at this stage.  The Deputy may take it, however, that every effort will be made to arrange this.</P>
    <P>Everything possible will be done to give as good a service as possible up to the date of conversion to automatic working, including provision of some additional trunk lines between Newcastlewest and Limerick later this year, with additional switchboards being installed at Rathkeale.  Indeed the Department took exceptional action to give a good service at Newcastlewest and Abbeyfeale by taking over the staffing of these sub-office exchanges.</P>
    <P>There is a very big volume of work to be done in improving and modernising the telephone service, but there are limits to what can be done at any one time. Work must be carried out in a planned, orderly way.  All manual exchanges would be converted to automatic work immediately but that is simply not practicable. More applicants have to be given service and the telephone network must be expanded to enable this to be done. Local cabling and trunk circuits must be increased and exchanges extended or replaced.  It is not possible to hold back all this type of work and to give conversion <Col N="2039" /> of manual exchanges to automatic working overall priority.  There must be a balance between all types of work.</P>
    <P>As Deputies can see, we have a progressive policy in regard to countryside automation.  At the moment, 90 per cent of all subscribers are on automatic exchanges.  I fully appreciate the position of many people who are on manual exchanges and the drawbacks as far as business is concerned, and our policy is to bring all exchanges under the automatic system as soon as possible. We recently announced that we are giving a high priority to the whole telecommunications section and we hope that before long 98 or 99 per cent of subscribers will be on the automatic system.</P>
    <P>With my rural knowledge I have no doubt that the system of manual exchanges is not acceptable because it is not efficient as far as modern industrial organisations are concerned.  They want a quicker service.  We are continuing to pursue the policy I have outlined and we hope that by the end of next year the <Col N="2040" /> County Limerick exchanges will be automatic.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his interest but I would draw his attention once more to the great unrest in Newcastlewest because of the delay. There was a kind of commitment given to that area prior to the last election: they were told that the building would be completed in 1978.  How is it possible that if the premises were completed in 1978 the service could not be provided until the end of 1980?</P>

This amount, in the case of University College, Galway, was £4,710,000 and represented an increase of £218,300 on that for 1978.  Additional income to college over 1978 would also be available from fees.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the situation in relation to the number of students studying the Irish language in University College, Galway, will continue to receive the constant attention of the college authorities in consultation with the Higher Education Authority.</P>
