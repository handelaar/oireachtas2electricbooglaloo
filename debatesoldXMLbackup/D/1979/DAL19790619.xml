    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I saw in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> two or three months ago that the Taoiseach asked the Comhairle Ceanntar of the Fianna Fáil Party in Cork to look into this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but these are not plans.  I asked Comhchomhairle Corcaigh, which is an associate organisation of Fianna Fáil in Cork City, to undertake studies of matters of public importance and concern from time to time.  In fact they conducted such a study in 1972 and invited many press people, journalists and others.  I asked them to take the matter up again.  From time to time there have been suggestions about the setting up of a Press Council supported by journalists.  In the long run I should imagine it would be a matter for the newspaper industry.  It is something <Col N="470" /> which I do not think could be imposed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to discuss the matter with the NUJ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the immediate future.  This Comhchomhairle study will take several weeks perhaps, and ultimately might conclude with a seminar. Unfortunately it has nothing to do with the House.  It is a private matter in effect. It will give me an opportunity of getting an insight into the question in more depth.  If I saw anything coming from that examination, and the possible seminar, I might be motivated to talk to the NUJ about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked referred to the timber processing industries and has nothing at all to do with the furniture industry which would be a separate subject.  I put it to the Minister that there has been a drastic reduction in the numbers involved in the timber processing sector.  I would appreciate it if I could have those figures specifically. There were four such industries two of which have now closed down.  Could I have the specific figures sought in my question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The heading is &ldquo;Wood and Furniture&rdquo; which are part and parcel of the processing of timber.  That is the heading we normally refer to in a case like this.  I have no other heading to refer to in the Statistics Office in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> As Deputies know, I have been in constant communication with the Industrial Relations Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions throughout this dispute in efforts to bring about a resumption of normal work and an end to the hardship being caused to the community and the damage being done to the economy.  In the course of these contacts, congress put forward a number of proposals for a return to work.  On each occasion, I accepted the proposals but, regrettably, the union did not.</P>
    <P>In discussion with congress representatives, I gave the union, through congress, wide-ranging assurances in relation to their various claims, including an assurance that, when negotiations on the pay claims in dispute are resumed, the Department will be prepared to offer an increase of £8.25 a week in the maximum basic pay of the grades concerned. Other assurances included a doubling of service pay, new allowances for unsocial work, and a substantial advance of wages to ease hardship among union members.  I believe that any responsible person would regard the assurances given as very reasonable.  I asked the staff, in the public interest, to return to work and resume negotiations on the basis of these assurances which were given by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as well as by myself.  I regret that that appeal was not responded to.</P>
    <P>Contact with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was resumed last week and is continuing this week.  The House can, of course, be assured that I will do everything possible, as I have done throughout, to bring the dispute to an end on a basis which is both fair to the staff and to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have had no request to meet representatives of the Post Office Workers' Union.  As I have said, contact during the strike has been through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the difference between what he is offering to the Post Office Workers' Union and what it would appear they are looking for from the Minister has been narrowed down to quite a small amount?  Would he agree that it would be in the national interest for the <Col N="473" /> Minister to have a direct meeting with the Post Office Workers' Union instead of having intermediaries involved? Would he agree that that would help to bring about an immediate settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on quite a number of occasions&mdash;and I think the public are very well aware of this&mdash;I am doing my utmost to settle this very difficult problem.  I have been dealing with it through the Industrial Relations Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I believe they are a suitable body to assist the union and myself in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that intensive and active discussions are now taking place between the Minister's Department and the Post Office Workers' Union through the ICTU, does the Minister agree that at this stage it would be extremely unwise for us to make any further comment from this side of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the position with regard to the confidentiality of telephone calls both direct and through the operator system; the statutory regulations, if any, governing the confidentiality of telephone calls; if it is the practice to listen in to calls; and if he will make a comprehensive statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> All telephone calls, whether dialled directly or through an operator, are regarded as confidential by my Department.  Any unauthorised disclosure of information obtained by staff in the course of their work would be an offence under the provisions of the Telegraph Act, 1868, and of the Official Secrets Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a standard part of telephone operating procedures to monitor calls for such purposes as ensuring that connection is established satisfactorily, that conversation is continuing where calls are timed and, in the case of most emergency calls, to verify that the message is transmitted satisfactorily and to help in any way possible.  Departmental operating regulations provide, however, <Col N="475" /> that operators should not listen in unnecessarily to calls and it is one of the duties of supervisors to check that they do not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the regulations which govern the access that operators or anybody else may have to telephone calls?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it an offence for a person to release publicity information gained from a telephone call to which he had listened in?  For one reason or another calls are listened into from time to time and I am wondering to what extenet that liberty can be abused, regardless of it being publicly released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> As I pointed out in the reply, it is necessary at times for operators to assist callers especially in relation to emergency calls.  This is to ensure that calls are properly connected and received.  Of course, it is necessary in the case of a manual exchange for the operator to assist with a call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, though perhaps not deliberately, is evading the issue.  I am not asking whether the operators assist people in regard to connecting calls and so on but in the context of the current dispute it is the practice apparently for operators to listen in to a call for the purpose of ensuring that it is of sufficient importance to warrant direct connection.  To what extent may an operator listen in on an entire call and is such a situation governed sufficiently by the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the type, age, capacity, method of waste disposal and safety precautions obtaining at the nuclear power station at Wylfa in Anglesea, if officials of his Department have visited this station and the procedures established for liaison with public authorities here in the event of an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Nuclear Energy Board, who are my advisers on nuclear energy, that the power station referred to by the Deputy consists of two gas-cooled graphite moderated Magnox reactors, using uranium metal fuel rods contained in magnesium alloy, magnox, cans. These reactors are in commercial operation since November 1971 and January 1972 respectively.  The design capacity of each reactor is 590 MW, giving a maximum station capacity of 1,180 MW.  The current maximum capacity is 990 MW and the station normally operates at a power output between 830 and 990 MW.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spent fuel containing the highly radioactive waste products is, on removal from the reactors, stored at Wylfa for a period normally less than one year and then transferred in specially designed transport casks to the Windscale Works near Seascale in Cumbria <Col N="477" /> for reprocessing.  Low-level solid radioactive wastes produced during the operation of the nuclear power station are processed and normally stored at Wylfa.  As the quantity and radioactive contents are low, storage does not present problems.  Small quantities of low-level gaseous and liquid radioactive effluents are discharged to the atmosphere and the Irish Sea in accordance with authorisations issued by the UK authorities through their licensing and control arrangements.  The quantities so discharged are very low and not of significance.</P>
    <P>All nuclear activities in the United Kingdom are subject to strict statutory safety controls.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Nuclear Energy Board have visited the Wylfa nuclear power station and are familiar with its operating and safety procedures.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that the probability of an incident at this power station which would represent a hazard to this country is remote and that it is not necessary to develop special precautions here.  Close co-operation and liaison with the relevant UK regulatory agencies is maintained by the board and contact is maintained with the UK authorities to ensure that we are kept fully informed of nuclear incidents at this or other stations in the UK.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this station is only 60 miles from Dublin which is the centre with the highest population in the country?

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

The Nuclear Energy Board have visited the station and have visited some of the other numerous UK nuclear stations and are satisfied regarding the level of controls that are exercised by the UK authorities. They are satisfied, too, with the level of co-operation from the UK authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>On the general issue, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 8 February 1979 to a similar question from him on this subject.  I informed the Deputy on that occasion that the Industrial Development Authority had agreed a development policy and grant criteria for the sawmilling sector of the timber processing industry.  The authority have to date approved grant assistance for projects with an investment in fixed assets amounting to approximately £2.9 million. These projects are expected to generate 257 jobs.</P>
      <P>The section of the study of the timber processing industry dealing with pulpwood products has since been completed and is being considered with a view to identifying how the maximum return can be obtained from our timber resources.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the cost of setting up a chemical pulp mill would depend on the capacity of the mill and the availability of adequate supplies of pulpwood.  Information available to the IDA suggests that the cost of setting up a modern commercially viable chemical pulp plant would be about £150 million. The pulpwood requirements of such a plant would be much greater than the present supply of pulpwood in this country.</P>

They tell me that <Col N="482" /> timber is literally rotting in the majority of those forests due to a lack of outlets. The sawmilling sector, which has been referred to by the Minister, is not capable of absorbing this surplus.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most useful things which could be done would be to revitalise the chipboard industry, which is one of the major users of the type of timber, which the Deputy refers to.  After many long months of negotiation at my instance the IDA finally agreed with a major Irish company, which are of considerable financial and management standing, to take over the two chipboard factories in this country, one of which was closed down and the other which had encountered some difficulties.  When the Government had approved of the package concerned and when all the details had been finalised, the company concerned found themselves confronted by a picket of a relatively small number of people in the Munster Chipboard factory in Waterford.  Those picketers were in no way, nor did they claim to be, in dispute with the company which were taking over this and the other factory. Notwithstanding the fact that there is no dispute and that their demands were quite unreasonable, the picket has persisted with the result that the company concerned have had no option but to withdraw from their proposed takeover. This has placed several hundred jobs in immediate jeopardy.  Jobs will be permanently lost, which could otherwise be created now or maintained.  I deplore very strongly the attitude of the handful of people concerned and their two unions, who appear to be supporting them in this.  I ask those concerned and their two unions whether or not they are interested in the creation and maintenance of employment in this country and in the utilisation of our surplus thinnings, to which the Deputy has referred.  It seems to me that their actions are only compatible with the actions <Col N="483" /> of people who are not interested in the maintenance and creation of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Minister's please to the people concerned. Has he any practical alternatives for getting rid of this surplus?  If he is not going to set up a chemical pulp mill he obviously must expand the chipboard industry on a major scale.  Have the Minister's Department any definite plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the chipboard industry could be got going again on the great basis on which this Irish company are prepared to get it going again it would take up a great deal of those surplus thinnings.  That would be an excellent start.  The IDA are actively studying certain other areas in which that type of timber might be used.  The difficulty which they face at present is that the market in Europe generally for the sort of products that are made from this type of timber is extremely bad: the prices are very low, it is subject to dumping, and it is subject to subsidies from certain Governments.  It is difficult at the moment <Col N="484" /> to operate this type of industry viably.  That is why it is doubly tragic that an Irish company of considerable standing who are prepared to take on this difficult task should meet with such opposition from two small, English-based unions.</P>

      <P>I sympathise very much with those people who may be affected by the malfunctioning particularly at night of intruder alarm systems.  However, the prevention of such difficulties is essentially a matter for subscribers to the alarm systems and the companies which provide and instal them.  The installation and maintenance of such systems are not, so far as my responsibilities are concerned, the subject of any regulations having the force of law.</P>
      <P>Intruder alarm systems are, however, the subject of an Irish standard specification (I.S. 199: 1978) published in 1978 by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  This specification, which is a voluntary one, was prepared at the request of those involved in the supply and installation of intruder systems and with the interests of the subscriber, the gardaí and the insurance industry also in mind.</P>
      <P>The standard covers the construction, installation, operation and maintenance of intruder alarm systems with a view to improving their reliability and minimising the number of false alarms.  The standard is accordingly intended to meet the situation described in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand what the Minister means when he said that the specifications he referred to are designed to meet the point of the question.  Is the Minister aware that over half the calls brought about by these burglar alarm systems are false alarms <Col N="488" /> of some kind or another?  Would the Minister be good enough to make representations to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, or indeed make an order himself, to ensure that people would not have to put up with alarms ringing all night, particularly in dense urban centres where there may be a small residential population, where it may not be possible to contact the owners of the shops until next morning, and where I am assured this is a real nuisance because presently there is no protection of any kind for these people who must listen to this ringing night after night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the percentage of false alarms mentioned by the Deputy.  With regard to the question of interference caused by the malfunctioning, as I have already said, I sympathise with the Deputy and the many people involved.  However, the specification brought in was done at the request of the industry.  It was prepared with the industry, with the interests of the subscribers, the alarm company, the Garda and the insurance industry being borne in mind.  The specification was drawn up using a corresponding British one.  Part of the specification points out that no system, however well designed or maintained, can be completely reliable.  I regret the interference caused.</P>
      <P>As far as making it a mandatory standard&mdash;it is a voluntary standard&mdash;the relevant section of the Act which gives powers to prescribe mandatory standards relates only to the safe use of products by the public.  Consequently, it is not within our power to make it a mandatory standard.  But, even if we did, it is impossible to devise any system, however well-designed and maintained, which is completely reliable or tamper-proof.</P>

But would the Minister consider at further length the suggestion I outlined in the question, which is simply that there would be a technical limit to the time for which the alarm would actually ring, which would mean at least that after 15 minutes or so the ringing <Col N="489" /> would cease?  Would the Minister accept that that is technically possible and that, if I have his sympathy on this question, presumably he would be willing to consider the point at further length in view of the real nuisance being caused regularly to people with young children and so on who cannot sleep night after night in some city streets because of the bells ringing?</P>

      <P>Arrangements had been made with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry earlier this year for the deployment of naval vessels to assist on salmon fisheries protection work.  It was arranged that the naval vessel involved would have a garda sergeant and a fishery inspector aboard at all times.  The area being patrolled in the period 14 May 1979 to 31 May 1979, was the west Cork/Kerry/Shannon mouth area.</P>
      <P>At 19.46 on 30 May 1979, the naval vessel on patrol the <i>LE Gráinne</i>, entered Smerwick Harbour, in company with the motor vessel <i>Thomond</i>, a vessel manned by fishery conservators.  A large force of gardaí were present on land.  A search for illegal nets was carried out but only one was located.  This was aboard a boat at anchor.  This net was seized and taken aboard the <i>Thomond.</i></P>
      <P>While the raid was in progress several large groups of local people gathered at Ballynagall Pier nearby, and local boats stayed close to the <i>Thomond</i> during the search.  At 21.30 when the net was being transferred from the <i>Thomond</i> to <i>LE Gráinne</i>, two local vessels actively tried to prevent the transfer by ramming the <i>Thomond</i> and attempted to pull her away from <i>LE Gráinne</i>.  Eventually one vessel was close alongside the <i>Thomond</i> and the other vessel tried to wedge herself between <i>Thomond</i> and <i>Gráinne.</i> This vessel by pinning a bight of the net on to her forward bitts and by going full astern was able to pull the net from both <i>Thomond</i> and <i>Gráinne</i>.  The net had to be cut several times to prevent personnel being dragged over the gunwale or the net being pulled under the stern and fouling screws and rudders.</P>
      <P>By 21.45 is appeared that <i>Thomond</i> might be overwhelmed and the net seized by the local fishermen.  As the ship and the forces on board were endangered by the local fishermen's action a round of 7.62 ball was fired in the air as a warning. Eventually half the net was taken on board <i>Gráinne</i>, the other half was recovered by the locals.  <i>Thomond</i> and <i>Gráinne</i> then proceeded towards the mouth of the harbour, accompanied by several local boats.</P>

      <P>Since the publication of the White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo; in January, both external and domestic developments have made the attainment of the target of an annualised rate of inflation of 5 per cent by the last quarter more difficult.  However, given the appropriate response from all sections of the community to our present difficulties, it is still possible to achieve an annualised 6 per cent rate for the last three months of 1979.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been taking a number of actions designed to bring about that appropriate response.  We spent several months negotiating a complex set of proposals which took the form of a proposed national understanding. Unhappily they were rejected by the trade union movement.  In the wake of that rejection, as the Deputy knows, the Government have now put forward an interim pay guideline designed to provide an increase to meet any change in the cost of living to protect living standards in the next six months.  It is hoped that that breathing space or pause would enable trade unions, employers and the Government to come together to achieve some appropriate understanding as a response to our present economic difficulties.</P>

      <P>With the indulgence of the Chair, since the Deputy was permitted to get his remarks on the record I should like to be given the opportunity of replying.  I do not accept that it is bogus to use quarterly figures as indicators of trends.  On the contrary, it can be very important to use interim figures whether they are monthly or quarterly so that we can know as quickly as possible the direction in which we are moving.  I would hate to think that we would condemn ourselves to inappropriate and unnecessarily high projections of price and, consequently, wage increases just because people were using historical information that was out of date.  In other words, it is possible to have very high price rises in the early months of the year and then have much lower price rises in the later months. Surely, it is important to know that the trend is down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, after &ldquo;day&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that nothing in this section shall operate so as to validate any necessary proofs in a criminal trial&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By this I mean that nothing in section 1 shall validate restrospectively any proofs in a criminal trial.  I have been concerned about this section since it was introduced. I have explained as fully as possible that it is an omnibus section, a very far-reaching section, notwithstanding the fact that the Bill is a one-section Bill.  It was introduced by the Minister as such; in fact, he was optimistic enough to think that he could get all sections after a few hours debate on the day he moved Second Stage and he seemed to be somewhat irritated and annoyed when we sought a Committee Stage debate one week later.  We were quite justified in doing this and we would have been guilty of a dereliction of duty if we had not done so.  Events have proved we were right to seek a Committee Stage and a Report Stage debate because after the debate on Committee Stage we find that the Minister himself felt obliged to introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  That shows the inadvisability of rushing legislation through this House.  I will go further and say that probably the most deceptive type of Bill is that introduced as a one-section Bill, especially when that one section is quite long and when it contains much complicated legal phraseology that is foreign <Col N="526" /> and strange to most people.  That is the position here.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned about this Bill since it was introduced because I fear the effect is to validate retrospectively a whole series of things done by Mr. McLaughlin while he was not legally appointed as Commissioner of the Garda Siochána.  I am particularly concerned about the question of providing proofs in criminal prosecutions, either directly or indirectly.  I believe that if the files were inspected it would be found that during the period when Mr. McLaughlin was not properly appointed he exercised statutory duties in providing proofs in criminal prosecutions, either directly himself on through persons to whom he had sought to delegate authority which he himself did not possess.</P>
    <P>The objective of my amendment is to write into the Bill the following words, &ldquo;provided that nothing in this section shall operate so as to validate any necessary proofs in a criminal trial&rdquo;.  Unlike my learned colleague on my right I am not a constitutional lawyer but I believe that any attempt to so validate retrospectively proofs in a criminal action would be unconstitutional.  I may be wrong in that, but whether such retrospective validation of proofs in a criminal action would be unconstitutional or not I do not think this House should be a party to giving that power to the Government and should not be a party to passing that kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that amendment No. 3 in the name of the Minister seeks to provide that we will not do anything that is not constitutional.  All I have to say in regard to that is thank you for nothing. In this House we cannot do something that is contrary to the Constitution.  If a law is contrary to the Constitution it can be set aside by the High Court or the Supreme Court but somebody would be put to the trouble of taking a case to the High Court or to the Supreme Court if he was aware of his rights.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Kelly is more or less on the same lines&mdash;I am subject to correction on this.  My amendment is clear-cut.  It merely says that we are not seeking to <Col N="527" /> validate retrospectively proofs in a criminal prosecution.  A person should be convicted of an offence only if it was an offence on the date that he did the act that gave rise to the alleged offence.  In my opinion he should be convicted only on evidence that was given in accordance with the law on the date of his trial or even on the date on which the offence was committed.  He should be convicted of an offence only on evidence that was valid and legal on the date the offence was committed.</P>
    <P>In putting forward that argument and in seeking to establish it, I am not alone protecting the people who may have been wrongfully committed between January 1978 and May 1979 but I am seeking to establish for all time that it is wrong for this House to pass that kind of legislation.  I am seeking to prevent this House setting a dangerous precedent, the precedent of making good retrospective evidence that was bad when it was given.  I hope I am making myself clear on that point.  That is why I am so concerned about this measure.  It could and might be held as a precedent in the future for taking further dangerous steps and for establishing dangerous law.  I am very much against that.  Since I read this section I have been concerned about this.  I am putting it to the Minister, even at this late stage, that he should not seek to validate bad evidence that would have been thrown out if the court had been aware that Mr. McLaughlin was not Commissioner of the Garda Síochána when he provided the evidence either directly under his own signature or indirectly through somebody he appointed in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>That is the case I am making.  It may be that what I am saying might have what the Minister would consider serious consequences for his Department or for the country even in giving people a way out, in giving people a defence they did not think they had.  I appeal to the Minister on the basis that hard cases make bad law and hard cases establish dangerous precedents to accept this amendment.  I do not think we should establish <Col N="528" /> those precedents or that we should pass this section as it now stands. I should not like in years to come, when perhaps this House is populated by different people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The only virtue in this might be that in the future it would be a warning against giving any party a majority of 20.  It might be pointed out that not alone did the Government which set up this dangerous precedent have a mandate from the people but that they had the greatest majority any Government ever had since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I am very serious about this amendment. I did not put it forward lightly.  I feel very strongly about it.  I feel that what the Minister is doing is wrong.  He appears to find himself in a difficulty and he is trying to get out of that difficulty and close all the gaps that the irregular appointment of Mr. McLaughlin opened. I appeal to him not to do that.  It may be bad enough to validate appointments and have people believing that, if Mr. McLaughlin had not been appointed, someone would have been promoted or somebody else would not have been demoted or dismissed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I know it does not call for a lengthy debate but what I am saying is that that is bad enough, but to go further and say that someone may have to do a <Col N="529" /> long stretch in prison he would not otherwise have to do if this Bill were not passed and the faulty proofs were not cured retrospectively is going too far and is an embarrassment.  As far as I know, this is going a step further in setting a dangerous precedent.  I am not aware that crimes were created retrospectively or that faulty proofs were cured retrospectively since the foundation of the State and, if they were, I would be glad to hear about them.</P>
      <P>That is a valid argument which, from my way of looking at it, is unanswerable. The Minister would not have been prepared to bring in a Bill, writing into it in black and white that, among other things, it proposed to validate these proofs retrospectively.  If he had there would have been an outcry from the media and from many other people. That is what I think is tucked away in the language in this section.  I am trying to sort it out and tell the House what we are doing.  I implore the Minister not to go on with this.</P>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister saying that if a person was convicted on bad evidence he has his rights.  The time for appeal may have passed.  I suppose he could apply for an extension of the time to appeal, but that means he must know his rights and be prepared to pay a lawyer or, if he cannot pay for a lawyer, get free legal aid to bring the matter to court.  In my view the citizen should not be put to that trouble if the Executive made a mistake.  If the Executive made a mistake they should own up to it and issue free pardons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for his contribution. He has been consistent in the points he has been making in this area since the Second Stage, but we will have to agree to disagree about this amendment which is totally unacceptable as far as I am concerned.  It is not that I consider the matter is of any great practical significance but I do not believe there are many cases in which the issue will arise in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Fitzpatrick made great play of the fact that all we had to do was have a check carried out of all the files in my Department <Col N="530" /> or in Garda Headquarters to ascertain in which cases Mr. McLaughlin had done anything in regard to prosecutions in the courts which may have led to the conviction of any person.  The fact is that there are no such files in my Department which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick must be aware, does not deal with criminal prosecutions.  Neither, in the majority of cases, does the Commissioner or any other officer in Garda Headquarters deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should know that prosecutions are initiated at the behest of members of the force all over the country who, where necessary, work to the local State Solicitor and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is no way in which we can select a few files, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has been implying, and ascertain the information he wants us to extract.  Indeed, even if one were to go through an indeterminate number of files it would not be possible for the gardaí to determine in what, if any, cases an issue of validity of proofs arose in a serious way.  That is the reality irrespective of what Deputy Fitzpatrick asserts to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Having made that point, I now want to stress that whether there are two or 20 or 100 cases, the principle, as far as I am concerned, is the same and that is that subject to the protection of people's constitutional rights&mdash;and those rights cannot be taken away irrespective of the majority any party might have in Government&mdash;convicted criminals should not be allowed to evade the consequences of their guilt on what the overwhelming majority of the public would rightly recognise as a totally unmeritorious defence.  Criminals sometimes escape justice on unmeritorious technical defences and that is unavoidable, but that is no reason why we, as legislators, should go out of our way to make an exception in this Bill for the purpose of preserving an unmeritorious technical defence.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what is involved in the Deputy's amendment let me point out that, even if there would be abundant evidence to prove that a person had committed the crime with which he was charged, and even though he may have <Col N="531" /> been caught in the act, the intention of the amendment is that he would be allowed to go free because its whole object is to provide that the prosecution would be precluded from relying on the Bill when enacted to validate any administrative or purely technical step taken in the proceedings.  The amendment is so framed that it applies to every crime no matter how serious and, in addition, the words &ldquo;any necessary proofs&rdquo; are so broad and are so imprecise that it would be quite impossible to say what aspects of the prosecution's case were covered by them and what were not, since in a criminal case every portion of the prosecution's case must be susceptible of proof and I am satisfied, without any doubt, that this amendment would represent bad policy.  I am sorry to have to say to the Deputy that I must totally oppose it for the reasons given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not intend to take up much more of the time of the House because it is apparent to me that the Minister is determined to put this Bill through and enact it as it stands subject to the cosmetic effect of the next amendment. The Minister has said that he is satisfied that there are not many of the cases that I have been talking about in practice.  That means that there are some such cases.  He says that there are no such files in his Department.  Of course there are such files in the commissioner's office; of course there are such files in the office of the Director of public Prosecutions, and I am sure the head of police or his deputy do not lightly sign their names to these all-important documents without some record being kept of them.  I do not accept the Minister's approach to this.  I will still believe that a person can be convicted of an offence and deprived of his liberty only in accordance <Col N="532" /> with the law as it then was and not as this House wants to make it months, or perhaps years, afterwards.</P>
      <P>But the most alarming part of the Minister's recent contribution is his reference to a totally unmeritorious defence.  Who is the Minister to decide what is a totally unmeritorious defence? Once we start using that sort of language and once we start tinkering about with the law we are opening the way to some other Minister considering in years to come that something else is a totally unmeritorious defence.  I am not, I hope, being extravagant when I say that that type of language smacks of the police state; it smacks of having no regard for the rights of the individual; it smacks of saying that if we know that such a person is guilty and we know that he did it, then we have to put him behind bars even if we have to take some short cuts in the process.  That is the danger I see and that is the danger that I have feared since I took up the stance that I have taken up on this Bill in this section. If I wanted corroboration and if I wanted backing, I would not have to read in books and I would not have to search law reports and I would not have to consult my learned colleagues in the law library; I would be satisfied when I heard the Minister coming in here and talking about a totally unmeritorious defence.  For the Minister to say that something is a totally unmeritorious defence means that he or the executive decide whether an accused person is guilty or not and it is the next step to say that if we are satisfied that a person is guilty we get him.  I am appalled at this approach.  I feel that I have done all that I can do to resist this and I am going to oppose it to the end by voting on it because I feel so strongly about it.</P>

      <P>In page 2, after line 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) If, because of any validation expressed to be effected by subsection (1) of this section, that subsection would, but for this subsection, conflict with a constitutional right of any person, the validation shall be subject to such limitation as is necessary to secure that it does not so conflict but shall be otherwise of full force and effect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the debate that took place on Committee Stage of the Bill.  Deputies who were here on Second Reading and Committee Stage will recall that Deputy Kelly put forward legal argument in favour of the proposition that an amendment was necessary and he put down an amendment on Committee Stage.  I said then that there was no disagreement between Deputy Kelly and myself about the underlying principle.  What was at issue was the <Col N="535" /> purely legal question whether on the one hand, it was necessary or desirable to say something explicitly in the Bill &mdash;which is what Deputy Kelly argued for&mdash;or whether, on the other hand, the point was already covered clearly, even though only implicitly, and whether spelling it out would be not only unnecessary but positively undesirable because of the effect it might have on the drafting or interpreting of other legislation.</P>
    <P>This is one of those situations where if an amendment is unnecessary it is also undesirable because of the possible consequences on other legislation.  The law officers who had considered the point in the context of the Deputy's amendment on Committee Stage had expressed the view that such an amendment was unnecessary and therefore undesirable.  On the basis of that advice I opposed such an amendment on the last occasion. However, since it was clear that Deputy Kelly was putting forward a serious legal argument to the contrary, I undertook to bring that argument to the notice of the law officers again.</P>
    <P>It will be apparent from the fact that I have moved this amendment now that the law officers accept that there is force in the arguments adduced by Deputy Kelly and they have now advised in favour of an amendment.  I hope it will not sound in any way ungracious to the Deputy&mdash;and certainly it is not intended to be&mdash;if I say that my understanding is that it is still considered that a valid argument could be made against having an amendment but it is accepted that the contrary argument is strong and that the balance comes down in favour of an amendment.  I could perhaps leave it at that on the basis that what is stated in this House is not, in any event, evidence that may be produced in court in any argument about the interpretation of this Bill, and that to say any more is just delaying the House.  However, there is a possibility that some question may arise at a future date in this House on another Bill and, if only for that reason, I think it right to make a few further comments.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it is accepted as far as I am concerned that there could be no question of adopting a principle in the <Col N="536" /> drafting of Bills of simply setting out a basic provision in a stark form on the basis that it could be left to the courts to add any necessary procedural or other safeguard.  On the last day Deputy Kelly took it that I was by implication defending that kind of general approach. That was not my intention.  My argument was not on the merits of spelling out or not spelling out specific procedural or other safeguards in legislation. We are not dealing here with specific safeguards but only with a generalised reference to constitutional rights.  Whether such a reference is made or left to be inferred, it remains a very general reference that can be interpreted only by the courts, and that, of course, is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the question whether the reference to constitutional rights ought to be included or omitted is really what can fairly be called a very technical one. Having said that, I must also say and emphasise that, though it may be a very technical question, it is an important one since it could affect the validity of the Bill itself.  For that reason I would like to place on record my appreciation of the contribution made by Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <P>The question remains whether, by making such an amendment, the House would be creating serious difficulties in relation to other legislation.  On reconsideration, I believe that in this instance the answer is, &ldquo;No, some difficulties, perhaps, but not serious ones.&rdquo;  I say this on the basis that validating statutes as a class can fairly be said to be unique. Such statutes are retrospective legislation and that distinguishes them from all other Bills in relation to the issue we are now discussing.  I am prepared to accept that the amendment I am proposing could well set a precedent if it should ever be necessary to have any form of validating statute in the future.  Fortunately, validating statutes are few and far between and we need not worry about it.</P>
    <P>One final point is to answer the question as to why I put down this amendment rather than accept the amendment put down by Deputy Kelly.  The answer is that, from a technical standpoint, the amendment I have put down is considered <Col N="537" /> preferable.  In effect, the issue is that if there is a clash between a purported validation and the constitutional right of any person, then to that extent the purported validation cannot operate. This is common ground and is the case whether we have an amendment or not. In that event the ineffectiveness of the purported validation does not arise from any claim made; it arises from the existence of the constitutional right and must extend as far as that right.  Strictly speaking, Deputy Kelly's amendment, if he will forgive me for saying it, is slightly narrow, perhaps too narrow, because under it the ineffectiveness of the validation is made to depend on there being legal proceedings in the course of which certain matters would have to be alleged as being material to the case being made. In practice that reflects what would happen if the matter were raised at all, but theoretically it is the constitutional right itself that is the relevant factor rather than the plaintiff's claim that the right exists or the particular form of pleading used by the plaintiff.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has put down an amendment designed to meet the point I was making.  I appreciate very much his taking what I had to say so seriously and getting his advisers to do the same.  I appreciate also what he says about my amendment being a bit narrow.  It is true that it does depend on litigation being started by somebody, whereas the Minister's amendment does not, although, of course, it cannot be seen to what extent the Minister's amendment will have any concrete effect unless and until litigation begins.  However, I appreciate that it meets the same point and I am grateful to the Minister for accepting a suggestion from this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not deal as ingenuously and fairly as he might have with Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment and it would have been a good deal easier had the Minister allowed the House to produce a fairly concise list of instances in which it might be said that a conviction was at risk because of the chain of legality attaching to the proof.  I sympathise strongly with Deputy Fitzpatrick's point and consider that the <Col N="538" /> Minister did not meet it entirely fairly, but the Minister's amendment will go a long distance towards meeting even Deputy Fitzpatrick's point.  My amendment would have done so also.  To the extent that anybody may wish to complain that his conviction has been secured, say, by a confession which was taken from him while he was unlawfully in custody, the unlawfulness of his custody resulting from a flaw in the chain of authority by which the custody was perhaps extended by another 24 hours or something like that, the courts would not necessarily be prepared to entertain it.  Even if they were prepared to entertain the idea that confession ought to have been omitted because of the illegal custody, the prisoner's point would be essentially a constitutional one and the right which would have been infringed by his unlawful custody would have been essentially a constitutional right.  The Minister's amendment is designed to save that right.  While the prisoner's case might not be all that strong, as in the case I have outlined, the Minister's argument would preserve that right for him.  It should have been possible for the Minister without envisaging hundreds or thousands of files to discover just which conviction might be at risk in consequence of a challenge arising through a suspect validating statute.  The Minister's amendment goes a very long way and I appreciate its introduction.  I beg leave to withdraw my amendment No. 4.</P>

In contrast to the previous amendment to which Deputy Kelly referred&mdash;amendment No. 2&mdash;which deliberately set out to allow people convicted in a court of law to escape the consequences of their crime by allowing them to rely on issues unrelated to the evidence that they were guilty, the present amendment deals with constitutional rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to provide for an increase from nine to 12 in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the High Court.  Section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, provides <i>inter alia</i> that, in certain circumstances, the number of High Court judges shall be one more but, since no High Court judge is currently a member of the Law Reform Commission the provisions of the section do not affect the High Court at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for additional judges of the High Court, as provided for in section 1 of the Bill, arises from the increased volume of business coming before that court in recent years, coupled with the fact that the full time of one judge has been for some time, and still is, taken up with sittings of the Special Criminal Court.  Up to January 1977 the Presidency of the Special Criminal Court had been filled by a retired judge of the High Court but he <Col N="540" /> was then appointed Chairman of An Bord Pleanála and, in order to ensure that there would at all times be a High Court judge available to act as President of the Special Criminal Court, it became necessary to appoint four High Court judges to be members of that court.  As a result the High Court has been deprived of the full time of one judge, while the time of another judge is now fully taken up by family law business which has grown substantially over the past three years and which, because of its personal nature, needs to be disposed of with the minimum delay.  The increase of two in the number of High Court judges provided by the Courts Act, 1977 has thus been absorbed and the court has not been able to reduce either its arrears of business or the average time-lag between the date of setting down of a case and the date of hearing, which, in the case of jury actions, had grown from seven and a half months in 1977 to ten months on 6 April 1979, the end of the Hilary law term.</P>
    <P>The annual number of jury actions set down for hearing in the High Court has risen from 863 in 1972 to 1,861 in 1978 and, despite the fact that 1,555 cases were disposed of in 1978, which is the highest number disposed of by the High Court in any one year, arrears continue to accumulate and a serious position now exists.  The situation has been aggravated by the assignment of Judge Costello to conduct the Bantry Bay disaster inquiry, which is likely to deprive the High Court of his services for many months.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, vitally important that additional High Court judges be appointed without delay, otherwise a situation will arise in which the arrears of business and the time-lag between the dates of setting down and of hearing of cases will increase further and result in a situation which the existing complement of judges will be unable to retrieve.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is, accordingly, an important one from the point of view of the proper administration of justice and I recommend it to Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill is in a <Col N="541" /> line of similar Bills with similar titles, I believe the title is a misnomer.  It has very little to do with the courts and a great deal to do with a number of judges in the High Court.  I particularly regret that there was not an explanatory memorandum of some kind with the Bill, although I appreciate that the Bill is very short.  Neverthless we should establish that legislation to do with the administration of justice is not merely a matter for discussion among technicians and lawyers.  Law is about people and members of the public who wish to obtain a copy of this legislation should be facilitated to the maximum degree rather than implicity discouraged.  There should be an explanatory memorandum explaining how the court process works, why it is necessary to increase the number of judges and the action being taken to achieve that outcome. Whenever possible this type of legislation should be accompanied by an adequate explanation, not just for the lawyer but also for the layman who wants to take an interest and desires to know the implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is essentially an administrative matter and I cannot understand why it is necessary to introduce a Bill whenever there is a need to increase the number of judges.  Parliamentary time is already stretched and it could arguably be stated that the whole system is falling behind in coping with the demands of the age in relation to the introduction of legislation and the review of existing legislation. Although one would not wish to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the Government to increase the number of judges in the High Court without limitation, surely they should have sufficient responsibility to be able to increase the number of judges by one, two or three within a given period, without having to drag a Bill into the Chamber and have a reasonably lengthy discussion on it.  Perhaps it is time for the Minister and the Government to have a look at this and allow themselves some flexibility, without creating a situation in which they could double the number of High Court judges and select them in one &ldquo;go&rdquo; which obviously would be fraught with some danger.  When we are increasing the number of High Court judges by one or <Col N="542" /> two, I doubt the need for legislation such as this.  I should like to think this will be the last time we will have to spend parliamentary time in this way.</P>
    <P>In a sense it is a sad symbol of the age that we need to increase the number of High Court judges, or the number of judges generally.  I would not like to take it too literally, but it could be interpreted as an indication that crime and the work to be dealt with by the courts are on the increase.  I should like to think we could look forward to a time when we might be able to cut down on the number of judges in the High Court and the other courts, not for administrative reasons but because the number of crimes will have fallen.  May be that is a naïve hope, but we have a duty to be optimistic.  We must have the best motivation for running our society in the future.  In our community crime is on the increase.  In this case we are responding by increasing the number of High Court judges.  We should examine the root cause of that at some stage.</P>
    <P>There could be a problem if the number of High Court judges were increased without the necessary increase in staff such as court registrars and other staff servicing such judges.  I understand that until recently, and perhaps even at present, one High Court judge was sent home regularly, so to speak, because he could not be serviced due to the lack of registrars.  When the Minister is concluding perhaps he will let us know whether the conditions under which the judges are operating are adequate. It is regrettable that the Government did not take this opportunity to be more fundamentalist and radical in their approach to the question of courts.</P>
    <P>The title of this Bill is Courts Bill. Therefore it would not be unreasonable to presume that the Government might have included some reference to other reforms which are desirable and necessary. Essentially this Bill is not about the courts but about judges.  Therefore the title is misleading.  There are many reforms which are worthy of consideration and which would be timely in terms of a Dáil discussion.  To the best of my knowledge there has not been any recent discussions along those lines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> I am also concerned to note that civil jury trials are no longer occurring due to the industrial dispute affecting the post.  I am not sure what effect this is having on the courts system and in the High Court. On the basis that justice delayed is justice denied I should like to see the Department of Justice exercising their muscle in the other Departments to find a solution to that problem.  It is intolerable in the long term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point and I do not wish to dwell on it.  Surely one of the reasons for the need to increase the number of High Court judges is the extra burden of work and administration. I wonder what the implications of the dispute are at that level.  I have made the point and I should like to think it has been noted.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other ways in which it might be possible to re-organise and streamline the High Court which might offset to some extent the need to respond by simplistically upping the number of High Court judges.  I should like to ask the rhetorical question whether the courts work hard enough and put in enough hours of work.  I appreciate that, as in the case of parliamentarians, it would be wrong to believe that High Court judges work only those hours during which the courts are open. Have any permutations been considered, because a variation in the number of opening hours might offset the need for an increase in the numbers of judges? An arrangement about increased jurisdiction for the Circuit Court dealing with fines and so on might lead to a diminution in the workload at High Court level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of some fines may have been set 18 or 20 years ago and this may mean a disproportionate workload is falling on the High Court in the settlement of cases which could validly and reasonably be dealt with by a lower court.  The argument behind that would <Col N="544" /> probably point to some kind of index-linking or regular review of the levels of fines in so far as one is willing to accept the idea of a monetary fine as being a just imposition.  What I am really saying is that the jurisdiction of the lower courts could be extended and therefore the High Court might not have to be the subject of this type of Bill which crops up now and again.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any other proposals for reform of the High Court or the courts generally?  Can any of the reports of the Law Reform Commission be expected to find a response at Government level in the near future?  It would be far more useful to the Dáil, and more constructive and publicly advantageous, if we had comprehensive legislation making a fundamental review of the courts and the High Court rather than having a very slim and essentially administrative Bill such as the Courts Bill, 1979.</P>
    <P>There is no essential objection to the Minister's proposal.  Whether it is the right response, whether it is a very superficial response, whether a far more comprehensive Bill should be introduced, whether it goes far enough in its immediate response to the situation, are all matters for debate and argument. I should prefer to have more weighty legislation setting out more fundamental issues so that we could spend parliamentary time in the most useful fashion possible. In deference to those of us who are not of the legal fraternity but who nevertheless have a full and equal right to a full knowledge of all the implications of this type of legislation, the explanatory memorandum should be made available as widely as possible. Otherwise we run the risk of creating a Department of Law rather than a Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I wish to keep our options open regarding possible amendments at a later Stage of the Bill, but there will not be any essential objection from us to the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill on behalf of my party.  During the past year we have been alarmed about the inordinate delays in the disposal of cases before the High Court, delays that are <Col N="545" /> due to circumstances which by and large are outside the responsibility either of the Court or of the Government.  This situation has been developing for longer than a year.  In recent years we have witnessed the emerging of the pattern whereby the services of High Court judges have been availed of in increasing measure for what one might refer to as extra-curricular activities but activities that are in the public interest, whether they relate to the Special Criminal Court, to the Law Reform Commission, to the Special Tribunals of Inquiry, to the Criminal Court or to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Likewise we have been pleased to note that the High Court has become more involved in the extremely complex and time-consuming area of family law litigation. This development has been inevitable. It is to be welcomed, but it puts a substantial workload on the High Court judges, whose workload anyway has been very substantial in recent years. For the most part, without commenting on the various judgments given, the judges have been subject to much pressure in relation to case work.  There is nothing more disastrous in terms of fatigue and of pressure generally than to have a substantial backlog of work, but this situation is frustrating too for the litigants.  Therefore, in the interest of democracy and of the discharging of the role of the High Court in our legal system we welcome the proposals in this Bill.  Presumably in due course the emoluments of High Court judges will be increased, but that would be a matter that would come within the ambit of the Devlin review later this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have been concerned greatly with the extreme timelag between the setting down of cases and the dates of hearing.  It would be highly dangerous not to rectify that situation because to allow it to continue would be to allow the legal system to be brought <Col N="546" /> into disrepute.  Personally I have some strong views regarding the performance of the legal system as a whole <i>vis-à-vis</i> the courts system, the role of the family law courts and the role of barristers and solicitors, but it is not my intention to air those views now except to say that in this whole area there is a need for massive reform.  Perhaps some time we may have a Minister for Justice who will be prepared to come to grips with the serious anomalies in our legal system especially in relation to the presentation of cases and in relation to the role of barristers and solicitors, many of whom become High Court judges ultimately. But that is a matter which could provide us with a substantial debate here.  With that reservation I welcome the decision of the Government to improve the administration of the High Court so that cases may be expendited, because there is nothing worse for litigants or for democracy than to have a situation of inordinate delays in the disposal of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I, too, welcome this Bill because I am confident that it will lead to a more expeditious discharge of business in the High Court.  It is obvious from the Minister's brief that the High Court has fallen into arrears, especially in relation to jury actions.  It takes almost 12 months from the date on which an action is set down until its hearing.  One would expect, for a number of reasons, the volume of work in the High Court to have increased.  First, Statutes passed by the last administration providing rights in the family and updating family law have led to one judge being occupied almost full time on this branch of the law.  That shows how much needed were the reforms put through by the previous Government. Secondly, there has been an enormous increase in the number of cars on the roads and we are told that there has been an increase between 1972 and 1978 of more than 1,000 jury actions per year.  If the Minister's brief is correct, that increase is attributable for the most part to the increase in the number of running-down accidents.  We know, too, that money is not as valuable as it used <Col N="547" /> to be and that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court at £2,000, a sum that was considered to be substantial in terms of awards for damages when it was introduced, represents no more now than what would be a decent garage bill, not to mention a bill for personal injuries. Therefore it is not surprising that the volume of work in the High Court has increased substantially and that the Government should seek to appoint more judges.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the policy was to appoint the minimum number of judges, but that approach was wrong.  The expeditious disposal of people's business in the High Court and the elimination of delays are much more important than the increased salaries involved in the appointment of further judges.  Delays in court cases bring the law into disrepute and lead to unnecessary frustration among the general public.  I am not suggesting for a moment that all the delays occur in the courts.  There are delays all along the line&mdash;in solicitors' offices, in the Bar Library and in receiving reports from expert witnesses.</P>
      <P>All those matters cause delay.  There are delays in running down actions which are unavoidable.  Legal advisers may have to wait for a period until the result of the injuries is clear in order to be able to value them.  There are delays in insurance companies' offices.  There are delays right across the line.  If we are to add to all of those delays a delay of 12 months or more from the date the action is set down for hearing until it is reached we have an intolerable position. The law is brought into disrepute and the litigants are completely frustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister of State in a position to be able to tell us what is the position in regard to accommodation for those judges?  I do not know what the up-todate position is in the Four Courts.  I have not been there for several years but I believe the accommodation is far from satisfactory.  I understand that further buildings have been acquired by the Office of Public Works but a few years ago the accommodation in the Four Courts was hardly able to serve the judges who <Col N="548" /> were then administering justice in the High Court.  Where will the three new judges be accommodated?  I hope the Minister will tell the House what exactly is the position.  It is necessary, from the point of view of the Judiciary that reasonable accommodation for the Judiciary, the jurors and the litigants be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I believe that a lot more could be done to facilitate litigants, particularly plaintiffs who have to travel long journeys from places like Kerry, Donegal and even Cavan.  Many of those people have to travel 150 miles to 200 miles to have their cases heard.  I know the situation has improved somewhat recently by holding the High Court in the larger cities.  We do not have free legal aid in civil matters and that means very often that plaintiffs who have not watertight actions, who may either win or lose, have to travel a long distance to come to Dublin.  The plaintiff's solicitor in cases like this has to organise all the witnesses, some professional, such as engineers and medical men, to be in attendance.</P>
    <P>Those actions are listed in order of setting down.  The first priority in arranging a list seems to be to ensure that the judges and the courts are kept working and that the list will not break down on any day.  Because of the practice of last minute settlements in the Round Hall of the Four Courts, very often after juries have been called, the practice of making sure that there is a full day's work involves listing more cases than can reasonably be heard.  Four cases are often listed for one court and unless there are three settlements the fourth one cannot get on and unless there are two settlements the third one cannot get on. There should be a more humane approach to this and an officer of the court should vet the actions and see where the people come from.  Litigants who have to travel long distances should be given a priority listing so that they will be heard on the day they come to Dublin. Litigants who have to come to Dublin often have to stay one night and even two nights and this has sometimes very queer effects.  A plaintiff might be coerced into settling an action which he would otherwise litigate and perhaps get more out of a settlement.</P>

A judge presiding in a court, concentrating every second he is on the bench for four hours a day has done a good day's work.  The Chair in this House would find it impossible to chair a meeting for several hours without a break.  The judge presiding in a court has a very difficult job.  It is not possible to measure his work by four hours or eight hours.  He is doing specialised work which cannot be done for long hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned jury actions. They have increased enormously, from <Col N="550" /> 863 in 1972 to 1,861 in 1978.  I am one of those people who believe that the jury system of trying cases is the best system. I would be against any proposal to abolish jury actions and the jury system in the High Court.  Over the years the wisdom of juries has been proved to be sound and their decisions reasonable.  If the occasion arises I shall go into this matter in more depth.  It would be a matter for another Bill when I shall deal with it in more detail.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter with which I want to deal.  We in this country have been blessed with the judges who have been appointed over the years.  The system of appointing judges has been questioned from time to time.  I do not propose to go into that here.  Suffice it to say that I believe that our judges have upheld the best traditions of the Judiciary in that they act with the utmost impartiality and, when they go on the bench, do their utmost to discharge justice; certainly they forget about their past.  At the same time judges are human; they are human beings and, being human beings, suffer from the shortcomings of human nature the same as the rest of us.  It has often struck me that one judge might be more suited for sitting in one court than another judge.  We hear it said in racing parlance that there are horses for courses, and I think there are judges for courts.  There could be and, indeed, have been, judges who are constitutionally unsuited for the particular task entrusted to them.  These same judges might be ideally suited to presiding in another type of court.  Of course, it does not occur to a person that he is not constitutionally or temperamentally suited to a particular task.  As a matter of fact it could very well be that the more unsuitable a person was for the task entrusted to him the more enjoyment he might get out of discharging that task.  What I am coming to is that I believe there is power available for the appointment of judges and the allocation of judges to the various courts.  In my lifetime as a lawyer I believe that that function has been discharged far too lightly, if at all.  I believe that the whole judicial system would be improved very considerably if the allocation of judges to particular courts was not regarded as <Col N="551" /> a lifetime allocation.  I believe that the administration of justice would run more smoothly, that litigants would be much more satisfied and would leave court much more satisfied whether they won or lost if the judges were moved about from one type of court to another within the same jurisdiction.  I do not mean that judges should be moved up and down from the Circuit Court to the High Court but I believe, particularly in the High Court&mdash;where there are different duties to be performed&mdash;the allocation of a judge to one type of duty should not be taken as a lifetime appointment.  I do not think any judge should be offended, or that it should be regarded as downgrading, if he were changed from one court to another.  There is a very human element in the discharge of one type of function as against another; for instance, some types of jurisdiction within the High Court deal with more sensitive areas than others.  I hope I have made myself clear.  I believe my legal brethren will know what I am talking about.  I know that the authority exists to do what I am suggesting and it should be exercised.</P>
    <P>I have felt for many years what I am now expressing.  I just did not have the opportunity of expressing it because an appropriate occasion did not arise.  I say it now and I strongly recommend that particular attention by given to courts presided over by judges and the type of task they are asked to undertake.  We have been blessed with our Judiciary over the years.  They have been impartial and fearless; they have allowed nothing except consideration of the administration of justice to influence them.  But they are still human and suffer from all the shortcomings from which we human beings suffer.  Many of us suffer from shortcomings of which we are not aware.  I am suggesting that the judicial system would be better helped, would operate more smoothly and to the satisfaction of the people to whose complete satisfaction it should operate, those litigants appearing before it, if my suggestion that judges should not be regarded as having a lease of life in any particular court was implemented.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the situation obtaining in regard to family law cases coming up for hearing in the country.  I have not had an opportunity of seeing how they operate in Dublin. From my experience family law cases in the country come up for hearing at the same time as other cases.  Here I am referring to some cases that are District Court cases when all are listed together. For instance, they may be cases in regard to dangerous driving, motor taxation, dog licences and so on, all normally listed for 11 a.m.  All cases, including family law cases, are listed for 11 a.m. The family law cases are called and are heard <i>in camera</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that this situation exists and I would ask the Chair for some latitude.  My point applies equally to all the courts. All the cases listed for the High Court are listed for 11 a.m. and the people involved in family law disputes, whether in relation to maintenance or assault, must wait in the body of the court.  The court clerk will call a couple into the court chamber and the case is heard by the justice and dealt with and then the next couple are called.  This system literally advertises the fact that a family dispute has arisen.  Family law cases should be dealt with separately and not along with ordinary run of the mill cases.  A certain amount of confidentiality should be preserved in this type of case but at present it is not being preserved and I would ask the Minister to rectify this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the question of the number of High Court judges with the Minister for Justice at Question Time some time ago. I was aware of a backlog of jury actions and of non-jury actions.  I was told that the average length of time before a case could be heard was nine months.  My attention has since been drawn to the fact that it takes at least ten months and that the postal dispute is aggravating the situation and that cases are not being heard for 12, 15 and 16 months.  This type of delay is most serious for people who are injured and who are living on social welfare benefits.  These people, despite the best advice, are pressured into accepting soft settlements because they cannot afford to hold out any longer.  An increased number of judges <Col N="554" /> will go some way towards meeting the situation and I could not expect the number to be increased beyond 12. However, I would ask the Minister to continue to monitor the situation.  There were 1,555 cases disposed of in 1978 which, as the Minister said, is the highest number of cases dealt with by the High Court in any one year.  However, the arrears continue to accumulate and I would like to know if the arrears numbers more than the cases dealt with. Will the Minister elaborate on the arrears? We must make a positive effort to reduce the number of cases outstanding because the delays are causing hardship to people who can ill afford to suffer further hardships.  I know that the fact that the Special Criminal Court is in session and that Judge Costello is in Bantry compounds the situation.  At present there is no one on the Law Reform Commission.  However, we need people to hear these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick touched on the arrangements in regard to the lists of cases.  I was involved as a witness in a case a short while ago and I arrived with engineers, architects, doctors and so on for a High Court case in which neither was in a position to pay additional costs. The case adjourned at about 11.20 a.m. although people had travelled from all over the country to attend the hearing. Everybody there left the court with a diminished respect for solicitors, barristers and everybody else connected with courts when they were told that the case was being adjourned for two weeks irrespective of the fact that both parties to that case would have been happy to accept the findings of the court.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to have preliminary discussions, involving counsel and solicitors on both sides, on the call-overs of lists so that more cases could be disposed of.  I am confident that if such preliminary consultations could be arranged many more cases could be settled and a lot of delays avoided. Perhaps there would be expenses attached to such preliminary sessions but a lot of the general aggravation about delays would be avoided and the High Court backlog would be reduced considerably. Some such arrangements will <Col N="555" /> have to be made to bring High Court lists more up to date.  These consultations should be arranged from inside and the arrangements should be made in the near future because otherwise outsiders, possibly the Department, will have to intervene and that would not be the most satisfactory way from the point of view of litigants.</P>
    <P>Another way to avoid delays and to reduce the cost to litigants would be if the High Court went on circuit to many more centres than at present when High Court judges attend in Galway, Cork, Limerick and sometimes in Kilkenny. The extra judges being appointed by this Bill should be requested to move to more areas and in effect to have all the year round sittings.  If this could be arranged it would be to the benefit not only of the parties involved in litigation but also professional witnesses such as surgeons, doctors, engineers and architects.  Doctors would then be able to stay in their hospitals until half an hour before the listed hearings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to suggest improvements in the way the courts operate.  I ask the Minister to consider these points very seriously to the benefit of all concerned.  I should like also to draw the Minister's attention to the serious lack of accommodation in the Four Courts.  A situation arose not long ago when High Court judges had not rooms in which to hear cases.  This should not arise, particularly in the case of highly-paid judges.  I appreciate that much of the judges' work could be done in their private homes, such as reading materials, preparing judgments and assessing evidence, but it is serious when a High Court judge arrives at the Four Courts at 10.30 a.m. to find that there is not a room available in which he can hear cases listed.  I appreciate that accommodation  <Col N="556" /> is being prepared in an effort to avoid a recurrence of such a situation but it must be remembered that when the additional judges are appointed further accommodation will be needed. We must ensure that another backlog of cases does not build up.  It is a very serious situation when a judge does not have accommodation to hear cases.  Of course, that is only part of the reason why there is such a serious backlog of cases.</P>
      <P>Another matter needing attention as far as the High Court is concerned is in relation to the shortage of stenographers.  I do not know why that shortage exists but it appears that there is a serious shortage of people who are skilled in shorthand note-taking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now we have had a shortage of judges and accommodation but now that we have both it must be remembered that it will be necessary to supply additional stenographers to take a note of the evidence in the courts of the new judges.  The Department of Justice should be made aware of that shortage so that they can make every effort to service the 12 judges we will have when we pass this Bill.  I am anxious to be helpful and not to score debating points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the provision in the Bill to appoint additional High Court judges I am disappointed that the opportunity was not availed of to appoint more district justices.  Because of a shortage of such people arrears have built up in many courts, particularly in the major centres of population.  It should be remembered that, following the decision to grant free legal aid in family law cases, many more cases are likely to come before such courts.  In this regard <Col N="557" /> the Minister should consider appointing people who are qualified in the area of family law to the bench.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the number of High Court judges is most desirable.  I am expressing an opinion as a layman.  The last two speakers have been legally trained, are familiar with court procedure and with attendance on behalf of their clients in the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court.  Can the Minister of State give us the real reason for the long delay in presenting cases in the High Court? Presumably the main reason, as this Bill indicates, is the lack of High Court judges.  This delay in hearing cases is causing annoyance and aggravation to both plaintiffs and defendants who are anxious to have their cases disposed of in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The District Court may be looked upon as the poor man's Supreme Court because he cannot go any further on financial grounds.  The Circuit Court is one of the most useful and valuable courts.  Cases are usually appealed from <Col N="558" /> District Court to Circuit Court and from Circuit Court to High Court for a decision. There are many workmen's compensation claims awaiting decision by the High Court.  It is difficult to understand the delay in hearing a libel case against a newspaper or a slander case in which a High Court decision is deemed desirable.  There are a greater number of cases to be dealt with at District Court level and at Circuit Court level.  The pressure of the long list of undecided cases should be taken off the High Court.  Many cases on this list are brought by local authorities, by Government bodies, and by semi-State bodies. With more commonsense exercised these could be disposed of much more easily and quickly, without wasting the valuable time of the limited number of High Court judges.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say &ldquo;We are proceeding to the High Court&rdquo; when those saying so have not to spend their own money.  I deplore, from my own experience, actions being brought by an individual which are deemed to necessitate a decision by one of the limited number of High Court judges.  The local authority, semi-State or State body have money at their disposal, as against the limited funds available to the individual to contest his case fairly and squarely in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Before cases reach High Court level they should be processed and their numbers pruned by a judge of the High Court.  I have seen cases where the valuable time of the High Court has been taken up unnecessarily, a number of witnesses have been brought from all over the country and the case takes weeks and weeks to decide&mdash;for example, a case in which Bord na Móna and a constituent of mine were involved. Anyone with commonsense or intelligence would have known the manner in which this case would be decided, but because of a certain stubbornness of the individual, and mainly because he had not to fork out the money&mdash;it was taxpayers' or ratepapers' money rather than the hard-earned money of the people advocating a High Court decision&mdash;the case went to the High Court.  Some reorganisation is required to have cases, <Col N="559" /> particularly involving local authorities and so on, speedily dealt with.</P>
    <P>The general public has no idea of the amount of work a High Court judge has to perform.  He is on the bench from 10.30 a.m. until 4.30 p.m. or 5 o'clock and they think his work is then finished, but his work has only then begun.  He has evidence to consider.  He is pledged to perform his duty with the utmost impartiality, honesty, integrity and courage, and without fear or hindrance from any section of the community. Here I join with Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick in saying that we are very fortunate&mdash;in recent years, perhaps not always because not all judges are angels; they cannot be angels, any more than all politicians can be, human nature being what it is&mdash;in having, on the whole, a first-class Judiciary.  Every judge sitting in the High Court has discharged, is discharging and will discharge his duty conscientiously, honorably, nobly and in the interests of fairness and justice. Justice is imparted after the fullest consideration of all the facts submitted in evidence.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we are increasing the number of High Court judges but I suggest, as a layman, that this number should not be less than 14.  In a couple of years a similar Bill will have to be brought before this House for a further increase in the number.  High Court judges have other responsibilities as well as deciding the variety of cases before them.  In judicial inquiries and commissions the guidance and valuable assistance of such talented legal men are invaluable.  We are very fortunate in having such legally trained men who have administered the law fairly and honestly. The success of our legal system has been due mainly to the integrity of the judges, and I say this with special reference to the Supreme Court and to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I presume the Government will give careful consideration to the people about to be appointed.  It is essential that the qualities and the personality of the person to be appointed as High Court judge be fully examined by the appointing authority, namely, the Government.   <Col N="560" /> For that position a person should have patience, understanding and sympathy. He should be able to balance the views of the intellectual as well as those of the most ignorant citizen who comes before him.  I do not think in any walk of life that there is such a need for patience and understanding, particularly an understanding of human weakness.  A judge has grave responsibility for administering justice and impartially administering the law and this vests great authority and power in him.  When the High Court adjourns at 5 p.m. many of the judges have to work in their own homes signing legal documents, advising on legal matters, keeping in touch with county registrars and others as well as examining thoroughly the volume of evidence before them.</P>
    <P>I should like to express the hope that an effort will be made to keep abreast of the demands on the court for quick decisions. There is little use in making this plea to the Government because once a person is appointed a judge he is free of the Government and everyone else. Unlike the Taoiseach, the Ministers and the most humble Member of this House who can be shifted by a very easy process, as we have seen in recent years, a High Court judge cannot be dismissed. I can only avail of this opportunity here to express my comments to the people about to be appointed judges.  If possible they should give their decisions immediately and not reserve decisions for a considerable time.  I know there may be cases where, for instance, a site has to be examined or evidence has to be examined further and in such cases it may be desirable to reserve judgement. However, this can put a lot of worry and mental strain on the participants in the court cases.  On too many occasions decisions have been reserved or cases adjourned, even in the High Court, without any visible justification for the adjournment.  I realise that the presiding judge knows all the facts but there appears to be a lack of information between the judge, the legal participants and particularly the plaintiff and defendant. Often they do not know why a judgment is reserved or why a case is adjourned until the next sitting.</P>
    <P>The High Court is perhaps the most <Col N="561" /> vital and important court.  All the High Court judges should come together to try to clear the backlog of cases and try to determine if some cases might be disposed of other than by court sittings. Many cases could be settled if there was reason and understanding without having to take up the time of the court, thus avoiding inconvenience and mental strain to the people involved.  There are workmen's compensation cases listed for the High Court and some of them have been there for many years without being disposed of.  The time of the court should not be wasted on such cases and an effort should be made to have them disposed of satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we have any women High Court judges.  I am sure there must be some women in legal circles whose talents are equal to those of the men and doubtless the Government would be favourably disposed towards them.  Irrespective of the outcome of a case there is always a financial loss.  A greater effort should be made to have cases settled outside court if possible.  The Court should only be used as a last resort. There are trivial cases awaiting decision and, because of the position they hold on the list, they are holding up urgent cases that require the attention of our High Court judges.</P>
    <P>I salute these men for their understanding, their interest in the institutions of the State and their high standards of honesty and integrity.  I say that from my experience of present day judges, but I did not always hold the same view.  All judges cannot be angels, nor can all Members of this House, but because of human frailty many of them may be inclined to give way to their feelings.  As I said, our judges are devoted to justice and fair play.</P>
    <P>My only complaint is that too many cases come before them which should not be before them at all.  Perhaps this is because legal people are anxious to take a good pluck of the goose before the cases come to the Four Courts.  If there is the slightest doubt about the success of a case, there is a grave responsibility on our legal people to advise their clients about the high costs involved in bringing cases before the High Court and the <Col N="562" /> Supreme Court.  After unfavourable decisions many people who attended the High Court as plaintiffs or defendants would have been happier if they had been legally advised not to take their case to that court.</P>
    <P>I hope the appointments to be made under this Bill will expedite matters.  In my view this Bill was introduced to clear up the backlog of cases and to accelerate the work of the Supreme Court and the High Court.  I support this Bill and have no objection to the appointment of the additional judges.  As a layman I think there should be at least 14 judges.  Some steps should be taken to bring the High Court on circuit more frequently, if a courthouse and office facilities are readily available.  This is already happening in Galway and Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the purpose of this Bill: that there should be an increase in the number of ordinary judges in the High Court.  The backlog of work makes one wonder if the increase from nine to 12 is adequate. There are a number of cases waiting to be heard literally for years.  This leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>I have often wondered at the method of appointment of High Court judges and judges in general.  It is relevant at the present time that I should say this, because the Constitution states that there must be clear separation of the Oireachtas from the Judiciary.  The fact that the Government of the day have such an important say in the appointment of our judges makes a mockery of that and leaves a lot to be desired.  I deplore political appointments.  That is very wrong for democracy and for the proper working of our Judiciary.  So many decisions affecting the laws of the Oireachtas go before the judges that I feel it is important that they should be absolutely impartial and the fact that the Government have a say in their appointment casts serious doubt and suspicion on their judgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that this is a small country and that problems can arise, but there must be some way to appoint judges other than by a Government.  As I said, it is wrong that the Government should <Col N="563" /> have a say in the appointment of judges because it is a complete negation of the idea that there should be complete separation of the Oireachtas from the Judiciary.  Because of that, in my view, we are doing a great deal of harm to our democracy.  I am amazed this has not been mentioned previously and that there has not been a public outcry at such appointments.  To expect judges suddenly to become impartial is asking too much of human nature.</P>
    <P>I would favour an interview panel which would appoint people to the bench purely on merit and not on political affiliations. It is very important that I put this view forward.  This subject should be discussed more often.  There has to be a change if we are to see the Judiciary totally separated from the Oireachtas.  I would be very much in favour of that separation and hope the Government might see their way to doing this, as their predecessors did with An Bord Pleanála, a separate body set up to deal with planning problems.  All Members will agree that this important body is operating efficiently and no charges can be levelled at it because of that.  In the same way a panel should be set up to appoint judges and the Government of the day should not have any say in their appointment.  I look forward to the day when this happens and hope there will be a public debate on it.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill but wonder why only three extra judges are being appointed. What is the justification for that number?  In my opinion we are not serving the cause of justice by appointing only three extra.  There should be at least five having regard to the volume of work before the courts.  It is the ordinary members of the public who suffer the delays and frustrations of this backlog, whose cases are delayed for a very long time because the judges cannot cope with the volume of work.  I would like to hear the Minister of State explain why. Will we have to come in here again in two years' time to ask that the number be increased?  Why not do it now to cope with the number of cases before it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Deputies in welcoming this Bill. <Col N="564" /> There are one or two points I would like to make.  I strongly endorse what Deputy Flanagan said about the dangers which arise from judgment being reserved in a case for an undue length of time.  One can obviously see that a judge may not wish, having heard the case, to give his judgment straight away but surely there must be some limit on the time within which he should be able to give his judgment.  I have heard reports of delays of a truly inordinate length by a judge in relation to him giving judgment in a number of cases with which he has been charged.  That should not happen because one must recognise that if any judgment is given it is possible to appeal it in the case of a lower court and at least the matter can be brought to some conclusion. But if judgment is merely reserved no progress whatever can be made by the parties.  When one considers the very large amounts of money involved and possibly the very great injuries that people may have suffered which require compensation it behoves judges to make sure that if they do have to reserve judgment&mdash;and nobody disputes the right that they have to do so in certain cases&mdash;it should only be for a minimum length of time.  Would it be possible to get information, through the Minister of State, about the length of time judgments have been reserved in individual cases?  Is it possible, for instance, to obtain, by means of parliamentary question or by answer here, information on the maximum length of time for which a judgment has been reserved in the High Court?  Possibly one might be told that because of the separation of powers between the Oireachtas and the judiciary the Minister of State would not be in a position to obtain that sort of information.  If he were, it would be very interesting and useful information which the public are entitled to know as they are paying the cost of the Judiciary and of other public services.  They are, therefore, entitled to know how this work is being carried out and information about the length of time for which judgments are being reserved by particular judges could perhaps be justly made available.  However, if there is a constitutional bar to this being done in this House on the grounds that the <Col N="565" /> Judiciary is constitutionally separate from the Executive and legislative arms of government, then obviously the information cannot be made available and if that is so, naturally I and every other Member of this House would accept it.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw attention also to another matter relating to the courts and that is the interest rate on court judgment debts.  At present if a person obtains judgment against somebody who owes him a substantial amount of money no interest whatever is obtained on the debt up to the date of the court hearing.  A person is merely entitled to the money even though he might have been out of his money for a very long time and may have been paying interest on borrowed money in the interim.  On the date of the judgment all he is entitled to is 4 per cent on the debt.  If the going market interest rate is anything from 15 to 20 per cent, that is four or five times as much as he is entitled to get on the judgment debt.  So he is clearly losing out because if the debt is still not paid up at the time when the debtor's property might be seized&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not really a matter of the functioning of the courts; it is a matter for the Government to change the law.  Under the Debtors Act of 1841, 4 per cent is the maximum which may be charged.  This Act has not been changed for over 100 years and it is about time it was changed.  A report was made to the Government in 1969 by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommending that this figure of 4 per cent which had been standing at that time for 120 years should be raised to a realistic level based on current rates of interest. The Government should be in a position to introduce legislation to implement those recommendations.  This is genuinely an urgent matter because people abroad are not prepared to deal commercially with this country in many cases.</P>

      <P>There will be a motion in the House tomorrow on that subject.  I am grateful for the constructive manner in which this very important Bill was met by the Members of this House.  I am particularly grateful to the practitioners on the Opposition benches. They are people who are respected in the legal profession and know what they are speaking about and it is most helpful that they should bring their considerable experience to bear on a Bill of this nature.  This is not in any way to undervalue the contributions made by other Deputies.  I consider that if it was left entirely to lawyers to discuss a Bill involving the legal profession then the discussion would in some way lose its merit and its value and I am grateful to the laymen for their contributions too.</P>
      <P>I will first deal in a very general way with this debate and I will then return to the various points made by Deputies and it will be my intention to deal specifically, item by item, with the queries raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the important aspects of this general discussion is to remember that our system of Government is founded on the separation of powers.  Article 6.1 of the Constitution classifies &ldquo;all powers of Government&rdquo; as legislative, executive and judicial and of course these powers &ldquo;derive, under God, from the people&rdquo; and are &ldquo;exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.&rdquo;  Further, the separation of powers is not a rigid one because the obligation devolves on all divisions to promote the objects of <Col N="567" /> the Constitution.  Deputies will be well aware that in the preamble to the Constitution the people set out that they sought to promote the common good with due observance of prudence, justice and charity &ldquo;so that the dignity and freedom of the individual might be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored and concord established with other nations&rdquo;.  The sentiments embodied in that preamble and other relevant Articles of the Constitution concerning how the State is governed are as valid as they were when the Constitution was first enacted by the people in 1937.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary are in a unique position in our law in that a person appointed to the Bench cannot be removed except by resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There has been no instance where the impeachment process has been brought forward.  This is a great tribute to the work and integrity of our Judiciary.  If the position of a judge carries with it great immunity and privilege, it also carries a high level of responsibility and the requirements of a high degree of zeal and dedication in the performance of judicial functions.  Deputies who are lawyers will appreciate that on assuming office every judge must make a solemn declaration that he, or in time according to Deputy Oliver Flanagan she, will execute the duties of his or her office &ldquo;without fear or favour, affection or ill-will towards any man&rdquo;, and that he will uphold the Constitution and the law. He must carry out this from the day he takes office and every day of his life thereafter.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution has a system of judicial review which is wide ranging.  It is more far-reaching than the American example from which, no doubt, it was taken.  We have a system whereby Bills can be sent by the President to the Supreme Court to test their possible repugnancy to our Constitution.  Administrative actions are subject to a wide degree of judicial review.  This has been an expanding sphere of judicial activity over the last 15 years.  Naturally decision are handed down from time to time which do not suit the Government of the <Col N="568" /> day.  However a Government with due regard for the democratic processes, and this has been shared by every Government in the history of the nation, will take an adverse decision in the spirit in which it is given, having regard to the judicial powers contained in the Constitution and the role each has to play in seeking to promote as best it can the common good.  Of necessity there is an inevitable, though slight, tension between the executive process and the judicial one.  It does not fall to the lot of either to praise the other very often.  I am taking this opportunity of doing just that and detailing, in reply to queries made by members of the Opposition, the strenuous workload which judges have in the High Court.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to place on the record of the House the statistics of the case workload of the High Court since 1972.  I do not know whether you wish me to read it out but I am sure the Opposition will agree that it is a considerable detailing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the year ending 31 July 1972 there were, awaiting hearing, 300 cases at the start of the year, 863 cases set down during the year and the total to be dealt with, 1,163.  Cases disposed of during the year were 702, adjourned at the end of the year, 461, and the average delay from setting down of the case to the hearing of the case was nine months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a good point in this regard.  It does not begin and end with the setting down and hearing of the case by the High Court.  There is a lot of preparatory and paperwork to be done. One has to meet one's client, discuss the case with him whether he is plaintiff or defendant, set up the paperwork which has to be sent to counsel and await their consideration of it.  It then comes back to the instructing solicitor.  That takes a long time.  It is not all about setting down the case in the High Court to the date of hearing.  A lot of preliminary work has to be done which involves solicitors and counsel, the client and, in some cases, doctors, engineers and so on.  These are additional delays not brought about by the practitioners themselves but by the general process of the law.  That brings me to the figures for 1978 and I am speaking about jury actions.</P>

      <P>If I may give the 1975 figures it would show the considerable increase between 1972, 1975, and 1978.  In 1975 awaiting hearing at the start of the year there were 860 cases, set down during the year, 1,124, total to be dealt with, 1,984, disposed of during the year, 1,303, and adjourned at the end of the year, 681 cases.  The delay from date of setting down to date of hearing was five months at that time.  It went up in 1978 to nine months.  As Deputy Enright said, the postal strike has increased the delay considerably.</P>
      <P>Matters such as family law were mentioned by Deputies opposite.  The whole sphere of family law, which was hardly known 15 years ago, has now expanded greatly requiring a judge sitting full-time in a family division of the High Court. The necessity to establish the rights of equality for women in regard to the family home and matrimonial property requires the assistance of the court to resolve the inevitable disputes that will occur in dealing with this aspect of the law.  The Guardianship of Infants Act has led to a great increase in applications affecting our children.  There has been the operation of the Planning Acts and the powers of section 27 of the recent Planning Act to enforce planning controls by the High Court.  This has led to a great expansion of the work of the High Court in addition to all the other matters mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned that crime, unfortunately, has increased dramatically over the past ten years.  This is a sad fact of life and of the affluent society in which we are living.  The opportunity for the criminal becomes greater the wealthier the society in which we live becomes.  It is a trite saying that the Judiciary must conduct their affairs &ldquo;without the sword&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, in our democratic system we observe and respect the rule of law and therefore the orders and judgments of our courts are respected and obeyed.  However, the obligation devolves on the Oireachtas to make sure that the courts are properly serviced from the point of view of having sufficient personnel to dispose of cases with reasonable expedition.  Deputies will be satisfied that even though the courts <Col N="571" /> may be short-staffed from time to time&mdash;and it has been suggested that they were, although I am glad to say that that position has been resolved&mdash;no litigant who, providing his legal advisers co-operate, seeks to get his case on speedily is held up unduly.  I speak at this time subject to the reservation that, unfortunately, the postal dispute has intervened to hold up many civil jury trials last term and in the current term.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned remuneration and so on.  The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Service Sector found that the time spent by judges on the bench is short by comparisons with normal hours of work at any level in industry, commerce or elsewhere in the public sector, with the exception of the teaching profession at all levels.  Nevertheless the time thus spent was found not to be a fair indicator of the time required for the job. Deputy Fitzpatrick addressed himself to that, as did a number of other Deputies. A judge sits for four hours, two in the morning and two in the afternoon, and that in itself requires considerable concentration. In addition the judge has to prepare his judgments, to refer to his library of legal text books and so on.  It just does not begin and end with a court sitting; quite the contrary.  At paragraph 516 of the review body's report it is pointed out that: &ldquo;Judges at all levels must keep abreast of developments in the law in the way of legislation, judgments, decisions and so on.&rdquo;  In the higher courts in particular it is necessary to keep abreast of such developments in other countries as well.  By definition the superior courts&mdash;the High Court and the Supreme Court&mdash;would be required to keep in touch with international judgments which in some instances are outside Ireland.  At paragraph 517 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>Preparation of judgments, especially in the case of High and Supreme Court Judges is a very important and time-consuming function.  Because of their nature, and because the more important judgments are reported and go to law libraries and universities at <Col N="572" /> home and abroad, great care must be exercised.</P>
    <P>That might apply in some small way&mdash;I think in a big way&mdash;according to the views of Deputies to the constructive observations made by Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Bruton on reserved judgments. First of all, it is desirable to avoid reserving of judgments altogether, but in the event of a judgment having to be reserved that judgment so reserved should be dealt with quickly.  It is not often that a reserved judgment has to wait for a long time; it is only in exceptional cases that that happens.  It is well to remember, too, that when judges reserve judgments the reason for their reservation of judgments may be that the case itself was long, that it was complex and that at the conclusion of that case the judge is immediately into another case in the law list and consequently may have five or six cases going, if I may use a crudity, at the same time.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the increase in the volume of crime.  Ever since 1972 it has been necessary to maintain a Special Criminal Court to deal with certain scheduled offences.  These in the main are committed by members of subversive organisations.  This is the first Special Criminal Court to be staffed exclusively by members of the Judiciary and a great debt of gratitude is due from the community to all the various members of the Judiciary who have served on that court from its inception. It has been a great bulwark in the preservation of the freedom and liberty of all of us.  It has, too, preserved the rule of law from the point of view of making sure that the institutions of State are not tumbled down.  On the other hand, it represents the best that can be done, short of a jury trial, to preserve the rights of an accused.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, always a matter of regret in a democracy such as ours, where trial by jury is such an inbuilt feature of our legal system, that that should be abrogated in respect of the trial of certain types of offences.  It is a matter of regret, too, that that situation has had to continue since 1972.  The alternative would be the likelihood of <Col N="573" /> dealing a mortal blow to the preservation of the rule of law through the intimidation of jurors and witnesses, and thus the bringing about of false and perverse verdicts.  It should nevertheless, be in the forefront of the minds of all of us to bring about a situation in this country on both sides of the divide whereby the need for a court such as the Special Criminal Court no longer arises. Until that day it will be necessary to keep the court in being.  On behalf of all Members of the House here and on behalf of the Government I express again our appreciation and our thanks to the Members of the Judiciary who have served on that court.  The fact that it required the presence of a number of High Court judges who serve on a rota basis is another factor which has been putting strains on what I might call the ordinary work of the judges of the High Court.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that we preserve the high standing of the Judiciary by recruitment of the best to positions in the High Court.  Deputy O'Connell made the point that an independent body should be set up to examine applicants for the High Court.  Over the years in the time of the Coalition Government something in the region of nine judges were appointed to the Supreme Court and to the High Court.  I am not quibbling about that.  The system has worked very well. The people who have been appointed by the various Governments over the years have never been found wanting in the service of the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy O'Connell in relation to the method of appointment of High Court judges is a reasonable observation.  He drew an analogy with the independence of the Planning Board; which has been working extremely well in relation to planning appeals from local authorities. They are an independent board and they appear to be independent.  However, the situation in relation to the appointment of judges of the High Court by successive Governments has not been found to be defective.  Consequently, it should be continued until such time as a better system is found.  No better alternative has been proposed.  The success of the system of appointment by successive Governments of people to the High Court can be seen in the quality and integrity of those people who have held positions as High Court and Supreme Court judges, and indeed Circuit Court judges and District Court justices over the years.  They have never been found wanting in integrity and none of them has been found guilty of wrong-doing. The only method of removing members of the High Court is by a joint resolution of the Oireachtas, something which has never happened in the history of this country.  It is good to be able to say that.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a subsidy for low income families and individuals towards the cost of their ESB charges.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, on 12 June last the Government announced that the price of electricity was to go up by no less than 20 per cent.  <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that the increase was approved by the Government on 12 June, a few days after the European and local elections. It has been suggested that the proposed increase from 1 June this year will add about 2 per cent to the cost of living overall.  I submit that this increase, together with recent substantial increases in the cost of food, will have a further substantial impact on the annual rate of inflation and will certainly push it well over the double figure for 1978.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that the increase will add between £1 and £3 per month to the accounts of most ESB consumers. This increase has come at a time when some 40 per cent of ESB subscribers have not paid their bills for several months.  It appears that four out of every ten households are substantially in arrears and these arrears amount to a sum in the region of £20 million.  The proposition of the Labour Party is that within the range of ESB subscribers as a whole there are families and individuals who have a very low income and who generally have difficulty in paying their ESB bills, even when there is not a postal dispute.  This increase, together with the abolition of food subsidies, puts pressure on these people well beyond the amelioration offered by the Government in the recent budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further increases in the price of crude oil are also in the offing and it is expected that these increases will have a further substantial impact on ESB charges in the autumn.  If that is so, it strengthens the case that the Government should give some consideration to the introduction of a wider scheme of <Col N="576" /> selective subsidies to well-defined categories of subscribers in the low income group.  The Exchequer should endeavour to bear this cost.</P>
    <P>This motion is tabled in anticipation of the coming winter.  This country has endured an unprecedented period of appalling weather and the prospect is that there will be a critical situation in regard to fuel supplies and fuel costs before this House reconvenes next October.  Even now there is a delay of three or four weeks in receiving supplies of coal from the monopoly which controls coal distribution. In addition to all this there is the unprecedented postal dispute.</P>
    <P>The people worst hit in this situation are the low income consumers.  If the Minister would stroll down to Townsend Street any morning &mdash; I would bring him myself tomorrow morning&mdash;he would see 500 or 600 people queueing up, even on an extremely warm day such as today. Elderly people, young people and mothers with children have been queueing up on the various morning allotted to them.  Several thousand are processed like broiler chickens instead of human beings.  They queue in Townsend Street and down a filthy back lane waiting for their cheques.  These are the people who must try to allocate from their cheques enough money to meet their ESB bills. They do not get very much, even in these days of alleged affluence.  A husband and wife with two children with full benefit get about £30.  The last item for payment is the ESB bill, as many public representatives know when supply is cut off.</P>
    <P>I know people are cynical about politicians generally, but I am sure the degree of cynicism on the part of consumers was heightened when the announcement of the increase was deliberately withheld until after polling day for the European and Local Elections. Sanction was given and the announcement came a couple of days after the close of the polls for these two elections. If I may chide the Government, that is hardly the mark of a Government, with a secure majority of 20, the largest majority in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>We should turn our minds in a responsible way to alleviating, as far as <Col N="577" /> possible, the hardship which will be suffered most in the coming winter by families and individuals with low incomes. Many families directly affected by unemployment, by redundancy, and quite a number also by the post dispute, are on the poverty line.  Despite the efforts of the previous administration when they went marginally above the poverty line, largely due to the major efforts of my colleague Deputy Cluskey in the Department of Social Welfare, they have slipped back again and have had no real net improvement in the past 12 months.  The inflation rate, now running at 12 or 13 per cent, has well and truly overtaken the increases given in social welfare.  It is important to point out to the Minister that in very many instances those increases have not yet been paid due to the postal dispute.</P>
    <P>Special consideration should be given to the ESB accounts of those families.  I want to draw another distinction.  The ESB account tends to be quite different from the differential rent paid by an individual. If a person suffers a period of unemployment his differential rent falls and is adjusted accordingly.  It can drop by as much as two-thirds for a person who is suddenly caught by unemployment. By and large the ESB bill is a constant and progressive expenditure having regard to the increases in charges.  Little account is taken of the income circumstances of families, even though families with high incomes usually spend more on electricity.</P>
    <P>The unemployed person, the redundant person, the deserted wife in our society, single parent families, deserted parents, and deserted children who are living in homes or are fostered out, have not got the benefit of the free electricity scheme or the subsidised scheme.  My plea to the Minister is that some consideration should be given to these categories, and our proposition is extremely modest.  Consideration should be given to reducing the qualifying age for free electricity.  It should be brought down to 65 years.  This would not be a terribly costly exercise.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, at the moment the Exchequer spends about £6 million a year on the free electricity scheme.  The <Col N="578" /> current estimate for 1979 is £5.9 million and 132,659 people will benefit.  If the qualifying age were reduced to 65 years some additional thousands would be added on to the scheme.  I have not got the exact age quota, but the cost would not be excessive.  It was and is an excellent scheme.  It was introduced in 1967 and has been of progressive benefit to the community down through the years.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, in our constituency the number of people in their early sixties requiring heat above all, living in flats and rooms with high ceilings and not much heat, is appalling.  At the age of 65 or 66 years the prospects of having free electricity at that critical age, when in many cases people are entering into what we now call regrettably old age, would be of considerable value to them.  By and large the present electricity allowance is confined rather rigorously to persons receiving old age pensions, blind pensions, invalidity pensions, disabled pensions, and so on, and they have to be living alone, or living with a dependent wife, or an invalid husband, or another invalided person.</P>
    <P>The average cost of the subsidy at the moment under the free electricity scheme seems to be about £45 a year for the approximately 132,000 people who qualify.  Additional groups and categories should now be added on to the scheme.  One could mention groups in our society like deserted wives with children.  There are about 3,400 deserted wives with children in our society.  If one applied the £45 subsidy to those deserted wives, the total cost would be about £150,000 only, which even in the context of a supplementary budget would be scarcely worth mentioning.</P>
    <P>Needless to remark in the case of the 3,400 wives with children, one would probably be paying the allowance only to those living alone.  I know some deserted wives who live alone with their children, and the ESB bill is a two-monthly crucifixion because the income of a deserted wife is extremely low.  It is £25 or £30 a week with supplementary benefits or allowances, the old home assistance. The increase in the ESB bill will be quite substantial.  Some deserted wives live with other persons, their <Col N="579" /> mothers, or their fathers, or in a general setting with other persons, and they might not qualify.  Assuming half of the deserted wives live alone with their children, the cost would be about £70,000 or £80,000 a year to give them the same ESB subsidy.</P>
    <P>There is another category of persons for whom I should like to make a special plea because they are on low incomes.  I refer to unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>There are 4,000 unmarried mothers in receipt of allowances.  I do not know what percentage of unmarried mothers live alone with their children but some of them live in flats and I can only describe as heroic the efforts these women make to care for their children, to feed and clothe them and to educate them.  If an unmarried mother earns more than £6 per week she will have a problem in regard to qualifying for the allowance. This means that these women who live in flats in urban areas have for the most part no income but the allowance. Therefore, they live quietly because there is not enough money for spending on any type of social activity.  The application of the free electricity scheme to this group would be of major social benefit. In most cases an unmarried mother has only one child although in some cases there may be more than one child.  The cost of extending the free electricity scheme to them would not be very much.  If one were to take a situation in which only one in every three unmarried mothers lived alone, the cost per year would be about £60,000.</P>
    <P>There is another large group of people for whom I should also like to make a special plea.  I refer to adult dependants with children who are unemployed. There are about 32,000 families in this category.  We know that there is a large number of single persons unemployed and in many of these cases there are adult dependants involved.  The extension of the free electricity scheme especially in respect of those who are on what might be termed unemployment of a long duration would be of major benefit.  Some of these people may be unemployable through no fault of their own.  To extend the free electricity <Col N="580" /> scheme to them would hardly cost more than £500,000 per year.  Admittedly it would have to be on an intermittent basis since the unemployed find jobs though they may become unemployed again, but the group I am talking of are deserving of special consideration.</P>
    <P>I shall not protract my argument in relation to these groups except to make a plea for that group of one-parent families, particularly widowed mothers and also, as is the case in quite a few instances nowadays, fathers who have lost their wives and who are caring for their children at home.  These families, in terms of the selective application of subsidies, a concept that seems to be close to the hearts of many Ministers in these islands, deserve special consideration. The people in the various groups for whom I am making this plea spend more time in their homes than is the case of people in any other group.  They have little social life because they cannot afford to spend money on anything other than the absolute necessities.  They do not have cars.  In their homes they are dependent on the lifeline of electricity accounts.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider also making available additional funds in the coming winter months to the officers of the various health boards for allocating supplementary welfare allowances.  Additional discretion should be developed on these officers and additional funds made available to them so that they could help those in urgent need and who will be faced with the additional burden of heavy ESB bills.  If the officers had this discretion they could pay some part of the extra amount due for electricity so as to help those people.  This would mean that the additional fuel subsidy funds would be spent by way of the greatest allocation going to those most in need in accordance with the discretion of the officers concerned.  With the hopefully early termination of the postal dispute and with the subsequent issuing of thousands of bills to consumers, I can envisage a situation going into the winter when the crunch period will arise in terms of arrears being paid and when many families will need the kind of additional discretionary assistance that I am talking of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> These, then, are some of the categories that I consider worthy of our special care.  Down through the years successive Governments have effected major improvements in the scheme.  The scheme which was introduced in 1967 and which cost then about £35,000 has grown and has been of major benefit.  In 1968-69 about 40,000 people qualified in terms of that scheme while in 1973-74 the number was 74,000 and in 1976 the number exceeded 100,000.  In 1978-79 the number of people expected to qualify in terms of the scheme is 132,000.  The Coalition Government extended the scheme to include those in receipt of invalidity pensions from the Department or those in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowances.  In 1975 the qualifying age of eligibility for the free electricity scheme was reduced to 67.  It had been reduced in the 1974 budget to 68 and in the 1973 budget to 69.  This Government have been in office for two years and so far they have not made any change in the scheme.  It is now necessary to remind the Minister that within the budgetary strategy of the Government, if one might call it that, there should be no great problem in meeting these modest suggestions.  What I am asking for would not cost more than £1 million a year on top of the £6 million already being spent.  It will go to those in greatest need.  When one considers the millions of pounds whittled away by the Government during the past two years on the most grandiose subsidies to the most grandiose families in the country in wealth tax, the virtual abolition of the capital gains tax, the sweeping, across the board virtual abolition of motor tax, all I am asking for is a fraction of that money to be given to those in greatest need.  The Government have well within their capacity the financial resources to assist in that regard.</P>
    <P>I accept that there must be an economic rate charged for electricity but I do not accept that the consumer should have to bear the full burden.  I reject the suggestion that all consumers, irrespective of income, should have to pay a penal rate when the Government have within their capacity the financial resources to pay a small subsidy to those in greatest need.  I ask the Government <Col N="582" /> to give our motion the most sympathetic consideration.  If they are unable to accept it this evening I ask that consideration be given to it in the next budget.  The only aspect of the amendment put down by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that I can support is in relation to the need to achieve greater economies in the use of energy.  I ask, particularly in relation to electricity, that the Government should review the income taxation relief allegedly offered if one avails of the ESB installation allowances because they do not provide any great incentive to families to avail of the offer.  A great deal more work could be done in that regard.  I regret, apart from the Minister's call to achieve greater economy in the use of energy, that the amendment proposed by the Government is not worthy of general support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue) Martin O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the problems arising as a result of increased energy costs, especially for lower income families and individuals, and also notes the need to achieve greater economies in energy use, and approves of the steps taken by the Government to improve living standards for lower income groups.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to begin, first of all, by placing the ESB increase into some sort of overall context.  I hoped there would be general agreement on all sides of the House for an economic price to be charged for electricity.  The greatest single component in the additional costs incurred by the ESB is higher fuel costs. These arise outside the country.  They are a fact of life which must be accepted by the country as a whole.  That means the citizens of the country as a group.  If they want the benefits of electricity generated through oil they must be prepared to pay the higher prices which now prevail for that scarce commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the underlying reason for the <Col N="583" /> increase of 19½ per cent which has now been applied and which will operate until the end of March next year.  I would like to point out that this is the first increase in ESB charges in more than two years and that in fact during that period there were two price reductions.  There was a price reduction of 2½ per cent in the autumn of 1977 and a further reduction of 5 per cent in April of last year.  The net effect of these changes, if we take February 1977 as our starting point, which was the date of the last increase, and when we apply this current increase, is that electricity prices will have risen by something of the order of 22 per cent whereas prices in general have risen by somewhat more than that in that period. Incomes, of course, have risen by even larger amounts.</P>
    <P>The price of electricity in real terms is actually lower now than it was in February 1977 and, of course, will continue to decline as the balance of this year progresses.  If there is a difficulty about the high price of electricity today there must have been an even greater problem more than two years ago but I do not recall similar motions being introduced in this House at that time to mitigate the effects of excessive charges for electricity.  There has been an increase now, primarily, as I said, attributed to higher oil prices but, taken in the longer term perspective, electricity costs are not excessively high when related to general movements in the economy, particularly those in incomes and prices.</P>
    <P>The next point I would like to make on this is how substantial an effect do higher electricity prices have on the overall cost of living?  Deputy Desmond quoted some rather extravagant figures in that context.  The estimate available to me suggests that the effect on the overall price index will be an increase of .36 per cent, in other words, something of the order of one-third of 1 per cent.  That is all.</P>
    <P>It will not have a massive impact on prices or in real incomes in general.  Even if one allows that there may be some secondary effect of firms adding on the higher electricity charges to their prices, <Col N="584" /> and some generous additions to their margins in the process; even allowing for those sorts of indirect effects, it would still be the case that the overall impact on prices would be well below 1 per cent. Therefore I do not see any basis for the very extravagant figures quoted by Deputy B. Desmond.  But, to repeat, the effect of the price rise in electricity is .36 per cent, that is, about one-third of 1 per cent on the overall price level.  Having said that, I recognise that an increased ceiling of that relatively small magnitude can have a differential impact on different groups: what may be small in the budget of one household or firm can have a very noticeable impact on the family budget in another.  The Government are conscious of the need to take account of the special circumstances of different groups.  That concern is reflected in the amendment I have tabled and which I shall discuss in somewhat greater detail over the next few minutes.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to take up the point that appears to be implicit in the Labour Party motion calling for subsidies for lower income families.  Of course this is a topic that has received quite a good deal of airing in this House over the past year or so.  Since on occasions people seem to avail of the opportunity almost to go out of their way to misrepresent the Government's position on the matter, I trust I shall be forgiven if I endeavour to repeat our position as carefully and as clearly as I can.</P>
    <P>In so far as general subsidies are concerned the Government view is that these are not a desirable feature on a permanent basis of any healthy economy because they distort the charges for different things and therefore lead to people conducting their economic affairs on a false basis.  It is our view, which we have repeated in the past, that it is in exceptional circumstances only that there should be any general provision of subsidies and that when the exceptional circumstances which give rise to such a general subsidy have passed the subsidy in question should be phased out gradually and eliminated.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to emphasise that, in so far as there is a clear statement anywhere of the policies of the different parties in the House, their policies confirm  <Col N="585" /> that approach.  But, of course, when it suits them, Members on the opposite side of the House try to pretend that that is not their approach.  They try to convey the misleading impression that they would in some sense want to have their cake and eat it.  Nonetheless, when one looks at the policy statements made by leaders and representatives of the different parties in the House, I think there is ultimately an acceptance of that approach&mdash;that permanent subsidies on a general basis are not a desirable feature of an economy.</P>
    <P>Coming to the case for selective subsidies in particular circumstances for particular groups&mdash;and here I think we can claim that Fianna Fáil in Government have demonstrated conclusively over and over again that they are indeed quite willing to bring in such positive subsidies in appropriate circumstances&mdash;Deputy Desmond referred to the introduction of the existing free electricity scheme which, as he said, was introduced in 1967 by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Of course there are other selective types of subsidy available for particular lower income categories, the obvious examples being free transport and free television licences and, more recently, of course the introduction of free telephone rentals for older people living alone.  Therefore over the years the Government have been willing to identify particular needs and where the circumstances seemed appropriate to introduce selective subsidies to cater for the needs of the groups in question.  I trust I do not have to elaborate on these earlier schemes in order to demonstrate our concern and competence in that area.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the issue before us this evening, namely, that additional selective subsidies would be appropriate in the case of these increased ESB charges, we must recognise that there are some considerations pointing in the opposite direction.  We must recognise that part of our need as a community in the wake of higher prices and reduced availability of oil is to have a maximum effort made to conserve energy and to economise in its use in all possible ways.  In that context perhaps I should repeat for the benefit of the House that two of the principles for <Col N="586" /> energy policy adopted by the International Energy Agency, of which this country is a member, are that domestic energy prices should be allowed to reach a level which encourages energy conservation and that the development of alternative sources of energy and vigorous conservation measures should be implemented which would include pricing policies that encourage conservation.  In that context there is international recognition of the need not to hold down energy prices by artificial means.</P>
    <P>The next question is whether that approach should be interpreted so comprehensively and vigorously as to preclude selective subsidies for particular groups.  But certainly one would have to take account of the need not to cut across appropriate emphasis on conservation. For that reason one would have to look very carefully at the overall situation before embarking on any commitment to extend existing subsidies or to introduce new forms of energy subsidy to particular categories, however deserving on general grounds.  Indeed, in that context one might argue that a more appropriate way of endeavouring to alleviate some of the hardship in this energy area would be to press ahead with a more selective conservation programme designed specifically to help lower income groups.  If we can put together an effective package of measures which would enable them to bring standards of insulation in homes and so on up to the best levels, if we can identify appropriate financial and physical support arrangements to bring about that improvement, that would have the effect, on the one hand, of improving the actual heating standards of all the homes in question without the need to excessively encourage greater use of energy and without necessarily subsidising actual electricity consumption. That is one aspect which can be looked at carefully.</P>
    <P>As to the actual effect on the income position and therefore the living standards of the families in question, the lower income groups who will be hit by this increase in ESB charges, this brings me to the third component of the amendment, namely, that this problem is best dealt with by general improvements in <Col N="587" /> the social benefits available to these groups.  Despite many attempts to represent the position to the contrary, over the past two years Fianna Fáil have made provision for improving the real living standards of people in this lower income groups, especially people in receipt of social welfare payments.  The real value of increases in social welfare payments amount to nearly three times as much in the two-year period 1977 to 1979 compared with the whole four-year period 1973 to 1977, the period during which Opposition speakers tried to misleadingly claim there were some worthwhile improvements.  Deputy Desmond repeated that untrue four year old allegation this evening.  The facts show that the real improvement in the value of social welfare benefits was greater in the past two years than in the previous four years.  To give them the additional money and allow them to decide how to use it is a better way in which to deal with the problems of the people in the lower income families.</P>
    <P>That is a more satisfactory approach than compelling people to be tied into a growingly complex series of administrative layers.  The more one seeks to cope with the problems of the lower income groups by introducing more and more specific schemes, the more one requires people to deal with forms and documents and to have transactions with more and more governmental or local authority agencies.  If we can bypass the need to add on layers of administrative difficulty for people in lower income families by improving the income at their disposal, it is more satisfactory approach in the long term. That is the Government's general approach to the problem.  In addition to social welfare benefits there was a substantial improvement of 23 per cent in children's allowances this year which will help many lower income families in addition to those dependent on social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I will digress for a while to pick up one or two other points made by Deputy Desmond.  Deputy Desmond tried to make the case that he was seeking relatively modest improvements which <Col N="588" /> should not give rise to any great financial problems, and in the process he introduced some snide criticisms of the Government.  The Deputy talked about people being treated like broiler chickens and being asked to queue up for hours to receive social welfare benefits to which they are entitled.  What the Deputy did not point out is that they are compelled to adopt that position and to accept that hardship because there is a strike in breach of recognised procedures and in circumstances where many exceedingly generous offers were made to the workers in dispute.  Therefore, no one with an elementary sense of justice could argue that the amounts involved implied any hardship for the groups concerned. No matter how modestly one does the calculations for pay rises in general this year, when these general increases are added on to the special offers made to the postal workers, we are talking in terms of increases of about £14 or £15 per week for those groups.</P>

      <P>The relevance is that, if we have these sort of pressures on the Governmental budget, because many of these claims call for payments that would have to be financed by the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is also to be asked to find money for improvements of a type the subject of the original Labour Party motion and if on top of that other groups are exerting pressures to have tax burdens reduced it is not a simple matter for any party to say in this House that there is no financial problem for the Government in seeking to meet the needs of these lower income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point was illustrated by Deputy Desmond's remarks and that is why I took it as an example.  While in general many people and groups are willing to commit themselves to pious exortations of goodwill and support for the lower income groups, the hard reality is that by their behaviour many groups and individuals demonstrate that they are quite unwilling to accept any relative restraint or moderation in order to permit improvements in the position of the lower paid.  The hardships that have been caused this year are a case in point.  I can cite many other examples of the way in which hardship has been inflicted on the lower income group through behaviour which was no fault of their own and over which they have no control. They were made the innocent victims of the behaviour of other people. The Government would be more than happy to support any programme of action which would permit a genuine relative improvement in the position of lower income groups so that attempts which began with improvements in the <Col N="590" /> situation of the lower income groups would not be used as the basis or the justification for others with higher incomes and a stronger bargaining position for their own advantage.</P>
    <P>That is the general point to which I was drawing attention.  It is part of the overall problem which has to be faced in these areas. The relevance of that at the time was that the budgetary position for the Government was naturally tight.  It always is at budget time: I do not think Finance Ministers ever find themselves in the happy position when they can meet all the claims for extra expenditure and at the same time be able to meet all the claims for reduced taxation.  The position at budget time was tight enough, but since then it has been hit by an overall slowing down in the international economy which has arisen from the higher price and the restrictive availability of oil.  We have also been hit by the damage resulting from disputes, such as the postal strike.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the ability of the Government to finance improvements such as those suggested has been reduced by the events of the economy in recent months. The Government have been examining the manner in which the position of those in the lower income groups could be improved during the winter, in particular. As the House is aware, part of the proposals for the national understanding, which was unfortunately rejected by the trade unions, was to make a further increase in social welfare benefits during the winter, specifically for the purpose of meeting higher costs such as higher heating costs that would arise during that period.</P>
    <P>The Government have been reviewing the operations of the cheap fuel scheme during the winter months, and it is our intention and our confident expectation that an improved system can be brought into operation in the coming winter.  I have made it clear to the House that the Government recognise the problems and needs of lower income families and the difficulties posed for them by any significant increase in energy costs.  They are some of the reasons why the Government have been approaching the matter in a particular way and therefore <Col N="591" /> why at this juncture we would not feel it appropriate to accept the motion but rather to advocate our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the Minister outlining the difficulties which confront him and the Government in regard to solving this problem and the problems of the overall economy.  He has told us of certain approaches which the Government are contemplating.  He is a master at using vague language.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago we had what came to be known as the national understanding, and now we have Government approaches to try to solve the problems we have been discussing tonight.  At one stage the Minister said,&ldquo;That would be the Government's approach&rdquo;&mdash;the conditional &ldquo;would&rdquo;, not &ldquo;will&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister is doing his best, but we know that for some reason his &ldquo;would&rdquo; will never become &ldquo;will&rdquo;, unless something drastic happens.  The motion deplores the 20 per cent increase in ESB charges, which is unprecedented.  Of course the Minister comes along to tell us that electricity consumers enjoyed two decreases in ESB charges in the past two years.  That is so.</P>
      <P>I was present during a Dáil debate on a Private Members' motion more than a year ago when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley announced his delight that a 5 per cent reduction in ESB charges had been possible.  Neither he nor the Minister present tonight told us that that reduction came about not through any Government action but simply as a result of a reduction in energy costs in the world market and the position of the dollar <i>versus</i> sterling.  The reduction came about under the fuel variation cost, and the Government had not one iota of input in the reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be hardship as a result of this unprecedented increase.  The Minister knows it, the country knows it and those who will be hardest hit know it.  It is now a question of what can be done to ease that hardship, of what can be done to avoid at least part of it.  We have been given certain ideas about how <Col N="592" /> this would be done, not how it will be done if the Government see fit to do anything about anything.  The Minister gave a reason for the increase.  This was more typical of other members of his party and I am sorry to see him sliding into that habit tonight.  The only reason he gave was the increased cost of energy.  I happen to know, and so does the Minister, that the energy cost element in this 20 per cent increase accounts for only 40 per cent of the increase, according to the ESB themselves. In other words, 8 per cent overall is made up of increased fuel costs.  It means that 60 per cent of the increase was accounted for by other increased costs for other reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us blandly that the increases are all due to increased energy costs, implying that nothing can be done about it.  If that was true I would accept the Minister's statement, but it is not.  The Government, while they may not be responsible for the 60 per cent, should have control over the reasons that resulted in 60 per cent of that increase but they do not seem to have that control over the major portion of the increased cost.  The Minister, because of the sparseness of his reasoning on this issue, could not give us the reasons for the increased cost involved other than the increased cost of fuel.  However, he gave us the result of this increased cost and told us that extraordinary and extravagant claims were made for the effect of a 20 per cent hike in ESB charges.  He pointed out that we were in reality talking about one third of a percentage point on the CPI.  However, that is only one element.  I should like to know if the Minister was talking about the resultant effect of this increase when it works its way through the economy and if he took into account also the direct effect of the consumer having to pay 20 per cent extra on his ESB charge. I do not think he took the latter into account. The former point will have its effect as production costs increase through the economy resulting in all of us paying more for all manufactured and agricultural products and for anything for which power is used.  The Minister's assertion that the price increase was due to oil costs only is unfair and inaccurate. <Col N="593" /> I hope he did not intend to mislead anybody.</P>

      <P>We are sliding into a dangerous area here.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, seem to be accepting the fact that any increase now can be hung on the peg of increased oil costs.  I have a fear that people may abuse this factor and seek increases beyond those which they would normally be entitled to, because they can say that everything is due to massively increased energy costs.  The sooner the message gets home to people that everything cannot be blamed on increased oil costs, the better.  The Minister appears to be saying that the whole thing has gone out of control because we do not produce oil and therefore costs resulting from this factor are uncontrollable.  That is what is happening and the Ministers concerned do not appear to be taking any notice of this trend.  I saw a reference in newspapers recently to the possibility of a 20 per cent increase in the price of a commodity used in the building industry and again the increase in the price of oil was blamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further disturbing feature of this is <Col N="594" /> that we are talking about areas where there is no competition.  The Minister, in referring to a statement by the International Energy Agency, seemed to suggest that the only way to get conservation is to allow prices to rise, to price the commodity beyond the reach of the consumer and then the consumer will conserve. We have been told that some of the reasons for the increases are outside our control, and I accept that, but there are other factors involved.  The Minister touched on what could be done in relation to social welfare recipients and lower paid workers in order to relieve the hardship they will undoubtedly face as a result of this and other increased costs. He mentioned again his Government's position on subsidies.  On at least two other occasions the Minister made a similar policy statement.  The Minister's statement seems to be a foolish choice. There is no argument here about the undesirable effects of permanent subsidies for any commodity; we all accept that they should not be permanent.  The Minister has consistently said, however, that where certain circumstances were present&mdash;he mentioned the reasoning behind the introduction of subsidies by the National Coalition which, he suggested, was at the behest of Fianna Fáil&mdash;subsidies were relevant.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that last year inflation was down to 8 per cent and that that was a classic situation where the removal of subsidies was the obvious course of action.  I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister on that point, but the Minister knows that that is not the present situation and was very careful not to mention his opinion of the current rate of inflation.  I presume most people are aware that the figure for the last quarter, mid-November to mid-February, showed an increase in the consumer price index of 4.2.  I am not suggesting that this can be multiplied by four to give an annual rating of 16.8&mdash;this figure is possible but I hope it will not come about.  We definitely have double figure inflation at present and the Minister now gives the same reason for the withdrawal of subsidies as he gave when the figure was 8 per cent.  There is something illogical, irrational and foolish about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> I am not in favour of subsidies across the board, or permanent subsidies, as a feature of our economic life.  They are undesirable, damaging and give a false impression.  The Minister, in this context, amused me by mentioning using artificial methods.  I presume he was not talking about another Bill going through the House.  However, that is what it is&mdash;the subsidy could be called an economic contraceptive.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last week on the radio, concerning these increases, selective subsidies, in the very broadest sense.  This could be in the form of a direct payment to a selected group of people who need specific help or in the form of extra social welfare payments, as the Minister suggested would have been made if&mdash;and again there are conditions all along the line&mdash;the national understanding had been accepted.  The Minister is not unique in suggesting that increased social welfare payments would be paid at the end of the year, if the national understanding had been accepted, for the relief of hardship in relation to high fuel bills during winter.  In times of very high inflation the Coalition Government introduced supplementary increases in the autumn for social welfare recipients because we felt that that course was needed.  The time is again ripe for thinking along those lines.</P>
    <P>While you may relieve a certain category&mdash;the social welfare recipients who are known to the Minister and to other Departments, who can be named and numbered, and whose numbers are known there are many thousands with large families who are in full-time employment, whose incomes are so small that they are experiencing grave hardship because of this increased inflation. The problem is how to relieve that person.  He is in full-time employment; for some reason or other, he is getting an uneconomical income and he and his wife and family cannot survive.  He is not categorised by any Department as being disadvantaged socially, because of his <Col N="596" /> income.  He is a person for whom I have great sympathy and for whom something must be done.  The social welfare recipient can be recognised as in need of help.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned energy conservation and his only suggestion on that point was again to quote the international agency document.  That may sound very fine and may produce the right result in time; however, if you allow energy costs to go so high that many people cannot use electricity, or gas, or coal, or power of any sort, because of the prohibitive cost that is a negative approach to any form of conservation.  It may conserve and save energy, but we have to pay a very high price.  In 1979, in a country which boasts of economic growth&mdash;or used to in the past; it is now falling back it would be bad to allow energy costs to rise and enforce conservation in that manner.  There are more palatable ways to achieve the same result if&mdash;to use the Minister's term&mdash;the Government were in the mood to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>At the moment, insulation material is subject to 10 per cent VAT.  We have a Government appealing for conservation of energy and, at the same time, taking revenue, in the form of tax, from people who are trying to conserve energy. There is something contradictory about that kind of situation.  Some positive solution could be found, perhaps by abolishing VAT on insulation material, or, indeed, providing a grant to people who are prepared to provide insulation. It may be suggested that I proposed this to the Minister, but what probably will happen is that from here on the Minister for the Environment will insist on insulation being introduced into every new house in order to qualify for the infamous £1,000 grant&mdash;in other words, making it even more infamous and even less useful than it has been up to now.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Energy Council meeting in Brussels on 17 May 1979, Commissioner Brunner in replying to a statement made by me on the oil market and supply situation in Ireland indicated that the Commission would use their influence with the oil companies to provide increased supplies for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> On 6 June 1979 a representative of the Commission stated that the matter had been raised with representatives of the major oil companies who had given an assurance that supplies to Ireland would be improved.</P>
    <P>Measures aimed at improving the Community oil supply situation have recently been put forward by the Commission and are at present the subject of consideration at Council level.</P>
    <P>55.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposal made by the Deputy to Commissioner Brunner.  It seems a matter which should, in the first instance, be considered by the Commission and I feel that a statement by me is not called for at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arranging to have a review carried out of the likely supply-demand situation during the coming winter for all forms of energy including, of course, the oil sector.</P>
      <P>In this connection consultations have already taken place with representatives of certain fuel supplies.  I propose to have this survey extended and completed during the next couple of months so that an over-view of the likely situation will be available to me.  Pending completion of this review it would be premature to make the kind of general forecast suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any responsible comment made at this time about likely oil supplies for the coming winter must emphasise that there are a number of factors, unclear at this stage, which could affect the position.  It <Col N="514" /> appears likely, however, that some shortages will persist particularly in relation to gas-diesel oil.  If that proves to be the case I will continue to ensure that the reasonable requirements of the more essential users are supplied.  People who use such oils for domestic central heating should prudently consider making provision for some kind of non-electrical heating to supplement any shortfall in their oil requirements that may arise in the winter months.</P>

    <P>Information on the number of houses which will be built by each housing authority in 1979 is not available in my Department.  Approximately 80 per cent of all local authority housing schemes are &ldquo;developed&rdquo; schemes, that is to say comprising 60 houses or less.  Under devolved procedures, it is a matter for each housing authority to determine when individual schemes will start and be completed, having regard to the priority awarded to each scheme in their housing programme and to the capital allocation made to the authority.  I am satisfied that with the capital allocations provided, local authority housing completions overall will be of the same order as in 1978, when 6,073 houses were completed.</P>
