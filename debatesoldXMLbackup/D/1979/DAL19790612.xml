    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the controls which are operated by most creameries and pasteurising plants are effective, it is not proposed to introduce an official testing system for the presence of antibiotic residues in milk.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he accepts the judgment of the International Energy Agency in their report published on 6 June 1979 regarding this country's performance in the conservation of oil and other energy sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The report referred to includes a detailed report on the energy policies of individual IEA member states including Ireland and an overall assessment of their energy policies taken as a whole.  The detailed report on Ireland gives a factual account of our energy programme and makes certain recommendations for further action.  Some of these have already been put into effect and others are still under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the overall assessment we are grouped with six other countries &mdash;Austria, Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg, Spain and Switzerland&mdash;which <Col N="8" /> are stated to have inadequate energy conservation programmes.  It should be remembered that one of the main objectives of the International Energy Agency is to reduce dependence on imported oil by promoting strong energy conservation programmes in all member states.  I do not think we could even hope to get to the stage where the agency would say that our efforts were adequate but I would point out that in the detailed report the agency stated that there was a definite improvement in our programme compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Estimates provision for energy conservation in this current year is £422,000.  In addition I have asked the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to expand their energy conservation programme very considerably and an increase in their budget of some £300,000 is being prepared.  The attempts being made by this country to improve energy conservation are, therefore, not to be denigrated and it will be a matter of concern to us to ensure that any savings which we can achieve are matched by the large and richer members of the IEA whose little-restrained demand for petroleum has been the subject of very serious criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that of the seven countries, of which we were one, that came in for this criticism, only Belgium and Luxembourg among the others are members like ourselves of the European Community?  Along with the Belgians and Luxembourgers we are the only ones who came into this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All the countries concerned are members of the IEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>But the European Community have repeatedly stressed in their own right the importance of energy conservation. It is a poor thing that we should be in this basket along with Belgium and Luxembourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the IEA have seen fit to exclude from their rather mild strictures to these seven countries, certain larger ones whose consumption <Col N="9" /> of oil would far exceed the seven countries put together.  I hope that the IEA will be able in the near future to have their guidelines followed by all their member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <P>I am satisfied that supplies of petrol are being distributed to motorists in as fair and equitable a manner as is possible in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that the orders made by me last month have contributed materially to the easing in the past week or so of the supply difficulties previously experienced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a rough public consensus would be to the effect that the petrol queues reached their worst in the weekend of 25, 26 and 27 May, ten days after the introduction of this measure?  Will the Minister therefore agree that the ostensible target of this measure, namely the toppers up, were not at fault at all in the creation of this shortage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's conclusion.  The days to which <Col N="12" /> the Deputy refers were days immediately preceding a long holiday weekend and it was well known that a large number of motorists would seek to get as much petrol as they could in those days.  Since that weekend the position has eased considerably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that the situation has eased somewhat.  Is the Minister now saying that the reason why the measures of 15 May in regard to maximum quantities did not put an end to the shortage is that people were hoarding petrol?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

The Deputy may be aware that there have been some prosecutions, and as far as I am aware some others are in train.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocations for this month are greater than those for last month and there is now a greater awareness of the problem.  There has been a cut-back in recent weeks in unnecessary motoring for which we should all be grateful.  Between those factors and the increased allocation I am hopeful that there will be no serious problems.  Obviously, it is likely in all the circumstances that there will probably be localised problems.  One can give no guarantee that that will not happen. However, it is a situation that we share with several other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of garages are closed.  In some cases it may be due to the fact that they do not have petrol but in other cases it could be because they have sold out their allocations quickly.  In other cases it may be due to the proprietor deciding not to open.  I certainly encourage filling stations which are in a position to do so to remain open as long as they reasonably can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>An assessment of the overall contribution to petrol saving arising from the reduced speed limit is difficult for a number of reasons.  A major factor is that a large proportion of motoring is done at speeds substantially below 55 mph.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of the brand name.  It is a matter of their being able to sell petrol that is delivered to them by this very small company at a different price from that at which they sell normally.  The way that it operated was that they sold their normal brand of petrol during the week, their tanks, I understand, were empty by Friday evening, and on Saturdays and Sundays they sold the other brand.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole  Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Toole</b> asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will make a statement on the conclusion of the appointment of Mr. Austin Kennan as Examiner of Restrictive Practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall from time to time appoint a person who shall be known as Examiner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> The Second Schedule to the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that:</P>
    <P>the term of office, which shall not exceed five years, shall be fixed by the Minister when making the appointment.</P>
    <P>These provisions entrust to me the choice of person to be appointed as examiner and also specify the maximum period for which an appointment can be made.  The Act does not confer on any holder of the office any entitlement to reappointment on the expiry of the period for which he has been appointed or reappointed.  In 1978 when Mr. Kennan's initial five-year appointment came to an end I decided to reappoint him for one year only.  Before the end of that year I had come to the conclusion that I should not further extend Mr. Kennan's term of office.  It was then open to him to return to his former civil service post of principal in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy but instead he chose to retire on pension from the public service.</P>
    <P>Certain developments subsequent to the intimation to Mr. Kennan that it was not proposed to reappoint him as examiner have reinforced me in the view that the decision not to reappoint him was in the circumstances the correct one.</P>
    <P>Arising from the press statements on 6 and 7 June attributed to Mr. Kennan, and statements made by him on radio and television, I should like to say to the House that</P>
    <P>&mdash;there has been no attempt to take away from the Office of the Examiner any of the powers conferred on it by the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Mergers, Monopolies and Take-overs (Control) Act, 1978; if it were proposed to make any such change amending legislation would be necessary and the Oireachtas would have the opportunity to review the position in full, as they had in 1972;</P>
    <P>&mdash;no pressures were exerted on me from any quarter to have Mr. Kennan removed from office or not to renew his appointment;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" />&mdash;neither I nor the officers of my Department sought to interfere with his independence in the discharge of his functions as examiner;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the claim by Mr. Kennan that, in commenting to certain journalists on his report to me under the Mergers, Monopolies and Take-overs (Control) Act, 1978, on a recent take-over proposal, he was conveying information that the public had a right to know is something that I cannot accept; Mr. Kennan's action then&mdash;less than 48 hours after he had been told of my intention not to reappoint him&mdash;constituted a breach of confidentiality which could have serious consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the difficulties between Mr. Kennan and the Minister and his Department go back a good deal further than the incident to which the Minister alluded last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, it is deplorable and it could well have serious consequences that a public official should pass public comment on the financial status of a company which had to make application to me under the Mergers, Monopolies and Take-overs (Control) Act, whereupon I decided to refer the proposal to the examiner for a report as envisaged by that Act.  The Act itself makes it very clear that all dealings which a company has under the Act are confidential and that the private affairs, whether financial or otherwise, of such a company will not under any circumstances be disclosed.</P>

      <Col N="60" /> SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 18, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Nothing in the foregoing subsection shall be construed as purporting to deprive any person of any right of action which, but for the enactment of the foregoing subsection, he would have had, if such right of action is founded on the alleged denial of, or failure to respect, a constitutional or natural personal right.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In introducing this amendment, I wish to recapitulate to the House the point I tried to make during the debate on Second Stage.  I was focusing then on the character of this Bill as an indemnity Bill for retrospective validation.  I made the point that the question whether it was constitutionally possible in this country to make retrospectively legal that which is illegal has not yet been squarely faced and decided by the courts.  We have had at least one indemnity Act after the civil war and there have been a lot of other Bills and Acts which contain sections which retrospectively validate this or that.  However, the constitutionality of this, where a grievance can arise, has never yet been tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Second Stage that I recognised that any Government, within reason, must have a chance to validate situations which, because of a technical flaw, are invalid.  I accept that.  A Government would be working with a very severe obstacle if the law did not allow for such a thing to be done.  Also, retrospective validation may possibly change the legal situation of individuals; and that perhaps is unavoidable.  The problem arises where the situation of the individual is one where he wants to litigate, where he wants to bring an action. I raised the point last day here of the distinction between things Mr. McLaughlin may have done in the perfectly honest discharge of what he believed to be his legal function as Commissioner, <Col N="61" /> of a kind which were not likely to aggrieve anybody and, on the other hand, things he may have done which may have aggrieved people.  I gave the instance&mdash;whether it is a good one or not I do not know&mdash;of regulations which he may have made in regard to restrictive parking areas or something like that, which, in their nature, do not give rise to much litigation and about which I could see no great problem if there were retrospective umbrella legitimacy for this type of regulation, even though they were a year old and made at the time without lawful authority.  On the other side, which is a good deal more difficult, is what to do when something which the Commissioner did in the line of duty, or what Mr. McLaughlin did in good faith, thinking it was his legal duty to do it, may, in its nature, have given rise to a grievance: for example, the promotion of X and the exclusion of Y, or the admission of X to a taxi driver's licence and the exclusion of Y, either because Y feels he is being wrongfully excluded, or because, perhaps, an existing taxi driver, or numbers of taxi drivers feel that their business is being prejudiced by the admission of an excessive number of new taxi drivers.  These are functions which the Garda Commissioner discharges. These are cases where one can well imagine that a disappointed applicant for promotion or a disappointed applicant for a taxi licence may have had a sense of grievance but may have grinned and borne it at the time thinking that he had no remedy.  Now he may discover, a year later, that the gentleman who in good faith made this ruling or decision from which he feels he suffered had no lawful authority to make it at all. Perhaps he now thinks that he has a good chance to have this set aside and get the courts to oblige the proper Commissioner, now that he is confirmed in his job, to go through the process again and reopen the competition or whatever.</P>
    <P>There the question of whether we can validate or legalise that which was illegal or had no lawful authority arises in an acute form.  If we pass the Bill as it stands we are purporting to deprive of a right of action persons who at present have a right of action or, if they were to realise their situation, may have a right <Col N="62" /> of action.  I realise that any retrospective validation is potentially capable of depriving someone of a right of action. Anyone who relies on an illegality or feels he can complain about an illegality is deprived of a potential right of action, even if he never intended to take an action, if that illegality is not made legal. That is clear.  At the same time I do not see how a state, if it is to do business, can avoid that kind of rough operation. The point my amendment is trying to get at is when the right of action which we are purporting to put off relates to something which is more than just an ordinary action in tort or contract, when it relates to a constitutional or what the courts are now calling a natural person right, I do not think this House, the other House and the President between them have power to deprive people of their right of access to the courts to assert that constitutional or natural personal right.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Second Stage I said, on the question of earning a livelihood, that the courts have now asserted there is such a thing as a personal right of a citizen to earn a livelihood. That involved a declaration by the courts that he has an ancillary right to prepare for a career, train for it and so on.  In the context of a hierarchical livelihood, namely one in the civil service or in the police force, I have no doubt that the courts would say, if they were asked, that there was implicit in it a right to a fair and equal chance of promotion.  I am not trying to stir up trouble and I am sure the Minister would not allege such a thing, but supposing a sergeant disappointed in an inspectorship examination or a garda disappointed in a sergeant examination now finds that the decision under which he was unsuccessful was made, albeit in good faith, by an officer who was not the officer he thought he was, that person could have a right of action related to his constitutional right to a livelihood.  I do not say he would win his action.  In 99 cases out of 100 he would probably lose. Quite likely it would be held that no injustice had been done to him.  Quite likely, if the competition was held all over again, the outcome would be exactly the same.  I am not making any other assertion. <Col N="63" /> However, at present he has a potential right of action and it is one related to a value in his life which the courts regard as a central personal right.  The Dáil, Seanad and President would be slow to legislate in a way which would incontinently cut off rights of action of this kind.  It may be that there are other rights of action we cannot avoid cutting off, but where this very sensitive area is concerned we should legislate with care.</P>
    <P>We are specifically prohibited by Article 15, section 4, from legislating to any effect which is repugnant to the Constitution: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to this Constitution or any provision thereof&rdquo;.  That provision has been made little of in this House on occasion. Before I entered the House it was made little of by the party who are now in office in regard to the Livestock Marts Bill, when it was repeatedly said to them by this side of the House that the Bill was unconstitutional.  They paid no attention, but in due course it was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  In another instance in 1970&mdash;admittedly there was no contention between the sides then, my party were at the time anxious to facilitate the party in Government&mdash;the Dáil and Seanad passed the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Procedure) Bill which was intended to facilitate the inquiries of the committee into the disappearance of £100,000 of public money during the Northern Ireland crisis of 1969-70.  That Bill passed through both Houses in one day.  It carried a fatal flaw in it for which I must accept some of the blame.  If I had sat down and studied it for five minutes I would have spotted it.  I did not do so.  I was so carried along by the euphoria of total inter-party collaboration in trying to get the Bill through both Houses in order to facilitate the committee, I do not believe I ever read the Bill properly. That legislation was in due course shot down by the Supreme Court to the embarrassment and humiliation of the then Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Not every right to litigate can be protected.  Any retrospective validation <Col N="64" /> will cut off some of these rights.  The right to litigate, which carries on its back the right to a livelihood, the right to some personal constitutional value which the courts have recognised, cannot be incontinently cut off.  It is to try to preserve such rights that I have inserted this proposed section.  If we enact it, it will be seen that the Dáil is conscious of its obligation not to legislate across constitutional boundaries and are conscious also of the duty laid on the State by Article 40, section 3, not only to respect but to defend and to vindicate the personal rights of citizens.  If there is a remote chance of anybody feeling that a personal right has been bruised by a Bill of this kind, which purports to make legal that which is now illegal, we ought to include a saver of this kind to spare us the reproach of having ridden roughshod over its possibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment not because of any disagreement with the sentiment it expresses but because I have received very firm and positive legal advice to the effect that, firstly, it is unnecessary and, secondly, that its acceptance would be positively undesirable. I am advised that, in effect, section I could not be construed as purporting to deprive a person of a constitutional right of any nature.  It is clearly set out in the Constitution, in Article 15, section 4, that the Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution and that any such law shall, but to the extent only of such repugnancy, be invalid. It has been clearly established by the courts that laws passed by the Oireachtas are presumed to accord with the Constitution unless they cannot reasonably be construed as being in accord. Further, it is not necessary to accept from legislation what would be unconstitutional, as the Deputy will appreciate. The Constitution has already done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To add to a section a proviso that said &ldquo;This section does not permit anything to be done which would be repugnant to the Constitution&rdquo; is unnecessary.  If a provision purported to take away from a person any of his constitutional rights, it <Col N="65" /> would be invalid.  In other words, without the suggested amendment the section must be construed as not purporting to deprive any person of a constitutional right.  Further, I am advised that to put into a Bill an amendment of the nature proposed would be highly undesirable both as a precedent and as bordering on the improper.  To repeat in delegated legislation what is already in the parent Act is normally looked upon as <i>ultra vires</i>.  It would be undesirable, to say the least, to repeat in legislation what is already in the Constitution.  The section as it stands does not purport to take away any constitutional right from any person.</P>
    <P>If in any situation it could be shown that any validation brought about by the section would adversely affect a constitutional right, then the section to that extent&mdash;and to that extent alone&mdash;does not apply.  This, then, is the legal advice available to me, which indicates why the amendment is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I may add however, that apart from the fundamental objections which are mentioned in that advice and which I have now described to the House, there are further technical aspects of this amendment which would render it defective in certain respects.  However, because the amendment must fall on the major grounds already mentioned, I do not propose to detain the House with details of those additional technical points unless the Deputy would wish to hear them, in which case I will be only too glad to mention them.  I would emphasise that they are in my view only peripheral points on which agreement would not be difficult to find if the fundamental objections already mentioned did not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected that the Minister would take this line.  The Minister is now doing something which is a much more dangerous precedent.  He is now falling back on a purely constructional approach, which the courts have adopted here in the last ten years or so, as permitting him or permitting any Minister or permitting the House not to bother about the Constitution on the grounds that, if they breach it, it would be void <Col N="66" /> anyway.  What the Minister is now saying is that, even if the effect of the Bill if enacted into law as introduced would be to prevent people or to purport to prevent them, which is the expression I used, from bringing actions to assert this or that kind of right, in that event the Bill itself would be a nullity.  The Minister has no right to produce a Bill in this House and sy complacently that, to the extent that this Bill may work unconstitutionally, it is a nullity but that we knew that all along.  Of course we knew that all along.  The Minister could be easily supplied by the very same advisers who have given him the note which he has just read with plenty of examples of Acts which contain provisos and savers of all kinds intended to show that the Oireachtas in making the enactment has respected a particular constitutional value.</P>
      <P>There are Acts about adoption, Acts about the custody of children and Acts about criminal procedure in which there are all kinds of savers about the welfare of children and about hearing both sides. The Extradition Act is an instance in which it is specifically provided that before somebody against whom an extradition order is made can be extradited he must be left in the country for a certain number of days.  Of course that is not specifically necessary because to shuffle him out of the country forthwith is unconstitutional&mdash;so the Supreme Court said in the case of the State, Quinn v. Ryan.  But that did not stop this House from legislating about extradition specifically to incorporate a provision which made sure that that unconstitutionality, so far as this House was concerned, could never come about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point.  It is an absolutely new thing and, although the Minister's well written note makes it clear that he is being very well served by the people who are advising him, I am very surprised that they did not advert to the fact when they were briefing him that this is a new complacency.  The Minister might as well be telling the House that whenever any Deputy here spots a potential constitutional flaw in a section he is only wasting his breath in mentioning it because, according to the Constitution, <Col N="67" /> it will not be law and that if it is unconstitutional the courts will not enforce it anyway.  It is not the business of this House to throw its burden on the courts. This House, like any other organ of the State, has to do its own job as it sees best and it must act inside its own sphere as though there were no such thing as a court in the country.  It must act on the supposition that there may be a citizen affected by it who may never get to court, to whom something irrevocable might happen before he is able to assert his rights effectively.  Whilst I see the line that the Minister is working on, namely, that the courts to the extent that this may work unconstitutionally, will regard it as a nullity, that does not relieve the Minister and the House of the necessity of making sure that this Bill is <i>ex facie</i> visibly in conformity with the Constitution when it leaves this House.  At the moment, although I do not think there is anything sinister behind the Minister's point of view, in my view it is visibly possible, at least on one construction of this Bill which we ought to avoid if we can, to interpret it in such a way as to deprive someone of an important personal or constitutional right, or the right to litigate, the right to assert that right which he at this moment still has.</P>
    <P>In regard to the technical points, if they are purely technical points about my drafting I will take the Minister's word, but I must say that simply as an academic matter I would be interested to know what is wrong with it without any desire to contest it.</P>

      <Col N="68" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section I stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is only one section in this Bill and what it proposes to do is to validate everything that Mr. McLaughlin did in his capacity as Commissioner between 28 January 1978 and 14 May 1979.  The Bill says that everything he did is to be validated retrospectively.  As I said on Second Stage, retrospective legislation at any time is undesirable and should be discouraged.</P>
      <P>What I am afraid of is that this retrospective validation may in fact be validating acts done by the Commissioner which resulted in somebody being convicted in a court of law and being now in prison.  The amendment put down by Deputy Kelly and now withdrawn sought to preserve any personal or constitutional rights.  Is the Minister prepared to go through all the acts done by Mr. McLaughlin on the dates covered by the Bill to see if any act done by him resulted in anybody losing his liberty or resulted in anybody being convicted?  Will he also check to see whether or not there is any person now in prison as a result of any action taken by Mr. McLaughlin between those dates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Minister to do that.  If he finds that there is such a person or persons in prison as result of some act done by Mr. McLaughlin, will he release that person forthwith?  Surely the Minister is not telling the House that he could cure a defective proof in a criminal prosecution retrospectively.  I say that he could not constitutionally do that.  The type of case I have in mind is where an extension of the time from 24 to 48 hours during which a person may be detained has been granted under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  If the detention of such a person was extended by a Superintendent on the authority of the Commissioner I believe that detention to be illegal.  It is my belief also that if such a person made a statement during the second 24-hour period of detention and was convicted on foot <Col N="69" /> of that statement he would have been convicted on a defective proof, on inadmissible evidence.  Such a person should now be released.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has instituted an inquiry within the Department to make sure that nobody is being held in prison illegally at present. It is possible that there are other instances of people having being convicted on foot of actions taken by the Commissioner when he was not in fact the proper Commissioner of the Garda Siochána.  I should like to know if the Minister has carried out any sort of investigation in the Department in relation to that matter.  My view is that the Bill is a lazy man's way of getting over a difficulty created by the Minister who wrongfully dismissed a Garda Commissioner and improperly appointed another.  The Minister used the most incomprehensible language possible in the Bill to tell us that everything done by the new Commissioner is covered.  It is hard for a person with some legal training to follow some of the language in the Bill.  I should like to know if any suspect was detained in custody for 48 hours on the authority of a Garda Superintendent authorised by Mr. McLaughlin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points raised by the Deputy were referred to by him on Second Stage but I am sure that what Deputy Fitzpatrick said when expressing his view as a lawyer deserves attention.  I do not think anybody likes retrospective legislation but I should like to state that this is not the first such Bill that has been presented to the Dáil. Some substantial weight must be given to the fact that provision in the Constitution, Article 15.5, states:</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a prohibition on one specific type of retrospective legislation.  I should like to put the point that that in itself is a fairly strong argument for the proposition that other kinds of retrospective legislation are not prohibited unless they <Col N="70" /> offend in some other ways.  It was suggested that instead of having a single section as is proposed we should have a Schedule setting out specific acts or types of acts done by Mr. McLaughlin since he took over which require validation. I should like to tell Deputy Fitzpatrick that I do not think this is necessary or is practical.  I do not think it would be desirable if he means that only certain specified acts should be validated.  The reason I do not think it would be practical to have a Schedule is that it would be virtually impossible to be certain that one thought of all the acts or decisions that might be called in question by somebody sometime.  As I stated previously, I gave the ones I believed had any significance and I did not deliberately omit anything affecting the general public.  I did not deal with internal disciplinary decisions for the reasons I have mentioned; they are internal Garda matters and anybody who thinks he was adversely affected needs no advice from me, or from this House, as to what he should do.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that there is something unfair about members of a Government introducing a validating Statute when a private individual who has been found not to have adopted some particular procedure has to accept the consequences.  I do not think Deputies would want to argue that the two situations are at all comparable. This validating Bill is not being introduced for my benefit or that of the Government but in the public interest because it is the public interest that would suffer if people succeeded by the use of what most people would call technical points to invalidate actions on grounds that had nothing to do with the merits of those actions.  The principle I am advocating in the Bill is that it is clearly in the public interest that Parliament ensure, as far as possible, that an issue that has no relevance whatsoever to the rights or wrongs of any of the acts of Mr. McLaughlin should not be allowed to create a serious uncertainty in many areas.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill does not interfere with the Constitutional rights of anybody.  The Bill is to be interpreted <Col N="71" /> subject to the Constitution and once that is acknowledged I suggest that there is no valid reason for fearing that it can do anybody an injustice.  I was asked if I had conducted a detailed study of the acts done by Mr. McLaughlin and my reply to that question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  My advice is that such a study would be impossible. It would be outside anybody's capacity to do such a thing.</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows that in my opening statement I said that if any situation should arise in which it could be shown that any validation brought about by the section would adversely affect a constitutional right, to that extent and to that extent only the section does not apply. Whether or not such a situation arose in relation to any particular instance in the final analysis would fall to the courts for determination.  The Bill does not in any way interfere with the jurisdiction of the courts.  With regard to the admissibility or inadmissibility of statements, the Deputy knows better than I that that is entirely a matter for the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister referred to Article 15.5 of the Constitution, which has nothing to do with the argument I was making.  The Minister shall be very aware of that.  Article 15.5 of the Constitution provides that the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
      <P>That means the Oireachtas shall not make something a criminal offence as on 1 January 1978 if as the law stood on that date it was not a criminal offence. Whatever I might accuse the Minister of doing, or suspect him of doing, I would not go so far as to say he would even think of doing that.  It is so outrageous that no Minister for Justice or no Oireachtas would think of enforcing that sort of law.  The Article talks about creating retrospective offences.  My worry is about curing defective proofs in criminal prosecutions retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's reply I consider it to have been vague and of a waffling nature.  I would go so far as to <Col N="72" /> say it was in the nature of a smokescreen.  I asked the Minister a number of straight questions and I should like him to answer them.  I agree it would be a trojan task for the Minister to go back over everything Mr. McLaughlin did in his capacity as Commissioner, as he thought he was, between 20 January 1978 and 14 January 1919.  That would be a very onerous job indeed.  A commissioner has categories of functions and duties, some of them dealing with the appointment of members of the Garda Síochána.  The Minister stressed that. Apparently he must admit a recruit into the Garda and the recruit does not become a garda until he is admitted by the commissioner.  That is understandable. There is nothing wrong with validating that.</P>
    <P>A commissioner has authority to promote people from the position of ordinary garda to sergeant.  Apparently the sole discretion and the sole authority for doing that rests with him.  People might have doubts about that and some garda might say: &ldquo;Another commissioner might have promoted me.&rdquo;  There is nothing of a major nature about that. The same is the case in a promotion from sergeant to inspector.  There are also bye-laws, and so on, but there are sensitive areas like the signing of certificates under certain Acts of the Oireachtas making certain matters evidence in courts of law.  That might be done by the commissioner or by somebody else on the authority of the commissioner.</P>
    <P>People may have been convicted in courts of law, either in courts of summary jurisdiction or on indictment before a judge and jury, and if it had been known at the time of their trial that Mr. McLaughlin was not a commissioner of the Garda they would have had a perfect defence and the district justice would have had to dismiss the case or the judge would have had to direct the jury to acquit.  The facts are that this man was not a commissioner of the Garda because the Government and the Minister did not carry out the law as it then was.</P>
    <P>Somebody may have been tried before <Col N="73" /> the Special Criminal Court and part of the evidence before the court may have been a certificate signed by the commissioner or by somebody on the authority of the commissioner.  I mentioned a specific case and I should like to come back to it.  Somebody may have been detained in custody for over 24 hours on the authority of the commissioner or on the authority of a superintendent of the Garda designated or appointed by Mr. McLaughlin to exercise that function.</P>
    <P>There are sensitive areas.  We are dealing with the constitutional rights of people. We are dealing with the liberty of people.  We are dealing with whether people have been rightfully or wrongfully convicted of a criminal offence.  I do not think it is asking too much of a Government and a Minister for Justice who have been found by our highest tribunal to have wrongfully dismissed one commissioner and, it follows, to have wrongfully appointed another, to suggest that they should go into the sensitive areas and find out did Mr. McLaughlin do anything in regard to a prosecution in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Special Criminal Court which led to the conviction of any party. If it had been known at the time that he was not a commissioner of the Garda this would have afforded an absolute defence to the person charged and would have secured his acquittal immediately. There is no way this House can cure defective proofs like that if those proofs were defective.  It is not good enough for a Minister who has bungled the dismissal of a Minister for Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;the dismissal of a commissioner of the Garda and bungled the appointment of another commissioner to say the law is there.  They cannot take away any constitutional rights of a person and say he can get his lawyers to find out if he has been wrongfully convicted or wrongfully imprisoned and come back to the courts and they will let him out.  That is the case the Minister is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> I do not think that is good enough coming from the mouth of a Minister who has acted as he has been found to have acted by the Supreme Court.  I go further and say there is an onus on such a Minister and his Department to check the position, to check the files.  There are not thousands of these files.  There are not even hundreds of them and there is no use in saying there are.  There are probably only some dozens of the type of case I am thinking of but there is an onus on the Minister and his Department to check every file relating to cases where this sort of situation could arise. At the time of elections there are very often re-counts when the issues are not nearly as important as is the issue here.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for raising this matter.  The question of whether I approve of what subversives are doing does not arise but there is involved the principle of the taking away of a man's liberty on the basis of defective proof. The Minister has not told me whether there has been any check in his Department under the two headings I have raised.  There is the question of all actions of the Commissioner in regard to the detention of suspects, in regard to the initiation of prosecutions and in regard to the presentation of proof to the courts.  I might have a different view if I got from the Minister an unqualified assurance that all these areas had been checked carefully and that during the 16 or 18 months involved Mr. McLaughlin did not act in any of those cases but that if he did act no person was prosecuted or convicted on the basis of his proof.  I have not had any such assurance. Indeed, the contrary has been the case. The Minister said he had not made any such investigation or check.</P>
    <P>I regard this section as a very important precedent because we have had a statement from the Minister to the effect that there have been precedents for validating legislation.  Perhaps that is so but is not this almost tantamount to validating the wrongful appointment of a judge?  If a person were convicted by a judge who had been appointed wrongly, that person should be released immediately. If anybody has been convicted on proof provided on the <Col N="75" /> authority or on the signature of Mr. McLaughlin during the period in question, that person should be pardoned immediately. If he is in prison he should be released immediately or if any such person has been released he should be compensated immediately.  I am not trying to be mischievous in raising this matter. I do not like the section.  It is too allembracing and too simple.  It was frightening on the last occasion here that the Minister should have had the nerve to ask for all Stages on the same day and to appear to be annoyed because we would not agree.</P>
    <P>Section 1 begins:</P>
    <P>Everything (including the satisfying of any condition precedent to the exercise or performance of a power or duty) done, ...</P>
    <P>I should like to hear what type of condition precedent the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>or purporting to have been done, during the period from the 20th day of January, 1978 to the 14th day of May, 1979, by, to or on behalf or in respect of Patrick McLaughlin or any other person shall be, and be deemed always to have been, as valid and effectual as if the said Patrick McLaughlin had been validly and effectually appointed to be Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on the said 20th day of January 1978. ...</P>
    <P>That is what we are being invited to do. This omnibus blanket-like validation could be validating defective proofs. What the Minister is saying is that defective proofs in criminal cases cannot be validated and that it is for the person who has a grievance to refer to the Constitution, to find himself lawyers and to go back to the courts to be cleared.  That should not be necessary.  The person who is on the defensive here is the Minister who is asking for retrospective validation.  He is the one who should come here with clean hands saying that he had done everything possible to ensure that nobody has suffered a wrong as a result of his blunder.  The Minister is asking for a concession.  He is telling us <Col N="76" /> that the Government made a mistake and that we are being asked to help clear up the mess that resulted.  In such circumstances the Minister should not have been aggrieved because we would not agree on the last occasion to let him have all Stages of the Bill on the one day.  He would have liked to have had the whole matter cleared up in half an hour.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have been in a position to tell us that, for instance, there is a file in the Department or in the commissioner's department dealing with the initiation of prosecutions in criminal cases which had been checked and that everything was clear.  He should have been in a position to tell us, for instance, that a file dealing with the detention of persons for periods longer than the period laid down in the Constitution for the detention of suspected persons had been checked and that again he was satisfied that nobody had suffered or was likely to suffer any wrong in that regard.  The Minister should have checked out the files relating to all prosecutions in the courts between the dates in question in which the intervention of the Commissioner, either directly or indirectly, could have been a necessary proof.  That is the sort of approach that we should have had.  Instead, the approach so far has been to find out how quickly the legislation can be put on the Statute Book, how quickly this shameful, sorry and embarrassing episode can be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not have a great deal to fear even if he did produce a Schedule in the Bill or, if not that, if he did produce to the House the information which Deputy Fitzpatrick has requested.  So far as a prisoner is concerned whose extended custody now turns out to be illegal because of the purely technical flaw that the ultimate authority for it, namely the commissioner, was not in fact the commissioner, that kind of inadvertent breach of liberty is likely to be overlooked by the courts.  It is different if the breach is deliberate.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is right in saying that the Minister could make a clean breast of these matters.  I appreciate that the Minister has duties on <Col N="77" /> both sides.  Like the gobadán he has to watch all sides.  At the same time he has nothing particular to fear here if what is in his mind is detention which went on a bit longer than it ought to have done, having regard to the fact that the person who authorised it turns out not to have had the legal authority to authorise it. That is a perfectly good example of an inadvertent good faith case of a breach of right and would not necessarily invalidate the evidence which would result if a person made a statement during that extra period.  The Minister need not be too apprehensive about meeting it.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Fitzpatrick was speaking I was thinking of something that the Minister said on my amendment.  It is true that the courts will try to give a constitutional construction to a statute because they assume in favour of the Oireachtas that the Oireachtas did not intend an unconstitutional enactment.  In the operation of that presumption they give if possible a meaning to an Act which is consistent with the Constitution and if possible they ignore a construction which would not be consistent with it.  However, in the Haughey case which arose out of the Act passed here on the Committee of Public Accounts, the courts said that where, however, the constitutional situation simply is not reconcilable with the plain words of the Act, then they would not attempt to screw the Act out of shape, they would not put words into it which were not there and they would not torture it beyond the actual meaning which its words can be made to bear.</P>
      <P>The technique adopted here is as follows:</P>
      <P>Everything ... shall be, and be deemed always to have been as if he had been as valid and effectual as if ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could not be words more categorical than those.  Suppose some litigant presents himself, whether it is a prisoner who now finds, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has so eloquently put it, that one of the proofs on which he was convicted has a technical hole in it on which he is entitled to try and rely, or whether it is a disappointed police sergeant who has not <Col N="78" /> been made an inspector or a disappointed applicant for a taxi licence who has not been given one.  That person's situation is in plain collision with the words of section 1.  It is not possible to interpret section 1, without doing violence to its words, in such a way as to permit these persons&mdash;whether Deputy Fitzpatrick's prisoner or my would-be taxi drivers&mdash;to bring an action after the enactment of this Bill to assert his rights. I know that the Minister is being well and solidly advised that the courts have to make this presumption in favour of the House or the Oireachtas, but that presumption is not driven past the point where it does violence to the plain meaning of language.  The plain meaning of language here is that every single thing done by, on behalf of or for Patrick McLaughlin or anybody else is to be deemed&mdash;in other words, the courts have to take it whether we like it or not&mdash;as valid and effectual as if this illegality which we are talking about had never taken place.  That very absolute statement simply is not reconcilable with the continued surviving right of a prisoner or a disappointed taxi-driver to bring an action to have his rights asserted.</P>
    <P>What I have been saying related back to my amendment in a sense, but I hope that the Minister when he is asking his advisers to think about this will make the point to them also, that the presumption in favour of an Act will go only as far as the double construction test as it is called. If two constructions are open on the wording of the Act, the one which is constitutional will be preferred to the one which is unconstitutional, and the courts will presume that the constitutional one is the one which the House intended; but where that does violence to the real meaning of words the courts do not operate that presumption. There are no two meanings in this section. There is only one meaning and that is that the courts willy-willy have to take everything in a certain category as being legal even though at the moment it is illegal. There is no way out of that.  If they are to do that a certain class of litigant must necessarily be excluded from access to the courts.  I would be grateful if the Minister would put to his advisers <Col N="79" /> that this is not a case in which the so-called double construction test will find application.</P>

      <P>The points raised by Deputy Kelly will be analysed carefully by the legal advisers.  With regard to the comments of Deputy Fitzpatrick perhaps there are a few in this House, and particularly Deputy Fitzpatrick himself, who will realise that what he is asking is impossible, impractable and inappropriate. There is no question of fear; that does not enter into it.  The Deputy knows that I have no function in the area of prosecutions and it is not for this House to decide if somebody is imprisoned wrongfully.  Nobody is imprisoned otherwise than on a conviction in a court that has competent jurisdiction. Deputy Fitzpatrick believes that a conviction based on a statement taken in certain circumstances which he mentioned is a defective conviction.  That belief of the Deputy is not shared by everybody.</P>

If the Deputy means seriously that a person convicted of bank robbery should be released by me as Minister for Justice just because certain Deputies might think that there may have been a defect in proof, I disagree emphatically with his approach.  Only a court of law can decide if a statement is admissible or inadmissible and nobody can say in the circumstances envisaged that these statements would not have been admitted. My legal advice is that they almost certainly would, but in any event only a court could say and it is not for me as Minister for Justice or anybody who would be Minister for Justice to try to release people in such circumstances.

Am I right in assuming that the Minister's decision resulting in a necessity to have this Bill before the House now was purely a political decision, that there was no consultation between the Minister and his legal advisers in the Department of Justice and that the document now before the House is really a document to retrieve the Minister from a very difficult position?</P>
      <P>The Minister has left himself open to many charges.  Some people might now be in prison because of evidence taken during a period in which the person should not have been in custody.  This whole sad sordid affair is a total indictment of the Minister for Justice.  It is quite natural for a Minister or anybody else to make mistakes but before the Minister took the step of removing a commissioner of the Garda from office and leaving himself in a weak position in relation to appointing a new commissioner he should have considered all the consequences of his action.  Who will pay the cost of this blunder and how much will it cost?  The Minister for Justice should have gone into these things before he took this action.  I leave the technical and legal points to Deputies Fitzpatrick and Kelly to debate but on a strictly political plane it was extremely wrong to take such a step and it shows a basic weakness in the person responsible for the Department of Justice.  I accuse the Minister of being totally political.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking on the last day he referred to private briefings with members of the Fine Gael Party and members of the Labour Party. I refute that completely.  I spoke to no one in the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister said that what I requested was not possible.  To date I have been dealing with arrests, detentions, prosecutions and proofs in criminal cases in which the Commissioner of the Garda, either personally or by way of delegated authority, has a part to play.  I requested that these be checked and cross-checked during the period in question and the Minister tells me that that just is not possible.  I do not accept that because the Minister knows as well as I that the cases I have in mind in which the commissioner has to certify or authorise something are quite limited.  All I am asking is that between 20 January 1978 and 14 May 1979, that type of case be checked and all matters arising therefrom be checked.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court is very jealous of the liberty of the individual and the constitutional rights of the person.  The Minister on the last day when introducing the Bill was critical of courts in general and went on to say in a backhanded way that he supposed that sort of thing was not too big a price to pay for the separation of the judiciary from the executive.  I cannot help feeling that that statement, coupled with a very sinister interjection from the Minister for Finance to the Leader of the Opposition when this matter was raised in the House before about legislation requiring a two-thirds majority, stinks a bit.  We all know what legislation requiring a two-thirds majority involves.  The only place that I know of its involvement in this sort of matter relates to the removal of a judge.  I sincerely hope that the Minister was not thinking along those lines.  While of course there would be some trouble attached to it, I am convinced that it would not be a very big job to check the files I have mentioned and to take the necessary action.  If anybody has suffered by a mistake made by the Minister for Justice or the Government of which he is a Member, that person has the right to be absolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to hear people saying that these are technical matters.  If a <Col N="83" /> person is to be deprived of his liberty he can be so deprived only in accordance with the law strictly and accurately applied and is entitled to put up, as a defence, that the law has not been properly carried out.  That is what the law says.  If we start at the thin end of the wedge today&mdash;saying that what we are doing now is only curing a mess or a mistake made by a Minister or a government, validating a conviction arising from that mess or mistake&mdash;what will we be at next?  We are curing defective proofs and that is a short step only from creating retrospective offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> What I am saying is that the Minister for Justice has rejected my argument on the grounds that it would not be physically possible within his Department, or reasonably physically possible within his Department, to do the sort of check or carry out the sort of investigation I have requested.  I simply do not think that is so.  It would be a comparatively simple job to check the type of file I am talking about; the Minister knows the type of file I mean.  I am not prepared to accept the statement by the Minister that it is simply not possible.  It is not good enough to have to wait until the accused person&mdash;whose fault this mess is not&mdash;gets research done and finds out he has not been properly convicted. I am not satisfied at all that the Minister has made a case against the reasonable request I am making.  The Minister should be in a position to come in and say: Look, I have done that and I am satisfied that nothing arises here; I am satisfied that the type of things we are validating are largely routine, largely innocuous; certainly we are not validating or covering up anything that could or did take away a person's liberty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of promotion from the position of garda to sergeant, from sergeant to inspector, inspector to superintendent, superintendent to chief superintendent and so on.  I believe that a number of such promotions were carried out by the commissioner at the request of the Minister or of the Government between the dates I mentioned, January 1978 and May 1979.  It is unfair and unjust that people who were in line for promotion were taken off that line and other people promoted in their places.  I do not know exactly what are the regulations. I do not know what part the commissioner  <Col N="85" /> plays in these promotions but I am satisfied he plays some part. Somebody must bring these names before the Government.  I hope the Minister does not go out and get them himself; somebody has to bring the names before the Government for promotion.  If there were people taken off promotion lists, and other promotion lists created immediately after the wrongful dismissal of one Commissioner and the irregular appointment of another, that is something that should be looked into, investigated and rectified.  I know from my experience in government that the Minister for Justice brings names of people for appointment before the Government but he gets those names from somebody.  He gets them as a result of some competition, enquiry or some interview board set-up.  In this case it is fairly common knowledge that in or about the time of Commissioner Garvey's wrongful dismissal and Commissioner McLaughlin's irregular appointment there were interviews held, people taken off an approved list and other people put on an approved list. Certainly those people have suffered a loss and feel aggrieved in that respect. Are we being asked to validate that?  I mentioned this on the last occasion on which we debated this matter when I was told, in a two-sentence reply by the Minister that these interviews or lists did not count at all, that there was so much irrelevance and that it was not necessary to validate them.  I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that we are not validating that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I do know that when one gets above the position of inspector the Government make the appointment of superintendent, chief superintendent and so on, but I think the commissioner must play some part in it.  I want to know if the lists for promotion were changed immediately subsequent to the appointment of Mr. McLaughlin, if people who were recommended to the Government for appointment were ignored and if other people were appointed in their places.  If that is so, I deplore it in the strongest possible terms.  The House should be told about it and should not be told about it in a two-sentence remark <Col N="86" /> by the Minister for Justice saying that it is quite irrelevant and, in so many words, that he would appoint whomsoever he likes.</P>

      <P>With regard to the promotions issue, which has been raised by the Deputy, I would like to assure him and his colleagues in the House that there is no question of any promotion having been made at my request as Minister for Justice or indeed made at the request of the Government.  Promotions to the rank of superintendent and above are made by the Government and the recommendations of the commissioner with regard to these appointments have no legal status.  I believe the Deputy is not serious in suggesting that those promotions should be cancelled.  There is nothing to do with them that would validate the promotions to sergeant and inspector.  The Deputy knows that as well as I do.  That should cover the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to get back very <Col N="87" /> briefly to the first point about the convictions, because the Minister has introduced it again.  I make no apology for raising matters of proofs in criminal prosecutions.  I want to repeat again that the nature of those prosecutions has no bearing on the matter so far as I am concerned. I am a bit alarmed to hear the Minister saying that he was glad I moved away from that.  He repeated that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to do what I requested and that it would be inappropriate.  I want to know what the Minister means by &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;. I want to call a spade a spade.  Does that mean that he is afraid of taking the lid off some mess?  Does it mean that it would be inappropriate because he would find something that he does not want to find?  I would be glad to hear the Minister telling us what he means by &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;.  I believe, in those particular circumstances, that it means that it would not be the thing to do.  I do not want to put an interpretation on &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;.  I want the Minister to tell us exactly what he means by it.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with a very serious matter: the validation of all acts done by the highest police officer in the State between 20 January 1978 and 14 May 1979.  All those acts include acts which in my opinion may have wrongfully taken away a person's liberty or have resulted in the imposition of a substantial fine on a person or some other penalty on him.  Why does the Minister think it would be inappropriate to ascertain if such penalties were wrongfully imposed?  Why would it be inappropriate to check those facts?  It follows from what the Minister has said that he has not checked them.  I will go further and put it on record now that standing here, assessing the Minister's approach to this, I do not believe that he wants to check them.  I believe he fears that, if he checks them, he will find something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care who was wrongfully detained or what he was wrongfully detained for.  If such a person is wrongfully detained or has been <Col N="88" /> wrongfully punished, if he has not been punished in accordance with the law, he has a grievance and it is up to this Legislature to see that the grievance is rectified and that compensation is made to that person.  We may be speaking about one man today but we have to think about other people in the future who will find themselves in the same place and the same circumstances.  We are establishing a precedent by what we are doing here today.  It is a very dangerous one and the Minister's whole approach to this matter has been dangerous and has been sinister.  I want to know what the Minister means by &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say for about the fifth time to Deputy Fitzpatrick that there are a number of reasons why I told him that it would not be right for me to do what he suggests. One of them is that it would be inappropriate for the Minister to do that.  I say it would be inappropriate because the Deputy would be asking me to exercise the functions of the court.  That is not my job.  I have already told the Deputy that I am not the adjudicator.  I should not be the adjudicator nor would I want to be it, and this House would not want me to be.  If there is somebody who is wrongfully in prison, I have already said&mdash;and the Deputy will clearly see that from the record when he goes back over it&mdash;that it is a matter for the courts to decide and not for me to decide. Everything possible in the way of legal aid will be available to those people to see that justice is done.  That was what I meant by &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;.  I cannot convince the Deputy and bring him over to my point of view.  I am not agreeing with the Deputy's point of view.  I explained the difference between us and I said why I disagreed with him.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister now makes the case that it would be inappropriate for him to check the files, as I have requested him to do, because he would then be putting himself in the position of some sort of judicial person and that he would in some way be usurping the rights of the courts.  We find ourselves in <Col N="89" /> an extraordinary position arising out of the wrongful dismissal of the chief of police and the irregular appointment of another.  One of the serious consequences that appear to me to flow from that is that some person or people may now be in prison or may have been penalised or suffered a penalty because of the wrongful and irregular appointment of a commissioner of the Garda Siochana.  The Minister tells me it is not for him to sort that out, and if he did that he would not be acting as Minister for Justice but would be usurping the judicial appointment of some judge.  All I want to say is that the Minister created the mess we are being invited to clear up. About that there can be no doubt.</P>

This is so important that the Government should set up a select tribunal of judicial personages to inquire into the very thing I am asking and to report to this House whether any people have been wrongfully penalised in court cases or by detention in custody as a result of the wrongful appointment of this commissioner. There is provision for such an inquiry and if the Minister thinks that he or his Department would not be the proper people to do it, before we close this chapter, before we send this Bill out of the House&mdash;and leave it to the High Court to finish the Garvey episode by assessing damages, which has nothing to do with this&mdash;and before we give our validation to it, the Government should <Col N="90" /> undertake to set up an inquiry presided over by a judge or judges with power to get these files, to check these cases and to see if anybody has suffered a wrong which we cannot validate but which we are trying to push under the carpet and cover up once and for all.

      <P>Amendment No. 17a will make clearer what I want to achieve. Both amendments Nos. 17 and 17a deal with the sale of artificial contraceptives in clinics.  As I explained the last day, amendment No. 17 has two purposes. The first was to bring the definition of &ldquo;open shop&rdquo; more into line with the Pharmacy Acts and the second was to provide that where a family planning clinic was being established, it would be possible to have artificial contraceptives sold at such a licensed clinic by a pharmacist or a chemist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was indicated to me that this would create a situation where it would be possible for a family planning clinic to employ a pharmacist and a chemist as agents and that was not my intention. Therefore, I am substituting this amendment to make it absolutely clear that if there is a licensed clinic which wishes to sell artificial contraceptives, this could be done only by a pharmacist or a chemist as an extension of his existing pharmacy.  In other words, the amendment  <Col N="93" /> indicates that it must be an extension of keeping open shop in accordance with the Pharmacy Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, what the original amendment set out to do has been superseded by this amendment, which is entirely different.  Some of us had hoped that when the Minister would produce this amendment he would be presenting a rather clever if devious way around the difficulties into which he had put family planning clinics in the original Bill.  The effect of the original amendment No. 17 would have been to allow pharmacists sympathetic to the operation of the clinics to appoint the people in the clinics as their agents and to allow them consequently to sell or distribute contraceptives.</P>
      <P>Some of us felt that that was a rather clever way the Minister had employed to meet the case made by the family planning clinics.  By the time the Minister introduced the amendment as opposed to the stage of originally tabling it, events had taken place somewhere else which appear to have changed the intentions of the Minister, and the speech he made when introducing the amendment suggested that he had never had that intention and that if necessary he would have to revise the amendment.  Deputy de Valera's remarks then also appeared to indicate that the Minister had some difficulties elsewhere.</P>
      <P>This substitute amendment would have the effect of reverting to the position before the original amendment.  As I understand it, the only effect of the substitute amendment will be to allow a pharmacist to operate a family planning clinic if he attends there personally, if he operates his pharmacy in the place where the family planning clinic is being carried out.  That does not meet the needs of the clinics, and from that point of view one can speak more in sorrow than in anger.  I do not believe the Minister is particularly pleased at having to introduce this substitute for the original amendment.  It represents a further disimprovement to an already unacceptable concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having seen this amendment  <Col N="94" /> I must withdraw the accusation I made on the last occasion that this Bill is a public relations exercise, a charge to which the Minister took exception.  The longer I listen to this debate and the longer I study what is before us, the more plainly evident it becomes that the Bill is something he wishes to be shut of at the earliest possible opportunity because it is doing him and the Government increasing political damage. Nowhere is this clearer than in this amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I am right in thinking that he introduced the original amendment by saying he was doing so at the request of the pharmaceutical organisation who deal with the legislative aspect of the profession rather than remuneration and so on.  It is now clear that the Minister's original amendment had a far more liberal intent than he or the profession intended, and that this substitute amendment is before us to try to correct that situation and to produce a situation in which, first of all, the family planning clinics as at present constituted will be able to continue in operation only if they receive the approval of the Minister and the Department, and second, if they wish to sell ordinary mechanical methods of contraception, they will have to employ a pharmacist and have that pharmacist on the premises.</P>
      <P>This looks like a way out of the difficulty, but in fact it creates far more difficulties. It is difficult to see how the Minister could have avoided that, because the logic of the basic premise behind the Bill has led him into a more and more ludicrous situation.  Let us be clear about what is involved in this amendment.  It is not just a simple question of allowing pharmacists to dispense condoms and other non-mechanical contraceptives at family planning clinics. Looked at in another way, the Minister is forcing the clinics to employ pharmacists if they want to go on providing the vast majority of their customers with ordinary mechanical methods of contraception. The cost implications of that for these clinics are immense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications are that family planning clinics outside Dublin will be wiped out overnight because they simply have <Col N="95" /> not got the money to employ pharmacists or to pay pharmacists for attendance on their premises.  Family planning services within Dublin could keep going for another year or two if they were to exhaust their reserves, but their span of life would be abbreviated and eventually terminated.</P>
    <P>It is not as if the clinics, to the best of my knowledge, have the remotest intention of complying with this draconian measure.  I do not believe they will, and I do not believe the Minister will extract himself from this difficulty by putting down this amendment.  It is a draconian measure.  I do not know how much pharmacists get paid these days, but when you take this amendment together with the section of the Bill which empowers the Minister to recognise certain clinics, we have a situation in which the Minister is saying: &ldquo;Right, you can have your licence and go on distributing contraceptives as before as long as you employ a pharmacist&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not know what is the going rate for pharmacists, but I suspect it is anything from £6,000 upwards. Therefore, what we are talking about is a licence fee for each clinic of £6,000 a year.  Contrast that with the cost of a licence to sell alcoholic drink which is about £4 or £5 a year&mdash;I doubt if it is in double figures though I understand the Government were considering putting it up recently&mdash;and you find that this is a penal imposition on the family planning services which they will reject as a reasonable way out of the difficulties in which this Bill places them.</P>
    <P>My final point in relation to the amendment is that the money which they might have to consider spending as a result of it if they want to continue to provide ordinary mechanical methods of family planning will have to be paid to pharmacists.  At the moment, that money, the profits which they make on the sale of these products over the counter, goes back into the service on a non-profit basis to subsidise education training and, if necessary, the free supply of these materials.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are talking about an <Col N="96" /> amendment whose logical consequence is to divert from the family planning service into the pockets of pharmacists revenue which should be used for the best interests and the best development of the family planning service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us that things are not as bad as they appear to be.  It seems possible to me that a pharmaceutical chemist could make an arrangement with a clinic on a sessional basis to provide a dispensing service, because that is all he has to do, in respect of prescriptions made up by the doctor in charge of the clinic.  This, at first glance, extraordinarily vindictive insistence on putting the greatest number of impediments in the way of family planning clinics which are carrying out their work is very hard to understand; it is frightening.  The Minister, listening to people who have made contributions to this debate, and having given the matter some thought himself, and knowing the problems of providing family planning as he does, and as nobody else in the country does, appears to have made an attempt at a working compromise.  He went to the trouble of circulating the amendment in the Dáil, got to the stage of debating it, and then he is humiliated because it seems that it is the Minister who has been humiliated. He is our expert on this; he is the Minister for Health here.  He has all the facts, as none of us has the facts, and he came to certain conclusions in the light of those facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He brought in that amendment, which was likely to be used in the way that Deputy Boland and Deputy Horgan and I suggested it could be used.  As soon as that is made clear he is then publicly rebuked by a Cabinet who have already betrayed him by allowing this extraordinary decision of evasion of Cabinet responsibility&mdash;but we shall deal with that later.  He is humiliated in that way and now there is the further humiliation of a Minister who is attempting to behave in a mildly liberal way, not a great liberal way.  We see the intervention of the extremely intolerant group representing, I suppose, the natural family planning lobby which is so powerful, through the Knights of St. Columbanus <Col N="97" /> and various interests which they use to control their lobby in Irish public life and he is made to bring in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Presumably there must be some point at which a Minister will not continue to accept this type of regrettable behaviour by his Cabinet&mdash;this public vote of no confidence.  We would have to accept that the Minister was not the best person to decide these things in the light of all the pressures put upon him.  We were prepared to accept this as a compromise, which would help to preserve the clinics. Now we find it was not from the Opposition that the resistance has come to the Minister's liberal attitude, it is from behind him and from his own Cabinet. Surely there must come a time when the Minister would have to consider his own position in that situation?</P>
    <P>On the question of these private clinics, everybody knows that I have been a socialist all my life and consequently I believe in the use of the State in the operation of this kind of activity, but I have never in the time during which I was in charge of the Department thought of closing down private organisations or enterprises which were working well, because of the defects in the service in many ways.  I felt that if they were doing a job I had already enough on my plate without looking for more trouble in closing down these clinics and I encouraged them in whatever way I could.</P>
    <P>It defies understanding how a Minister&mdash;knowing, as he does that there are perhaps ten doctors in the whole of the country competent to give serious advice on family planning&mdash;at a stage where he is proposing to provide a national family planning service, in the absence of any service whatever with the exception of the service provided by these private clinics, or private enterprises, or whatever you like to call them, would think of closing these.  They are extremely efficient and are carrying out a very badly needed service under very great difficulties and supplying the needs for which he is Minister.  Leaving aside the political consideration, it is his responsibility as Minister to provide a service for the people for whom he is Minister for Health.  Surely that must be <Col N="98" /> the first consideration.  The political considerations and the differences within the Fianna Fáil Party, and the disgraceful pressures to which he appears to have been subjected, should not be allowed to interfere with his responsibility to provide an efficient family planning service.</P>
    <P>I cannot repeat too often that the Jansenist influence in Irish Catholics seems always to come down to the fact that because people enjoy sex there is something wrong, or bad, or evil in it. That does not concern me at all.  What concerns me is the issue raised, which motivated the introduction of this Bill, in the McGee case.  It is a shame that the Supreme Court should have to tell us to make that law.  If you remember the McGee case, it represented a matter of life and death to the particular lady; if she could not obtain contraception, she could have lost her life and it was generally believed she could have if she had another child.  What is being debated here is a Bill which, in its effect, is one which could mean women losing their lives and children losing their lives&mdash;avoidable maternal mortality and avoidable neo-natal mortality and all the other things we talked of from time to time.  These are demonstrable facts; I produced the figures, as did other Deputies, also, to show that this is the most important issue affecting women since the State was formed, not to mention the effect in relation to children, thousands and tens of thousands of unwanted children who are born every year in this country.  I have already made my case for making this very harsh statement. It is possible now, because of the advances in science in relation to family planning and the control of fertility, to ensure that children brought into this very terrible, frightening world should be only the children of a loving relationship and children who are wanted.  It appears that we can talk, argue and question in Opposition and do our best to attempt to defend the interests of the people we are concerned about, women who are faced with unwanted pregnancies or the children who are faced with being brought into a world where they are not wanted, but in the final analysis none of us can influence any of the decisions <Col N="99" /> taken.  There is only one person who stands between these people and the distress, tragedy, avoidable illnesses, hardships, sufferings and even death and the kind of law that would protect them, the Minister.  I should like the Minister to give careful thought before he allows this very reactionary lobby which is obviously pressing him so hard within his party to gain control.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say why we have this rigmarole about &ldquo;open shop&rdquo;?  What is so important about a chemist having to be a chemist in charge of an &ldquo;open shop&rdquo;?  What will be dispensed are medical contraceptives such as IUDs, caps and spermicides and, in the non-medical area, condoms.  I tried to introduce this question of the medical and non-medical contraceptives during the Second Stage debate.  I believe a case could be made for a very competent professional level of individual being in charge of dispensing the apparatuses involved. In relation to the non-medical contraceptives no such case need be made.  The dispensing of condoms can be done, and is being done, by slot machines.  I should like the Minister to explain why it is that we have to have this very detailed provision about having to own a shop.  What is wonderful about owning a chemist shop rather than being a chemist who has gone through the college of pharmacy and has the necessary qualifications?  What is important about owning a shop before one is allowed to dispense condoms?  Why is it that an ordinary qualified person on leaving the college of pharmacy cannot do that? The same applies in relation to the medical contraceptives because those who qualify at the college of pharmacy must be competent to dispense medical or non-medical contraceptives.  Whatever about medical contraceptives it is absurd to try to suggest that the chemist dispensing condoms must own a shop. Can the Minister justify that?  What case did those people make to the Minister to make it so important that only those who own a shop can dispense condoms?</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would define the term &ldquo;open shop&rdquo;.  May such a person have his supplies in a <Col N="100" /> family planning clinic in the same way as he has them on the shelves in his shop?  The Minister should explain the legal implications of having a shop.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly on this amendment but it is as well that I should repeat my approach.  It would be simple for me to draft a Bill which would meet with Deputy Browne's approval but I do not think such a Bill would be passed by the House.  Secondly, in this whole business I have placed on myself an obligation to bring as many people with me as possible. This is a sensitive and delicate area, an area about which diametrically conflicting views are passionately held by many people.  I regard it as my onerous duty to try to bring as many people with me as possible in an effort to achieve as broad a consensus as possible.  The Bill is based on a simple straightforward principle, that the question of family planning is treated as a medical matter and the availability of artificial contraceptives is confined to a doctor's prescription and sale through a chemist's shop.  There is no point in any Deputy railing against these provisions because the only thing they can do is vote against the Bill.  This principle is at the heart of the Bill, it is the principle on which the Bill is based.  I have found a most general <Col N="101" /> level of acceptance throughout the community for that principle and I believe it is a defensible principle.</P>
      <P>I have asked the House to imagine what the reaction would be if I had not transferred family planning matters from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health.  If I had not involved doctors and pharmacists fully I can quite clearly visualise the string of complaints there would be that here I was taking something that should be, strictly speaking, a medical matter where the advice of doctors, chemists and nurses was needed, and dealing with it in some other way.  So I do not make any apology for trying to bring family planning matters into the context of medical, nursing and pharmacy advice.  That is the principle on which the Bill is framed and this amendment is following through on that principle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eileen Lemass made the point that if there was to be a licensed family planning clinic under medical supervision it was perhaps a bit unreasonable to expect a patient of such a clinic who got a prescription for an artificial contraceptive to go off some distance to procure the object and perhaps come back to the clinic to have further treatment in regard to it.  It is in order to meet this eventuality that I am making the provision so that if a pharmacist wanted to extend his business to the clinic he would be able to do so and as part of his pharmacy and chemist business he could supply artificial contraceptives on a doctor's prescription at the place where the clinic was being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out one thing to Deputy Browne and in particular to Deputy Horgan.  Implicit in what they are saying is that the right way to run a family planning service is to have it financed from the sale of artificial contraceptives. That is the corner they are forcing themselves into.  I do not think that stands up.  Whatever the position about the particular clinics that the Deputies favour up to now, when this legislation is passed an entirely new situation will prevail.  These clinics came into being when there was no family planning service provided by the Department.   <Col N="102" /> This legislation now places a statutory obligation on the Minister for Health to provide a family planning service on a national basis and it is in that context that these questions must be examined. It is in that context that the question of whether or not any family planning clinic will be licensed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know it is my thinking and my approach that family planning services will be, in the main, provided by the general practitioner, the experienced, knowledgeable, skilled family practitioner. That is my belief.  Family planning should reside with these people.  I do recognise and it was implicit in the Bill from the beginning that there may be circumstances in which a general practioner service would not be able to meet needs.  Therefore, we have provided in the Bill that there can be, under licence, family planning clinics and this is a step which is an extension of that.  It is said that if we are going to have licensed family planning clinics with prescriptions available in them from doctors it is not unreasonable to enable pharmacists to supply artificial contraceptives in these clinics for the convenience of the persons concerned.  I do not think it is anything to get terribly excited about particularly when at the moment this very important service must be provided if we want to have anything like a comprehensive health service here. It is a service which perhaps should have been provided long ago on a national basis.  Advice, consultation, help, encouragement, sympathy and understanding are all involved in this important service.  If we are going to have this, surely it is desirable that we should contemplate for the future the absurd situation that has applied up to now, namely, that a family planning clinic wishing to provide this service can do so only out of profits provided by the sale of artificial contraceptives.  That is undesirable in principle and what I am proposing here is ultimately in the long term far more reasonable.</P>
    <P>If I do, as I must, provide a comprehensive family planning service on a national basis, is that not the right way to do it rather than relying on a situation which could only have come into being <Col N="103" /> because of the inadequate state of the law up to now? I recommend the amendment to the House.  My attention was focused on it because of a conversation which I had with the representatives of the pharmacists and they could see difficulties in the Bill as it was originally framed.  When I came to look at it, it seemed reasonable that in exceptional circumstances it might be necessary to license family planning clinics and it might be desirable to have artificial contraceptives made available somewhere convenient to the family planning clinic and this was a reasonable way of doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the obvious and correct way would be to provide a national comprehensive family planning service and that if that were done the question of the clinics dispensing or selling contraceptives should not arise.  I would entirely agree with the Minister but he knows very well that the effect of this Bill will not be to provide a national comprehensive family planning service in any way and consequently as some of us had hoped would be avoided, some people will be put to unnecessary expense and trouble in having to go to a doctor first and pay for the cost of the visit to the doctor and, secondly, in having to go to a pharmacist and pay the full retail cost that the pharmacist chooses to impose on the sale of the contraceptives. This will put an additional and in some cases an unacceptable financial burden on poor people in particular. For that reason and because the Minister's Bill does not set up a comprehensive national family planning service some of us felt that it would be better if the clinics that were being allowed to operate were also allowed to sell contraceptives at a reduced price which would be to the benefit of the people who had gone to them for advice and which would have the additional beneficial effect of allowing the clinic to continue in being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the position is that they can only finance themselves by engaging commercially in the sale of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="104" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But I do not see that the Minister is suggesting any way to financially assist those clinics to continue in operation.  If the Minister were suggesting, as part of his licensing arrangement under section 3, that he is going to give financial assistance to such clinics as he sees fit to license, that would be an entirely different situation because then we would be considering the position where the clinics were being assisted by the State to operate.  It still is not getting over the difficulty that certain people will find themselves in of having the financial burden of visiting a doctor and visiting a chemist at his shop and paying the appropriate fees in each case, and those people have benefited up to the present through the reduced cost which contraceptives are sold at in the family planning clinics.</P>
      <P>If the Minister sees fit under section 3 to license a clinic he will have to be well satisfied about the standard employed in the clinic, the training of the personnel who would be available and its entire <i>modus operandi</i>.  It is right that that should happen.  I accept that in any legislation clinics which are operating should have some kind of licensing arrangement from some Government agency to ensure that they operate to a high and acceptable standard.  Once those clinics are licensed by the Minister it means that he is satisfied that they will operate to that high standard.  I would have thought that if he was so satisfied that they would operate to a high standard and in an acceptable fashion it ought to have been possible to allow the clinics to sell contraceptives.  It would be only those clinics which the Minister was satisfied were above board and operating in an efficient manner which would be allowed to operate under licence at all.  In that case the Minister should feel satisfied to allow them to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost certain that any clinics which might be licensed would be under the control of the health boards.  One of the things the health boards made clear to me was that they did not wish to be involved in the sale of <Col N="105" /> artificial contraceptives.  There is that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  In section 3 the Minister obliges the health boards, if he is going to introduce any kind of national service to them to make family planning clinics available within the health board structure.  In section 3 (3) (a) it is stated:</P>
      <P>A person other than a health board may, with the consent of the Minister and in accordance with regulations for the purposes of this subsection, make available a family planning service, not being exclusively a family planning service such as is referred to in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>The one referred to in subsection (2) is a natural family planning clinic.  It is under section 3 (3) (a) that the Minister has the right, and I am assuming will exercise the right, to license certain clinics other than health board clinics.  Those are the ones we are talking about.  It is not being helpful to confuse the issue by bringing us back into the area of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a lot of unacceptable and unpalatable things that some of us involved in public life are obliged to do from time to time.  I am quite certain it would make life easier for the health boards to operate family planning clinics that did not make contraceptives available but I am not certain that that is the right course of action for the Minister to take merely because the representatives of the health boards, for the sake of having a quiet life, should make the point to him that they did not want to be involved in the dispensing of contraceptives.  In 1974 the Minister's colleagues who spoke on the Bill introduced at that time were all tending towards the suggestion that the only clinics that should make contraceptives available were ones operated by health boards.  Party colleagues of the Minister and party colleagues of mine who serve as members of health boards and executives of health boards would all see that it would be an easy operation for them if they merely had to make advice available but not actually make contraceptives available.  That does not <Col N="106" /> necessarily mean that the Minister of the day should decide to acquiesce.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have looked more carefully at that and have said to the health boards that he accepted they did not like the idea of doing this but for the sake of providing the best possible service and control to a high standard they would have to make contraceptives available through health board clinics. That is the corollary to the argument put forward by the Minister in relation to health board clinics.</P>

    <P>The Minister said he did not see why we got excited about this.  We only did so because we thought he had done something which was an advance on a very unsatisfactory situation.  We welcomed his decision to try to make it possible for the clinics to survive.  It is not a situation of choice held by these people.  If the Minister could give us an enforceable undertaking that if he accepts the professional standards of the level of services being provided in a particular clinic he will fund the service we have no further question or conflict.  One assumes that the money would be provided to any pharmacist whether it is the one with the shop or the one with the <Col N="107" /> degree.  The Minister should make clear what his attitude is about that.</P>
    <P>The health boards extraordinary decision that they would like to provide advice on contraception but not provide the appliances is an absolutely absurd situation which they cannot possibly be permitted to maintain.  This is what being a Minister is about: making decisions which sometimes people do not like. They must be made if we are to advance. The public health service in the early years of the State did not want to have medical officers of health in many health authorities.  The then Ministers had to persuade them that it was important for them to do this kind of thing.  The health boards have been providing contraceptives for a number of years through dispensing the pill.  Why they should decide to dispense one kind of contraceptive and not another is simply childish.  This kind of thinking should not be tolerated. The job is to provide a service for women which is in the interests of their health.  The Minister has made the point the whole way through that it is based on the need for medical advice.  It is a medical question.  It is in the interests of their health and a health board who do not feel they can provide the facilities to people who pay for the running of these health boards, the taxpayers, and have this curious sense of punctilio about providing one kind of contraceptive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The health boards probably do not particularly want to expand the contraceptives service and facilities.  For many years in the Eastern Health Board we had our pharmacy.  Incidentally, it was not an open shop and I wonder does that in any way contravene the Minister's provision in the new amendment.  It was a very closed shop because there was a full-time pharmacist whose job it was to provide whatever we as doctors prescribed for patients.  Of course, part of the time we prescribed contraceptives in the form of cycle regulators as being the only ones available.  That was certainly done. From now on we can provide all the different sedatives, narcotics, thymoleptic drugs, and all the different medicines which may be made available for the one thousand and one ailments to which people are heir.  We can write prescriptions which will be sent down to the health board pharmacy, and prescriptions for all of these medicines and drugs and appliances can be filled with the exception of prescriptions for contraceptives.</P>
      <P>This is advice which the Minister simply wants to take.  It is the easy road for him to take.  I do not think he should, and I do not think he can.  It is unthinkable that somebody should have to go to a separate chemist half-a-mile from the hospital, or even a few hundred yards from the hospital, while at the same time all the drugs, medicines and appliances other than contraceptives can be made available by the hospital pharmacist. The Minister might like to consider the question: does that constitute an open shop and is that person competent under the Act to provide contraceptive appliances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have to take a stand on that where the health boards are concerned. Could he give us an undertaking that he will fund any registered clinic? Could he put in an amendment on Report Stage or give us an assurance in some way that he will fund any approved registered health clinic?  If it were a matter for the health board to finance them, and if that were permissible under <Col N="109" /> the Act, nobody wants people to go on making money out of contraceptives if that can be avoided.</P>

      <P>I want to query the Minister on the issue raised by Deputy Browne and raised previously by another Deputy.  On the question of the establishment of family planning clinics for which health boards do not wish to have any responsibility, a plea has already been made for making available certain artificial contraceptives at a low cost.  I want to place on record my serious objection to any such plea. People have their own views, and I have my views on this matter.  I cannot associate myself in any way with the plea which has been conveyed to the Minister.  In the event of a patient having to obtain a prescription for contraceptives, there should be no question of one penny piece of taxpayers' money being spent to lower the price of contraceptives or subsidise them in any way.</P>
      <P>Some health boards have already made strong representations to the Minister on this matter.  Many members of health boards, officers and executives, feel they are bound in conscience not to recommend nor to be associated with the supplying of artificial contraceptives. I believe that the vast majority of taxpayers would object strongly to part of their taxes being used to subsidise artificial contraceptives.  Is it any wonder that some hundreds of thousands of Irish voters are disgusted with parliamentary democracy?  Having regard to current trends I do not think that we will have parliamentary democracy for very much longer.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to put this Bill on the shelves of his Department and to leave it to become surrounded by cobwebs because there are many vitally important economic and national problems to be dealt with.  Artificial contraception is morally wrong.  Have we lost our minds?</P>

      <P>Parents cannot be denied the right to plan their families and to help them in this matter the Minister should give his full support to those clinics at which there is provided advice on the natural methods of family planning.  Very strong representations have been made to the Minister in this regard.  However, not a penny of public money should be made available to subsidise in any way those clinics which provide a family planning service that is not based on the natural methods.  The Minister has referred to the availability of sympathy, advice and understanding but such sympathy, advice and understanding can be provided readily at natural family planning clinics.  There is no need for legislation to provide for the development and the expansion of such services.</P>

      <P>I agree, but in view of what has been said already I should like to place my views on record. It is a matter of indifference as to how the Minister may try to cloak the availability of artificial contraceptives by stipulating where they can be sold.  He should know that to make them available is wrong in every respect and this House is wrong to endeavour to legislate in any way for the making available of artificial contraceptives.  The Minister must be aware that the majority of the health boards do not wish to be associated with the provision of artificial contraceptives.  There has been the suggestion that artificial contraceptives would be made available on medical prescriptions by the health boards.  We must ensure that the taxpayers' money is not used to subsidise what is wrong morally but I am sure no taxpayer would object to the subsidisation of clinics at which the natural methods of family planning only were advocated.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I was asked whether I was speaking on this Bill on my own behalf or on behalf of my party.  This is the first opportunity I have had of replying to that question.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I explained at considerable length that I was speaking on behalf of my party, but I explained also that this party had held traditionally that anyone who had a disagreement with our attitude on the basis of personal conscience was free to abstain from the party attitude and to come here and enunciate his views.  I pleaded again, as I have pleaded before, that that same spirit might be allowed to permeate on the Government side.  Deputy Flanagan and others will be able to confirm that I have gone to the trouble of encouraging those who disagree with my point of view to come here and put forward their point of view.  In that way there could be a meaningful discussion here.</P>
      <P>Perhaps when I am asked whether I speak on my own behalf or on behalf of my party by somebody who was not present to vote at the end of the Second Stage debate on this Government measure, it may be by somebody who has sat like a Richelieu on the Minister's shoulder since Committee Stage of this debate began.  Perhaps when I am being asked by somebody who obviously is the main proposer and proponent of amendment No. 17a it might be considered inappropriate.

His Department permit moneys to be spent by people who attend them because of the quality of the service in the form of lectures, instructions and so on given in these clinics.  Given that he does recognise the existing clinics and it would be an extraordinary act of folly to close them down&mdash;and they must close down if they do not find the money&mdash;will he be responsible for providing the finance to save them the necessity of finding money for contraceptives? If he is not able to clear that point, may a pharmacist who keeps open shop allow his assistant to act in the capacity of a dispenser in a family planning clinic of prescriptions made up in that family planning clinic?  Is it permissible for an assistant not the owner of the open shop to be the person who dispenses? If an assistant is permitted to act as dispenser why cannot an ordinary assistant with the same qualifications act in that capacity?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that I have not taken any decision at all yet as to whether any clinics will be needed.  It is my intention that the family planning service will be provided primarily by the general practitioner, the family doctor.  That is the principle enshrined in the Bill.  Naturally, we have to be reasonably prudent and we have to recognise that in many of these clinics there may be areas, perhaps sectors of the population, which would not be catered for by the general family doctor, particularly in view of the fact that we have the conscientious objection clause in the Bill.  Therefore, as a precaution it is provided in the Bill that where public interest demands it clinics may be licensed.  I would see a distinction.  If there is a statutory obligation on me as Minister for Health to provide a comprehensive family planning service on a national basis, then certainly in so far as that national family planning service would be involved it would be part of and integrated into the general community medical care service and whatever funds would be involved would be made available for the provision of such a service, just as the Bill provides that we can make research grants available for research into natural family planning methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another principle which I have enshrined in the Bill so far is that public funds will not be provided for the provision of contraceptives for family planning purposes.  If certain medical preparations are made available at the moment for medical reasons as distinct from family planning reasons, that situation will continue.  It is not my intention that <Col N="115" /> artificial contraceptives as such should be provided or subsidised in any way from public funds.</P>

By implication it appeared that the Minister might consider making some money available to help in the operation of those clinics.  The Minister has now made it clear that that is not his intention.</P>
      <P>The question I asked the Minister, which has still not been dealt with, is whether when the Minister is licensing those clinics&mdash;and we all accept that he would only license clinics which he felt were operating at a very high standard&mdash;he will then allow the operatives of those clinics to sell contraceptives. The Minister has now suggested that as he tries to develop a comprehensive national family planning service that eventuality might arise.  That eventuality will be excluded from ever arising if this Bill in its present from and this amendment in its present form are enacted. There is no let-out clause and there is no way whereby the Minister can allow the clinics to sell contraceptives under this Bill as amended by amendment No. 17a.</P>

I am only concerned for the kind of service provided in the existing family planning clinics which may go out of operation unless they are funded in some way.  Quite obviously what we usually did, as the Minister will recall from the 1947 Act, was that we allowed for the funding of the voluntary hospitals from public money.  That was a sensible compromise.  It would have been absurd to try to start up a completely new hospital service, so obviously a compromise was arrived at by the then Minister which works extremely well. What I have in mind is that these clinics should be absorbed into the existing health service to provide a service for the people for whom the Minister is responsible and that the Minister would pay in the ordinary way under the accepted principle.  Surely the Minister sees nothing wrong with that, assuming that he agrees to register the clinics to which I refer.</P>

      <P>No.  I am still not clear about it.  Whatever else one might say about the Minister for Health he cannot easily be described as being incompetent. The Minister has not made it clear why amendment No. 17a replaced amendment No. 17.  When the Minister proposed amendment No. 17 he suggested that the effect of it had been subsequently brought to his attention after he had entered it on the Order Paper for discussion.  I would not dream of describing myself as being in any way near as competent as the Minister but within 20 seconds of reading amendment No. 17 the effect of it was quite clear.  I do not see that the Minister can fairly ask the House to believe that he did not realise that amendment No. 17 would have the effect which it would have had and ask the House now to agree to this substitute amendment which has an entirely different effect.  The House deserves a more comprehensive answer than the Minister gave.</P>

      <P>We would have to say, in relation to amendment No. 17a, that it is fairly clear, and became clearer this afternoon, that from the time amendment No. 17 was published to the time it was moved by the Minister, certain of his colleagues who also read it and saw its effect, were not prepared to support it and who apparently were not there in sufficient numbers to force him to change his hand.  From that point of view, I said at the outset that I spoke more in sorrow than in anger in relation to the matter because I felt that the Minister must feel uncomfortable and unhappy that his original intention was changed.  I am now faced with a situation of being asked by the Minister to accept that that was never his original intention.  I do not believe he is that incompetent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>the person to whom the contraceptives are sold is named in a prescription or authorisation in writing for the contraceptives of a registered medical practitioner and is a person who, in the opinion of the practitioner formed at the time of the giving of the prescription or authorisation, sought the contraceptives for the purpose, bona fide, of family planning....</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well known drafting phrase.  I have already explained this frequently.  If I might refer again to what I said on 9 May at column 273 of the Official Report of that day:</P>
      <P>By &ldquo;bona fide family planning&rdquo; I mean the genuine decision of a couple in a family context to make those decisions.</P>
      <P>In fact I said at columns 272-273:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to what I mean by &ldquo;family planning&rdquo;, I mean the ability of a family to decide the number of children they will have and the spacing of those children.  By &ldquo;bona fide family <Col N="124" /> planning&rdquo; I mean the genuine decision of a couple in a family context to make those decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>It is just a piece of superfluous jargon which lawyers are inclined to use.</P>
      <P>Because some of my colleagues in the Seanad were endeavouring to have the phrase &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; reinserted into the Landlord and Tenant Bill there was a subsequent debate on the phrase in the Seanad on 2 May in which the Minister's attitude to using any Latin phrase, but in particular the Latin phrase &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo;, can only be described as scathing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann demands that a comprehensive national policy on the improvement and proper development of major urban areas be undertaken <Col N="125" /> immediately; that an Action Plan for the inner-city of Dublin be a priority in such a policy, this Plan to take full account of the present deplorable standards of a wide range of social, economic and cultural factors, including housing, recreational and other amenities, jobs, education, the quality of the physical environment generally; and that Dáil Éireann therefore demands the immediate formulation of a programme of massive and enlightened investment of resources into areas such as the heart of Dublin, beset by major urban problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter for which the Deputy was suspended from the House was the rubbish around the city and it has a bearing on the content of this motion.  The amendment which the Minister will move later states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is undertaking a review of the 1972 Statement by the Government on Regional Policy, that this review will include an examination of the strategy adopted in relation to major urban areas in that Statement, and that Dáil Éireann approves of the action taken by the Government to establish an Inner City Group to develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the Dublin inner city area and to make an additional £1 million available in 1979 to accelerate progress in dealing with inner city problems.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> This side of the House would not have any great problem in accepting the Minister's amendment if it were an addendum.  I hope he will be able to consider accepting our motion in those circumstances. People living in an urban community are confronted with many challenges not experienced by others.  Their lives in a variety of ways are different from those of people living in small towns and villages or people living in the relative isolation of a typical rural setting.</P>
    <P>It is only recently that we have come to understand that this process of urbanisation is a major political and sociological problem and that the difficulties and demands of living in an urban community amount to more than the sum of the individual difficulties and the demands of the people concerned. Experience abroad and growing evidence here clearly indicates that the traditional organisation and attitudes of Governments are no longer the appropriate response to the new urban situation.  A radical change of structural and resource commitments is essential to tackle properly the urban challenge which confronts us on all social and economic fronts.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Dublin city and county manager recently said that the political structures of Dublin are totally inappropriate. We have a 1930 structure for a 1980 situation.  As a former Lord Mayor of this city, now an alderman, I know only too well how ineffective the present political arrangements are, how desperate the administration of the effective boundaries of the city is.  Within the effective boundaries of the city we have three different councils, the city council, the county council and the Dún Laoghaire borough council, none of them with the wide responsibilities, co-ordination and powers they need to confront the problems of the region.</P>
    <P>We have a decaying capital city.  We have an inner city of which any Dubliner, indeed any Irishman, is ashamed.  I have said before in this House and also when I was Lord Mayor of this ancient city, which I and many thousands more deeply love, that not one single building of distinction has <Col N="127" /> been built in this city since independence. We have a city centre of decay, vandalism and dirt.  We have a dying inner city.  We have, in fact, a choked inner and outer city.  The only major developments taking place around Dublin are in the shape of vast spirals of rabbit warren housing, featureless, characterless, repetitive suburbs, housing spirals without any character or distinction whatsoever.</P>
    <P>When we ask ourselves why, it gets back to the fact that the political arrangements for Dublin are wrong.  The corporation have responsibility for an area of between four to four-and-a-half miles in radius from the city hall.  They have no responsibility outside that very confined county boundary, where almost all their housing development now takes place.  They have to get planning permission from the next authority and are not allowed to apply their own high standard of housing and planning policies.  They have no responsibility for roads in the county or for traffic within the city.  They have no responsibility for transport within the city.  They have no responsibility for education, health or policing within the city.  I am not saying that all of those powers should be given to a new authority within the city.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that if we are to have an effective local government in the Dublin area we need first and foremost to abolish the anomalous city boundary. There should be one single authority for the entire city and county of Dublin. That authority, call it what you will, the Greater Dublin Council or the Dublin Regional Authority, should have responsibility for most of the matters I mentioned. As a Deputy and an alderman of this city, I know the corporation are building houses in areas where there are no schools and where we have no functions to provide schools, where there are no buses and where we have no function to provide buses, where there are no shops and where we have very little function to provide shops, and where there are no facilities and where we do not have any function to provide most of those facilities.  For those and many other reasons we are building modern <Col N="128" /> ghettoes and these areas will remain ghettoes for ten or 15 years.  The lack of those facilities devalue these areas. Initially people may be keen to move into them but they try to get out very fast because of the difficulties of transportation, shopping, schools, youth and so on.</P>
    <P>New councils have been elected in Dublin and we all agree that the time is ripe to declare that within the next five years this House will have decided upon a proper political government for Dublin.  In five years' time the next local elections will take place and I do not think my plans are very ambitious; indeed many would say they are very tardy.  They are not speedy enough to tackle the very worrying social, economic and cultural problems that exist in the inner city in particular.  This area must be treated as an emergency.</P>
    <P>Although I do not represent the inner city I moved the motion in Dublin Corporation's General Purposes Committee to create a special committee to deal with inner city problems and to try to get something moving to improve that area. As a result of the setting up of that committee, there is a dehousing policy around the Seán MacDermott Street area and a redevelopment plan but all this is still too slow.  Anyone familiar with inner-city problems and to try to get social deprivations there, anyone who has authority to do something about it but has not done so, ought to be ashamed of himself.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development made £1 million available to the inner-city group he established.  That is a help but it is merely a drop in the ocean when compared with what is needed.  We do not need an inner-city group; we need a Minister charged directly with sorting out the massive problems that exist in the inner city.</P>
    <P>In the inner city there are traditionally poor housing conditions, the scantiest of recreational facilities, if they exist at all, and long-term, multi-generation unemployment on a massive scale, perhaps as high as 30 or 40 per cent.  In some parts of the inner city there is total cultural deprivation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> I do not believe the complete answer is a policy of building houses in the inner city, although I believe it is a right policy.  However, it is only a small part of the answer.  Since the election of the last council the corporation have been building houses in the parts of the inner city where they have been able to acquire the land.  On the face of it those houses cost twice as much, and sometimes even more, than they cost in the outer suburbs.  But that is not comparing like with like.  Already in the inner city roads, shops, churches, schools and so on exist.  To get a fair comparison the total cost of inner city houses would need to be compared with the total cost of outer city houses.</P>
    <P>It is right to pursue a policy of providing inner city housing but that is only a small part of the solution to the problems of the inner city.  The most worrying part of the problem is the social, economic and cultural deprivations the people in those areas have had to live with for a long time.  It is a matter of great concern to me that this once gracious city has been allowed to decay like a corpse, without any planned reconstruction or redevelopment.  Who is to blame for this lack of a planned reconstruction of a gracious Dublin? Nobody has been given that political responsibility.  Consequently, when the corporation want civic offices they do their own thing, they propose to build on Wood Quay and they go ahead and do so.  That is only one instance.  There is no planned redevelopment of the city.  There are planning laws but they do not go nearly far enough.  They allow derelict sites to proliferate in the inner city of Dublin&mdash;2,800 acres of them.  Laws which allow a situation of that kind to exist are defective.</P>
    <P>To find out the extent of the problem, Deputy Keating, who should have moved this motion, had to go through a marathon exercise to establish the acreage of inner-city derelict sites.  After months of effort in Dublin Corporation he had to resort to a section 4 application and still he had to wait many months before he was given the information.</P>
    <P>As far as redevelopment planning is concerned, Dublin is a haven for <Col N="130" /> speculators.  We allow land to lie idle, overgrown with weeds and covered with bottles and stones but appreciating in value all the time.  It is a major flaw in our planning laws which allows such a situation to exist.  There should be a limit on the time during which a site can be left undeveloped, and immediately thereafter a CPO should be applied.  This change should be made with haste in the case of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation or, I hope in five years, the Greater Dublin Regional Authority, should be given responsibility to make this a gracious city once again. To do that we must give local authorities powers in respect of transport, education, health and policing.  I am talking not of an investment of £1 million but possibly of hundreds of millions.  If we do not make that investment it will cost us very dearly.  The problem in Dublin is so urgent that it cannot await political reorganisation, necessary though that may be.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the House properly recognises the nature of the urban challenge and of urban problems here and throughout the country, the social, economic and cultural deprivations in Dublin's inner city.  In the few years since I came to the Dáil I have been shocked at the lack of understanding and appreciation of Dublin's problems and of the problems of cities in general displayed by Deputies.  I suggest that it would benefit the country generally if Deputies like Deputy Keating, Deputy Brady, Deputy Fergus O'Brien and others representing the inner and outer Dublin area, were to bring other Deputies around to see the practical problems facing the people of the inner city, to see the environment in which they are forced to live.  If that were done I believe the House would address itself more urgently to the massive urban problems with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>Many more powers in respect of education, health and policing&mdash;there was once the DMP&mdash;should be given to city authorities.  In Dublin at the moment we are building housing estates but we are not making provision for bus services to them with the result that people have to walk for 20 minutes to a bus stop.  A proper Dublin city authority <Col N="131" /> would make sure that these needs would be looked after.  They would not be building housing estates without providing telephones, buses and proper policing.</P>
    <P>When the new local councils come into office next Monday we will have a golden opportunity to ensure that these new councils will be enabled to deal effectively with the real problems of the people in their areas.  Apart from the elections of mayors and council chairmen, the political make-up of these councils is not a big factor.  At the moment the influence of the councils running our cities is marginal.  Since the abolition of rates, the powers of city and county managers are less than they used to be.  These councils should be vested with the authority to influence the cultural, social and economic lives of the cities which they are supposed to be running.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is undertaking a review of the 1972 Statement by the Government on Regional Policy, that this review will include an examination of the strategy adopted in relation to major urban areas in that Statement, and that Dáil Éireann approves of the action taken by the Government to establish an Inner City Group to develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the Dublin inner city area and to make an additional £1 million available in 1979 to accelerate progress in dealing with inner city problems.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will begin by saying that I welcome Deputy Mitchell's constructive approach when he moved the motion and for his suggestion that he might even accept my amendment.  I fear that some of the wording of the original motion is rather emotive.  It might be simpler to proceed, <Col N="132" /> on this occasion at any rate, on the normal parliamentary convention of a Government moving its amendment.  I take the basic point that Deputies on both sides of the House are concerned about the manner in which development takes place or about the lack of development in certain urban areas and the need to adapt our institutional arrangements and to adapt policies which are appropriate to the circumstances of the 1980s rather than simply echo the practices of former decades and, indeed, centuries.</P>
    <P>The reason I begin by making reference to regional policy is because it is important, if we are talking about developing a relevant contemporary approach, that issues like this should not be tackled piecemeal.  While I recognise the importance of ensuring appropriate developments for Dublin, I do not believe this can be achieved if you simply look at Dublin in isolation.  You must look at Dublin in its national context.  It is a capital city; it has a very substantial proportion of our total population.  It would be wrong to allow any group&mdash;whether it be the greater Dublin authority or the existing Dublin bodies, or a Government Department or other agency&mdash;to develop a programme of action for Dublin, simply by reference to what exists or what is identified as being within the boundaries of the Dublin area itself.  On the contrary, if we are to set about this in a satisfactory manner, we must begin by looking at the problem in national terms and asking what are the likely trends in our overall population growth and in the characteristics of that population, and then facing up to the very important and very difficult question of the geographical distribution of that population&mdash;in other words, where those people are going to live and work.</P>
    <P>There have been for long periods of time established patterns of movement. We have had a pronounced tendency to internal migration from the countryside into the cities and towns, Dublin being the most pronounced example of that internal migration.  If we are thinking seriously about the future development of the nation and of the satisfactory urban structure within that overall context, we must face up to the question of <Col N="133" /> whether each area is allowed to grow spontaneously and build to accommodate whatever population emerges within its boundaries, or whether there should be a deliberate policy designed to encourage or influence either, in some instances, movement to a particular area or, in other instances, to slow down or prevent movement to particular areas.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that for several decades there have been occasional references and discussions and emphases on the importance of development of a positive regional policy which would have, as one of its aims, a sufficient pattern of growth in centres outside Dublin.  This would achieve a better balance of urban development in the country as a whole, rather than a top heavy structure in which there is just one large urban conglomeration in Dublin and relatively small and underdeveloped urban structures in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There have been some earlier attempts at tackling this problem and some positive results have been achieved, but the last policy statement in this area was the 1972 statement on regional policy. The first task that must be undertaken is to update that policy statement, to bring it into line with existing population characteristics and to seek to anticipate and to identify the probable development which is required into the 1980s.  That, in my view, will enable us to define the most appropriate context for the future development of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have to emphasise that it is not simply a question of thinking in terms of numbers, of ways of ensuring that more job opportunities and more housing and so forth are available in other centres throughout the country so that there is no longer the need for internal migration into Dublin from the rest of the country. It is also a question of looking at the other roles that a capital city plays in the life of the nation.  Deputy Mitchell referred to particular types of buildings not having been provided since independence. It is not only a question of buildings; it is a question of whether it is the focal point for certain forms of cultural and social activities.  In some instances, it may be the only centre of such activities, in which, typically, a <Col N="134" /> capital city has a predominant role, in a number of cultural and social spheres. These roles and characteristics need to be identified and some relevant policy stance adopted if we are to embark on any worthwhile pattern for future development.</P>
    <P>It is enough, in the limited time at my disposal, to emphasise the importance of that point.  I stress it because it was one that did not arise in Deputy Mitchell's remarks and, however important and however difficult the issues arising in Dublin or any other urban centre may be, I must emphasise that they cannot be tackled satisfactorily in isolation from what is required for the country as a whole.  Given that we can approach the matter in that national context, that we can achieve some adequate statement of the appropriate regional balance, regional distribution, of future development, then we can focus on the particular issues that would arise in any Dublin area.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the second part of the motion before us, which was dealt with in part of my amendment, namely, the emphasis on Dublin itself, which is the most clear-cut example of urban development and redevelopment problems that arise.  Although the actual size of these problems may be greater in the Dublin area, they are by no means confined to Dublin.  Similar problems about the use of space in urban areas, about the prolonged existence of derelict sites to which reference was made, arise in other centres throughout the country. What is needed is a comprehensive approach in tackling these questions.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make, not by way of apology but by way of trying to put the issue in perspective, is that this type of problem of the growth, decay and change of urban areas, especially the inner core or central city areas, is by no means a uniquely Irish problem.  On the contrary, it is a universal phenomenon in the western world that there are spontaneous patterns of development which have operated over the centuries and these produce natural movements.  We are touching on some very complex issues of how people live their lives and, indeed, the nature of the freedom they can enjoy in a democracy <Col N="135" /> when we start delving into these questions and asking: &ldquo;Are people free to live, work, trade or carry on various social and cultural activities in particular physical locations?&rdquo;  What we see today is the fact that whereas in the past there were sound reasons why people and economic activity should have concentrated into small, tightly knit areas, such as we now call inner-city areas, they no longer operate today.  We have seen a different pattern of development in recent decades reflecting the different characteristics of the 20th century, especially the second half of it.</P>
    <P>When mass transport was, in effect, not available and before the advent of buses, motor cars and so on, it made sense for housing, factories, shops and other activities to be tightly knit into geographical areas.  In recent decades we have seen the speed and relative cheapness of transport making it possible for people to develop a more mixed pattern of location.  The suburban form is a typical one which enables people to go on working in an inner city area where they are not particularly concerned about the external environment because it is primarily regarded as simply the location in which to carry on their occupation and, on the other hand, enables them to locate their homes in suburbia where they have some of the features of the countryside, the green spaces and safe play areas for children, the healthier environment away from the factory fumes and so on.  That was the underlying rationale for the growth of suburbia.  It is not a pattern to be attacked or despised.  I am not necessarily endorsing monotonous or unimaginative development or what can be described as&mdash;using Deputy Mitchell's words &mdash;featureless rabbit warrens of housing. It should be remembered that for the first time in history they gave thousands of people the opportunity to have a decent amount of housing space with a decent patch for their own flower beds and reasonably safe areas for their children to grow up in and play in.  That should be contrasted with the very cramped and over-crowded inner city environments from which many of them had come. One has only to look at the old <Col N="136" /> photographs of Dublin or read some of the historical descriptions of the city, even into the early years of this century, to know of the appalling conditions under which the majority of Dubliners lived.  One would then recognise that the featureless rabbit warrens of suburbia would have been regarded as paradise by many of those people had they been given the opportunity to enjoy them.</P>
    <P>Those types of movements are not simple one-way items to be easily denounced or attacked and neither are they to be perpetuated.  The rationale which gave rise to them has certainly diminished in relative importance.  This is the sort of issue which we must now face.  If we ask what were the features which caused the inner city to decay we would have to say that the relative decay emerged because we had this separation or split between the working functions and the residential or leisure functions of people.  Once they transferred to their homes away from their working environments we come across the phenomenon of city areas that died at 5.30 or 6 p.m. However, there is another phenomenon in that typically those areas do not die altogether.  They produce certain categories of population and the phenomenon there has been that overwhelmingly it is the lower income families who end up inhabiting, relatively speaking, the older inner city areas.  That then gives rise to a different kind of social problem because, classically, a healthy city depends on an adequate mix of people.  It is necessary to have people with all kinds of interests, skills, attitudes and incomes if we are to have a vibrant, healthy and dynamic community.  Once we allow our cities to become very highly compartmentalised or, to use the derogatory term, once we allow ghettos to be created, almost inevitably the quality of life for people is adversely affected.</P>
    <P>If we look at the reasons why this type of segregation or compartmentalisation of people should occur we start stumbling on the individual policies that were pursued over the years, very often with the best intentions.  Of course, we know that it is the road to hell and not to paradise that is paved with good intentions.  One finds that with the best <Col N="137" /> of good intentions one gets sectionalised or compartmentalised policies which may be dealing with planning regulations, permitting different types of development to take place or may be dealing with housing or taxation policies. It may be a variety of factors which end up producing effects that certainly were not intended and, very often, were not thought of by the originators of policies.</P>
    <P>One of the important examples I should like to give&mdash;it is a telling argument that is usually neglected in any reference to rates&mdash;for instance, for the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings to which insufficient attention was given, is that they were a factor which served to intensify the movement out of inner city areas to the suburbs.  Typically, the older houses in the inner areas had higher valuations.  As house prices and house tax rose the newer suburban houses became doubly attractive not only because of their more attractive locations but also because they carried a smaller tax burden.  One of the encouraging features of the last few years has been the tendency for this outward flow to be halted.  Indeed there is now some inward movement because the relative costs of living in an inner-city housing unit have been significantly reduced through the abolition of rates.  That is a very important, very desirable and very healthy social feature in our community because, as I have said already, it is undesirable that the majority of people living in the inner-city area should be predominantly from one particular income or social group.  It always struck me as one of the paradoxes that it was only people with the smallest incomes who apparently could afford to go on living on the most expensive sites in the country.  That illustrates the point I am trying to make about the effects of policies not necessarily being the ones that were originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>These are the sorts of problems which have to be looked at and of course if we use these as examples, then I would certainly agree with Deputy Mitchell on one point and that is that there is not going to be any satisfactory solution to them by going at them in isolation and having individual agencies and going off at <Col N="138" /> tangents in tackling them.  Instead we need some comprehensive approach which seeks to look at the total space within a defined area.  In a different context we may be looking specifically at the inner-city area or we may be looking at the greater Dublin area and so on. Whatever the particular geographical entity we take we must look at the population characteristics to which I referred at the outset; then we must look at the range of facilities, the range of activities that would be appropriate for that type of population.  So we must immediately look at the question of facilities and opportunities for work, facilities and opportunities for leisure, facilities for children and the various specialised facilities that are needed, whether for leisure activities, caring for the old and for the sick and so on.  It is only by developing a comprehensive set of development proposals that we can hope to achieve a satisfactory resolution of these issues.</P>
    <P>Even in going at it in this way I have to come back to one of the points to which I referred earlier and that is that ultimately we are touching on very important issues in the lines between individual freedom and the need to achieve solutions that are desirable for the overall well-being of the community.  We can all now look at the product or the work of the Wide Streets Commissioners and say that it was great that people had the foresight in relation to O'Connell Street but the people who were affected at the time, I am sure, regarded this as an unwarranted intrusion on their privacy upsetting their established way of life.  We see the same sort of problems today where we need to get a change of use for a particular block of land and it does not matter whether we want the land for a new road or new houses or new office blocks or new shops.  There will always be some people who will be upset by the change in the <i>status quo.</i> One of the most important tasks that we have as politicians representing the interests of the people is to make sure that we convey to them the importance, the necessity and the desirability of having a healthy degree of change.  We have to emphasise that the one option that is not open to any community is to try to insist <Col N="139" /> on the total preservation or freezing of the <i>status quo</i> because that is a classic recipe for guaranteeing stagnation and decay with all its consequent damage to the future health and vitality of the community itself.</P>
    <P>So, we need then to identify policy for change, policy for development, policy for progress that must inevitably call for some upset in the existing pattern of activity, and therefore for some expressions of concern by those who are affected by the change.  Nonetheless one of our tasks must be to ensure that there is a sufficient degree of support and understanding and goodwill in the community as a whole to permit that type of development to take place.  I do not believe that we are going to be able to solve all these problems overnight. Indeed I doubt if one ever in that sense solves this kind of problem because the healthy community, the healthy society is one in which there will always be change taking place, and just as one feels that one has successfully tackled and overcome the issues of today, tomorrow will present itself with its new questions and its new challenges which must be faced and resolved.</P>
    <P>The approach on which we have embarked in the inner-city group arose from the work of an inter-departmental committee reporting to me.  That represents the first step on the part of the Government to produce the type of comprehensive approach to issues of inner-city development and issues of general urban development which are at the heart of this type of motion.  The commitment that we have already made financially is designed as an indication of our intention to speed up the progress in these areas and particularly to use these funds as pump primers or as ways of initiating work rather than losing time while items are channelled through the various separate agencies, be they central or local, which are inevitably involved once there is any large scale proposal at issue.  For that reason then I am confident that tackling the issues in this way will enable a much more rapid and much more positive level of progress to be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> The actual question of the changes in the institutional arrangements which should accompany any more vigorous approach to the inner-city question is something which we can leave for another occasion.  I would rather begin by using the various departments and agencies that are there and simply injecting a type of co-ordinating function into them rather than attempting to redesign a system from scratch.  While I sympathise with many of the sentiments which Deputy Mitchell expressed in that area at the need for institutional reform, I am sure he will agree that the first consequence of his seeking to put through any major reform along the lines he proposes would be to, in effect, stultify and hold up all progress for quite some time because evidently there would be very prolonged disputes and debates as to the most desirable institutional reforms.  So if we are genuinely concerned about doing something positive for the people of the inner city and indeed the other urban areas which require it, surely we can agree that it is possible to make a worth while start and be doing things which require action.  Surely we can agree that it is possible to make a worth while start and do things.  Perhaps then when we have accumulated sufficient experience and can point to sufficient achievements we can also think in terms of carrying out some institutional modifications that may be appropriate to see us through the 1980s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not represent a constituency that has any great share of inner-city residents in it but part of my constituency experiences the same problems.  I have studied inner-city problems for some time particularly in relation to education.  It is not only important and inevitable but essential that if the inner-city problems are to be solved those who live and work there and those who represent the people living there need all the help they can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sad truth is that our inner cities today are in a sense in a minority position. They are old communities, already small to begin with, that have been fragmented by many forces.  They do not have the political power in many instances  <Col N="141" /> to achieve or help bring about the changes they would like to see in society.  What we need to bring these changes about is not to let the inner city fend for itself or fester and rot but have a co-ordinated plan of action, perhaps as suggested in this motion, which would involve the energies, capabilities and enthusiasm, not just of the inner-city people themselves, although this is important, but of the whole community.</P>
    <P>It is possible to think of the inner city as an Irish colony.  It is an internal colony in our society.  It is a community of people who are depressed economically in comparison with many other sectors of the population and whose physical and financial circumstances can, and often are, exploited by those around them.  One only has to look at what has happened to housing in the inner city over a period of a half of a century to see the remorseless way in which the forces of capital and of commerce have eaten into and all but destroyed living communities.  I do not want to be understood as saying that what we had in the centre of our cities 50 and 60 years ago represents a state of affairs to which we want to return.  In physical and economic terms and, in many respects, in social terms the picture was one of fairly intense deprivation.  That was not the whole picture.  The picture also included aspects of vitality, culture and life which go when these communities go. These communities have been remorselessly nibbled away at by what are sometimes called the forces of progress in our society.  Slum clearance is the polite word for it.  Until comparatively recently slum clearance meant just that.  It meant a policy, perhaps well meaning but altogether socially disastrous in its effect, of compulsory relocation of people from the heart of the city in which they had been born and bred away out to the outskirts, into suburbs and new communities which had been planned with no respect for the human scale or no consciousness of the needs of human beings living in communities, which had been planned in the belief that four walls and a roof constituted a home.</P>
    <P>We can read in our history books and those of our neighbouring island of the <Col N="142" /> highland clearance when the highlanders in Scotland were forcibly and physically removed from their ancestral crofts to make way for sheep because there was more money in sheep than in people.  It is not difficult to see that something of the same kind happened, although the motives have not by any means been so consciously commercial, in relation to our inner cities.  In the inner cities property is more important than people. The value of a tenement house with 12 or 13 families in it compared to the value of the plot of land on which that tenement house stands hardly bears comparison. These economic forces over 50 or 60 years have been operating to fracture the urban population, to denude it of its essential life blood, which is people, and to replace the people who live there by a network of commercial institutions and central institutions of other kinds.</P>
    <P>When my colleague, Deputy James Tully, was Minister for Local Government, a serious attempt was made to put a halt to, if not actually to reverse, this process and to build houses in the inner city to replace the houses that were being destroyed there.  This is the kind of policy that is open to objection on the grounds of cost.  Housing in the inner city costs more.  Economists who talk about costs in our society can never cost in the human element, the cost of physical relocation of people or the cost of destruction of human communities.  It is my contention that when one adds in these costs to the overall total one will find that the cost of putting more housing back into the inner city and of achieving and creating a better balance between residential and commercial development in the heart of our cities and towns balances out fairly equally all around.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many Members of this House have walked through the centre of the commercial city of London at night.  It is dead.  It is supposed to be the heart of the city but it is a heart that stops beating at 6 o'clock.  If we are not careful the same thing will happen in our capital city and perhaps in other cities as well.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the need for development and action in the centre city in relation to housing and to land <Col N="143" /> use generally but this is a programme which takes time and will cost money. Governments of any description have a built-in resistance to spending money which does not yield short or mediumterm results.  There are other areas of policy which should be explored and which are referred to specifically in this motion.</P>
    <P>The one I am most familiar with is in relation to education.  I should like to draw the attention of the House and of the Government to what I believe some of the needs are in this area.  I am not pointing the finger of scorn at this Government in the matter of education in the inner city.  Most of our Governments have been to blame to some extent in failing to realise that the educational provision in the inner city has been at best inadequate and at worst a joke.  To be fair to these Governments, unfortunately it is true that not a lot of research has been done until comparatively recent times into educational deprivation, into what the words &ldquo;educational deprivation&rdquo; actually mean, and into strategies destined to counter it.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is a Government supported project in Rutland Street for the pre-school education of two and three-year-old children.  The initial report based on the experience of that school was written within the past few years. One of the ironies of that report has been its implicit finding that, even though this pre-school made some measurable differences in the educational attainment of the children who went to it, the improvement they registered in their brief period at the pre-school was all but wiped out when they went on to the orthodox primary schools.  This is an object lesson in the truth of the proposition that you simply cannot solve a problem by tackling just one bit of it.</P>
    <P>If I concentrate on education in my remaining remarks, it will not be because I believe that by adopting a radical new educational policy you can solve the problems of the inner city&mdash;I do not believe that and I have never said it&mdash; but because I believe a fresh look at the educational situation in the inner city is essential if we are to help solve these <Col N="144" /> overall problems.  Of course we need the other things.  We need the housing factor and the recreational factor to be looked at.  We need to look at the cultural environment and the physical environment. We need to spend resources in all these areas.</P>
    <P>Just as we cannot expect educational reform to solve the problems of these areas it is also fair to argue that these problems cannot be solved if we ignore the needs of education in the inner city. The Rutland Street project is at present suffering from a malaise which affects many inner-city schools, very simply, a decreasing number of children available to go to it because of the declining population of the inner-city area.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister for Education not to scale down the financial support available to the Rutland Street project simply because fewer children are attending the school.  The very first thing he should do, for example, is to abandon the split day which I believe operates there at the moment so as to ensure that mothers with children at the school can plan their households more effectively.  I should hate to see the Rutland Street project winding down and ending not with a bang but with a whimper as the population of the centre of the city winds down.  It should be a power house of invention and ideas and experiments at the service initially of its immediate community but ultimately of the total community in which it is situated.</P>
    <P>In educational terms the centre of the city has fulfilled a very odd function in our society.  Because radial transport routes traditionally served the centre of the city very effectively and very efficiently a tradition has grown up of having very large, very prestigious and often fee-paying second-level schools in the heart of the poorest and most deprived areas of our community which draw their pupils from a catchment area which can be anything up to ten and 12 miles distant.  It is an affront to the social conscience of any enlightened nation to see the contrast between such splendid schools and the decayed environment in which they are situated.  It is sad that the nature of our educational system, and also of our economic system, has helped <Col N="145" /> to create a situation in which barely any, if any at all, of the children who live within a couple of hundred yards of the doors of these schools can ever hope to go through them to get their education.</P>
    <P>Cheek by jowl in the centre of the city you have these splendid schools endowed with private and public funds catering for children who come from outside&mdash;some of them may even come from my own constituency&mdash;and the schools catering for the indigenous population.  I use the term &ldquo;indigenous population&rdquo; advisedly because they are viewed in much the same way as the colonialists previously viewed the natives.  There is one set of schools perhaps not overgenerously but well endowed catering for one group of the population, and another group of schools much more inadequately endowed catering for the natives, the indigenous population.  We must really look again at that situation.</P>
    <P>I believe that because we have radial transport routes and because they will remain and we hope will become more efficient rather than less efficient, it obviously makes sense to locate important educational institutions in the centre of the city.  The important educational institutions we need in the centre of the city are not ones which are selective, are not ones which draw their clientele only from the outer ring of suburbs.  I would argue very strongly that on each side of the city of Dublin, at or inside the Royal Canal on one side and the Grand Canal on the other, there should be a major second-level educational institution under local authority control, whether under the VEC or some similar regional system.  Such a school would, of course, draw pupils from the outer suburbs, but it would also be open and available to pupils from the inner suburbs, pupils from the internal colonies of our society. To think and plan in this direction would be at least to challenge the acute discrepancy in educational opportunities which exists at the moment between some of the children in our society and some of the other children in our society.</P>
    <P>Another point is the amount of money we spend on the education of children, especially on the education of children in the inner suburbs.  Some of us are <Col N="146" /> prepared to talk continually about equality of educational opportunities. We talk about this subject with such passion and enthusiasm as to give the impression that it is possible to achieve equality of educational opportunity without passing first through the phase labelled &ldquo;equality of educational expenditure&rdquo;. We do not have anything like equality of educational opportunity.  The way in which we spend moneys voted for education is in no way related to the actual needs of the pupils on whom these moneys are spent.  I do not know whether any Member of the House has read Father McGrail's excellent study of education in the Dublin area.  He has produced a map which in graphic terms by way of shading, dots and so on, depicts the relative percentage for the population in each of the city wards who go on to upper secondary and third-level education.</P>
    <P>The centre of the city is a black area in more senses than one because it is there that the proportion of children who go on to upper secondary and third-level education is lowest.  We are invited&mdash;but not by Father McGrail&mdash;to conclude from that that the reason for this situation is that the children are either too stupid or that they lack the motivation necessary to enable them to continue.  I will not be part of any racist argument that is based on the belief that the level of stupidity in Ireland is ascertainable and definable geographically.  That is not possible and no one need truck with the argument that the difference between educational participation is related to whether the parents of the children concerned have any regard for education.</P>
    <P>In the inner-city area many children leave school before the compulsory school-going age.  The ESRI have calculated that the loss to a family in economic terms is the equivalent of about £700 per year in respect of a child who is at school but who would otherwise be in employment.  For a long time there has been a need, though that need has not been met yet from central government resources, for some kind of financial support grant to enable second-level students to bridge the gap between the end of the compulsory school-going age and the beginning of the grant aid <Col N="147" /> for third-level education.  Unless many students get some realistic financial help to bridge that gap the whole notion of equality of educational opportunity is a myth.</P>
    <P>There is another reason for this alleged lack of interest in education among parents in the inner-city area and that is that with the best will in the world they have often reached the conclusion that the educational system they experienced did nothing by way of meeting their real needs.  How could it meet their needs when in so many ways it is dominated by the universities and when the entire educational system reaching down even still to the upper regions of the primary school is dominated by the number of points that 20 per cent of our children or less are expected to get when they reach the leaving certificate year?</P>
    <P>I would urge an extension of the Rutland Street project idea into the primary level and into the post-primary level so that we might investigate the social, the economic, the cultural and also the educational reasons for schools in the centre-city area not being regarded by the people who live there as being of any great value to them in their struggle against the very many unequal forces with which they must contend.  I would urge the creation, if resources permit, of the kind of educational institution at second level that I am talking of to help revitalise the inner city.  I would suggest very strongly that these inner-city communities on which so little is spent in terms of education should at least be given more direct control over the amount of money that is being spent on them.  In these areas where children will go to school at six, or at five if they are lucky, and where they will begin to leave school at 11 or 12, the expenditure per child is low.  These children will not have the opportunity to avail of the subsidies that are available to upper second-level education, a level which is reached only by about half of the children in the inner city.  Few of these children go on to third-level education where the annual subsidy is now at more than £1,000 per year.  That is all the more reason that we should be creating experimental communities  <Col N="148" /> and structures in the inner city areas to allow the parents and the teachers in these communities to exercise real options in the spending of the money.  Modern history has shown that we have made mistakes, that our administrators, well-intentioned though they are, have made mistakes in deciding how this money should be spent.  We must allow the consumers of the system to have a greater say in deciding how the money should be spent.  If such an experiment works well in the inner city, there is no reason for its not working elsewhere.  Instead of becoming a source of decay in our society the inner city should become a crucible for change and for experiment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the fact that there are more than 2,000 acres of derelict sites in the inner-city area.  Both public authorities and private interests are extremely culpable for permitting these areas which are ripe for development and for proper use to lie in a situation of decay.  In this connection I must admit my personal disappointment that although I announced in the 1973 budget that steps would be taken to introduce  <Col N="149" /> legislation to penalise the owners of derelict sites in the inner city for allowing their sites to remain in that condition, all kinds of administrative delays and obstacles were put up against our efforts for reform in this area.  If we are a caring community we ought to introduce legislation to penalise heavily the owners of derelict sites within the inner-city area in order to make it less profitable to leave sites in dereliction than to develop them.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention also to what I regard as an indication of the indifference of the Government to people in the urban areas.  I refer to the appalling accumulation of festering refuse in Dublin.  I shall not make light of the difficulties of the Government in relation to industrial problems and to demands which are being made by one sector for incomes beyond the level which our society can bear.

      <P>Deputy Bruton has asked for and received permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 40 of 30 May 1979 to ask the Minister for Social Welfare if UK pensioners being paid by him under reciprocal arrangements with the UK Government are receiving full sterling value pensions or the equivalent figure in Irish pounds.  The Deputy has not more than 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising a matter which in my view is of very considerable <Col N="150" /> importance because the net effect of it has been that 30,000 old age pensioners resident in this country have lost approximately £1 million in pensions which they should have been receiving under normal rates and on the basis of contributions they made during their working life in the UK.  They have lost £1 million in effective value of these pensions since we broke the link with sterling and the Irish pound sank in value <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling to approximately 95 per cent or 95p for the Irish pound for every 100p for the British pound.</P>
      <P>To set this matter in context I will quote from the Minister for Social Welfare himself.  He said in the Official Report of 30 May 1979, column 1781, Volume 314:</P>
      <P>On the entry of this country into the European Monetary System in March last it was agreed with the British postal authorities that, as a temporary measure, British pensioners in this country and Irish pensioners in Britain would continue to be paid their pensions at post offices at the rates shown on their pension books.</P>
      <P>At that time there was only a slight difference in the exchange rates and this arrangement was regarded as the most equitable method of payment for pensioners in both countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 30,000 British pensioners living in Ireland who are being paid on this basis and approximately 5,000 Irish pensioners living in England who are being paid their pensions.  The British pensioners living in Ireland, almost all of whom are Irish people who have returned having spent a large part of their working life in Britain, are receiving pensions in Irish pounds.  In other words, if they were living in Britain they would be getting their pensions in British pounds and would be getting 100p for every pound.  Because they are living here in Ireland they are getting only 95 British pence for every pound. They are being paid in Irish money which is worth 5 per cent less than they would be getting&mdash;and are entitled to&mdash;if they were living either across the Border or in Britain, in other words if <Col N="151" /> they had not come home to live in this country.</P>
    <P>The fact that they are being paid in Irish pounds and not in the proper currency, which is the currency in which the pension is set, has incurred for them this loss of about £1 million since this country entered the EMS.  There is a net loss to pensioners overall as a result of these arrangements and the pensioners living here are losing out, whereas the Irish pensioners living in Britain and being paid the British currency value of their Irish pensions would if they were living here be receiving that money in Irish pounds which are worth less. Therefore, 30,000 people are losing 5 per cent on the value of their pensions and 5,000 people are gaining 5 per cent. Approximately six times as many pensioners are losing as are gaining under the present arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer&mdash;whether it be the British Exchequer or the Irish Exchequer I cannot say at this stage until we hear what the Minister for Social Welfare has to say&mdash;one Exchequer or the other, is gaining a significant amount of money at the expense of pensioners as a result of these patched-up arrangements which were made when this country departed from its pound-for-pound link with sterling. The Minister told me in his reply of 30 May&mdash;which it must be remembered was three months after this country entered the EMS and about two months after the link had been broken&mdash;that this matter, whereby the pensioners are losing so much money, as I have indicated and will continue to lose it unless something is done</P>
    <P>... is, however, under active discussion between officials of my Department and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and officials of the corresponding British Ministries with a view to finding a solution which will be equitable and convenient to the pensioners.</P>
    <P>He gave no indication whatever as to any time within which these arrangements would be completed.  He did not even indicate that there would ever be a solution to the problem.  He merely said <Col N="152" /> that discussions were continuing.  He gave no evidence that any final solution would be achieved.  I am surprised that he did not do so because he could see, as can any sensible person, that 30,000 Irish people are losing a substantial amount of money every week as a result of these arrangements.  All he could say was that the matter was under active discussion. These pensioners have already lost £1 million of money to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I asked if the Minister would give an assurance that a retrospective refund would be made to these pensioners. They have already lost money since the link was broken and they are continuing to be paid in a currency which is worth less than the currency in which their pensions are set.  The Minister said quite emphatically as reported at column 1782 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>No, I will not.</P>
    <P>He was quite clear that he would not give any assurance that a refund to these pensioners of money to which they are manifestly, morally and legally entitled would be given.  He gave no undertaking that a refund would be made, or that he would even seek in the discussions which he told us were taking place actively that such a refund would be made.  This is very disappointing indeed, particularly when one bears in mind that the people who are losing this money and have lost approximately £1 million already by arrangements which have not changed are as a general rule amongst the poorest people living in this country.  We all agree on all sides of the House that the old, those on pensions, are, if not the least well-off section of our community or any community in the western world at least amongst that section.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if money of this sort were being lost by businessmen or by people organised in a trade union, the Minister would long ago have brought the so-called active discussions to a termination and would have achieved a result and given a refund.  Neither businessmen nor trade unionists would be prepared to accept a situation where they go on losing approximately £1 every week on their incomes by virtue of <Col N="153" /> these arrangements.  If it were business people or trade unionists who were involved, people organised as a group, they would have demanded and obtained action from the Minister to rectify this situation.  However, pensioners, be they UK pensioners living in Ireland or Irish pensioners living in the UK, are not organised in a manner to obtain this sort of action.  Their only resort, therefore, is to have the matter raised here in the Dáil, as I have done today and on 30 May.  I hope that by doing so we will have a definite commitment from the Minister to (a) have this anomaly put right and (b) have a refund made to the pensioners who have lost money already by virtue of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>When replying will the Minister also indicate the financial arrangements between his Department and the British Department?  If the Minister is paying UK pensioners living in Ireland in Irish £s are the Irish authorities being paid the equivalent amount in British £s by way of refund from the British authorities?  Is the Irish Exchequer getting the 5 per cent difference between what they are paying out and what they are being paid by the UK authorities, or are the UK authorities only paying the Irish authorities 95p for every £ in British pension values commensurate with the fact that pensioners living here are only being paid in Irish £s?  Who is getting the money?  Clearly the pensioners are not getting it.  Which exchange is reaping the benefit?  I am seeking a solution to this problem and a refund to the pensioners of the money they have lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Bruton on this issue.  Deputy Bruton has outlined the problem quite clearly and I am entirely familiar with the situation.  In my constituency quite a number of pensioners are affected by the situation. There has been a good deal of confusion and we need absolute clarification from the Minister as to the extent to which progress has been made in the discussions between himself and representatives of the British Department of Social Security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have received a number of inquiries from pensioners and we do not wish to see those people suffer under the <Col N="154" /> transitional EMS arrangements.  The arrangements that have developed are likely to continue for many years and it is necessary for us to plan ahead to see to what extent the shortfall can be met either in these negotiations or by way of representations to the current British administration. In the previous administration, when I broached this subject with some of them whom I met at Council of Europe level, I detected some sympathy. I am not at all sure that the current administration in the UK would be as sympathetic or as understanding.  I join with Deputy Bruton in asking the Minister for the details of the active discussions and of how he proposes to meet the shortfall which is quite evident in relation to the pension cheques of the pensioners directly concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In our case there is nothing dramatically new.  We have lived with this sort of thing for many years so far as American pensioners are concerned.  Retired Americans living here drawing US pensions have had to take their chance. They are paid in dollars and have to abide by the prevailing rate for the dollar. In regard to Britain and Ireland there are a number of complicating factors in regard to pensions.  It is important to make it clear that neither Exchequer is gaining at the moment.  This temporary arrangement has brought about a standstill situation.  When it was made nobody anticipated that it would be of great significance one way or the other. The punt has fallen very considerably against sterling since and it is now a matter of some significance.  However, neither Exchequer is gaining at the expense of the other or at the expense of the pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>British pensioners here are paid at the face value of the pension in Irish £s, and the same applies in Britain.  Irish pensioners over there are paid at whatever the face value of the pension is, in sterling. This situation although not as significant arises in the case of other European countries, but one of the difficulties in the case of Britain and ourselves and the other European countries is that the EEC are not willing to contemplate any form of compensation  <Col N="155" /> being paid for fluctuations in exchange rates, because in effect what that would mean is that a national in a certain country drawing his pension in another country would get more than the national who stayed at home.  On the other side of the fence another national might lose.  There could be a situation where a French person or a German person living in Ireland was getting a better pension than his fellow countryman living at home.  In our case there is also the additional factor of the disruption of the postal services which has completely distorted the situation.</P>
    <P>The present position is that we made this temporary agreement with the British authorities and we have been pressing for discussions to work out some system to deal with the situation. We have arranged for these discussions to take place this Thursday.  We will have to discuss the matter fully and hear what arrangements the British authorities wish to make.  There will be no easy solution.  The most likely thing is that each side will just pay the appropriate amount in each other's country.  That would certainly be in keeping with the EEC provisions. However, I do not want to prejudge the discussions before they take place.  We have been pressing for these discussions and Thursday's meeting is at our instance.</P>
    <P>The figures given are more or less correct. There are about 30,000 persons living in Ireland drawing British pensions and about 5,000 persons in Britain drawing Irish pensions.  Of course the present arrangement means that people living in Britain drawing Irish pensions are gaining whereas British pensioners living her are losing.  But I would have to put the word losing in inverted commas. I think we would all agree that the British pensioner here has a moral right to exchange his pension at its full rate. But it is really a matter for the British authorities to say what they want done. After all, these pensions are paid by the British authorities; the arrangement is between the pensioner and the British authorities; we are&mdash;if you like&mdash;a paying mechanism only; we just pay out, <Col N="156" /> and we would pay out whatever the British agree should be paid out.</P>
    <P>I just want to make this point.  I know it is a dangerous point for me to make because it could be misinterpreted but I want to say that, strictly speaking, a British pensioner living here, cashing his pension, is not losing in a material sense. Because he is living in Ireland and paying Irish prices, to that extent, he is exactly the same though&mdash;and again I repeat&mdash;we would probably all admit that he has a moral claim to cash his British pension stipulated to be paid in sterling at its full rate unless the paying authority, which is the British Government, indicates that something else should be done.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that is all I can say to the House at this stage except to say that we will be having these discussions on Thursday and, as a result of them, I will make a fuller report to the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

We are paying British pensions at the expressed rate in Irish £s and <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;British post offices are paying Irish pensions over there in sterling at the rate expressed in the pensions.  But we have not done our sums.  We have not done any exchange of funds as a result as yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To be strictly, classically, correct about it, neither should. If one was to follow the sheer economics of the thing, we should pay these British pensions at the sterling equivalent and then claim back the appropriate amount from the British authorities, neither gain or lose on it, and <i>vice versa</i> with them. That means, of course, that either one <Col N="157" /> group or category of pensioners at any given moment is doing a lot better than the other, but this is something we will have to tease out with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>A nurse employed in a permanent capacity by a health board is allowed to retain her existing salary if appointed by competition to a similar type permanent post in another health board.  It is a matter for her new employer, who is the chief executive officer, to decide on her new incremental date.  It is normal practice in the Eastern Health Board that the incremental date of a new employee should be the date of appointment to the <Col N="41" /> board.  In view of this the employer decided that the nurse in question should conform to established practice within the health board.  This means that her next increment will be paid a year after the date of her appointment.</P>

He was then awarded disablement benefit provisionally at the rate appropriate to a degree of disablement assessed at 20 per cent from May 1977 to March 1978.  This rate was reduced to 15 per cent for the period from March 1978 to March 1979 when his claim was due for further review.

As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 9 May 1979, the Government recognise the importance of the Second Window, which enlarges the scope and function of the fund by extending its operation to developing commodity producers who would be unlikely to benefit significantly from the financing of actual buffer stocks.</P>
      <P>The precise amount of our voluntary contribution will be announced when the work on the modalities for the establishment of the fund has been concluded as presently expected towards the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the proposal put forward by the Group of 77 at the recent Fifth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD V) which took place in Manila, 7 May&mdash;3 June 1979.  This would provide for the holding of global consultations within the framework of UNCTAD on policies in the fields of trade, development, money and finance and for the establishment of <Col N="51" /> an <i>ad hoc</i> group of government experts to prepare a report for these global consultations. This proposal was originally contained in the declaration issued following the Ministerial Conference of the Group of 77, held at Arusha, Tanzania, in February 1979, in preparation for UNCTAD V.</P>
      <P>At UNCTAD V, the proposal by the Group of 77 was the subject of serious consideration.  Unfortunately because of the limited amount of time available, it was not possible to reach agreement on the text of a resolution on the matter. For this reason, the entire matter has been referred on for consideration by the Trade and Development Board, which will hold the first part of its 19th Session from 2-19 October 1979.</P>
      <P>Ireland can, in principle, support the holding of such global consultations within the mandate of UNCTAD as well as the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> group of government experts to prepare a report for the consultations and will participate constructively in the further discussions on these matters which will take place in the Trade and Development Board.</P>

However, in regard to the main supervisory grades in road services, the question of pay adjustments in the following instances is being examined in the Department.</P>

      <P>The restrictions on lending for house purchase, which the building societies were asked by the Government in August 1978 to apply, include a provision that all applicants for mortgages up to £16,000 for the purchase of new houses should furnish a certificate of reasonable value in respect of the house before their applications could be approved.  At the same time the societies were asked to allocate the amount available to them for house purchase mortgage finance so that not less than 60 per cent was in loans of £13,000 or less, and another 20 per cent in loans of between £13,000 and £16,000, and so that the apportionment of loans as between new and previously-occupied houses would be maintained at levels current at that date.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the societies to administer the restrictions and I have no information or functions regarding individual applications.</P>

      <P>The main functions of the group will be to further the work of the interdepartmental committee and to develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the inner city area.  It will be a matter for Dublin Corporation and not for me to nominate a member of their staff with responsibility for the co-ordination of their efforts in the inner city should this be necessary in the future.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 119 and 120 together.  I am not aware of any objection by the Department of Finance to the formation of the inner city group.  I am, of course, aware of the stance adopted by that Department's representative on the Inter-Departmental Committee on Dublin Inner City in relation to some of the proposals made by the committee.</P>
      <P>While not formally committed to these proposals the Government see them as providing a basis to meet the complex economic and social problems in the inner city.  Accordingly, they have made £1 million additional funds available in 1979 to the inner city group towards a programme to accelerate the pace of action in dealing with these problems.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to comment on specific proposals made by the inter-departmental committee in the absence of advice from the inner city group.  As regards the Deputy's last question I am not aware of the degree of consultation which took place between Dublin Corporation and local community interests on the proposed re-development in the North City designated area and I am not prepared to comment on the remainder of this question in the absence of advice from the inner city group.</P>
