    <Title>Minerals Development Bill, 1978: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 43 and 44, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>13.  &mdash;Without prejudice to the provisions of Part II of the Act of 1940 (which relates to prospecting for unworked minerals), section 12 shall not operate to prevent the owner of an estate or interest in minerals in any land from prospecting for such minerals, that is to say, carrying out any activities for the purpose of ascertaining the character, extent or value of such minerals and taking and removing reasonable quantities of such minerals for analysis, test, trial or experiment where such prospecting is conducted otherwise than as part of the operation of working those minerals if, apart from that section, he would be entitled to conduct such prospecting but such right of prospecting shall not apply in relation to minerals which are being worked by the Minister or are the subject of a State mining lease or a licence under section 16 (1) or be so exercised as to interfere with such working or with the lawful operations of the lessee or licensee.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This and the other amendments which are now before the House arose out of points raised in the course of the Committee Stage debate in the Seanad. The amendments were subsequently agreed by the Seanad when moved at the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to put it beyond doubt that the vesting provision in section 12 of the Bill does not affect any rights which mineral owners have under existing law to prospect for their own minerals, provided such prospecting does not interfere with the operations of the Minister or any other person lawfully entitled to work the minerals.  The desirability of the amendment arises from the fact that the definition of &ldquo;working&rdquo; includes &ldquo;searching for&rdquo;, an activity which would be involved in prospecting.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of interpretation whether prospecting only would come within the definition, but it is desirable to clarify the position that the right vested in the Minister under section 12 does not interfere with any existing rights to prospect for minerals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Title>Health (Family Planning) Bill, 1978: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most controversial section of the Bill and is probably the most confusing, misleading and impractical proposition for many reasons.  There are a number of important words used in this section for which there is no clear explanation and for which, in the process of their explication later in the law courts, the Law Library must be jubilant at the prospects of the fortunes to be made in the interpretations of this section.  I will have to do my best to make whatever definitions and clarifications I can in the hope that the Minister may then tell me where I am wrong or, if I am right, in order that we shall have on the record <Col N="166" /> some kind of undertaking that at least this House saw the defects in the Bill, reminded the Minister of them and possibly that this Minister may decide that he may amend this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes a number of statements.  He claims that the best people to implement this Bill will be members of the medical profession.  He also claims that this Bill is brought in in answer to the Supreme Court decision about the McGee case.  Then he is particularly vague and indecisive on the issue of to whom it is to be permitted that contraceptives shall be made available on the prescription or authorisation of the general practitioner: must these people be married and, if they are, what do we do about the complicated position, which the Minister concedes exists, in relation to the law of marriage in this country?</P>
      <P>The Minister is reported on Radio Éireann as saying that the person who is to get the contraceptives is the individual who &ldquo;in the opinion of the general practitioner formed at the time of giving the prescription or authorisation, sought the contraceptive for the purpose, <i>bona fide</i>, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances&rdquo;.  He then attempted to establish&mdash;at column 320, Volume 313 of the Official Report&mdash;that the Health (Family Planning) Bill, 1978, follows the Supreme Court decision which involves a fundamental change in the law relating to the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the control, sale and supply of contraceptives.  The Deputy seems to be going into matters which were appropriate to the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, subsection (2), says:</P>
      <P>... that the person named in it is a person who, in the opinion of the practitioner formed at the time of the giving of the prescription or authorisation, sought the contraceptive for the purpose, <i>bona fide</i>, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> That is the part of the section with which I am concerned: the Minister's decision to establish that a person who will authorise or prescribe a contraceptive must be a medical practitioner.  He is giving the impression that medical practitioners have accepted this as desirable and he has sought to give the impression that his decision to establish this practice is in accordance with the ruling in the McGee case in the Supreme Court.  I want to refute all these points in some detail because I believe they are very categorical misstatements of fact.</P>
    <P>We should further establish that as things are at present there is no law in force in this State which prohibits the distribution or manufacture of contraceptives for use inside or outside marriage.  This statement was made in the Supreme Court and this decision to change the law in a very fundamental way is, I believe, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.  It is very strange&mdash;and I am very concerned about this&mdash;that any couple, but certainly a married couple, should not have imposed on them a legal responsibility to go to a medical practitioner to establish that they are seeking contraceptives, <i>bona fide</i>, for family planning purposes.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinarily insensitive proposal that the privacy of the individual's marriage should have to suffer this intrusion of somebody outside the marriage in order to make this essentially very personal, very private and very sensitive decision.  Quite frequently, through my life as a socialist, I have been attacked on the broad principles that my socialist beliefs inevitably imply that the State will intervene in the lives of the people in a very direct way and will lay down rigid laws and rigid restrictions to order their lives.  One of my most consistent opponents in this broad conflict of ideologies has been the Minister, yet, if ever <i>1984</i> was epitomised in a piece of legislation surely it is implicit in section 4 of this Bill, and, in particular, in this subsection, that Big Brother should make decisions on behalf of a married couple or a couple who intend either to <Col N="168" /> have a family or not have a family&mdash;to make decisions about the extremely personal, intimate details of their married life.  When the Minister says that this particular proposal in this Bill stems from the ruling in the McGee case, I think he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now dealing with the broad principles, the fundamentals of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The section is confined, irrespective of its reference to the subsection.  It only deals with control of supply and sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing, in some detail, with the right of the Minister to introduce this clause into the Bill.  I dealt with the principle of the Bill on Second Stage; I completely accede that point.  It was quite impossible for us to deal on Second Stage in the required detail on this proposal.  I said it was quite wrong for the Minister to bring in this proposal on Second Stage; I am now attempting to enlarge on the general principle which I attempted to establish at that time and to back my case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to refute, or contradict, or reject a statement without making an argument for it.  That is what Committee Stage is about.  The Minister has said to me, &ldquo;Deputy Browne does not agree with the Bill. This is unfortunate, but this is what it is going to be.&rdquo;  I am explaining now why I do not agree.  He is quite right to reject my simple statement that I do not agree with the Minister's Bill.

      <P>The Chair agrees that the Deputy may have referred to principles in the Bill in order to discuss the section, but not in a detailed Second Reading speech.  The section in question deals only with the logistics of the Bill and with the manner <Col N="169" /> in which it may be operated&mdash;mainly in relation to sale and supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing precisely with the logistics.  The Minister made it clear on an earlier Stage that he would ask the doctors to implement the provisions of the Bill for him.  He said in his Second Reading speech that the doctors are the best people to implement this Bill for him, and particularly this section of the Bill but he is wrong to give the impression that the medical association believe that they should implement, particularly, the section dealing with the non-medical type of contraceptive.  They have repeatedly said that the legislation on contraception is social and political and not medical. They went on to say that the doctors should not be the only route by which non-medical contraceptives should be supplied.  The Minister says, &ldquo;I have consulted various people&rdquo;, and he keeps on consulting people until he gets the opinion that he wants and then he says, &ldquo;The doctors told me this, therefore I must do what they say&rdquo;.  The doctors have said they do not want to be solely responsible for the distribution of non-medical contraceptives.  When they give him advice that he does not want, the Minister persists in attempting to impose this responsibility on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already made the point that there are less than 20 doctors trained in family planning in the country.  The doctors welcome the suggestion that the medical profession should supervise the agents which may affect the health of those people who want the medical type of contraceptives, the IUD, the cap, the pill, and so on, and that is perfectly reasonable.  These should obviously be restricted to supervision by the medical profession.  The Minister, however, inexplicably refused to divide the medical from the non-medical type of contraceptive, so we have the situation where it is true that one type of contraceptive should be made available by general practitioners, but it is highly absurd that contraceptives such as the condom and spermacide should be restricted for prescription to members of the medical profession.  These are articles which are available in barbers <Col N="170" /> shops, chemists' shops, slot machines, anywhere and everywhere, as a result of newspaper advertisements, and through the post quite indiscriminately in most other countries.  There is no case whatever for the Minister's decision to restrict the sale, or the prescription, of contraceptives to the members of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>In fact is has been generally agreed that doctors are almost the last people who should be asked to deal with the question of non-medical planning or contraception.  At the European symposium in Istanbul it was laid down that doctors are not needed for non-medical types of contraception.  The report says that the medical profession, especially obstetricians, have been the greatest obstacle to the development of family planning services all over the world.  A notable example is our own Dr. Arthur Barry, an obstetrician with obviously a vested interest&mdash;as all members of the profession have&mdash;in the baby business, who made a completely hysterical assault on the suggestion that there should be an extension of the availability of artificial contraceptives. He went on with the usual charges that this must lead to abortion and so on.  So that if the Minister is serious in trying to extend the scope of his family planning services then he is certainly not going to do that by restricting the administration of the service to members of the medical profession.  The doctors do not wish to be the instruments by which family planning contraceptives, particularly the non-medical type of contraceptives, are made available.  Many of them are hostile to the extension of contraceptives for various reasons, sometimes simply ideological reasons, sometimes committed conviction and moral beliefs and sometimes the factor of simply ordinary common or garden interests in the very extensive and very valuable business of having babies.</P>
    <P>If the Minister attempts to interpose the medical practitioner he is carrying out a direct assault on the very principle decided on in the McGee case in which it was decided that the individual has natural and human rights over which the <Col N="171" /> State has no authority and the family is the natural, primary and fundamental unit of society which has rights which the State cannot control.  So that the Minister is acting in direct conflict with this rather than introducing a provision which is going to implement the Supreme Court's decision in the McGee case.  In another section of Mr. Justice Walsh's ruling he said:</P>
    <P>It is a matter exclusively for the husband and wife to decide how many children they wish to have and it would be quite outside the competence of the State to dictate or prescribe the number of children they should have.</P>

      <P>I did not indicate that it was satisfactory.  I could not have indicated that it was satisfactory because that is what my whole conflict is with the Minister.</P>
      <P>On the question of <i>bona fide</i> family planning, I went to some trouble to find out what a family is and according to the Oxford English Dictionary a family is:</P>
      <P>1.  Members of a household, parents, children, servants, etc. (<i>happy</i> -, animals of different kinds in one cage); set of parents &amp; children, or of relations, living together or not...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  All decendants of common <Col N="172" /> ancestor, house, lineage, ...; race, group of people from common stock.</P>
    <P>3.  Brotherhood of persons or nations...</P>
    <P>4.  Group of objects distinguished by common features.</P>
    <P>5.  Group of allied genera, ...</P>
    <P>and at the end&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>planning</i>, birth control;</P>
    <P>But in the definition of family, marriage is not referred to at all, so therefore it is important that we try to establish that the Minister cannot restrict the principle of family to what he said in his speech, that it must be a married couple.  I would be glad if he would deal with this matter again because at one stage he quite satisfied me at any rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it.  Our <Col N="174" /> problem with this Bill is the equivocation of the Minister on a number of occasions. We had a good instance of it last night where we had an amendment No. 17 and a further amendment No. 17a One was quite different from the other. We were satisfied with one and then the Minister produced another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 17a was accepted by the House without a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made my point.  One amendment was introduced amending another amendment and that is what I meant by equivocation.  There has also been equivocation on the question of the meaning of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo;, whether it means a married couple, a stable couple or otherwise.  Our laws are confused for the same reasons that we cannot make up our minds to provide for the dissolution of marriage in a divorce.  We have this strange anomaly of annulment by the Catholic Church and the absence of civil law.  The Minister&mdash;perhaps he would enlighten me on this for the last time when he is making his own contribution&mdash;has to admit that he cannot impose on doctors the responsibility of trying to decide who under our laws is married and who is not.  We have the couple who got an annulment from the Catholic Church and are living apart, the couple who have a foreign divorce and are living apart, the couple who have had an annulment and are remarried and the couple who are divorced.  Divorce and annulment are not recognised by our laws.  There can be seven or eight permutations of legal or illegal marriages in our country.  For that reason all the Minister can do is leave the whole question of contraception widely open in the terms of the Oxford English dictionary, that is, practically any couple living together, married or unmarried, divorced or following an annulment, can be considered suitable for being permitted a prescription for contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister can ask any doctor to decide <i>bona fide</i> on the kind of person who should have further children or have no children as the case may be.  This is something which must <Col N="175" /> be clarified.  In my whole approach to the Bill I have tried to slow myself down to the rate of the caterpillar progress of social advances in society in order to come to terms with the kind of debate that must be carried on in this House.  I am not attempting to make any problems in doing so.</P>
    <P>If I was a doctor in general practice and a person came along to me, I do not see how I could say to him or her: &ldquo;I think you are <i>bone fide</i> planning a family&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not think you are <i>bona fide</i> planning a family&rdquo;.  On what grounds could a doctor say this and why should he say it?  Why should a third Irishman or woman intervene between two others when it comes to having their family?  The Minister said at one stage&mdash;this is why it is so important that I deal with this matter&mdash;that <i>bona fide</i> family planning meant that contraceptives would be allowed only to married people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not try to deliberately mislead the House.  What I asked the Minister about was whether married people could decide to have no children.  That I felt was an advance in so far as he said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, that he could not intervene in those circumstances.  It was an advance that we would not compel people who did not want to have children to have them.  With regard to <i>bone fide</i> family planning, that meant <Col N="176" /> that contraceptives would be allowed only to married people.  Now we have it on the Minister's assurance that this is not so.</P>

      <P>Mr. Haughey: I will give you my definition of family planning.  I use the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; because a married couple seems to bring us into some complicated legal situations.  There could be people who are a family and who strictly in the terms of our law are not so regarded.  Can the Deputy accept that?</P>

Despite all the marvellous things said in the Constitution, about the family being the basis of society and so on, there is no definition of the family in the Constitution.  The Minister has given me no definition of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a definition of family planning <i>ad nauseam</i>.  That is the important thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, planning a family.  I ask: what is a family?  I made it quite clear that a family is a group of people living together, men, women and children, dozens of them, or two or three of them.  This is a considerable advance. No wonder the medical profession are very puzzled as to why they should have to intervene in this very private and personal decision between two people.  It is a completely personal whim how the doctor decides.  It is an extraordinary, absurd and inexplicable intervention by another individual in such a private and personal decision.  It must occur to the doctor to ask: &ldquo;Why on earth should I be asked to make a decision between a man and a woman as to whether they should or should not have a family?&rdquo; This provision must make us the laughing stock of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the McGee case concerning this lady's right to have no children and to have the contraceptives of her choice, but even that does not hold up.  The Minister tried to establish that because of the McGee case, a married lady and her husband, the provisions here can be extrapolated in some sort of reverse direction.  The Supreme Court decision was that this <Col N="180" /> married couple must have contraceptives but even that does not hold up because in a dissenting judgment on this question in the Supreme Court, Mr. Fitzgerald said it is well to realise that the plaintiff's claim here is as a citizen and not as a married person and that if any portion of section 17 of the 1935 Act is declared unconstitutional&mdash;and of course it was&mdash;the benefit to be derived from such a decision is equally to be enjoyed by every other citizen married of not.</P>
    <P>The Minister's whole case is in shreds. He is asking for a Supreme Court action to be taken the day this Bill becomes law.  That is why it seems so extraordinary to me that the Minister should make the claim in his Second Reading speech, and subsequently, that he is in fact implementing decisions arising out of the McGee case.  He is not.  This is a crazy provision.  It is completely unworkable. Maybe that is what the Minister has in mind.  It is so totally unworkable and impracticable that perhaps I am wasting my time.  It will go under the carpet and nobody will take any notice of it.  Maybe that is so.</P>
    <P>At the same time if law-abiding citizens want to get permission to buy contraceptives presumably they must consult a lawyer in order to ascertain the position legally, in order to ascertain what variation of Irish marriage is permissible so as to give one the right to decide whether to have a child.  Even more important is the position of the doctor.  He would be in a very vulnerable position and would possibly face a High Court action if he presumed to tell two people who were planning not to have children that in his opinion they should have children.  The whole situation is absurd.</P>

      <P>That was not repetition. We have established much this morning. For instance, we have established that the Minister is making it possible for a doctor to make contraceptives available to anyone who asks for them and that while there may be defence in law such defence would not be upheld in terms of the Constitution in the case of any doctor denying people, whether married or unmarried, the right to have as many or as few children as they wished.  The Minister attempted to establish that &ldquo;family&rdquo; meant marriage but later in his dealings with the medical association he said that the law relating to marriage is not clear and that, consequently, he did not wish to put medical people in the position of having to decipher the law in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a most useful morning.  We have established the very important principle that a couple need not be married in order to be able to avail of the means of planning a family. I have made the case before that arising out of at least one interesting survey carried out by Dr. Bowman of the Department of Psychology at TCD, just less than 50 per cent of those visiting family planning clinics are not married. We should have regard also to the ICTU recommendation that there should not be any restriction in this legislation in relation to marriage.  I cannot forsee any possibility of this section being upheld.</P>
      <P>We have dealt with the position of the doctor but the position of the chemist is particularly invidious because he is to be put in the position that if he gives advice or information to his customers as to the use of contraceptives, and it would be reasonable for a chemist to do that since he offers advice in respect of any drug or anything else he sells, he will be acting unlawfully as a family planning clinic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My main point is, then, that it is completely outrageous that we adults here should legislate for the establishment of the principle that one citizen has the right to enter the bedroom of another pair of citizens and make decisions for them regarding the size of their family.  In addition we know now that the phrase &ldquo;family planning&rdquo; is totally meaningless and cannot be established in the sense in which the Minister attempted first to establish it. We have established that family planning refers to people living together, that marriage does not enter into the question. Regardless of whether the Minister or any other Member of the House may like to hear this, the situation as a result of this Bill will be that anybody who wants contraceptives will be able to get them on the prescription of a doctor but at unnecessary expense.  In other words, the Bill is unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Boland intervenes, it might be useful for me to demonstrate the manner in which Deputy Browne is approaching this legislation.  He has just said that the position of a pharmacist is to be very difficult but the Deputy knows that amendment No. 13 which was passed by the House applies directly to the situation of the pharmacist and will result in his being exorerated specifically from the sort of difficulty to which the Deputy referred. If we are to continue to cover the same ground all Deputy Browne will succeed in doing will be to delay the Bill and, therefore, to delay the initiation of a family planning service.  There is one very brief point about the constitutional position.  It is my view, and I think constitutional lawyers would uphold this view, that the majority decision in the McGee case contained the following point but I might point out that it was the minority decision to which Deputy Browne referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority decision <Col N="184" /> is the one that matters and in that decision the point was made that a husband and wife have the correlative right to agree not to have children.  There is no argument about that.  Towards the end of that majority decision Mr. Justice Walsh said that he wished to emphasise that he had not given any consideration to the question of the constitutionality or otherwise of laws which would withhold or restrict the availability of contraceptives for use outside marriage and that nothing in the judgment was intended to offer any opinion on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that the majority decision was based on the Article in the Constitution relating to the family and that, therefore, any question of the availability of contraceptives to single people was not involved.  I am reasonably certain from my knowledge of these things that the Supreme Court did not and would not upset this Bill because it does not make artificial contraceptives available to single people as of right.  The Supreme Court have never said that there is any such constitutional right and I do not believe they ever would say that there is any such constitutional right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I said on Second Stage that I did not believe that the courts would look in a benign fashion on this Bill and that is why this Bill and this entire discussion have been a waste of time of the House and have been misleading the public.  In section 4 of this Bill the Minister now purports to join a <Col N="185" /> third party, the doctor, into that right which the majority decision that the Minister has read twice into the record of the House gave to the husband and wife.  The Minister is now removing from the husband and the wife that absolute right which the Supreme Court in the majority decision stated was theirs and he is giving instead that decision to a third person, a doctor.  He is giving it specifically in section 4, not on the basis of the doctor's medical knowledge, abaility or training.  In section 4 (2) he says:</P>
      <P>A registered medical practitioner may, ... give a prescription or authorisation for a contraceptive to a person if he is satisfied that the person is seeking the contraceptive, <i>bona fide</i>, for family planning or for adequate medical reasons....</P>
      <P>If the Minister had not chosen to put in the last phrase it might be argued that &ldquo;family planning purposes&rdquo; came within the ambit of the doctor's medical training. However, the Minister in his own legislation is at pains to make it clear that family planning purposes are not necessary medical reasons at all.  It appears clear that this Bill will end up in the courts on foot of this section and the joining of the doctor with the couple who had their right confirmed by the Supreme Court in the McGee case judgment to decide how to order their sexual affairs in private without interference from anybody else or without their interfering with anybody else.  That right appears to be eroded and attacked in section 4.  If the courts take the same line as they took previously they cannot accept sections 4 as being constitutional now because of the joining in of the doctor, and indeed in some degree of the chemist, into that decision-making approach. For that reason we are to a large extent wasting the time of the House unnecessarily on a Bill that will not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I warned the Minister that we were wasting the time of the House on a Bill that was unworkable he did not accept that.  That Bill, which was for the control of the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products, has never been implemented because the <Col N="186" /> Minister subsequently found that what I said was right.  That Bill has never come into effect and this Bill will not come into effect either.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Other parts of section 4 raise serious doubts.  Section 4 (1) (b) sets out the fact that a chemist, his servant or agent may supply contraceptives to a person on foot of a prescription or authorisation, but apparently the situation is now to be that the chemist may supply to the named person who has to go to the doctor to have a prescription made out to him in his name for contraceptives.  The spouse of the person to whom the prescription has been issued apparently would not be empowered to go to the chemist's shop with the prescription or authorisation.  Similarly the husband of a woman would not be allowed to go to the chemist's shop to have the prescription or authorisation dispensed.  Does that not seem a rather unfair, unnecessary restriction?  The Minister might <Col N="187" /> care to explain why he is insisting that only the person to whom the contraceptive prescription is issued must attend personally at the chemist's shop to have the prescription filled.  It does not seem reasonable.  There is the even more ridiculous position that the pharmacist apparently will find that while he is selling contraceptives to other people on foot of these scripts he will be obliged to obtain a script from a doctor in order to supply himself with contraceptives. Otherwise if a chemist were to sell contraceptives to himself he would be clearly in breach of the provisions of section 4.</P>
    <P>I referred last night at some length to the use of the phrase &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; and the difficulty it had created.  I asked the Minister to explain why he had used the phrase &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; in the legislation.  He suggested, perhaps a little facetiously, that it was because of his classical education.  My reason for inquiring is that in recent legislation on the Landlord and Tenant Amendment Bill, 1979, which was an amendment of the 1930 Act, the phrase &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; was dropped. When the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy D. Andrews, who handled that Bill in the Seanad, was questioned as to why &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; was no longer being used his explanation was that it is just a piece of superfluous jargon which lawyers are inclined to use.  I think he would agree that it is not necessary in the context and is purely a drafting matter.  The phrase &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; is a cliche.  Why use the words?  Why not use the words &ldquo;with the best of intentions&rdquo;?  The Minister of State went on to say that it was about time we started to use printable and understandable English.  When the matter was raised again in the Seanad on 2 May by way of amendment the Minister of State said, as reported in the Official Report of the Seanad, column 15, Volume 92:</P>
    <P>The language is there, but it is out-of-date language.  It has not been updated and consequently is meaningless to anybody who would wish to understand it, except lawyers....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> We have an obligation to make Acts meaningful not only to the people who practise the law but the people who actually use the law in defence of their interests.</P>
    <P>It is also a well-known matter of social justice that people in the capacity of private citizens are entitled to go to the courts without, dare I say it, the services of a solicitor or a barrister.</P>
    <P>Consequently, to ensure that fundamental concept of social justice we have an obligation to make Bills in this House, which eventually become Acts, as meaningful as possible.  I have no reason to change my views in relation to the use of the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister handling the Landlord and Tenant Bill, which is a very complicated piece of legislation, should speak as strongly as that against the use of the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; because it is not clearly understood by the general public, why has this Minister chosen to use the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; in a section where the unfortunate doctor and the person visiting him will both be obliged to interpret for themselves what &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; means?  If the Landlord and Tenant Act, which is normally interpreted by lawyers, has the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; excluded from it because the Minister believed it to be a cliché in lawyers' jargon, why are we including those words in a Bill which is to determine the decisions to be made by doctors for their patients?  I tried to raise that matter last night but I am afraid the Minister did not deal with it to my satisfaction.  The main objection to section 4 is that it places a very unfair obligation on the doctor to decide which people should or should not have contraceptives made available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being absolutely serious.  Apparently the association representing doctors did not see that it was appropriate that they should be asked to take on the business of being the moral arbiters or to take on a quasi-judicial role.  Subsection (2) states that once the doctor issues the script and states on it that it is for the purposes of this Act, it shall be conclusively presumed that the person sought the contraceptive for <i>bona fide</i> purposes. Not only has the doctor to take on a moral role as an arbiter but he has to take on a quasi-judicial role as well and yet he is being asked to interpret words like &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; which the Minister of State, Deputy David Andrews, a lawyer, felt should be excluded from other legislation because of the difficulty of interpretation.</P>
      <P>The doctor is also being asked to define &ldquo;family&rdquo;, a word which the House was not prepared to define.  I have the same reservations as Deputy Browne in relation to the Minister's definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  I would be satisfied with the definition given by the Minister on Wednesday, 9 May at column 282 of the Official Report except that earlier on the same day the Minister gave a completely different definition.  I invited the Minister on two occasions to state that his later statement was appropriate rather than the earlier statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about that.  The drafting of legislation is a skilled art.  Neither Ministers nor their civil servants are involved in it but a skilled body of men called parliamentary draftsmen whose specific skill is used to devise legislation for us to draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these the same draftsmen who drafted amendment No. 17 so badly that the Minister had to amend it before it went through the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In these matters parliamentarians are entirely in the hands of the draftsmen.  The phrase &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> family planning&rdquo; is the phrase adopted for the purposes of this legislation by the draftsmen.  I am quite satisfied that it achieves its purpose.  It <Col N="191" /> means genuine or valid and in neither legal terminology nor in common parlance is there a phrase which means more to the ordinary person than &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;.  I am not claiming any pride of authorship nor am I defending it except to say that it is the phrase which in the draftsman's skilled opinion he has deemed appropriate for this legislation.</P>
      <P>I read the report of the majority decision of the Supreme Court again and again and right through that decision the sentiment, the direction keeps reappearing that married couples&mdash;here I am using the word &ldquo;married&rdquo; because that is the phrase that the Supreme Court used&mdash;have the constitutional right to artificial contraceptives.  From that simple statement this legislation has evolved.  I am convinced that the trend of the majority decision of the Supreme Court is that the availability of artificial contraceptives be confined to a husband and wife relationship or to married couples. The Supreme Court went to the trouble of specifically stating that they were not extending this right of availability to single persons.  It is very significant that the Supreme Court did that.  If the Supreme Court were leaving the thing completely open and were only deciding the issue in so far as a family, married couples, or a husband and wife were concerned it would have stopped at that.  The Supreme Court did not stop at that.  In the majority decision they went on to specifically indicate that they were not prepared to extend this constitutional right of availability to single persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all fallible.  We can only do our best.  However, I am reasonably convinced and advised that what we are proposing in this Bill is not alone in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court but also in accordance with the spirit of the decision of the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court majority decision is based upon and evolves from the family Articles of the Constitution and therefore we, as parliamentarians, are obliged by the Supreme Court decision to make artificial contraceptives available to <Col N="192" /> families for family planning purposes.  I have sought in this legislation with all the advice and all the parliamentary drafting skill of the draftsmen to give effect to that and on that basis the Bill will stand up.  If it does not we will have to try to legislate again.  At least we have made a reasonable effort to legislate for what is a difficult complicated sensitive area.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I can add any more to this argument.  We have been over the ground again and again, we have taken every word and examined it minutely, we have discussed it and considered its implications.  I maintain that if we accept that there is a constitutional obligation on Parliament to make artificial contraceptives easily available, reasonably accessible&mdash;that is all that is involved&mdash;to married couples, then everything else in this Bill follows in logical sequence.  I do not have to say this to Deputy Boland but I have to say it to Deputy Browne.  If you accept, on the one hand, that you have a constitutional obligation to make them reasonably available to married couples for family planning purposes, husband and wife relationship, and at the same time you do not want to make them completely and limitlessly available to the general public, then some mechanism and some arrangements such as are outlined in this Bill are the only logical alternative.  I maintain that the arrangements I am outlining in this Bill to try to fit inside those two parameters are as good as you can devise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up the point the Minister made in his last few words, which is the kernel of the matter.  I know we have got to keep to section 4, but there are many points of view.  Yesterday, when I asked Deputy Boland a certain question it was not with the intention that he attributed to me, but to bring out the broad spectrum.  My view of the situation might not be very far away from Deputy Flanagan's in fundamentals but we have to follow the line of the Minister for two very coercive reasons, which apply particularly to section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> We have, as the Minister said, a choice of a free for all.  The McGee case has resulted in the administrative necessity of bringing in control.  The alternative is commercial exploitation, serious problems of public health and morality and the protection of young people.  These are the consequences resulting from the administrative impact of the McGee case, which left everything wide open.  It is on that fact that I believe Deputy Flanagan and I take different views in relation to this section.  I take the Minister's view very strongly because I believe that this control must be brought in urgently before the situation deteriorates completely.</P>
    <P>The second fact was discussed on Second Stage.  It may arise on Fifth Stage but it would not be proper to discuss it now.  I must mention it as a background. Section 3 is a necessary ingredient in this Bill because the McGee judgment was given.  The absence of section 3 would substantiate Deputy Boland's argument about constitutionality.  I do not believe that the Deputy would ask me to go into the constitutional argument with him. The Minister has answered it and there is no need for me to answer it again. With regard to constitutionality the Bill would not stand up without section 3.  I am no more enamoured with some of the implications of the situation than Deputy Flanagan is but the choice is: &ldquo;Will you sit back and do nothing and let the flood gates widen and have all the consequences?&rdquo;.  It would be out of order to go into those details now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is getting back to a Second Stage debate and we cannot have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief on this.  In all the arguments, constitutional and others, there has been little advertence to what I regard as the fundamental reasons why the doctor is the appropriate agent.  I have already given them in detail.  Whether contraceptive methods are drugs, intrauterine devices, surgery or even diaphragm, these are all matters for close medical supervision.  It would be very difficult under any of those headings to supply any other answer than the one in section <Col N="194" /> 4.  They all have serious implications within the doctors' ambit.  I believe, in tying it to the medical profession and the pharmaceutical profession, that the arguments I made on an earlier Stage in regard to that still hold and this is the basic reason why it is logical to adopt the mechanism the Minister is using.</P>
      <P>The last point is one that has been insinuated into the argument on this section, that is, putting the onus on the doctor. Is it not just relying on the doctor as a responsible member of the community to use his judgment since it is so closely associated with his skill and with his profession?  Where else can one go? There is an implication in the criticisms that have been made of referring this matter to the medical profession that the medical profession are not a group of responsible people who will particularly look to the human factors.  I would like to make this point to Deputy Browne, who is a doctor.  Are not the doctors the most likely people to be humanly and understandably sympathetic to their patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been sufficient time given to debate on this section without going into further detail.  I wanted to say something, particularly to a Deputy like Deputy O.J. Flanagan, whose fundamental views and attitudes I would share more nearly than perhaps I do a lot of other views expressed in this House.  Furthermore&mdash;and this relates somewhat to what happened here yesterday&mdash;there are many arguable and divergent views held and there are very substantial groups holding very different views in this community.  We must take that as a fact also.  My personal view is that we have got to do something; we cannot sit back negligently and let everything go by default.  In all the circumstances the Minister's Bill, as he has justly claimed himself in his last remarks, is about the best solution to this very difficult problem facing our community with its diverse thinking and this House representing it.  In all these circumstances, then, I urge that we take a reasonable view of the realities following the McGee case.  Endeavouring to take that view I personally, as well as being a member of the party supporting the <Col N="195" /> Minister, I feel that his solution is the best and that we should pass section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne.  Unless there are some new points to be raised at this stage the Chair must put the section.  We cannot go on hour after hour repeating the arguments made and making Second Stage speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal only with the points referred to by the Minister in relation to the Constitution, but I think he gave the impression in some way that I was misleading the House in my references to the Constitution, the majority decision, and particularly Mr. Justice Walshe's magnificent and very moving defence of citizens' rights in our society.  This is what genuinely amazes me about this provision for the introduction of the doctor in the decision-making process between married people for married people&mdash;of course, that is what is intended here&mdash;but even between any two mature people, any mature couple taking a decision about having children, whether they should have contraceptives or plan their family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general point made by the Minister is correct, of course, but he did not deal with it, I felt, completely frankly. Mr. Justice Walshe was dealing with the case put to him, that is the McGee case.  That was a married lady looking for the right to use contraceptives.  He came down categorically on her right as a married person.  He did not deal with the rights of an individual, of a person as a citizen, because that is a separate question arising out of the rights of the individual under our Constitution.  While it is true to say that Mr. Fitzgerald dissented in his judgment from the majority decision, in the course of his dissent, he made the statement to which I have referred already and which I have read into the record of the House.  It is well to realise that the plantiff's claim here is as a citizen and that if any portion of section 17 of the 1935 Act is declared unconstitutional the benefits to be derived from such a decision are equally to be enjoyed by every other citizen be they <Col N="196" /> married or not.  That statement was not concerned with the McGee decision.  It was the interpretation of the right of an individual under the Constitution.  That is quite unequivocal and, it seems to me, unanswerable.  It establishes beyond doubt that this section cannot be applied.</P>
    <P>What is surprising&mdash;if the Minister has gone to the trouble of reading Mr. Justice Walshe's decision&mdash;is how on earth he could bring in a Bill of this kind in which he is insisting that an individual shall intervene in the decision-making when eloquent paragraph after eloquent paragraph makes the position quite clear, according to Mr. Justice Walshe. Incidentally he dealt also&mdash;something which might interest the other Deputies here who are insisting on the implementation of Catholic social teaching on the question of natural family planning methods&mdash;with the question of the pluralist nature of our society.</P>

If there are no new points to be made on it, I must put the section.  That is the duty of the Chair.  I cannot allow the debate to continue this way much longer.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make just two very brief references that I think will establish my point: the question of the outrageous nature of this proposal to introduce the doctor as the arbiter in family planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Now I shall explain that the Supreme Court is on my side and I cannot see how the Minister could come in here and say that he has the backing of the Supreme Court or majority decision, which he said a few minutes ago, in defence of this.  I am reading now from Mr. Justice Walshe's ruling:</P>
      <P>It follows that the use of contraceptives by them within that marital privacy is equally guaranteed against such invasion and as such assumes the status of a right so guaranteed by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Walshe continues:</P>
      <P>The sexual life of a husband and wife is of necessity and by its nature an area of particular privacy.  If the husband and wife decide to limit their family or to avoid having children by use of contraceptives it is a matter peculiarly within the joint decision of the husband and wife and one into which the State cannot intrude unless its intrusion can be justified by the exigencies of the common good.</P>
      <P>And there is no such suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one aspect which is very important from the point of view of Deputy de Valera's and Deputy Flanagan's point of view is that we live in a pluralist society from a religious point of view.  Therefore Mr. Justice Walshe went on to point out that we have guarantees of religious freedom, freedom of conscience which are not confined to the different denominations of Christian religions but extend to other religious denominations <Col N="198" /> and so on.  There is another point which is important in relation to the importance given to natural law.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that among those persons who are subject to a particular moral code no one has a right to be in breach of that moral code.  But when this is a code governing private morality and where the breach of it is not one which injures the common good then it is not the State's business to intervene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must again point out that all this was debated on Second Stage.  It is not relevant to the section before the House. The Chair has to put the section at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the final paragraph:</P>
      <P>There is no law in force in the State which prohibits use of contraceptives either in or outside of marriage or the manufacture or distribution of contraceptives within the State.</P>
      <P>I accept that the majority decision of the Supreme Court referred to marriage strictly because that was the case put to them.  The dissenting decision had nothing to do with the fact, Mr. Fitzgerald went on to say, that if the majority decision was a valid decision&mdash;and obviously it is&mdash;then it refers to everybody in this State.</P>

      <P>I will take this opportunity to refer briefly to what has been said by other Deputies.  This is the <Col N="199" /> first time I made a contribution on section 4 and it is not my intention to delay the House.  The Minister must be extremely anxious to put this Bill through the House and I realise the Chair is anxious that this section be dealt with quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the job of the Chair.  If the debate on this section went on for a year the Chair would not have the power to do anything about it.  The Chair must ensure that there is no repetition, or that a section is not being deliberately held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to repeat anything that has been said already.  This section gives a person the right to obtain contraceptives.  It says that:</P>
      <P>(1)  A person shall not sell contraceptives unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the sale is in accordance with regulations for the purposes of this subsection relating to the sale of contraceptives,</P>
      <P>And the prescription must be given solely for the purpose of family planning.  A person who acts contrary to the regulation which is likely to be made under this section shall be guilty of an offence.  I would not like to rush this section through without hearing what every Member has to say about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy V. de Valera and the Minister referred to the Supreme Court decision on the McGee case which brought about this legislation and particularly this section, which is the principal section of the Bill.  If the Supreme Court rule in a special case that a certain husband and wife have, or a wife has a legal right to obtain contraceptives, we are now told that we must change the law because of that decision.  If a citizen feels she has a legal right to abortion, as Mrs. McGee felt she had a right to contraceptives, and as a result of the Supreme Court decision in her case we are now changing the law for everybody, we must bear in mind&mdash;and this is accepted by Catholics and Protestants&mdash;that contraception is morally wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="200" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true about Protestants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are Protestants, particularly in Northern Ireland, who express indignation when we say that in order to bring about national unity we must change our laws in relation to contraception.  A large proportion of Catholics and Protestants object to the provisions which this section will place on our Statute Book.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, and Deputy de Valera agreed with him, that this Bill was introduced as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  Does this mean that every time the Supreme Court give a decision on any matter pertaining to the family or the individual, irrespective. of the special or unusual circumstances of the case, legislation will be passed to give everyone the same legal rights as those given in the special case which was brought before the Supreme Court?</P>
      <P>When this section is passed the groups which pressured the Minister into bringing in this section will say, &ldquo;We have won the first part of the race and we will now proceed to pressure for the further opening of the floodgates to make contraceptives available&rdquo;.  This Bill was introduced as a result of a Supreme Court decision.  In the event of somebody claiming a legal right to abortion in special circumstances and the Supreme Court deciding in her favour, will we reach the stage when we will legalise abortion to meet the decision of the majority of the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House has the right to legislate independently of any outside views, and this is where section 4 comes in.  If the Supreme Court or any other court has laid it down that the purchase, sale and making available of contraceptives is a legal right, have we not the right to legislate for the good of the majority? Must we put in section 4 of this Bill to please a small pressure group in a complete minority?  Must we leave dangers for the majority in order to please the pressure group minority?  That is the danger I see in section 4 of this Bill.  This is a section giving teeth to the Bill.  The valuable time of the House and the Minister is taken up with this section, <Col N="201" /> simply because a small pressure group in a complete minority wishes to have legislation enacted in order to meet its point of view, to the detriment of the majority. I cannot contribute, by any means, to this section, bearing in mind that the whole question of the prescription, purchase, sale and the making available of contraceptives are morally wrong.  This is the section which gives the right to do that and I strongly oppose it by every means in my power.  No matter how we legislate, we cannot make right what is morally wrong and make available to any section of the public facilities which are morally wrong.  No Act of Parliament passed by this House can do that.</P>

How can that be reconciled with the majority ruling in the McGee case?  I accept the point made in relation to the importance of section 3 being in compliance with the McGee ruling.  How can this section, joining the doctor with a married couple in the decision as to whether or not the married couple should have availability of contraceptives or not, be reconciled with the majority ruling of the McGee case?  This is one question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister what was in his mind on this section and I do not think we can accept that the parliamentary draftsman is entirely responsible in this case. Section 5 (1) (a) provides that a person shall not import contraceptives into the State unless they are part of his personal luggage accompanying him when he is entering the State and their quantity is not such as to indicate that they are not solely for his own use.  Possibly the draftsman may be responsible for some of the tortuous language employed in the paragraph but the Minister must have indicated what his requirement was in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How on earth is the unfortunate customs officer to interpret what is a quantity of contraceptives which would indicate that they are not solely for the traveller's own use?  Is the customs officer supposed to determine for himself on the basis of his own knowledge or experience what is an acceptable quantity for a person's own personal use?  Does <Col N="211" /> the Minister intend to issue regulations or guidelines giving some indication to the customs officials that quantity X would be deemed to be appropriate for a person's own personal use but quantity Y might not?  Would the length of stay of the traveller in the country be taken into account <i>vis-á-vis</i> the amount of contraceptives he may or may not have in his personal luggage?  Will the whole thing not be as farcical as the wording of paragraph (a)?  Surely the Minister could have found something better, or nothing at all, rather than inserting that paragraph in that form at this time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent survey indicted us as being the most hypocritical nation in Europe.  They will be able to introduce a new category now of our being the most absurd and ridiculous nation in Europe when it becomes common knowledge amongst visitors to this country the kind of questions they will be asked about their very intimate and private and personal lives.  A Frenchman, or a German, or a Dane, or an Englishman, or an American, coming into the country will have to suffer an inquisition by an unfortunate customs man about details of his private and marital relationship arising out of an investigation into the contraceptives he is attempting to bring into the State.</P>
      <P>To me a contraceptive is simply an industrial product.  A non-medical contraceptive is an industrial product and it is a matter for the IDA, if they so wish, to set up a factory to produce and sell them.  Nothing more than that is involved. The Minister has not referred to the question of standards.  Contraceptives coming into the State should be dealt with as ordinary industrial products.  Tourists, visitors and businessmen coming into the State, and our fellow countrymen coming down from the North of Ireland, will find that this society&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the problem of the customs man at the point of entry to the State faced with implementing the provisions of section 5 in respect of visitors.  It is well to remember that there are a number of different kinds of contraceptives starting with the pill of varying strengths, and then the IUD, the cap, the condom and the spermacides. Imagine the position of a customs officer faced with one or other or all of the different forms of contraceptives in a visitor's luggage.  He has to decide whether the person is bound by this <i>bona fide</i> intention of family planning. He has to decide whether a traveller may bring them in and not use them <i>bona fide</i> and whether he is subject to our law.  He has to ask whether he will use those contraceptives for the purposes of family planning.  That is one question which obviously arises and which a stranger or a non-Irish person coming here will be asked.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there is the Irish man or woman coming in here with one or more of these different devices who presumably as a national is subject to our law.  What is the position of the customs officer faced with a multiplicity of these various devices in the bottom of the person's luggage?  The customs officer is faced with a citizen and he has to decide what he will do.  Does he ask the Irish national for his prescription authorising him to import them and in what amount, or to reimport them if he had them when he was going out and in what amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Boland asked, how is the customs officer to decide?  Taking the simplest device, the condom, what is a reasonable amount for a week's stay, a month's stay, six months' stay, a year's stay or an overnight stay?  What is he to tell the foreign visitor who brings in a <Col N="214" /> week's supply and may or may not stay for a fortnight?  Must he tell the visitor: &ldquo;Once you are in here you are subject to Irish law and you will have to go to a doctor for further prescriptions if you require them for contraceptives.&rdquo;?  If a woman mislays her contraceptives will she have to accept the strictures of Irish law and go to a medical practitioner in order to be fitted with a new device rather than simply going and saying: &ldquo;I want No. 5 or No. 6&rdquo; or whatever it may be, or will she be treated as a foreign visitor and so allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a total negation of the pluralist idea of true republicanism. We are talking of a couple from the Continent who during their stay here find it necessary to renew their supplies of contraceptives but neither he nor she can obtain supplies without going to a chemist and producing a prescription.  Is the customs officer to tell him or her that this is the situation here?  I am emphasising both him and her since both are involved. Are they to be told on arriving here that in order to obtain contraceptives they must go to a doctor for a prescription for which they must pay and then go to a chemist where they must <Col N="215" /> also pay a fee in order to allow them to carry out this perfectly reasonable practice of indulging in effective family planning as they know it on the Continent?</P>
      <P>In subsection (a) there is reference to the situation of contraceptives being part of a visitor's personal luggage but the reference is to &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  What is the position about a woman?  Do we recognise that women come into this State from other places and that they may bring contraceptives with them?  Are they to be permitted to bring in condoms or other contraceptives or do women exist at all in our male chauvinist muslim-type society?  They do not appear to have any rights so far as this section is concerned.</P>

      <P>So far as I can see customs officers are to be faced with the problem of attempting to decide whether the contraceptives in an individual's luggage are for the person's own use and whether the amount involved is reasonable.  This will put customs officers in a dilemma comparable to the dilemma facing a doctor in terms of section 4 except infinitely more advanced.  It is particularly absurd for us to treat contraceptives as if they were some kind of dangerous drug like cocaine, opium, pot or one of these which are alleged to be serious drugs.  To treat contraceptives in the same way in regard to the supervision of their importation into the State is absurd.  They are completely harmless. They are medicinal, as the Minister has made it clear on a number of occasions. They are most valuable to every society. They are accepted by the World Health Organisation and by EEC bodies involved in the question of family planning. It is obvious that if we leave section 5 in the Bill we are going to create an absurd dilemma which will bring about a laughable situation where Irish people are concerned in Europe.  They are going to be subjected to this inquisition by these unhappy young customs officials who will not for the life of them be able to say whether the person they are talking to can say reasonably and truthfully <Col N="216" /> that the number of contraceptives that he has in his baggage is the amount to which he has a right.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy follows Deputy Boland and Deputy Browne in making a cod of himself, I tell the House that the position now is that the law at the moment is that anybody may import artificial contraceptives for his or her own use.  Persons may not import them for sale, so this legislation does not change the situation that Deputies opposite seem so terribly worried and excited about.  If the present situation upsets them, then they are objecting to legislating at all in this area. Apparently Deputy Browne is content to let the present situation continue, but the present situation is exactly as it is in this legislation.</P>

      <P>At present as a result of the Supreme Court decision anybody coming into this country is entitled to import artificial contraceptives for his own personal use.  He is not entitled to bring them in for sale.  Therefore, this provision in section 5 does not change the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> It is quite simple to use that <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> argument to put forward a hypothetical proposition in regard to any legislation.  Any legislation must be looked at reasonably and sensibly.  This is a reasonable proposition.  I can visualise clearly the ranting and raving by Deputy Browne and others if there was no provision in this legislation for a traveller coming into this country to bring in artificial contraceptives for his own use.  Could you imagine the song and dance we would have about that? Just because I put in a simple, practical provision, Deputy Browne wastes the time of this House endeavouring to use <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> tactics to make it appear ridiculous.  Customs officers are trained officials used to dealing with this sort of situation every day of their lives. They will have no difficulty whatever in administering this provision and they will administer it in a reasonable, sensible and mature fashion.  It is a sensible, practical proposition.  Apart from anything else, this is the situation that has prevailed for the past ten years since the Supreme Court judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Minister says that this has prevailed for the past ten years, but the contraceptives must be in the luggage accompanying the person. This is not the law as it stands, Secondly, this brings us into disrepute and holds us up to world ridicule in that we may now have to have notices displayed prominently at foreign ports to say that tourists coming into Ireland may not bring more into this country than a quantity sufficient for their own personal requirements.  Who is to determine their personal requirements?  Shall we now measure the sexual prowess of an individual?  Shall we measure his virility?  Shall we have blood tests of his serum and antigens?  Shall the person have in attendance there a doctor or medical consultant to advise him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When we come in with this luggage must they be declared?  Must we go with them into the green or the red zone?  These questions must be faced by everyone who may bring them into the country.  I am not trying to take this jokingly.  I am talking seriously about a problem that may confront a customs officer.</P>

      <P>The official functions of the Garda Siochána are related to the prevention and detection of crime and accordingly they have no responsibility for the finding or recovery of bodies from rivers or the sea except in cases where foul play may be suspected.  In practice, however, on humanitarian grounds, members of the Garda Siochána, and in particular members of the sub-aqua unit, engage in work of this kind outside the demands of duty, but of course the extent to which this can be done is governed by the resources available and by the facts of each case, <Col N="221" /> including the prospects of a search being successful.</P>
      <P>The Garda Sub-Aqua Unit are a part-time unit attached to Garda Headquarters and the Garda authorities do not consider that the establishment of a full-time unit would be justified having regard to the number of underwater searches that arise.

I would be prepared to discuss with other Government colleagues who have certain responsibilities in this area the need for the establishment of a full-time unit but not necessarily a full-time unit within the Garda Siochána.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's legal position but I failed to find any authority, local or otherwise, who would accept responsibility for the recovery of bodies.  That is most unfortunate, especially when people encounter such a tragedy.  Would the Minister consider in his negotiations with his colleagues trying to come to a conclusion that will allow for the establishment of a proper full-time unit charged with responsibility for recovering bodies?</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities <Col N="222" /> do not believe that there is a need for the establishment of a full-time unit at present having regard to the number of searches that have been carried out.  I should like to tell the Deputy that 28 searches were carried out last year, 28 the previous year and 25 in 1976.  The Garda Sub-Aqua Unit at full strength consists of one sergeant and 12 men. The Deputy can see, because of the small number of searches, why the authorities believe that there is not a need for a full-time unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The present rate of interest on a judgment debt of the <Col N="224" /> Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court is 4 per cent; interest is not allowed on District Court decrees.  The interest dates only from the date of the judgment's pronouncement.</P>
      <P>As a matter of principle, I would regard it as inappropriate for me, in the context of a reply to a parliamentary question, to undertake to supply information about the law in operation in any other country, as I have no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

Is the Minister aware that the fact that such a low rate of interest is available here is a discouragement to foreign people to trade with people here because in the event of a debt not being paid and enforcement proceedings having to be taken a low rate of interest is available?

      <P>I am generally aware of the hardship that the closure of cross-Border roads can cause to the public and I have stated previously that I would be anxious that these roads should be reopened as soon as security and other considerations allow.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the road closures in the Kiltyclogher area on the Leitrim-Fermanagh border has been the subject of representations by me to the British authorities on a number of occasions. The British authorities have told me that they have re-examined the question of the continued closure of cross-Border roads in this area but that they are of the opinion that, on security grounds, the roads should remain closed. I have not received representations about any other cross-Border roads between County Leitrim and County Fermanagh but I would be happy to have investigated any other case which is drawn to my attention.</P>
      <P>These roads have, of course, been closed on the Northern Ireland side of the Border and the decision when the crossings might be reopened is therefore a matter for the British authorities.</P>

      <P>The Government do not believe that the elections which were held in Rhodesia during April under constitutional arrangements introduced by the Smith régime can form a satisfactory basis for the resolution of the conflict and the accession of Zimbabwe to independence based on genuine majority rule.  This objective can in my view only be achieved in a process which involves the parties concerned, including the Patriotic Front, and which permits all the people of Zimbabwe to decide their own future, freely and fairly under international supervision.</P>

    <P>In this context, I should recall that the United Nation's Security Council, in its Resolution 448 of 30 April, declared the <Col N="232" /> election and its results null and void and called on all States not to accord recognition to any representative of, or organ established by, that process and to observe strictly the mandatory sanctions against Southern Rhodesia.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper report (details supplied) that the laws relating to fire hazards are seriously antiquated and that the danger of a disaster similar to Woolworth's in Manchester, England exists here; the proposals, if any, to up-date the legislation and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to.  Firstly, I must point out that the statement in the report, attributed to the Chief Fire Officer concerned, that there is no legislation whatsoever covering fire safety in shops and stores is not correct.  In fact, the provisions of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, enable local authorities to require fire safety precautions to be taken in such premises.  While these and other existing enactments contain considerable powers which can be used to promote fire safety measures in buildings, I have already indicated my intention to up-date and strengthen the law as necessary and proposals for amending legislation are at present being prepared in my Department.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that experience has shown that legislative controls of themselves provide no guarantee of immunity against fire hazard.  There is a need to promote a greater awareness amongst management, workers and the general public of fire hazard and to encourage advancement of education in all aspects of fire prevention.  It was for this reason that, in conjunction with fire insurance interests, I recently established the Fire Prevention Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this report it was incorrectly reported in the press.  The press report quotes the speaker as saying that there is no legislation whatsoever covering shops and stores.  This was referred back to the person concerned, the chief fire officer. It transpired that the press report omitted the word &ldquo;specific&rdquo;.  But in the existing law, the 1940 Act, there is provision for this with regard to stores, shops and so on.  As I said in reply to the Deputy's question, at the moment we have the 1940 Act under active review in the Department and we intend to bring in the necessary amendments or legislation to strengthen the existing laws. There is also provision made under the Planning Acts for the insistence of the proper precautions.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister now accept that the £1,000 grant scheme as outlined in the manifesto is a most unfair method of grant-aiding the building of houses?  For example, the children of rich families who never owned a house before will qualify for the £1,000 grant whereas a young man who owns a poor house, no matter what condition it is in, will not qualify if he wants to improve his housing circumstances.  This militates against the lower income group of the community.  Would the Minister, after his two years' experience in office, not abolish this system and introduce one in keeping with the cost of living and in keeping with the need of families who are building houses?</P>

It is time the Minister considered the lack of consideration for this in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the 1977 election which was sold to the people as being a £1,000 grant for all who bought sites, not to build houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the policy of some local authorities whereby the sale of local authority houses to <Col N="241" /> prospective tenant purchasers is being delayed for up to two years after receipt of applications; if he will explain the delays and if he will take the necessary steps to ensure that these delays will cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of their tenant purchase schemes is a matter primarily for the local authorities concerned and I am not aware that it is the policy of any authority to delay the finalisation of sales to tenants.  In general, applications to purchase are dealt with by local authorities as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will appreciate that, as local authorities are now required to sell their houses in fee simple under the terms of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, it is inevitable that delays will occur in cases where the local authority itself has to acquire the fee simple in property before the houses can be sold to tenants.</P>
      <P>In addition, local authorities must ensure that houses sold to tenants are in good structural condition, in accordance with the provisions of section 106 of the Housing Act, 1966.  In certain circumstances, due to the large number of houses being sold under the tenant purchase schemes, delays will occur in carrying out necessary pre-sale structural repairs to such houses.  In order to obviate delay in finalising sales in these cases, I have included a provision in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, recently introduced in the Dáil, to provide for an agreement between the prospective tenant purchaser and the local authority whereby the tenant purchaser may undertake to carry out certain agreed repairs after sale and, on their satisfactory completion, have the cost refunded to him by the local authority.  This procedure should appreciably expedite the sale of these houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I also mentioned the fact that the fee simple has to be acquired as another reason as well as the structural repairs.  In an effort to overcome any delay caused because of structural repairs I have included a provision in the Housing Bill to allow the tenant purchaser to do it and have it refunded after the sale.  This should hasten the completion of sales held up for that reason.</P>

Alternative premises have been acquired for the exchange and it is the intention to move to these other premises as soon as possible. In the meantime I understand that a scheme of improvements which has been agreed with the staff is in hand and will be started in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The leaflets on careers published by my Department include seven leaflets on agriculture, two on horticulture and two leaflets on forestry.  The following are the titles of these leaflets: Farm Manager, Instructor in Agriculture, Creamery Manager, Instructor in Farm Home Management, Buttermaker and Cheesemaker, Agricultural Officer, Assistant Agricultural Inspector, Instructor in Horticulture and Beekeeping, Horticulturist, Forester, Forestry Graduate.</P>
      <P>The total number of career leaflets currently available from my Department is 253.</P>

      <P>Is it not extraordinary that agriculture, which is our major industry, is represented by only seven career leaflets out of over 250?  Does the Minister really think this is satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are others which are allied and related to agriculture as the Deputy will appreciate, for example, veterinary surgeon, zoological assistant, seed analyst, and careers in food science and technology.  We constantly update these leaflets.  In the case of the creamery managers, the leaflet is being updated at the moment.  The title is being changed to &ldquo;Careers in the Dairy Industry&rdquo; because of the changing structure of the creameries as such.  We are constantly working on new careers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in many areas of the country the shortage of skilled agricultural labour is very severe and that the wages being paid for that labour are fairly high?  In the light of that situation perhaps he would undertake to have a look at the situation in order to determine whether further leaflets should be added to the series for the benefit of children, especially in rural areas.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to keep the situation under review.  The <Col N="249" /> Deputy's suggestion will be borne in mind as will any other suggestion that may be put forward in respect of careers.  It is our practice to make these leaflets available to schools.  They are made available through the NMS offices and are updated every two years.  They are publicly available for anyone who wishes to peruse them.</P>

    <Title>Health (Family Planning) Bill, 1978: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been absent for the earlier part of the discussion on this section and, consequently, I am not aware whether the Minister has replied yet to one criticism that may be levelled against the section, that is, that the effect of section 5 is to prohibit the importation of contraceptives by post.  If I read the situation correctly, if this section is passed in the form in which it appears now or in any form that is likely to be acceptable to the Minister, it will be illegal for anybody to import contraceptive materials by post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the original court case, which provoked not only this legislation but the legislation proposed by the Coalition, was a court case on foot of which a married woman challenged the validity of the existing legislation because it prevented her from importing by post contraceptive materials for her personal use.  The Supreme Court held that the effect of this was to deprive her of reasonable access to the means of family planning.  We now have a Bill which, subject to very severe penalties, effectively outlaws any exercise of the same option by an individual  <Col N="255" /> citizen, regardless of whether he or she is married.</P>
    <P>No doubt it would be argued from the ministerial side that the Bill meets the desire of the Supreme Court that any married person who wishes to have access to the means of family planning will have those needs met but it is at least arguable&mdash;and this may be challenged in the Supreme Court if the Bill is passed&mdash;that it is open to any married person, and we will take the case of the married person for the purpose of the argument, to say that the provisions of this Bill are not reasonable because at the very least they involve a visit to a medical practitioner and also the payment of a prescription fee to a pharmacist. Therefore it could be argued that to that person's way of thinking reasonable access might mean access by post from a supplier either in Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The question of access by post from a supplier in Ireland has been dealt with presumably in the previous section, but we are talking now about a married person who wishes to import contraceptive materials for his or her own use but who may not do so legally despite the fact that that person might consider this means of obtaining contraceptives to be more reasonable because it would be substantially less expensive than the procedure envisaged by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question that must be asked is whether this section in its present form flouts the manifest intention of the Supreme Court in relation to reasonable access to methods of family planning. The Minister may say that it is for private individuals to take a case to the Supreme Court and that naturally the State as a whole and the administrators of the family planning services would be bound by any decision that might be taken by the Supreme Court in this area but I have come to the conclusion that, while this section is based on an expressed desire to change the legislation in order to bring it into line with the Supreme Court decision, it goes against the whole spirit of that decision.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this interpretation of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As was the case in respect of most of the sections we have dealt with so far, the Minister's approach to this section has been lighthearted despite the many apparent pitfalls, weaknesses, contradictions, inconsistencies and uncertainties that have been pointed out to him during the course of the debate.  To coin a phrase, the general attitude he seems to adopt is that &ldquo;it will be all right on the night.&rdquo; This approach applies to this section in relation to the unfortunate customs official having to ask people coming into the country to declare whatever contraceptives they may have.  To clarify a question raised by Deputy O'Connell, can the Minister tell us whether men coming into the country must declare whether they have condoms and whether women must declare whether they have caps, spermicides or IUD's or the pill? If this is to be the case will it be a matter then for the customs official to decide whether it is permissible for someone to bring in an IUD, a cap or spermicides. Is Deputy Dr. O'Connell correct in presuming that at the various inlets to the State there are to be notices explaining what is permissible in respect of the different kinds of contraceptives and how many are permissible?  Are we to have a situation in this respect similar to that which applies to the number of bottles of whisky or the number of cigarettes one is allowed bring in?  Are various types of contraceptives to be added to the list of prohibited articles so far as foreign visitors are concerned?</P>
      <P>I am shocked to think that a customs official, a civil servant, should have to ask these appallingly impertinent questions when confronted with a visitor to our country.  The possibilities arising from an official having to ask a man how many contraceptives he intends to use or to ask a woman whether any contraceptive she may have is for her own use are unlimited in terms of satirical reviews throughout Europe at our expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the quantity, which will be limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am unable to cope with such an outrageous proposal.  The <Col N="257" /> Minister is faced with this dilemma arising out of section 4 and the limits imposed in that section on our citizens.  In relation to our citizens I would like the position clarified.  On 15 May 1979 the Minister is reported in the Official Report, column 630, Volume 314, as saying:</P>
      <P>I want to be clear.  There must be prescriptions for all forms of artificial contraception.  Agree or disagree with the Bill, that is what is in it.</P>
      <P>Is that to be so?  How is this to be enforced? An Irish citizen could be in two positions, (1) he has bought contraceptives under prescription here in accordance with section 4, (2) he leaves the country and comes back again with some of these contraceptives still in his possession.  What is the situation then? Is the customs officer to ask the lady or the man, &ldquo;Did you come by these things legitimately?&rdquo;  There are, as Deputy Horgan said, frightfully heavy penalties &mdash;crazy penalties really considering the microscopic nature of the offences&mdash;for breaking the law.  If somebody goes out of the country and, having a number of condoms left over after being abroad for a week or so, comes back in again, how does he explain his bona fides to the customs officer?  Does he have to show the customs official his prescription from his doctor legitimising his possession of these articles because that establishes that he bought them in Ireland&mdash;in the Republic?  I have to discriminate there between the Republic and the Six Counties because, quite obviously, this is very much a two-nation State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, if the person goes abroad and while abroad in the US, France, Germany, anywhere, he purchases some condoms, or she purchases an IUD, caps, spermicides or pills, what is the position about the Irish citizen coming back by Aer Lingus through Collinstown or through the boat entry points? What does he or she have to say to the customs official?  Can he simply come in again with the contraceptives?  Must he declare that he has these contraceptives? It is an offence to have them because, as the Minister says, there must be prescriptions for all forms of artificial contraceptives.  If this man comes in <Col N="258" /> through a customs post and has a number of artificial contraceptives and he has no prescription, what happens then?</P>

      <P>The level of hysteria running through the whole of this Bill is outrageous. Freud says that we never joke, all our jokes are made seriously. Presumably we have had a little of the unconscious or subconscious thinking of the Minister when he gave vent to that particularly vicious comment.  However, &ldquo;Taken out and shot&rdquo; is one proposal for the Minister for Health simply because a person attempts to come into the country with a condom and without a prescription for a condom.  I must be careful and that is presumably an exaggeration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is not included in the Bill I must assume simply that a customs official has to warn the person coming in that he is subject to the draconian fines of the later sections of the Bill if he has not a prescription and is in possession of these dangerous substances.  It is the Minister who is creating the ridiculous situation by making these into such frightening substances.  Look at the measures he is taking to prevent people being in possession of them without the permission of a doctor.  There is provision for six months imprisonment, £500 fine and so on.  Is the hysteria not there in these extraordinary penalties to be imposed on responsible citizens who decide that they will space their families by using artificial contraceptives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position for an Irish citizen when he has these contraceptives which he has bought in the US, Britain, France or somewhere like that?  At the <Col N="259" /> point of entry must he request an appointment with a doctor and must he consult with the doctor and say that he is in this difficult position where he has these things without a prescription and the Minister for Health has said in the Dáil that there must be prescriptions for all forms of artificial contraceptives? What does he do then?  Are we going to lay on a medical presence at all the ports of entry so that our incoming citizens can legitimise any contraceptives that they may have in their possession when coming into the country?  On the other hand, it is possible that they may not have to do this, in which case they are in possession of contraceptives without prescription and therefore, it would seem, in breach of the law.</P>
    <P>At what stage can one say, &ldquo;I brought them in last week&rdquo;?  If a garda approaches you and says that he is going to charge you with unlawful possession of contraceptives&mdash;a man with a condom or a lady with an IUD or a cap&mdash;will the defence be, &ldquo;You need not worry about it, I got it when I was abroad last week.  Therefore, this provision of necessity for prescription in respect of all contraceptives does not apply to me&rdquo;?  This is the decision which the Minister is going to leave to the customs official, unless it is his intention to ensure that the customs official will take on the role of the medical doctor.  If that official can satisfy himself that the person has these contraceptives for <i>bona fide</i> family planning reasons as laid down in section 4 can he then wave him on and say, &ldquo;You are acceptable&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>When you come into the Republic you are, in quotes, a black Protestant coming down from the North, and you are faced with the dilemma of declaring your contraceptives.  A lady has to declare her contraceptives.  That is bad enough if it only emphasises the profound, fundamental unbridgeable gap between the two nations, but what happens to such people if during their stay they run out of contraceptives?  Must they go through the section 5 procedure, go to a doctor and not only say: &ldquo;I want to limit my family, I live in Belfast, I want contraceptives&mdash;please give me some&rdquo;, but also listen to a lecture on the <Col N="260" /> whole question of what Deputy Flanagan calls the natural family planning system of contraception?</P>
    <P>If the Minister tells us that an Irish citizen can come in and with contraceptives he has bought abroad, surely we are discriminating between two kinds of citizens, the one who can afford to go out and the one who cannot.  Article 40 of the Constitution lays down the inalienable rights of the citizens, of citizens being treated equally before the law. Surely, therefore, there is a defect in this section.  Would the Minister be good enough to reply to this point, particularly the question of whether there must be a declaration, and what it will contain?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be clear to the Minister that this section is unworkable, to say the least.  There are three major bodies of opinion on this matter, those who want very strict control, those who want little or no control and those who want reasonable control.  None of them will be pleased with this section.  It is clearly one that should be reconsidered by the Minister.  If our parliamentary system was a little more open we would not have Ministers&mdash;I do not refer to any one Government&mdash;bringing legislation here and refusing to change a dot or a comma.  If there was a proper approach to this Bill this section would have been re-written.  Subsection (1) (a) states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not import contraceptives into the State unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) they are part of his personal luggage accompanying him when he is entering the State and their quantity is not such as to indicate that they are not solely for his own use, or</P>
      <P>Supposing a person makes a trip to England and brings back a year's supply of contraceptives, who is to say whether it is a quantity sufficient or in excess of what he needs for his own use?  It is clearly nonsense.  A person could go to England every day and bring back a year's supply from England where they are freely available.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to re-write the whole thing.  Deputies Browne and O'Connell earlier asked the Minister not to make us the laughing stock of the world by putting up notices at ports of entry telling people that they can bring in only so many contraceptives. The Minister must know that is absurd, that it reduces legislation to worse than a farce.  I am appealing to him to look again at the subsection.  Paragraph (b) relates to a servant or agent acting <Col N="263" /> for a person.  It is clearly the same category as section 1 (a).</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to give himself authority to make conditions for the issuing of licences.  Is it wise that the Minister should have such unfettered authority?  Perhaps such a condition should be subject to a regulation which would be open to annulment by the House.  In my view section 5 is farcical and unworkable.  It is clearly deemed to give the impression that there will be control.  We are forcing ourselves to put up farcical notices at our ports of entry which will make us a laughing stock.  I appeal to the Minister to completely review the section.</P>

      <P>One of my problems in this debate is to know exactly where Fine Gael stand.  They want to try to procure all the possible political parliamentary advantage they can from opposing this measure but at the same time they do not have the political courage to say what they want me to do. At least I know what Deputy Browne wants, he wants completely limitless availability of artificial contraceptives. However, Fine Gael on every section oppose it, ridicule it and resort to the argument of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, but at the same time have not put forward any single proposal which they want adopted and incorporated in the Bill.  The suggestion of an all-party Committee is farcical and Members putting forward that suggestion know it is farcical.  There is no way one can devise any all-party Committee of the House which would represent Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Dr. Browne and the bulk of opinion in Fianna Fáil.  I would be grateful if Deputies would stop being hypocritical about that and forget about it.  It is not a serious proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to apologise for, perhaps, irascible interventions on my part.  I want to deal with the arguments put forward by Deputies as sensibly as I can and if I occasionally give way to impatient outbursts I hope the House will forgive me for doing so and understand that that is not the way I want this Bill approached or dealt with.  The principle <Col N="264" /> of the Bill is clear and I must mention it again for the purpose of explaining why section 5 is included.  The simple principle on which the Bill is founded is that because of a decision of the Supreme Court we must make artificial contraceptives reasonably available to married couples.  I accept that constitutional obligation which was placed upon us.</P>
    <P>I believe I represent the majority of sensible and mature thinking people when I say that in making artificial contraceptives available for family planning purposes we do not wish to make them universally available without let or hindrance to anybody who wants them under any circumstances, whether they are young, old or single.  The Bill is founded on the principle of making artificial contraceptives reasonably accessible for family planning purposes to families.  The provisions of section 5 are in pursuance of that objective.  We have decided that the availability that is necessary and must be provided is an availability through pharmacies on doctors' prescription.  That principle has been accepted by the House as the founding principle of the Bill and, therefore, we must have section 5 to ensure that artificial contraceptives are made available only through licensed channels to pharmacists who would supply them on prescription.</P>
    <P>It is no good railing about that or trying to ridicule it because that principle has been accepted by the House.  Section 5 is simply a mechanism for giving effect to that principle.  I am surprised that Deputies who purport to be liberal in their approach object to subsection (1) and try to defeat it by ridicule.  I would have thought that they might have adopted the following attitude about that: &ldquo;We do not like the Bill because we think it is unduly restrictive, it is illiberal but at least there is one part of it with which we agree, the provision whereby a person can bring in artificial contraceptives for their own use.&rdquo;  I would have thought that they would have regarded that as an acceptable concession.  The attitude of those Members seems to be totally illogical.</P>
    <P>If I did not have such a provision in the Bill Members should consider the <Col N="265" /> ridicule that would then be heaped on the legislation.  Pictures would be painted for me of tourists who would be prevented from bringing in artificial contraceptives for their own use.  I do not particularly like the provision but it is something that, in all reasonableness, should be made.  It is possible to take practically any provision in any legislation and ridicule it by inventing all sorts of hypothetical situations, but that is not the way legislation works.  Legislation is put forward on as practical and sensible a basis as possible and on the implicit understanding that it will be administered and implemented in a sensible and practical sort of way.  All the things that Deputies Browne, Horgan and Mitchell are saying about this provision could <i>mutatis mutandis</i> be applied to literally hundreds of other provisions in the customs legislation.  There are all sorts of ludicrous and ridiculous situations one can invent about practically any aspect of the customs regulations.</P>
    <P>One can visualise all sorts of impossible situations if one wants to.  However, as I said earlier today, we have a trained, skilled, honest, impartial, conscientious customs service.  Very often we may not like what they do and occasionally they will come in conflict with the travelling public, but I am satisfied to leave this provision to their commonsense, practical implementation.  All the ludicrous and ridiculous situations that Deputies are inventing for the sake of argument are not going to arise.  They have not arisen for the last ten years.  Since the Supreme Court decision the law here is that a person, individual, visitor, citizen or anybody else may bring in artificial contraceptives for their own use, but they may not bring in artificial contraceptives for sale.  That is the situation that applies at the moment and that situation is being continued in this section. At present it does not give rise to all the catastrophically ludicrous, laughable situations which Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If there is one aspect of this legislation which needles me it is when Deputies and the Minister in the past few minutes, in reply to a provocative word from a Labour Deputy, introduced the people of Northern Ireland.  There is nothing more offensive to the people of the Six Counties than to be continually associated with contraception, divorce and abortion. The majority of the people there look upon legislation on divorce, contraception and abortion with disgust and contempt.  If you want to drive these people away you will do so by associating them with filth and propaganda of this kind.  I have too much respect for the people of Northern Ireland than to hold them up as an example of a society which concentrates on nothing but contraception, divorce and abortion.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is what certain Members of this House associate with the people of Northern Ireland.  The greatest part of the population of Northern Ireland&mdash;not only the entire Catholic population but the vast majority of the decent, honest Protestant population&mdash;do not want to have their names dragged down in the mud in this Parliament or any other institution in this State by being held us as a reason for glorifying contraception, divorce and the other topics which the liberal section of our community delight in discussing <Col N="270" /> and in advancing the interests of.  The sooner we get the idea that there is a greater resentment to the terms of this legislation and everything connected with what is morally wrong the better. What is morally wrong in the Republic is morally wrong in the Six Counties. But there are liberal members in this House and perhaps there are some on both sides who do not like to hear the facts which cannot be denied and which none or them have attempted to deny. Every aspect of contraception is morally wrong and no amount of talking they can do in this House can make right what is morally wrong.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 5 reference has been made to the customs officers and customs officials.  I have the greatest admiration and respect for the customs officials who must undertake a difficult job; they are highly trained, they are specialised in their work and they are all people of the highest integrity.  Otherwise they would not have been selected and hand picked by the Revenue Commissioners for this task.  I do not think that there is the slightest danger of contraceptives coming into this country unless they are being brought in for the personal use of the carrier or his agent. According to the Minister the laws of this land enable them to do such.  There will be no question whatever of contraceptives coming in in quantities for sale except under licence as the Minister has clearly indicated.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear, as I have endeavoured to do in many other speeches I have made in this House, that the terms of this Bill are too liberal for my taste.  I do not believe in it and there are many other Members in this House who do not believe in it either.  That is why I am sorry that this legislation has not left it to the individual conscience of each Deputy to decide in relation to this section on the importation of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong with a foreigner coming into this country having to seek the medical advice that would be necessary? If facilities are going to be granted for family planning I must say that the importation of contraceptives for any use is wrong.  What we should do is advance and develop the natural methods of <Col N="271" /> family planning and then this whole question would not arise.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the control of importation of contraceptives.  The first paragraph of subsection (1) is of paramount importance.  It says that a person shall not import contraceptives into the State unless they are part of his personal luggage accompanying him when he is entering the State and their quantity is not such as to indicate that they are not solely for his own use.  I want to put this to the Minister.  Because of our close proximity to Northern Ireland and our convenient situation in relation to the United Kingdom, it is very easy for people to import contraceptives. I will give the example of a person living in Dundalk who visits Newry once a week or once a fortnight. He could bring back one dozen condoms as part of his personal luggage&mdash;just sufficient to last until the next visit.  On the other hand a Cork or Kerry cattle dealer who makes monthly sailings to Cardiff or Swansea could no doubt import two and a half dozen without the risk of seizure by the Revenue Commissioners. How can this section hope to cope with the residents in any part of County Monaghan or County Louth or the people in Lifford who can import contraceptives from Strabane.  What is to stop frequent visits and ample supplies of contraceptives coming in in that manner?  Also in regard to the people making frequent journeys to Cardiff or Swansea in connection with the cattle business or any other business I do not think there would be any great risk of seizure by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this section to curtail greater importation of contraceptives and I would like to hear from the Minister as to how he or the Irish Medical Association or anyone who has a comment to make on it would hope to deal with this situation when we see that in other sections of this Bill registered medical doctors have to provide prescriptions in order that contraceptives may be obtained, but there is no question whatever of a medical prescription having to be made available to the people who frequently travel in and out <Col N="272" /> of the State.  How does the Minister propose to deal with circumstances of this kind?  Furthermore, what steps would he take if evidence were presented to him that certain people who are travelling in and out of Northern Ireland and travelling to and from Britain were having a nice hand over by bringing in even small quantities of contraceptives illegally?  Does he propose to circularise special regulations to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Customs officers in order to prevent such from happening? For the life of me I cannot see how this section is going to be effective. For that reason I cannot subscribe to it as a workable section.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister when he says that the alternative to this section is the free availability of contraceptives for all who require them.  Such legislation would be disastrous to the future of our society. So long as I am in this House I hope I will be a voice to be raised strongly against it.  Such would not improve the quality of our society.</P>
    <P>As I know from experience, every section of every Bill is discussed in detail between the Minister and the officers in his Department in advance of it coming into this House.  Can the Minister tell us what was the advice given to him by his officers in relation to the smuggling of contraceptives in and out of the State from the Six Counties or from Britain? As the section is framed, it is unworkable in the circumstances I have outlined.  I do not know how it will be put into effect regionally.</P>
    <P>I am all for the complete restriction and prohibition of contraceptives because I believe in the divine law and in the natural law.  I should like to hear from the Minister on this in order to clear up one or two aspects of the section with which I have dealt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes against the grain but I am almost beginning to sympathise with the Minister in his predicament.  He is plainly in a difficult situation and has admitted as much this afternoon.  He threw it back across the floor of the House in his last interjection and said that he might expect the liberals on these benches, as he termed people without <Col N="273" /> identifying them too closely, while disagreeing with the Bill in general, to say that at least for the first time we are to have a statutory recognition of the availability of contraceptives in our society.  This is the second time.  The first time was the Supreme Court decision in 1973.</P>
      <P>In relation to this section the Minister took exception to the ridicule as he classified it by Deputy Browne, myself and others and made a reasonable case that if this section had not been in, even greater ridicule would have been heaped upon him because of the difficulties experienced by tourists and others coming into the country whose modest supplies of contraceptives might be seized at the ports of entry because there is no statutory mechanism under which they would be admitted under any circumstances. The fundamental problem is not whether the situaton of this section is more reasonable than the one the Minister described but whether it is reasonable enough, which it plainly is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In giving vent to his impatience with the time it has taken to process this legislation, the Minister has invited us to consider the effects of this delay.  He pointed out that there is legislation on mental illness which he, Deputies Browne, O'Connell, Boland and myself would be anxious to see passed.  It is plain that the fundamental genesis of this legislation is twofold.  It is not just the Supreme Court decision.  It is also the evident discomfiture of the Coalition Government at the defeat of their Bill a few years ago.  It was this discomfort and the subsequent promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to bring in adequate legislation which is responsible for the present situation.  When I said I sympathised with the Minister it is because I recognise that this Bill and this section are the best the Fianna Fáil Party can produce in the circumstances.  It is better than anything the Fine Gael Party could produce in the circumstances.  It is not better than anything the Coalition Government produced in the circumstances. It is not an improvement on the present situation, bad and all as that is. Emphatically it is not any better than the Labour Party Bill on this subject which <Col N="274" /> is on the Order Paper of Seanad Éireann at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he did not like this section.  As we go through the Bill the number of sections the Minister does not like seems to be added to day by day.  I can see why.  It is that the Minister is expressing the collective decision of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to this Bill and he must stand over it, distasteful and all as that may be to him.  The Minister defends this section in relation to what he describes as the basic principle of the Bill, that the means of family planning should be reasonably accessible to married couples.  If we accept, for the purposes of argument, this as being the basic principle of the Bill, the Labour Party would want to go further than that.  If we accept it, we must ask ourselves if section 5 meets this.  Does it guarantee reasonable access to the means of contraception to married couples for the purposes of planning their family?  Even on the Minister's own criterion it does not.  I will not go into any hypothetical examples in an attempt to prove so because any exact scrutiny of the actual living conditions of many people in our towns and cities today will show that this section is unreasonable in relation to their needs.  For example&mdash;this is not a hypothetical situation&mdash;a post office worker on strike with a wife and two children has a family income from social welfare of about £21 per week.  His wife may have medical contra-indications to the use of the pill which is the only form of contraceptive she will be allowed to have on the medical card, which presumably she would have on that level of income.  If either he or she opts in favour of a mechanical method of contraception, condoms, spermicides or whatever, on an income of £21 per week with four mouths to feed, how does anybody expect that family to spend £4 or £5 for a doctor, plus a prescription fee on top of the actual cost of a condom or a spermicide?</P>

      <P>What I am saying is entirely relevant to the section and I am not trying to step outside the bounds of order as my next few sentences will make clear.  In present circumstances this family can go to a family planning clinic.  Effectively family planning clinics are to be closed down or penally fined under this legislation.  If this section is passed in its present form, that family have no option but to spend 25 per cent of their weekly income at a minimum on the purchase of family planning requisites. If this section is not passed, if they are allowed to continue to import contraceptives by post, the difference to that family is the difference between £5, which is 25 per cent of their income, and 10p, which is the cost of a stamp.  Of course, they still have to pay the cost of the contraceptive on top of that.  If we ban effectively the import of contraceptives by private individuals for their own family planning purposes the Minister's decision in this section flogs the principle of the Bill which he himself has prepared.</P>

The only way they would be able to get contraceptives other than the pill would be to go through the mechanism suggested in the Bill, which is to go to their doctor to get the prescription or authorisation for a non-medical kind of contraceptive and to pay the prescription charge levied by him.</P>

      <P>They would have to pay substantially more to get them from a pharmacist than they would have to pay if they imported them from relatively cheap outlets in the UK.  Even if the situation is as the Minister has described, he is creating a further anomaly in that we are going to have medical card holders who will not be charged for a visit to the doctor, who will not be charged the prescription charge, but who will be charged for the item being prescribed for them free of charge which a pharmacist is due to supply to them free of charge.</P>
      <P>Another anomaly which the Minister is creating under this section is that he is giving rise to a major simple form of discrimination. In his earlier answer he referred to the travelling public.  We are making a major difference here between the travelling public and the non-travelling public.  We all know what the major source of difference is between the travelling public and the non-travelling public.  The major difference between the two is that one has enough money to travel and the other has not.  Here we are creating a distinction between people based on grounds of means which is totally abhorrent to us in the Labour Party and should be abhorrent to a Minister who wants to create and develop a genuine family planning service.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (2) (b) of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may refuse to grant a licence under this section to a person who has been convicted of an offence under this Act or of another offence of such a character that, in the opinion of the Minister, it would be inappropriate that he should hold such a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gives the Minister an extraordinary wide discretion.  Even if one accepted that the Minister would have the right to refuse a licence to somebody who had committed an offence under this Bill, unsatisfactory as it is, why should we give a Minister an absolutely blanket permission to refuse licences to people who <Col N="277" /> may have been convicted of other offences? Let the Minister be straight with us.  Is he going to refuse a licence to import contraceptives to somebody who has been found guilty of smuggling pigs, butter or any other substance across the Border?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably.  I have not thought about it, but a person convicted of smuggling should not get any sort of import licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is adding fuel to the flames now because he is suggesting what his mind may be on this issue. Outside the scope of this Bill he is giving himself far too blanket a power which may be misused.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (6) reads:</P>
      <P>Contraceptives, the importation of which is not authorised under this section, shall be deemed to be included among ...</P>
      <P>certain goods.  If my reading of the section, and in particular of section 5 (2) (a), is correct, contraceptives will not be allowed to be imported under section 5 (6) in either of two situations, firstly, if they are of a different kind than are specified in subsection (2) (a) and, secondly, if they are in a different quantity from the quantity specified in subsection (2) (a).  At this point we must ask the Minister whether he has it in mind to ban the importation of any particular kind of contraceptive.  This section gives him the right to ban the importation of specified contraceptives by exclusion.  In other words, if he declines to give a licence for the importation of a particular kind of contraceptive he is effectively going to ban it.  Is he going to ban the IUD?  This is a very real question.  Is he going to ban one kind of IUD by refusing to grant the licences for its importation? If so, which kinds is he going to let in?  The Minister is opening up a hornets' nest for himself.  He will have to look at the situation again in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the ironies of subsection (6) is that people who import contraceptives above the number specified in subsection (2) (a) would also be liable to all the draconian penalties enumerated in the <Col N="278" /> penalties section.  Therefore, you have a consignment of articles part of which will be legal and part illegal.  The articles are absolutely totally similar in design, manufacture, shape and use, yet some of them will be untouchable and some will be OK.</P>
    <P>The problem in this section, which springs from the way that the Bill has been drafted is that the section lends itself to a large amount of anomalies even without going into the area of the fantastical that the Minister objects to. Under subsection (6) contraceptives either of a kind or of a number which have been specified under subsection (2) (a) are now going to be added to the table of prohibitions and restrictions inwards contained in section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  We are using an Act over a century old to control the importation of contraceptives. Of course, that of itself is not necessarily ludicrous.  I am not personally in possession of all the amendments and up-to-date versions of the Customs Consolidation Act, but the 1876 version which I have in front of me gives an indication of what the Government at the time had in mind in relation to customs.</P>
    <P>For example, under this Schedule, which may or may not have been amended, extracts, essences, or other concentrations of malt may not be imported. Indecent or obscene prints, photographs, books, cards or obscene articles may not be imported.  I am surprised that, given the stress being put on contraceptives in this Bill, they have not been deemed to be included under that Schedule.  The importation of infected cattle, sheep or other animals, or the carcases thereof, hides, skins, horns, or any other part of cattle or other animals &ldquo;which the Privy Council may by order prohibit in order to prevent the dissemination of any contagious distemper&rdquo; were forbidden to be imported.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving himself an extraordinarily unwieldly and old-fashioned instrument and, taking his earlier remark made in sudden irrascibility about taking people out and shooting them, I am surprised he did not add section 43 of the Customs Consolidation Act, which prohibits the importation of arms, ammunition, gunpowder  <Col N="279" /> or any other goods.</P>
    <P>This section can be attacked not just on the grounds of ridicule but of ordinary common sense.  We in the Labour Party have attacked it on the basis of our Bill, down for discussion in the Seanad.  In his Second Reading speech the Minister made play of the fact that he would not ask any officer in his Department to take part in the drafting of this legislation if he had any conscientious objection to doing so.  I now ask him if he has thought, for example, of customs officers who may share the views of Deputy Flanagan about the desirability of the use of contraceptives at any time.  Will they be assigned to a job that will force them to allow the importation of items or articles which they believe should not be used in any circumstances? Will he extend to them a conscientious gratuity, or has he even begun to consider the administrative absurdities that would arise from this situation?</P>

      <P>If we look at the penal provisions referred to by Deputy Horgan, the £500 and six months imprisonment, and then £5,000 for further breeches of the law, we would be completely irresponsible if we did not try to find out what is in the Minister's mind about the implementation in detail of this legislation.  It would not matter if it was a trivial fine, like the £5 for interfering with a train or for throwing rubbish into a street, or for failing to have a TV licence.  In this Bill the penalties provided are for desperately serious offences.  The outrageous part about it is that such a perfectly normal and perfectly natural practice by an adult individual should be subject to these fearful penalties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to a fact which I have found very disturbing since the debate began&mdash;I suppose it started 30 years ago, but let us agree that it began with the McGee case in the Supreme Court in which I was involved on the medical side.  What most impressed me <Col N="280" /> has been the vindictive and venomous nature of the opposition from what could be described as the natural family planning Catholic social teaching, the lobby in relation to family planning, the intolerance, the authoritarian tenor which runs through it all: &ldquo;This is what we believe and this is what is right.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One gets from it echoes of the old Inquisition, the terrible imposition of a point of view irrespective of what the opposition may think.  I have to draw the attention of Deputy Flanagan to the fact that contraception is immoral only for Roman Catholics.  It is not immoral for Presbyterians who nearly ten years ago made a clear categorical statement that the question of having children was a matter for responsible parents.  Similarly with the Church of Ireland.  The Jewish faith have come down in exactly the same way and have advised,&ldquo;Legislate for all people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Down through the years I have been trying to establish what I believe to be a truly republican state, a secular state, a pluralist state and this Bill seems to me to represent a fundamental conflict within our society.  Article 40 of the Constitution lays down that all citizens shall as human persons be held equal before the law.  We can see from Mr. Justice Walshe's magnificent comment in the McGee case the essential pluralist nature of this society.  We simply ask that we provide for each religious group to let them act within their own moral teachings.  Nobody is asking anybody to behave other than in accordance with their own social and moral teachings, but that each person must have the right to pursue his own social or moral objectives within our pluralist society.</P>
      <P>As we have debated during the years here, Deputy Haughey and many of his colleagues have talked about pieces of legislation being discussed, including this one, as examples of what sensible mature people here believe.  The general implication where I am concerned is that I am not a sensible person, that I am an immature person and that I do not do very much thinking.  I have to draw the Minister's attention to the reality that there are at least a million Protestants in this country who accept the teachings of their different churches.</P>

It is not very sensible legislation.  It is immature, and it is legislation of essentially rather frightened people who are afraid of the world and of allowing adults to take up whatever position they like in the light of the informed conscience of the different sects which make up our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not right of the Minister to say that what I want is unlimited availability of contraceptives.  That creates the impression that I am an irresponsible person simply interested in creating a sort of society in which there is unlimited licence.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I believe most people understand that my only consideration in all kinds of legislation down the years has been its effect on the human condition in our society.  I should like to digress to say to all Members who tend to dismiss this legislation as not being important that there is more important legislation that should be considered.  For 50 per <Col N="282" /> cent of our population, the female sector, there is no more important piece of legislation than that which we are considering. No more important legislation affecting women has been or could be introduced in this House.</P>

      <P>As far as thinking is concerned on this issue, apart from being immature and irresponsible, as far as Europe and the greater part of the civilised world is concerned it is my view which is the orthodox view, and it is the Minister and his colleagues who hold the heterodox view.  We have made terribly miniscule progress throughout the debate but it is important that we have got to the stage where the Minister has contradicted a statement which I referred to.  It is permissible for an Irish citizen to have in his possession contraceptives without the need to have a prescription for them.  At least we have advanced on that position, as we have with a couple of other matters.  The fact that it is permissible for an Irish citizen to import contraceptives for his own use creates a position of discrimination but at least it makes the position slightly less horrendous than it was under the Bill.  I want the same provisions which operate in Belfast, London, Paris, Munich or New York to prevail in respect of the importation of contraceptives here.  Of course, the Minister is the prisoner of the absurd provisions in section 4 under which a prescription must be made available before contraceptives can be bought in a chemist shop.  I cannot be blamed for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is appealing to the House, but the House is appealing to the Minister to withdraw, or to amend, this section.  I am referring particularly to subsection (1) (a).  The Minister asked earlier what to put in in its place.  For instance, the Bill presented to the Seanad by Senator Robinson and others had a section which was clearer; it would have been much simpler if the Minister had the grace to accept section 2 of Senator Robinson's Bill which <Col N="285" /> says&mdash;and I quote, if I may be permitted to do so:</P>
      <P>Section 2.&mdash;(1). A person shall not import for sale, sell, offer for sale or invite offers to purchase contraceptives unless he is the holder of a licence to sell granted under this section, and shall import for sale, sell, offer for sale or invite offers to purchase only such contraceptives as he is permitted to sell by such licence.</P>
      <P>This is a much clearer section, much less ambiguous that what is now proposed by the Minister.  For political reasons, and for political reasons only, the Fianna Fáil Party, when in opposition, totally opposed any measures coming before this or the other House.  They promised to have a whipped vote on a Bill, which was clearly a very bad promise to make. It had no regard whatever to conscience. Now the Minister is hoist by his own petard, or the petard of his own party. Not only that, but when they were in government they refused&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not saying that section 2 of Senator Robinson's Bill is perfect either, but it is a great deal better than section 5 of the Minister's Bill.  The Minister is hoist with his own petard.  For political reasons only he has constantly opposed everybody else's Bill on this matter.

      <P>This is a better section, for a start, than the one the Minister has. I am not saying it is perfect, but it is much better than the Minister's.  Another point that has occurred to me, as I said earlier, is that there is no way you can control&mdash;it is only a sham to pretend you can control the personal importation of contraceptives.  You cannot put any control on the number of times people leave this State, whether to cross the Border, or to cross the sea.  There can be no control, therefore, of the supply that can be reached for their own use.  There is nothing in this section to prevent people from giving away what they have brought in for their own use&mdash;nothing, not that I am saying that should be the case.  The point I am making is that to make the pretence of control is to make us the laughing stock of the world, leaving people coming here open to the possibility of being charged, if this legislation is passed.</P>
      <P>The section refers to a person.  It does not refer to a mature person, or a married person.  Subsection (5) is absolutely empty; I must say it is one of the worst subsections I have ever seen in my two years in the House.  That is in no way an exaggeration.  It is the most open, loose, meaningless and false piece of legislation I have seen in any Bill that has come before this House since I became a Deputy, and a long time before that, when I was reading Bills that came before the House.  I am asking the Minister at least to consider this whole section, even if it meant substituting section 2 of Senator Robinson's Family Planning Bill, 1978, introduced in the Seanad.</P>

However, if he is talking about reasonable access, I have to ask whether or not he accepts that convenience is an index of reasonableness; if it is reasonable access if a married person in order to acquire mechanical contraceptives has to go, first of all, to a doctor, and, secondly, to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am genuinely not trying to protract the business of the House.  If it is reasonable for a person under section 4 to acquire contraceptives within the State by a process which involves identifying herself or himself to two other individuals and involves several journeys and the payment of money, why is it unreasonable under this section for the same person to put a 10p stamp on a letter to the United Kingdom and get contraceptives through the post? If one is reasonable, why is this unreasonable? Why is the same person, who is allowed to buy them under certain conditions within the State under section 4, subjected to the draconian penalties under the penalty section if he or she wants to import them by post? That is the first question I ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question I have put which the Minister has not replied to is: does he accept the logical situation I outlined in relation to customs officials, that there may be customs officials who share Deputy Flanagan's point of view, who may have a conscientious objection to the use of contraceptives under any circumstances? Will the Minister or the Minister for Finance make any provision for this kind of situation?  If the Minister is genuinely concerned about other <Col N="288" /> health legislation which he has on the books he has a short cut which does not involve the guillotine but involves withdrawing this Bill, shelving it indefinitely and bringing in the legislation which he wants to bring in.</P>

If those contraceptives are not available in Ireland what will be the option open to that person?  I asked the Minister a question earlier about this matter and I was not here for his reply if he gave it.  Must the people importing those contraceptives declare them when they arrive at Dublin Airport or one of our ports?</P>

      <P>You can turn any proposal into a ridiculous situation if you want to imply all sorts of impractical and hypothetical propositions.  This <Col N="289" /> is an attempt by me to put in a reasonable provision for people bringing in artificial contraceptives for their own use.  I believe it will work very well. Customs officers are trained, experienced and wise people.  I have no doubt that this will work in a reasonably satisfactory manner.  If there are any abuses of it or if it turns out to be ridiculous, we will have to look at it again.  I really believe it is straining at the mast to be going into all this detail about a simple, straight-forward provision that the importation of artificial contraceptives is controlled by licence except for a person who wants to bring in some for his or her personal use in a limited quantity and not for sale.  Surely nothing could be more reasonable than that?</P>

      <P>We pass legislation here with the very best of intentions but unfortunately it is the implementation of it which presents many problems.  Are we sending the message out from this House to the customs officers that there must be wide latitude in the implementation of this?  We have one thing in mind, that we must be very reasonable about this and there must be no question of a figure, but how about the implementation of it?  I believe this presents many problems.</P>
      <P>I always remember when you were Minister for Social Welfare and there was a question of a deserted wives' allowance. I admired your statement on it when you said that we must be very sympathetic to the needs of deserted wives.  That legislation, which you very successfully steered through the House, was very different when it came to the implementation of it.  It was not applied as you would have wished it to be applied. You said that there would be great sympathy towards them but many of those deserted wives were denied deserted wives' benefit because their husbands had called on them the night before.  When you were Minister for Social Welfare you never intended this.  I quote you over and over again on that legislation, that you meant the best.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useful to know that blackmail did not work and that the Minister is now using his more plausible approach.  Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Boland will recall a discussion on the Tobacco Bill when this same attitude was adopted by the Minister who told us that it was all rather complicated, that he had done his best in the legislation and would we be good enough to give him the power and he would guarantee he would implement the provisions without delay.  We have not had those provisions implemented in respect of the tobacco legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the Minister's assurance that everything will be all right on the night.  This responsible and unfortunate young customs man will be left with the dilemma which we are all sending out to him.  It is very untidy, confused and not very clear in its implications. <Col N="291" /> As we go on we make changes which the Minister concedes after considerable pressure.</P>
    <P>The question about the right of an Irish citizen to buy contraceptives in New York, London, Paris or anywhere else and bring them back for his or her use without recourse to the provisions of section 4 in relation to a doctor's prescription and the provision that they must be for <i>bona fide</i> purposes or family planning is a new concession which the Minister's wants us to accept.  Why then can the lady, to whom Deputy Horgan referred, the lady who is unemployed, who wants to minimise the amount of money she spends on contraceptives, without doctors' fees or chemists' fees, and possibly living in rural Ireland and wanting to avail of a postal service, not buy contraceptives in London, Paris, New York or anywhere else she wants by post and have the right to use them for her own use in our society?  If she has the money to take a plane to London she has this facility, but if she has only 10p to put a stamp on an envelope, she cannot have this facility.  Surely that is highly discriminatory and completely unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to be. It is not desirable that the public in general should write away for contraceptives, presumably in reply to an advertisement. If we were to permit that sort of thing we might as well throw our hats at control.  The Deputy knows and accepts now that I want control of availability.  The Deputy said that I accused him of being in favour of limitless availability.  I do not accuse him at all, I just thought that that was his general belief and approach to this matter.  Is it not better for the people to whom we will make contraceptives available, to have the advice of the pharmacist rather than that they should write away to some almost certainly commercial organisation which is only interested in developing and exploiting the market?  Is it not better that the person concerned should procure contraceptives from some reliable, reputable pharmacist able to stand over the product and give the advice <Col N="292" /> needed in regard to it, if there is no different cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a difference in cost for the non-medical card holder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but the Deputy is primarily concerned with those in the lower income group who are medical card holders.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Browne wishes to be reasonable about the argument he is putting forward, he will surely see that if we permit the importation of artificial contraceptives other than by way of a licence, or if we permit anybody to write away to procure them, there will be no control and we might as well scrap the Bill.  Some people might think that we should scrap the Bill anyway but the Bill is based on certain principles and this section is only a mechanical section.  If one does not accept the principles of the Bill, it does not matter, but if one accepts the principles of the Bill there is nothing odious, reprehensible or silly about section 5.</P>
      <P>Most people who travel to this country know that we have a protective mechanism in relation to foot and mouth disease.  It is regularly announced on aeroplanes that anybody who has been in contact with a farm or poultry and so on should report to the Department of Agriculture in the airport.  It would not cause the slighest difficulty to Deputy O'Connell to make the same ridiculous type of argument about that provision as he is making about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that our experience in the whole of this debate is that if there is any weakness in this law or if there is any provision whereby people with an extremely narrowminded attitude to contraception, in the sense that it must not be permitted because it will destroy the moral fibre of the community and all that sort of thing, are given powers under this Bill we can assume that they will, as in the old days in relation to censorship, use any such weakness in the Bill.  It would be wise of the Minister to insist that if there is a palpable defect in the Bill, it should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about the capacity of an Irish citizen to be legally in possession of contraceptives, and to give them away if he wishes, simply by virtue of the fact that he has been in a position to go to Northern Ireland and across to England and back again.  The person who as a result of an advertisement in one of the reputable magazines wants to send off for contraceptives should be allowed the discretion to do this.

      <P>The logical outcome of what the Deputy is saying is that I should withdraw subsection (1) (a) from the Bill.  By doing that I can remove the discrimination the Deputy is talking about.  I am sure that would please Deputy Flanagan greatly, but that is not what Deputy Dr. Browne has in mind. The only way that I could remove the discrimination would be by having no control over importation.  We will not have that and there is no point in trying to persuade me to have it.</P>

      <P>the Minister is satisfied that the contraceptives are required by the person for sale to persons specified in section 4(1) (b) (i) of this Act,</P>
      <P>This means that the importer will in turn sell the contraceptives to the chemists.  I wonder should we have used the phrase &ldquo;solely to persons specified in section 4 (1) (b) (i) of this Act&rdquo;?  Did the draftsman imply that that was unnecessary? If so, it would appear strange when one looks at contentious paragraph 5 (1) (a), which has a double negative:</P>

In relation to paragraph 5(1) (a), how would anybody be able to decide that the imported contraceptives in a traveller's personal luggage would be solely for his own use and, in relation to certain forms of contraceptives, how could they have the required effect if they were solely for the use of the traveller?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), paragraph (b), lines 45 and 46, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;to&rdquo; in line 45 to the end of the subsection.</P>
      <P>My objection to this section is an exploratory one and the Minister is going to find out how reasonable I am in spite of his assertions to the contrary.  I do not see why the manufacture of contraceptives should be considered to be a particularly exceptional activity.  I do not think it is an activity with which the Minister should be concerned in what I would read as a policing role.  I believe that, if he was agreeable to saying that the conditions of the licence would be that the licence be made available only on certain standards of quality, that his concern was the quality of the contraceptives to be supplied, then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a person guilty of an offence under the Act.  My point is that the Minister is treating the person <Col N="299" /> who might manufacture contraceptives in a penal way simply because he manufactured contraceptives and not because he manufactured contraceptives which were in some way defective.  I am concerned with the quality of the contraceptives. The Minister has made the point about how angry we all would be if he had left the introduction of this Bill to the Minister for Justice.  Instead of that he brings it in as Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>This is one of the features of the Bill which I find so repugnant.  I would not object to any penal clauses where the Minister for Justice is concerned but creating a crime out of the manufacturing and sale of contraceptives is completely repugnant to me.  I find it difficult to understand how the Minister can defend his position as Minister for Health.  If the Minister was concerned about somebody manufacturing contraceptives which were defective I could see some justification for the provision.  Other than that, I am opposed to it.</P>

      <Col N="300" /> In page 5, subsection (5), line 52, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in accordance with the regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is simply to try to ensure that anything the Minister does in respect of this Bill to change it in future should be done in accordance with regulations.  We should have an opportunity of considering these regulations before the Minister is given power. Anything the Minister does should be done in accordance with the regulations which should be laid before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is entitled &ldquo;Control of manufacture of contraceptives&rdquo;. I say without the slightest fear of contradiction, and invite evidence as to the contrary, that it is the manufacture and manufacturers of contraceptives that have a grave vested interest in the whole question of birth control and contraception.  Many family planning clinics that have been set up have had substantial sums of money placed at their disposal by manufacturers of contraceptives. It is the vested interest, those who have a big financial interest and those engaged in the manufacture of these devices, who have been the armchair promoters and the backbone of the contraceptives lobbies not alone in this country but elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I oppose every section of the Bill.  I disagree with the principle of the Bill and so disagree with every section contained therein.  However, it is the manufacturers of contraceptives who have had medical and organising contacts and who have sponsored family planning clinics so that the demand for contraceptives would become greater and greater.  They are not concerned with the kind of person who uses them.  They could not care less if they were used in every school or college in the country as long as they make money out of it.  They are prepared to spend a fair share of money on increasing the output of the manufacturer.</P>
      <P>I do not go so far as to say that those who speak the loudest receive a fair share of the financial reward for speaking on this matter.  Vast sums of money have been invested in family planning clinics.  I am saying, for the record of the House, that this is a section which controls the manufacture of contraceptives and the materialistic, pagan-minded, godless money seekers, money squeezers, get rich by every means fair or foul, by right or wrong, bury moral standards, promoting every kind of standard that brings in money.  They are the type of people responsible for the sale and promotion in general of contraceptives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I was dealing with the motivation behind those who manufacture them.  Those engaged in the manufacture of these devices could not care less about the moral standards or the social conditions in our country.  Their only concern is to advance their interests and swell their dividends and they endeavour to create discontent and to eliminate by every means in their power anything that would cut across their greed for money, even at the expense of destroying the quality of life by the promotion of the most immoral forms of public activity.  That is why I condemn as strongly as I can those engaged in the manufacture of contraceptives for the amount of money they have put into the campaign in which people were paid for shouting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Vested interests are behind the whole question of the manufacture of contraceptives.  It would not have been possible to have these family planning clinics and other campaigns in the halls, the streets and elsewhere if pressure had not been put on men in public life so that the manufacture of contraceptives would be increased vastly.  The result is that the financial profits for those engaged in this business extend and expand while the moral standards and standards of decency disappear completely.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will know the line I am about to take in regard to this section about advertisements.  I do not want him to think that I want to have all the school newspapers, children's comics and programmes on television and radio pervaded by advertisements for contraception.  Frequently absurd things are said in this sort of situation.  This business of people using contraceptives irresponsibly and widely <Col N="303" /> cannot happen unless the people are educated to behave in an irresponsible way.  Most people would agree that the kind of people who are products of our schools have had fairly powerful indoctrination in the Catholic ethos or what is considered in our society to be a Christian ethos.  Therefore, it has always puzzled me to understand why people become so worried about the likelihood of the abuse of things like contraceptives in a society which is so heavily censored, controlled and educated by people handpicked because of their orthodoxy in things like Catholic social moral teaching.</P>
      <P>I do not know how far one goes in this business of big brotherism.  With young people of 16 or 17 years of age, at what stage do you tell them to make decisions for themselves?  What have you done with them up to 16 or 17 that they are likely to fall into some sort of evil or wrongdoing simply because of the effect of putting in an advertisement offering them something which you have taught them they should not make use of?  I have always felt that the educational process is the correct way in which to make an individual able to stand up to the appalling pressures and stresses of life, particularly in relation to the very powerful seductive pressures of the sex drive in its various manifestations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear at the beginning that I am not in favour of pornography of any kind, soft or otherwise, as my basis for consideration of this question of the advertisements.  I merely see once again here a very persistent feature of our society over the 50 or 60 years since the State was founded&mdash;the dual standards of our society on issues of this kind.  Listening to Deputy Flanagan, whose opinions I respect completely, I would put very much higher on the list of moral turpitude&mdash;if such terms must be used&mdash;the people who sell drink, the beer barons.  Also, if one looks at the consequences of tobacco on cigarette smokers and the influence and effect of that on our society, then if we are serious about the question of advertising, why have we not done something if we are going to be so restricted as we appear to be on the <Col N="304" /> question of contraceptives?  Why is it that the enormously wealthy powerful vested interests of drink and tobacco in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not in order.  I appreciate the analogy but it is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue it. Without doubt, if one is to make a choice between contraceptives and drink and cigarettes, the last two are easily the more likely to be in need of curbing from the point of view of advertising.  The view has been accepted in most western countries, in the US, and in all socialist countries, that family planning is part of ordinary living, that people simply cannot do without it, that, in the words of the Supreme Court judgment in the McGee case, it must be freely available.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am opposed to restrictions on advertising, particularly of educational programmes which have to do with limiting the size of families.  I do not think such advertising should be restricted to the medical and nursing professions.  Perhaps the Minister will make his position clear in regard to the kind of regulations he proposes to draw up to implement this section and I hope he will not lean as heavily as he has done in other sections in favour of one kind of family planning as against the other, that he will allow equal dissemination of information on both.  In his letter to the Medical Association last year he made the point that the public must have access to information about all forms of family planning.</P>
      <P>A sort of reluctance has permeated this legislation, a suggestion that it has been brought in because of the McGee case.  Consequently, many women, particularly in the poorer sector, the less educated people, need to be helped by advertisements to find out about all forms of family planning.  I do not agree with natural family planning because I think it is inefficient, but if people want to use it they should be permitted to do so.  However, the natural system of family planning should not be promoted universally at the expense of other forms, right down to the most efficient forms of all, sterilisation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I should like the Minister to say that the general principle of family planning has been accepted by our society.  That would be a marvellous advance.  As somebody who has observed it for many years I consider that the introduction of even this kind of Bill is a great advance when we think of the position we had and the appalling powerful opposition over the years.  I believe that the present generation of 18-year-olds to 30-year-olds will have family planning of the kind they want whether our generation like it or not.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there is at the moment an element of urgency, and this section should be used to dissipate resistance to the idea that there should be responsible family planning, that it is necessary to our society, and we should carry out a systematic programme of education where it is most likely to be effective, including, of course, our schools. A programme suitable for schools should be promoted by the Department of Health to help youngsters to meet the tremendous stresses of adolescence.  All this can be done through this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is right and proper that responsible family planning should be undertaken.  I have not heard that being disputed, particularly if it is by natural methods.  The section deals with advertising and publicity.  The Catholic Marriage Advisory Council are concerned to ensure that the widest possible publicity should be given to natural family planning methods.  I am sure they have been in touch with the Minister before the introduction of this Bill.  On the other hand, I think there should be the strictest possible control on advertising and the display of artificial contraceptives.</P>
      <P>Section 7 states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not take any part in, or procure, the publication of an advertisement or notice in relation to contraception or contraceptives or display, or procure the display of, contraceptives,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I correct in thinking that the only exceptions permitted are professional or medical journals the circulation of which is limited to medical people?  I would be <Col N="306" /> obliged if the Minister would explain if the word &ldquo;notice&rdquo; shall be deemed to include any published matter advocating or describing the use of contraceptives but does not include a statement of the dangers to health which may be involved in the use of such contraceptives?  Does &ldquo;publication&rdquo; include any transmission by radio and television in the case of advertisements in relation to contraceptives in medical journals?  It is my view that, as in the case of cigarettes and certain drugs, those advertisements should carry a note warning of the dangers to health.  The Minister should not permit such advertisements unless they carry such a notice.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have a further look at this section with a view to improving its provisions before Report Stage.  This aspect should be seriously and fully examined now.  We all know that there are many smart people in our society who can drive a coach and four through most legislation and I have no doubt that an effort would be made to do so in relation to this section.  This is an important aspect of the Bill which can have far-reaching effects unless there is rigid control.  The Minister should not permit any publicity in relation to contraceptives.  I make that suggestion on the basis that contraception is morally wrong and that most types of contraceptives are a grave danger to the health of the users.  I should like to hear members of the medical profession deal with the records which show that the use of contraceptives has been damaging and responsible for the deaths of numerous people who use them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with some bafflement to Deputy Flanagan, much as I respect the sincerity of his views and the intensity with which he expresses them.  My bafflement has been related in particular to a suggestion that this section is inadequate because it does not require the incorporation in any publicity of warnings of possible dangers to health from the use of contraceptives. There are many different kinds of contraceptives and I do not understand what Deputy Flanagan was getting at. Take the most common form of contraceptive, the male condom, the only <Col N="307" /> possible danger to health arising from the male condom, as I understand it, is if they are not used properly.  To the best of my, no doubt, imperfect knowledge the manufacturers of most of these articles have taken such steps as are open to them to include such instructions with their merchandise as to make sure that they are used properly.  They are already meeting the conditions demanded by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
      <P>My basic quarrel with the section is that it is a consorship provision and one which is repugnant to common sense.  It is not so long since a number of countries of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation made an attempt to impede the free flow of information and our Government took a liberal and enlightened view at that time on this issue.  Section 7 files in the face of the free flow of information, particularly in relation to the free flow of necessary information on family planning.  I can already hear in advance the Minister's counter-argument.  He will say that because contraception is a medical and pharmaceutical matter the doctors and pharmacists must be involved.  He will say that anybody who goes to a doctor or pharmacist will be told where to purchase or otherwise acquire the means of family planning and, therefore, the restrictions in the section do not unduly restrict access to the necessary information by the persons concerned.  However, that is all based on the fundamental premise of the Bill the effect of which is that the adult male or female married person who wants to buy a mechanical contraceptive for his or her use within marriage is obliged to seek the intervention of a qualified medical practitioner and qualified pharmacist.  Those people are not adjudged responsible enough to go into a shop to buy the things for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as control is needed on advertisements I would suggest to the Minister that we already have fairly wide-ranging legislation on indecent displays and publications.  It should be up to the courts and to the police force in common sense to decide whether any <Col N="308" /> advertisement or series of advertisements offend against this canon of taste. It is essentially a canon of taste we are talking about and that canon of taste changes from time to time.  As society becomes more mature they can take some things without being shocked that they would not have been able to take a generation before.  The standard of what is permissible and what is not is partly governed by legislation and is partly governed by the common sense, maturity and sophistication of the particular generation of adult human beings who form our parents, our police force and our judiciary.  I do not see anything wrong with leaving the control of the advertising of the ordinary mechanical methods of contraception to the good, ordinary and honest judgment of those people.</P>
    <P>In relation to the wording in detail of the section, in particular subsection (1), I would be grateful for some clarification from the Minister because the section as it is worded seems to be extraordinarily wide in its possible application.  I adverted to this on Second Stage and I asked the Minister whether it was proposed to make the sale or distribution of magazines which contained advertisements for mechanical family planning methods an offence.  I do not recall the Minister replying to that.  The section states:</P>
    <P>A person shall not take any part in, or procure, the publication of an advertisement or notice...</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the fact that many publications of a more or less serious kind, most of them originating outside the country and offered for sale here, carry advertisements of the kind this section seeks to control.  Is it not obvious on the facts of the matter that somebody who sells or distributes one of these publications is taking part in the publication of an advertisement because the advertisement is not published unless it is delivered to the person who reads it, the general member of the public who buys the magazine.  What am I to say when I go to my newsagent tomorrow morning to buy <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;he is a well-established member of the Minister's party&mdash;in relation to this subsection? <Col N="309" /> Am I to tell him that he will not be able to sell <i>The Spectator, The New Statesman or the New York Review of Books</i>?  Let us, for example, take the situation in which some foreign television stations eventually allow the broadcasting of advertisements for contraceptives on television.  When this is done by a commercial television station in a neighbouring island what then is the position of an organisation like RTE Relays&mdash;a wholly-owned subsidiary of a semi-State company?  Are they also to be guilty, under section 71, of taking some part in the publication of an advertisement because they have set up a relay system which conveys a particular signal containing a particular advertisement to an individual's house?  I would be very greatful for the Minister's observations on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that this was the most impeccable section. As the Deputies know, I have had a long exhausive series of consultations with different groups, representatives, sectors of the community, interested parties, and there is one matter, above all other matters, upon which everybody who came to see me was agreed, which was that there should be some control on advertising about artificial contraception. Every group that came to see me was of that mind.  I am certain of that. There might have been one exception but I doubt it, because it was a question which I put to every deputation or group, that came to see me.  There is unanimity about this one thing above everything else.</P>

      <P>In particular, there was unanimity among all the representatives of the different religions who came to see me.  I would have thought that this section was beyond reproach.  First of all, I want to say that this is only a preventive section.  It is a section which prevents, except in accordance with the regulations&mdash;in other words it is the regulations that will really be the important matter.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Browne under another section, these regulations will be before the <Col N="310" /> House and will be available for discussion. I indicated, on a number of occasions, that it was my intention that the regulations would not, in any way, prohibit or inhibit the making available of advertising material about artificial contraceptives to those professionally involved in family planning&mdash;doctors, nurses, pharmacists and so on.</P>

      <P>My intention is that the regulations should prevent the commercial exploitation of artificial contraceptives. That concept of mine is in keeping with the general philosophy of the Bill. In a situation where we wish to make artificial contraceptives available, in certain circumstances, for family planning purposes, I think it would be completely out of keeping and absurd to permit commercial companies to freely advertise their products to the public at large. We have in mind in that regard susceptible young people and indeed maybe people who are not so young who need some sort of instruction, advice and guidance from disinterested parties before they are exposed to the pressure of commercial advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The liberal wing of the House must be in a dilemma in this regard.  They, like me, would deplore a great many of the modern techniques of sales promotion, the unrestricted commercial exploitation. of a market where every modern psychological device is used to persuade the public that the use of a certain product is the gateway to human happiness, satisfaction or whatever.  We would not want that sort of situation where artificial contraceptives are concerned. Deputies know that if there is no control and no regulations the resources of the advertising people to promote the sale of their products are almost inexhaustible. They have all sorts of modern persuasive techniques for promoting their products which to a great majority of the population are almost irresistible whether they <Col N="311" /> are selling detergents, clothes pegs or refrigerators.  It has now become a very exact sort of science.</P>
    <P>I have not intruded my personal opinion too much into this debate, I hope, but I look with horror at a situation where our media would be completely open to full-scale commercial exploitation of the market for artificial contraceptives. That would be very harmful, and I do not see that any good could flow from it.  It is a complete distortion of the situation to suggest that by controlling or attempting to control unrestricted advertising I am interfering with the free flow of information.  That is stretching the fine sounding phrase &ldquo;free flow of information&rdquo; a bit too far.</P>
    <P>Today, the idea of controlling advertising is on the increase.  Governments everywhere are setting up institutions to control and restrict advertising so as to try to make sure that if it is not directed to the public good, it at least is not subversive of the public good.  Totally unrestricted advertising cannot be condoned in any situation, and certainly not in this situation.  It certainly would not be in keeping with the general principles according to which the Bill is designed. The situation will be governed by regulations which Deputies will have an opportunity to discuss and examine in detail, but I wish to give fair notice now that as far as I am concerned the regulations will restrict the advertising of artificial contraceptives to the categories of persons I have mentioned.  I would not go as far as Deputy Flanagan, who suggested that there is need to include a warning in these advertisements.</P>

      <P>Deputy Horgan seemingly was not aware, but the Minister is aware that it has been medically established beyond doubt that the use of certain types of contraceptives is responsible for abortion, heart disease, VD and cancer.  Surely, as Minister for Health, when making these regulations there is a serious responsibility resting on the Minister to warn the users of contraceptives of the dangers of heart disease and cancer particularly.</P>

      <P>As the advertisements will only be available to professional people, knowledgeable medical nursing people or pharmacists, they will be aware of any danger or any medical disadvantage attached to a product, so that it would not be necessary to stipulate that in the regulations.  Even if I never had the intention of putting in the section to control advertising by regulation, this section would have recommended itself to every single group of persons who came to see me no matter which side of the fence they came from.  Certainly, the almost universal unanimous opinion of those who came to see me about that matter, no matter what they said about availability was against uncontrolled, unrestricted advertising.</P>

      <P>In response to what I have said the Minister ignored all the reasonable points I made about the effect of this section, if it is passed, on a great deal of the ordinary commerce in newspapers, journals and publications of altogether reputable standards, and he has created a bogey man of a picture of what might happen in a situation in which there were totally unfettered rights of advertising.  I invite the Minister to look at the situation in a neighbouring country where there has been totally unfettered advertising for over half-a-century. What has happened to the advertising of contraceptives in that jurisdiction during that period is that the advertising of contraceptives in the UK has by and large been confined, without any regulation or control by any Government, to medical and trade publications, because medical and trade publications go to doctors and pharmacists and because in that jurisdication certain contraceptives have to be prescribed, doctors and pharmacists are the people who need to be told about the characteristics of certain contraceptives and to learn where to get them for their stocks.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Mitchell on Tuesday, 12 June 1979:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann demands that a comprehensive national policy on the improvement and proper development of major urban areas be undertaken immediately; that an Action Plan for the inner-city of Dublin be a priority in such a policy, this Plan to take full account of the present deplorable standards of a wide range of social, economic and cultural factors, including housing, recreational and other amenities, jobs, education, the quality of the physical environment generally; and that Dáil Éireann therefore demands the immediate formulation of a programme of massive and enlightened investment of resources into areas such as the heart of Dublin, beset by major urban problems.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is undertaking a review of the 1972 Statement by the Government on Regional Policy, that this review will include an examination of the strategy adopted in relation to major urban areas in <Col N="314" /> that Statement, and that Dáil Éireann approves of the action taken by the Government to establish an Inner City Group to develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the Dublin inner city area and to make an additional £1m available in 1979 to accelerate progress in dealing with inner city problems.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment which the Minister for Economic Planning and Development moved last evening.  At the same time, I want to make the point that the amendment does not propose a direct counter to the motion laid before the House by the Deputies opposite.  There is a good deal of common ground between us and a common acceptance that there is a genuine need for action by central and local authorities in order to deal with the social and economic problems which are most acute in the inner core areas of Dublin and indeed in other old cities in the country.  The differences between Deputies favouring the motion and the amendment respectively lie mainly in approach and emphasis and, may I say, in a willingness to acknowledge that a number of constructive policies to cope with these problems have been formulated by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, reminded the Dáil yesterday that in 1972, a formal statement on regional policy made by the then Fianna Fáil Government laid down a strategy for urban development.  That statement had pointed out that the development of urban areas was an inherent part of the planned development of the regions within which the towns were situated having regard to the importance of the urban areas in the matter of population distribution and economic and social <Col N="315" /> development.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, until the present Government resumed office two years ago, the 1972 scheme of regional development did not get the support and public commitment it merited and particularly the investment of public capital in the infrastructural services needed to complement the forward physical and economic planning.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has been reviewing the 1972 statement of regional policy, the recent pattern of development in urban areas and the form which this development should take in the years ahead will form an integral and important part of his review.  Naturally the Dublin area, in which such a large proportion of the population reside and work, must feature prominently in the review.</P>
    <P>In July 1978 an inter-departmental committee of senior officials of nine government Departments, each with special responsibilities and functions relating to the inner city area of Dublin, were set up under the chairmanship of an officer of the Department of Economic Planning and Development. The IDA were also represented on the committee which was instructed:</P>
    <P>to recommend policy decisions and other measures to be taken in relation to the special economic and social problems of the Dublin inner city area.</P>
    <P>An early report was requested and, in fact, a most comprehensive analysis of the situation and a series of proposals to deal with the problems of the area was presented to the Government last month.</P>
    <P>In a debate such as this there must be always a temptation for Members opposite to score political points and to criticise the slow rate of progress in dealing with the real problems which have existed and indeed have become acute for some years past.  I appreciate the restrained and reasonable manner in which Deputies Mitchell, Horgan and Ryan, in their contributions yesterday dealt with some of these problems.  Let me assure the Deputies that the matters <Col N="316" /> they raised&mdash;the poor housing conditions, environmental deficiencies, the high level of unemployment, the educational troubles, the incidence of petty crime in the area, the need for effective sanctions to curb deliberate dereliction and urban blight, and so on&mdash;all have been fully covered in the report of the committee and that possible solutions to all are included in their recommendations.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards giving effect to the committee's recommendations the Government decided on 9 May last to establish an inner city group, reporting to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  The functions of this group will be to further the work of the inter-departmental committee and to develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the Dublin inner city area.  The group will also co-ordinate the activities and policies of these bodies.  To underpin the programme and to accelerate the pace of action in dealing with inner city problems, additional public funds will be allocated for this programme.  As an earnest of their commitment in the matter the Government have already made a sum of £1 million available for the programme relating to the Dublin inner city.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these actions in order to put on the record of the Dáil that long before the motion now being discussed was tabled, the Government were very much aware of the serious social and economic problems which exist in the inner city of Dublin, also that they were determined to identify, locate and quantify these problems and, with full regard to the human issues involved, to decide on the most effective courses of action to deal with the situation as it exists.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record also the amount of work done by the Dublin Corporation, the IDA, the Department of Education and other public agencies&mdash;much of it with a minimum of publicity&mdash;work to improve the quality of life and the prospects of those citizens residing in the inner city areas.  In particular, the approach of the corporation has been extremely considerate and has <Col N="317" /> always avoided any suggestion that families who wish to continue residing in these areas would be in any way compelled to move out to suburban estates. Naturally this has slowed up progress with redevelopment of the area and the rehousing of residents.  However, I think that all Members will agree that the desire for progress in these matters should not override the human factors.</P>
    <P>It is only right too, that in this debate a well deserved tribute should be paid to the local parochial and order clergy and nuns and the different lay charitable associations who have, down the years, put an immense amount of work into making life more tolerable and purposeful for those families and individuals in the inner city who have always needed this kind of support and who continue to do so.  These public-spirited people seek no publicity and prefer to work unobtrusively on a personal basis.  But it would be wrong on an occasion like this not to express public appreciation of the contribution they have been making towards improving conditions within this area.</P>
    <P>In this context I note that Deputy Horgan spoke at considerable length yesterday about the educational problems associated with the inner city. While he saw fit to criticise one educational establishment in the area, I feel that he should also have given credit to the long and honourable tradition of education of the children of residents in that area&mdash;without regard to family means or background&mdash;by the Irish Christian Brothers, the Irish and French Sisters of Charity and the Nuns of the Holy Faith, Loreto, Mercy and Presentation Orders.</P>
    <P>With that reservation I agree with Deputy Horgan that education has a much more important role in the problems of the inner city than is generally realised, especially in relation to youth employment.  Where a person has failed to secure a job in his youth it makes it all the more difficult for him to secure employment during his early adult life, and this could be the beginning of a history of social problems for that individual and his family.  The interdepartmental committee examined the educational aspects of inner city <Col N="318" /> problems and have made recommendations on the subject which will be carefully considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to pre-empt any decision on the subject, I can say that the Government are committed to the principle of equal educational opportunity for all children.  In practice it is difficult to achieve the desired measure of equality, since the situation is affected by factors other than financial resources. Research in Ireland and elsewhere has shown that both educational attainments and post-school careers depend in large measure on the social structure into which a child is born.  Various attempts have been made in the past to rectify this imbalance&mdash;including the raising of the school leaving age, the provision of free education, free transport, free books, and so on.  These measures, however, appear to have had only limited success in influencing the participation rates of depressed urban classes in education.</P>
    <P>Housing is a major social problem in the inner city, and is characterised there by a preponderance of local authority dwellings, much of it below modern acceptable standards, and by a good deal of small private houses provided a century or more ago.  Many of the dwellings are very small and lack modern facilities. Overcrowding is above average and the standard of maintenance is poor.  The Government have been considering what measures should be taken to improve the situation in this regard, in particular to achieve a better social mix, to eliminate substandard housing, both private and local authority and, at the same time, to encourage the rehabilitation and upgrading of sound old houses in the area which with due attention could have a potential life span extending into the twenty-first century.</P>
    <P>In the case of public housing Dublin Corporation have a planned programme for the redevelopment of residential parts of the inner city area.  Sites have been acquired for approximately 2,000 houses scattered throughout the area. The schemes will be mostly relatively small and compact with a mixture of large, medium and small houses, including dwellings specially designed for the accomodation of elderly persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim is to create integrated communities, blending fully with existing residential developments in the area.  Five schemes, totalling 269 dwellings, are already in course of construction, and the corporation project that 167 inner city dwellings will be completed and handed over in the present year.  A further 1,133 houses are in various stages of planning by the corporation.</P>
      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation are reviewing their city redevelopment programme and have in mind the acquisition of additional sites.  This course of action does not require my sanction since the cost of acquisition will be met initially by overdraft or other temporary borrowing.  The cost will, of course, be met from State funds when the schemes get under way in due course.</P>
      <P>A feature of inner city house building is the extremely high cost, which can be double the cost of conventional housing in a suburban area.  Three-bedroomed houses now being built at City Quay will cost at least £36,000 each, involving a State subsidy over the next 35 years of over £88 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This factor requires constant and critical examination.  Too great a proportion of the corporation's capital allocation spent on inner city redevelopment would undoubtedly hamper the capacity to build municipal houses at an adequate rate on the periphery and would impede the progress of the corporation in their priority role as housing authority of housing families in need.  It is essential that the corporation should retain a <Col N="320" /> reasonable balance between building on expensive central city sites and sites outside the municipal boundary in order to ensure an acceptable level of unit output to meet the needs of families on the waiting list with a minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept without reservation the suggestions made last night that in comparing the cost of housing on inner city sites with those in respect of suburban development we are not comparing like with like.  Deputy Mitchell did mention that in the case of central city sites services are available which have to be provided in the case of suburban developments.  I would like to remind the Deputy, however, that much of the basic infrastructural services in the inner city are approaching obsolescence and certainly need substantial expenditure to bring them up to a level which would be acceptable in the case of new housing development.  It is relevant in this regard also to remember that fairly constant criticis have been expressed about the substandard educational accommodation, the lack of open spaces, the traffic flow problems and other features associated with redevelopment areas of the inner city.  Having said that I want to make it clear that I have never endeavoured to stop or slow down the pace of housing development in central city areas and that I will continue to consider proposals for such development on the merits of each scheme.</P>
    <P>Better housing within the city must also provide for the improvements of the existing housing stock there which, though old, is capable of being brought up to reasonably acceptable standards without undue cost and a diversification of types of new dwellings, both public and private.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Horgan raised some questions.  While they came under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education, I would like to assure the Deputy that it is not proposed to decrease the scale of assistance given by the Department of Education to the Rutland Street project.  I am also advised that the question of the continuance of the split day is under consideration at present.  I want to assure the Deputy that the other points raised by him in relation <Col N="321" /> to the Rutland Street project will be brought to my colleague's attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said we needed a Minister for Dublin inner city.  There are many Departments and public agencies operating in the inner city and each has its own special role.  The Government realise this, and also the fact that each one of these is responsible only for its own line of activity.  They further realise that there is a need for a broad overall approach to the inner city problems which would involve a co-ordinated effort by all Departments and agencies operating in this area.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of this effort.  The inter-departmental committee on Dublin inner city was chaired by an officer of his Department and reported to him.  The inner city group which the Government have decided to establish will also be chaired by an official of that Department and will report to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development as well.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy, Deputy Mitchell, spoke about the lack of a plan for the inner city.  I would like to point out in relation to this that the inter-departmental committee which I have referred to have produced a wide ranging list of recommendations which extend over the main aspects of life in the inner city.  The function of this new group will be to examine these recommendations and to develop a programme of action by the different Government Departments and public agencies operating in the area.  The group's orientation is towards action and not towards further planning and this is the sensible and proper approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government accept the recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government see the recommendations I have referred to as providing a useful basis for a co-ordinated programme of action by the inner city group.  Deputy Mitchell made a number of suggestions for restructuring local government in the Dublin area. At the moment I am having the whole question of local government organisation looked at from the point of view of <Col N="322" /> its adequacy in serving the local public. This examination, of course, embraces the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>A review of organisation is necessarily a complex task.  It must avoid the temptation to accept change simply for its own sake and concentrate on those reforms which offer the prospect of generally improved administration.  I will be looking for realistic proposals of this kind from the examination now being conducted in my Department.  I can assure the Deputy that his suggestion will be borne in mind in the process of working towards final decisions on the matters about which he is concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell has alleged that there is a reduction in the powers of the Dublin city manager and the corporation as a result of the abolition of domestic rates.  This argument has already been debated at great length during the passage of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 and I do not intend to delay the House on it now.  The allegation shows an unrealistic attitude first of all because neither Deputy Mitchell nor his party are for a moment questioning the wisdom of our decision to abolish domestic rates and, secondly, because the argument ignores that Dublin Corporation are this year managing their biggest ever current budget&mdash;just over £100 million&mdash;with exactly the same freedom as they had before we removed rates from houses.  There is no interference with the autonomy of the corporation with regard to how they spent their money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I would put it to the Dáil that the approach adopted by the Government to the matters raised in this motion is proper and realistic having regard to the significance of major urban areas in the development of our economy and the urgent nature of the problems facing inner Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major urban areas account for over 40 per cent of our population.  They have an important role not alone as growth centres in themselves but also in the impact which they have on the surrounding <Col N="323" /> areas.  Their development cannot be considered in isolation from the rest of the country.  It is appropriate, therefore, that their development should be guided and encouraged in a regional context throughout the country as a whole.  This is the best way to ensure that development in these areas and in their extensive hinterlands is complementary rather than competitive.</P>
    <P>Many of the difficulties which major urban areas outside of Dublin are now experiencing stem from the inadequate public capital provision for infrastructural services in the mid seventies.  The Government have given particular attention to making good this deficiency and have made massive increases, in constant money terms, in the capital investment in infrastructural and environmental services.</P>
    <P>The road development plan announced last month will help considerably in relieving wasteful and frustrating congestion points in major urban areas.  The electrification of the Howth-Bray railway line, recently given the go-ahead by the Government should also help to relieve appreciably traffic congestion in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In regard to Dublin inner city, the various measures which will be adopted to meet the special economic and social problems of the area will have as a foremost principle the improvement of life economically and socially for the residents.  The recommendations made by the inter-departmental committee, which will be used as a basis for action by the inner city group, extend over the main aspects of life in the area.  The approach adopted by the Government recognises the need for action over a wide range of aspects.  At the same time it is essential to recognise that the problems of the area are inter-related and that there would be little overall advantage in concentrating on just some of them and neglecting the others.  Hitherto, problems in the inner city areas have been tackled more or less in isolation from each other.  There is not much point in concentrating on housing alone and ignoring job creation and education. Conversely, it would be foolish to concentrate  <Col N="324" /> on education and to ignore job creation.  Such an unco-ordinated approach would be economically wasteful and socially demoralising.  The effective approach must enbrace all facets of life, including housing, the environment, jobs, education and so on.  Perhaps the most important feature of the Government's policies on the matter is that they have been formulated on a co-ordinated, multi-dimensional basis.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the need for action without delay to meet the genuine problems which exist in Dublin and other major urban areas.  Needless to say, the problems will not be solved overnight: they have complex and inter-related causes and attention has to be paid, to the greatest extent possible, to the wishes of the people who are most directly affected.  Nevertheless, the Government will ensure that everything that can be done to improve life generally in the area will be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The £1 million which the Government have made available for disbursement through the inner-city group will give an added impetus to the efforts of the group.  It will provide an important stimulus and enable them to undertake projects quickly and speed up courses of action which it feels necessary for the area.  In particular it will facilitate pump priming operations which could have a long term catalytic effect, especially for the youth of the area.</P>
    <P>I recommend the amendment to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for the very comprehensive analysis and assessment of the motion which he has obviously taken time to undertake. Although agreeing with much of what he says, I honestly feel that it is going to become clear that the Government are not doing enough and that what they are doing is not being done rapidly enough.  I do not want to be small or mean about this and it is fair to say that in recent times more attention has been paid to the inner city problem and to the urban problem generally than perhaps was the case hitherto. Nevertheless, the Minister has put his finger on a central problem in his concluding  <Col N="325" /> remarks.  The facts are that, while the Minister admits that it would be wrong to lay stress on one aspect of this multifaceted problem more than another or to the exclusion of another, there is no way in which that multifaceted approach can be taken in the context of the present structures of administration. That is the central problem we have. There is no co-ordination or no way of ensuring that the various agencies co-operate. There is no statutory interlinkage between them.</P>
      <P>What we have is a city in crisis.  It is a crisis on a number of fronts.  I do not wish to pedal the statistics of doom or gloom more than anyone else.  People outside of Dublin in many cases do not fully grasp the sheer enormity of the social, economic, cultural and educational problems that confront us. A recent report from AnCO on youth employment in north central Dublin showed what can only be considered as a shocking indictment of the job situation. Other areas of social and economic need probably do not need much highlighting.  The housing situation is far from satisfactory despite what the Minister says.  I predict, not with any jubilation but with sadness, a serious housing crisis in Dublin city in the near future.</P>
      <P>In the report on employment: &ldquo;52 per cent of respondents who had left school were employed and 48 per cent were unemployed&rdquo;. &ldquo;A more concentrated employment pattern emerged for females than for males&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The low wages of all the respondents was most marked.  A mere 3.4 per cent of both employed and unemployed either were or had been taking home over £30 a week&rdquo;.  Something like 96.6 per cent of people in this part of the city, whether they had jobs or not, could be said to be the victims of massive exploitation.  Their salaries and wages were less than £30 a week.  This report is last year's report.  We are not talking about 100 years ago or a generation ago.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;No unemployed female had taken home more than £20 a week compared with 20.7 per cent of employed females&rdquo;. There were other statistics including the fact that &ldquo;84 per cent of households live in flat accommodation either in blocks <Col N="326" /> or multidwelling buildings&rdquo;.  There were many other figures which clearly gave the lie to the confidence that some may have that the present local government structures are capable or competent in relation to tackling the problem.  We have a very complex, inter-related social and economic challenge of the most major kind.</P>
    <P>We have inadequate housing, inadequate numbers of jobs, woefully inadequate educational facilities, enormous traffic congestion and other related problems stemming from them, including disadvantaged health statistics and so on.  If we are to tackle these, and I ask the Minister to consider this seriously, we need a very bold and brave new approach.  Part of that approach must be the courageous and firm devolution of power to some local body such as a strengthened local government agency, Dublin Corporation or whatever, to tackle these needs in an integrated way.</P>
    <P>At present in the central city of Dublin, Dublin Corporation have a scheme of so-called redevelopment.  The Minister said that there were sites for 2,000 houses in the possession of the local authority in the inner city area of Dublin.  That is not factually correct.  I know what the Minister was thinking of. There is a statistic available from the local authority which says that within the city boundary there are sites for 2,000 houses.  Despite the apparent high figure involved we have to be temperate in our acclaim because the numbers of people on the housing list wanting to live in the city are in excess of 4,500 families. Even if we could magically convert the total land bank of the local authority overnight within the city boundary, not the inner city, we would not be able to house half the people who want to live in the city.</P>
    <P>We have a problem with regard to evacuation of the city.  This is complicated and tragically underlined by the fact that we have, depending on whose figures one likes to quote, a huge amount of derelict land.  A survey carried out by qualified students recently indicated that 9 per cent of the land surface in Dublin city is derelict.  That works out at a figure of over 2,000 acres, which is incredible. It is not so incredible when one <Col N="327" /> does a survey on it or when neither the local authority nor the Department of the Environment have up to date statistics on the numbers in the area or the owners of derelict sites.  There is an enormous wastage of resources because nobody cares that much and because the rights of private property can take precedence over the rights of the community. On the other hand there are people crying out for jobs, houses and facilities who are being inadequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>I do not have confidence in the way we are going about the problem, for a number of reasons.  The Minister referred to the inter-departmental committee's work on the inner city.  Whatever about the timing of the publication of that report&mdash;which was injudicious because it left itself open to the accused of being somewhat political in the light of the elections, although I do not subscribe to that&mdash;I acknowledge the good work which has gone into it.  When one reads the report and comes up against statements such as that accurate estimates of the numbers unemployed in the inner city are not available, one begins to worry.  In other words, we do not have an approach to the inner city problem and to the Dublin problem generally which has been regionalised.</P>
    <P>The Corporation's proposals for rebuilding houses in the inner city are doomed to fail.  It is sad to say that, because I am on one of the committees which is involved with this.  I do not see it being successful.  By that I mean successful in the creation of a comprehensive integrated environment for people which will be fully satisfactory, will not be vandalised and which will have adequate facilities for self-expression and self-fulfilment in all the social, cultural and economic areas.  It will not be successful because the Corporation have only responsibility for building houses and not for stopping traffic going through these places, for ensuring that children go to school, for ensuring that the kind of education they have is a mixture of informal and formal, because children are not going to formal schools, and for job creation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> We will have gleaming new houses and people who, for a variety of reasons, will not have an adequate number of jobs, the rate of school attendance which we would like them to have and so on. What I and my Party are arguing for and what policy documents produced by the Minister's party argued for is the definition of the city problem as being a lot more than one which can be tackled by the traditional parallel approach of various Government Departments which operate nationally.  The problems of Gweedore and Galway are far different from those of Gardiner Street.  They are not more or less important; they are different. They need a response which is able to deal with all fronts simultaneously if we want to redevelop parts of the city.</P>
    <P>At present, as a local authority, we do not have the powers to get involved in job creation which is essential.  I know the Minister will say we will talk to the IDA about it, but they do not have to deal with it with the same expedition, urgency or narrow focus which is essential if we are to tackle the problem satisfactorily.  The same teacher-pupil ratios are deemed to be appropriate, in large measure, in an area like this.  This is nonsense, because we should have a different approach to education here.</P>
    <P>I have argued before that the concept of hedge schools which served us in another century may be something which we should look at, not because we have many urban hedges&mdash;the quality of the greenery in the environment leaves something to be desired&mdash;but because we could have more success if we had teachers going into the community.  It is just a suggestion.  The TUI, ASTI and all other unions would have to talk to the Minister.  We must identify the problem. Their children do not go to traditional formal schools at present because they see them as alien to their understanding, something which their parents have done without and which, therefore, is not to their liking.</P>
    <P>But no, carry on.  The local authority are going to build houses and the Minister is going to spend £1 million in the context of the inner city group.  I do not wish to sound ungrateful and any help is to be welcomed, but the £1 million  <Col N="329" /> suggested is miniscule in relation to what is necessary.  Any money spent in this area of the city will be an investment, it will not be wasted.  At Question Time today I was discussing the Church Street area which has taken much abuse and slander.  I want the Members of this House to think seriously for a moment. We have in this complex of flats something of the order of 6,000 people. It is a very big small town in Ireland and does not have the most meagre facilities which the ordinary small town would have.  We have schools but we do not have the normal recreational outlets, the social care services, the cinemas, recreation rooms, community centres, even the Garda stations or the various social care facilities such as advisory services for mothers.  The whole area is bereft of those and is little more than a vast reservation containing large families.  We wonder then why some of the families do not live up to our expectations.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister meant well today when he was answering me, but one of his references related to the fact that prosecutions were pending of people who littered the place.  That is the kind of response, that, unfortunately, will not be heeded in an area like that, because the problem is not that sort of problem.  It is a human problem which has to be tackled on a number of fronts.  The urban challenge is huge, but there is sufficient goodwill for us to work together on this.  The approach that the Minister talks about is the beginning of something positive, but it is far more urgent than he suggested.  We need action on a number of fronts.  The reason why money spent here is an investment rather than a waste is that essentially the cost of allowing social malaise to destroy and decimate an area like this will be far higher.  The money which the Minister is about to commit&mdash;it is a long time being committed; it is about six months since I asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development how this money would be spent and he said that he was awaiting proposals and so forth, and up to now not one penny has been spent&mdash;is less than the cost of building a block of houses.  Maybe that comparison is not fair or valid, but where there is a political need the response is rapid enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> Part of the problem of the people in this area is that they do not vote as often or to as high a percentage as people do in other areas, and I am referring not to one election alone but to successive elections. Therefore, the tendency is for politicians to take a less serious view of their demands.  They do not rate as highly, and they are not as articulate or literate as people in other areas.  I do not wish to class all of them in this area as semi-illiterate, but they have not orchestrated their demands in the way which stronger lobbies have with admirable success in some regards.  These people here are to some extent like the Legion of the Lost.  No one listens to them and no one cares about them.  The way in which the mothers in these areas put up with the conditions is a marvel.  I do not know how so many fine children and citizens come out of such areas.  I would not be able to endure the conditions they are living in.</P>
    <P>If we continue to let the Department of Health deal with the health and social problems of the area without regard in any meaningful sense for the educational or housing problems of the area, we will not be successful.  Recently at my request and that of some agencies a conference was held by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare concerning one family.  This conference took over a year to organise, and we had to get the agencies together because the problem was so convoluted and integrated.  At present nobody accepts the responsibility. It is not that of the Department of the Environment, the Department of Justice or the Department of Health and Social Welfare.  Whose is it?  The crying need is for a structure of locally devolved Government to be able to say &ldquo;we will develop this area.  We will build houses in this place, we will put schools there, shopping here, a church somewhere else and do X there, and we will make all of them come true&rdquo;, instead of engaging in the itty-bitty planning that we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>We have a chance of learning from the experience of other cities.  The urban malaise is not peculiar to this country. The total population of this city could be lost in one of the boroughs of London. The problem in terms of logistics and <Col N="331" /> demographic size is not insuperable. With goodwill and a genuine identification of its real roots we can tackle it.  If we do not tackle this problem and give the people of this part of the city the birthright which is theirs, the children the opportunity for education and their fathers jobs, we will reap the whirlwind in due course.  This problem cannot fester on indefinitely, and it is getting worse.</P>
    <P>I say with the greatest respect that some of the proposals of the inter-Departmental committee are very cosmetic.  We are sick and tired of work experience programmes in the inner city. Give us work.  We are sick and tired of the identification of a place as a priority area.  What does that mean?  We have to grasp the nettle here and acknowledge that what we have been doing and the way we have being doing it are not good enough.  Give the power to some agency, who do not necessarily have to be the local authority but they are an example of who it could be.  Give responsibility to an officer of the IDA to work in conjunction with the local authority and the Eastern Health Board and make one body who can handle the various problems on all fronts.</P>
    <P>Take the traffic situation.  The city centre is riddled with continual transport day and night.  Trucks, lorries and cars trundle along these streets, and ten feet away through stained windows children can be seen trying to study often in overcrowded rooms, coping with the noise of traffic on the one hand and with the baby in the corner in the other. These children are not being cherished equally, but the local authority have no function in regard to the traffic passing by the window.  The local authority can build the roads but they have not statutory responsibility for so much as putting up a &ldquo;No entry&rdquo; sign.  They act in loose liaison with the Garda and the Department of Justice to effect certain traffic measures, but the traffic carries on regardless of the economic and human needs of the people in the area. The complexity of the problem would make some people wonder why they need bother, and they conclude that it <Col N="332" /> will go away in due course.  It will not. The way we have been doing things is unsatisfactory, and the evidence of that is ample.  There is constant evacuation from the city.  People are leaving it, not because they want to live outside the area, but because of the combination of psychological, economic and other types of pressure.  The housing is not in the city; the jobs are not in the city.  The quality of life in terms of environment, facilities and so on is not in the city.  Are we serious about ensuring the continuation of a living city?  The report from the inter-departmental committee says, and I quote from page 1:</P>
    <P>The general objective of inner city policy is seen by the committee as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a resident population in the inner city that is capable of sustaining itself, economically and socially.</P>
    <P>That is a very worthy objective which flies in the face of all present trends and all present investment.  There is a need for a massive commitment of resources if we are to bring about the sort of improvements that are necessary, not £1 million, which can allow for only a certain amount of cosmetics.  I do not say this disparagingly, because I am sure that move was made with goodwill. However, it will not make the slightest qualitative difference and very little quantitative difference.</P>
    <P>The areas in which we need progress to bring about the kind of changes we need are many and interrelated and the answer to the problems must be of the same nature: we must have an individual agency with power delegated to them by the Government to get the job done on all fronts.  That does not exist, and until it does we will have the same scattered, bureaucratic, loosely liaisoned, ineffective, drifting response which we now have, one agency not knowing what the other are doing.  The whole effort is being lost in gestures of goodwill by individual agencies but not knitting together in any meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems we have are massive, and they are gathering momentum. The position is in danger of remaining in its present state.  For instance, the <Col N="333" /> growth of population in the Dublin region from 1966 to 1971 was 57,200 people compared with 37,100 for the rest of the country.  While the Dublin population in 1971 constituted almost 30 per cent of the population of the rest of the State, the Dublin increase in the period 1966 to 1971 was 60 per cent of the total increase.  The population projection for 1991 on this basis for the Dublin area would be 1.15 million, an increase of 298,000 in 20 years.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that these figures do not take migration into Dublin into account.  If we are to create jobs for this vast number of people we will need a land bank of industrial land, because we are talking not only about enormous new housing and social needs but also the critical matter of providing jobs.  The labour force projections for the period 1971 to 1991 indicate that there will be an enormous increase in the need for job provision, far and away above our meagre estimates in our job targets, and we will not get the jobs if we carry on in the way we are.  The labour force, the portion of the population available for gainful occupation, is estimated to increase over the same period by 130,000.</P>
    <P>We had an average yearly increase in the labour force for the ten years to 1971 of 4,100.  For the following ten years the average increase in the labour force is estimated to be about 5,400 yearly, and in the ten years 1981 to 1991 the figure is estimated at 7,500.  It means a continually increasing number of people seeking jobs in the city, which has the highest percentage of jobless people in the State.  The horrific implications of this are not being dealt with by the Government.</P>
    <P>The demand for primary school places is likely to increase by 33,000 pupils to a total of 169,000 in the 20 years to 1991.  This should mean additional accommodation of 42 to 52 16-unit schools.  The amount of land required for this will depend to some extent on the number of units per school, but it is likely to be about 200 acres.  The increase in demand for post-primary education is estimated at 25,000 pupils, bringing the post-primary population to 89,000 pupils in 1991.  The estimated <Col N="334" /> number of post-primary schools needed is 25, requiring 390 acres.  However, the local authority for Dublin city and the IDA and the Eastern Health Board, and all the other agencies dabbling in the problem, have not been doing anything to ensure the provision of a land bank for schools.  Apparently that has been left to the hard-working clergy and some faith in an act of God.  Even the present educational structure is not succeeding.</P>
    <P>Right across the entire front we see a huge burden of responsibility, at the moment falling on the shoulders of this Government.  Based on the 1961 to 1971 trends, the projected number of jobs available in 1991 in Dublin will be 392,000.  The projected labour force on the basis already outlined will be 460,000.  Assuming the traditional pattern of full employment, which in some extraordinary way is 4 per cent unemployment, this would mean a total of 442,000 seeking employment, or a shortfall in jobs of some 50,000.  On the other hand, if the growth in employment was based on the slower rate of the 1966-71 period&mdash;and the evidence is that that is the case on which we should assume employment will grow&mdash;the 1991 shortfall for Dublin would be 75,000 jobs. That figure is based on natural population increase, without reference to immigration.</P>
    <P>If we take immigration into account we find an estimated need of another 64,000 jobs.  In other words, more than 139,000 jobs will be needed in Dublin before 1991 if we are even to maintain 4 per cent unemployment.  The mind boggles at such figures.  I do not think there is any conception in Government at the moment&mdash;I am not blaming the individuals involved&mdash;of what Dublin will be in ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>Therefore I appeal to the Minister, whose goodwill doubtlessly exists, to consider the setting up of one agency&mdash; call it an urban development unit&mdash; which will be composed of representatives of other bodies but which above all will have authority to act on all fronts, an agency which will be given that power by a Government with the wisdom and the courage to realise they do not need to hold on to all the power all the time.  If we do not get such an <Col N="335" /> agency the crisis city we now have will become worse.  I appeal to the Minister from the bottom of my heart to consider a radical restructuring of the set-up which cannot even identify the problems we have.  We want these problems strung together to ensure that the people of all of our cities will have the kind of standards we all wish for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister tonight which has been very encouraging, particularly in regard to the grant given for the reconstruction of Dublin's inner city.  I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the people who have worked in that area so well throughout the years such as the parochial and religious organisations. They worked there long before it became fashionable to do so.  Without their work that area would now be much worse.  I have often thought that we have failed to examine one of the major causes of the run-down of the north city in particular. This was caused because the port was moved east.  Therefore, areas around the North Wall which had a good source of employment on the dockside have not the same advantage.</P>
      <P>The whole structure of the port set-up has changed.  Some years ago a very simple system operated. When a boat berthed many men were needed to unload it and it took a couple of days to discharge the cargo.  Those ships berthed at the North Wall close to many centres of population, but when the port moved east the method of unloading changed. We now have a roll-on-roll-off system to the east of the port.  In fact, the British Railways depot is well out in the bay, like the B &amp; I depot.  That one major factor caused great changes in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same happened on the south side. If one walks in that area one will see many derelict buildings but very few ships.  That area will continue to decline because bigger ships will be built in future but there will not be the same readiness to berth at the port as those big ships will discharge at the new jetties to be erected in the bay.  If we are anxious to solve the problems of such areas <Col N="336" /> we must face the fact that dock labour has moved out of the area.  That was one of the prime causes of the decay.  We could not stop that development, but we must realise that the prosperity of the city depends to a great extent on the prosperity of the port.  In the next ten or 12 years we will be exporting about 80 per cent of our produce, but to do that we must have good port installations for the importation and exportation of goods.</P>
    <P>In recent years the word &ldquo;port&rdquo; became a dirty word and people became suspicious of the activities of the board responsible for the port.  For some reason or other they were blamed for having greedy eyes on many of the amenity areas around the port.  It is essential that the port should expand, but at the same time we must ensure that its expansion will not affect the amenities which the people of the area need.</P>
    <P>We should follow the example of the Japanese who have developed their ports but kept them beautiful.  There is no doubt that ports can be beautified with proper planning.  We must aim to build that port in such a way that it will be a thing of beauty as well as a thing of utility.  The fall in the amount of work at the docks meant a lowering of the standard of living of the families.  Those families did not leave that area very easily; they clung on to old houses in places like Gardiner Street and Summerhill.  We must accept that we are not the only people facing this problem.  In the London area adjacent to that port a great change has taken place as a result of the modernisation of the loading and discharging of cargo.</P>
    <P>We made one big mistake in trying to cure the ills of the inner city area without first trying to diagnose the main cause of the illness.  Great attention is being paid to the rebirth of those areas, but we must not view this as an experiment in social development.  We must realise that the people living there are no different to the rest of us and that they have been deprived for many years.  I made an effort to bring an industry to the port area on one occasion but people shouted at me that we had over-employment in Dublin.  We knew that was not correct because there were many people who <Col N="337" /> could not get employment.  Unemployment has been endemic in the port area for many years and if there is a high crime rate there the blame for that rests with society as well as with the people involved.  If any of us had to live there we would have a different view of the Establishment.</P>
    <P>The people in the inner city area are only too willing to join in a big drive to change the area and make it a place where people can live with a decent standard of living.  It must be remembered that the people who live there have been deprived for many years and that life can be very rough for the old.  While the Departments of the Environment and Education are involved it is my view that the Department of Health should also be involved.  It is tragic to see old people who are too old to be kept at home being sent off to a hospital or nursing home many miles away from the area.  The Department of Health should carry out an experiment by placing a home for senior citizens in the heart of that area. It should be properly laid out, with local people involved in the running of it.  If that happened senior citizens there would not have to suffer the trauma of being changed from an area where they have lived for up to 70 years to a hospital in another part of the city.</P>
    <P>We must make these areas selfsufficient, and show that it is not our intention simply to pull down old houses and re-erect new buildings.  We must not develop the area on a 19th century pattern but in a 20th century manner with people being the primary concern.  We must ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of those who planned the area many years ago.  The Wide Streets Commissioners did a good job on the main thoroughfares but not a very good job on the back streets.  Life can be very difficult for people living on those streets. The basic requirements are education, employment, proper housing and a deep commitment to show that we are in earnest about improving the area and are not getting involved in a cosmetic exercise.</P>
    <P>We must change the pattern there and give the people a guarantee that we will not just patch up the existing structures. Let us guarantee that any family wanting to remain in the area will be allowed  <Col N="338" /> to do so.  If a family wishes to move out, let us re-house them elsewhere.  Deputy Keating referred to the number of derelict sites in the city; there are too many of them, but these sites could be put to good use.  I hope the Minister will encourage local authority housing groups in the area and not leave it to the corporation to do the housing.</P>
    <P>In one part of the area, in the south side, there are clergy doing an excellent job with their own housing groups.  We could make available to them serviced sites where they could build houses for young families.  We have to bring people back into the area, while maintaining those already there.  People very often say that they remember the days when 80,000 people lived in an area and they say &ldquo;who lives there now?&rdquo;, but I certainly do not want a return to the conditions of eight families to a tenement house.  We are not going back to that. We should not be nostalgic about the past.  We should ensure that we have model new estates.  That is not going to be an easy task&mdash;in fact, the housing will be the easiest part of it.  People cannot live with just housing alone; they have to have employment, churches and schools, and everything that goes to make up a community.  I would mention again the fact that those who founded Dublin, whoever they were&mdash;Fir Bolg, Picts, that they settled there on the river&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They recognised how important that place was.  We, in this century, should recognise that the city of Dublin depends very much for its prosperity on the port of Dublin.  I would make a plea here; let us have proper planning between the Department of the Environment and the other Departments involved in the rejuvenation of the city, and then let the Port and Docks Board, the corporation and the local communities get together and discuss their various aims.  From this will come a blueprint for a much better Dublin, recognising that the port of Dublin must expand in a controlled way.  If we discuss it with the people who live around <Col N="339" /> the port they, with their genius, will solve this problem.  It would repay the whole lot of us in the city of Dublin.  It would convince people that we do care and that we are going to do a good job.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned the traffic problem.  It is a big problem and we must face the fact that a bold decision on it is necessary.  People often say if we adopt such a plan it will ruin the communities. Communities are being ruined at the moment with uncontrolled traffic.  It must be almost impossible to live in flat complexes with the thunderous traffic going by.  Let us have some real thinking on the traffic problem, in these areas especially. Let us remove the traffic from the residential areas there and make life more tolerable for the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to participate in this very important debate.  Inner city development and renewal are most important.  I am happy that, basically, we are in accord here on what we want, though we may have different points of view.  What is important is that we should have a firm and strong commitment from the Government.  We can put down these motions and the Government can put down amendments to them; we can say there is reasonably general agreement and we all go home happy that we have done our thing here in our Parliament. That is not enough.  There is too much talk about inner city renewal; it has become a fashionable thing to talk about and it is nice and cosy to get oneself involved in it.  However, the time has come when the Government of the day must give a firm financial commitment.  They talk in their amendment of something of <Col N="340" /> the order of £1 million.  Presumably that amount would be for setting up some sort of structure rather than for improving matters.  The kind of money we are talking about is vastly greater than £1 million.</P>
      <P>We must have some sort of five-year plan with regard to Dublin and this must be thought out.  One asks oneself is the local authority the agency to take on this particular job, or should we have a completely new look at it and get a highly powered development team?  This is not casting any reflection on the local authorities.  They are responsible for the major works, roads, sewage, and the whole area of of local government.  What we want here is a professionalised action team which would not have the constraint that local authorities have.  When local authorities want to do something, it is so open and so public that the people who want to make a quick buck move in behind their backs and buy, and often thwart sound development.</P>
      <P>The state of our city today leaves a lot to be desired.  In a lot of areas, it is nice and cosmetic, but when we take off the paint and powder, the stark reality is shown and there are a lot of things that we do not like&mdash;bad housing, bad education, run-down streets, inadequate transport, bad roads.  One of the worst features within this inner city is unemployment. It is the scourge of the inner city.  It is a malaise with which it is very hard to come to grips; we must examine our education and our attitude to better housing.  We have started on the task but it is moving at a pedestrian rate, far too slowly to meet the demands and the needs of communities that are dwindling slowly away.  The heart of any city is the communities.  They are the bedrock and when they become fragmented, it takes a generation or two to develop that kind of community again.</P>

    <P>We are all concerned about housing and I, for one, believe that we should be aiming at a mix.  The only way we can obtain a mix is by giving private developers an incentive and we can give them that incentive without really costing the exchequer anything.  It can be done through the tax mechanism, which is the proper way to do it.  One might say that that is money which will <Col N="341" /> be lost to the Exchequer but that might not have come in anyway.  To make progress, the local authority must develop one arm of the housing and the private side must develop the other. Because of the cost of serviced land in the inner city it is almost impossible for developers to build profitably, but obviously builders will get their price.  Some rather old small three-bedroomed houses in need of repair have sold for £40,000, £45,000 or £50,000 in Dublin.  Small schemes have been successfully built by builders who have made money but they have only scratched the surface.</P>
    <P>When we talk about inner city development we are talking about the people in the inner city and the quality of life in the inner city.  To improve the quality of life there, houses must be built by both the local authority and private builders.  If the local authority takes over completely they will create more problems eventually than they will solve. We need a good socio-economic mix which will uplift the society in the inner city areas.  The small shopkeepers, the publicans and so on who still operate in the city do not now live there so consequently there is not a good mixture in the society there.  There are major social problems in the inner city and these have manifested themselves in the fact that in three schools, for instance, about 56 per cent of the parents of the pupils are unemployed and there is no social mixing.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider the way in which we spend money in the inner city. We must consider what type of urban renewal we want and the quality of life necessary to bring back standards which have dropped.  There is vandalism and a breakdown of law and order in the city. Urgent remedial action is required to help the people in the inner city and obviously one way of improving the inner city is by improving housing.  There is a lot of substandard housing and colossal overcrowding in Dublin at the moment. There are a number of houses without the ordinary facilities of a bathroom and hot and cold water, houses that have a toilet in the rear yard.  That and the type of grants we are giving for any kind of development is derisory, and we do not meet the needs.</P>
    <P>If we were serious about this we <Col N="342" /> would not talk in terms of the money we are talking about.  I realise that money is scarce but if we invest it wisely in our people we will get a solid return for it. We tend to underrate the return we get from the money we invest in people.  For instance, the investment in education in the inner city is disgraceful.  If we look at the subvention that the ordinary young lad in a national school gets, and consider that in the suburbs a youngster goes from national level to second level and to third level, it will be clear that there is a gross anomaly in the type of money one section of the community gets as against what the other gets.  I realise that this does not come within the terms of reference of the Minister for the Environment, but the development of the inner city concerns a number of Departments. We must look at all the problems and we cannot divorce one from the other.  We must develop a team which will take action in relation to the inner city because at the moment the overlapping of Departments stifles action.</P>
    <P>We have said enough in this House over the last number of years but we have not done very much.  We are now at the stage where we are patronising one another and agreeing with one another but that is not enough any more and I cannot accept it any longer.  We must have a firm commitment.  The rapid rail system will have a major effect on the inner city and we have been dragging our feet in relation to it.  This system will enable people to come speedily to the inner city and will help in the development of a stronger shopping complex.  Any city needs that type of development and the only way we can get that is if people can come into town within 15 or 20 minutes instead of having to wait all day.  We are also dragging our feet in relation to the whole question of inner city housing.  The White Paper made it clear that the cost of inner city housing would be prohibitive.  Using the resources of the Departments concerned we should examine the infrastructure, the ready-made community, the churches, schools, libraries and so on. We have a number of economists but they never seem to cost the important factors in relation to inner city development.</P>

No appeal was made to me in connection with this notice.  As the notice was not complied with within the time specified, the corporation entered on the land in February 1979 to carry out the works required.  I also understand that at about the same time the site was enclosed by a low brick wall.  This latter work was presumably carried out by the owner.</P>
