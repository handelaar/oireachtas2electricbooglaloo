      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether he has been able to establish when he can expect to see the transcript of the Supreme Court decision in respect of the Commissioner Garvey case which the Tánaiste yesterday suggested was a pre-condition to the making of a Government statement on the position of having two Commissioners of the Garda at present?</P>

      <P>I should like to repeat that every matter a Deputy thinks of cannot be raised on the Order of Business.  I am appealing for co-operation in this matter.  I should like to take this opportunity to refute the statement made yesterday by some Deputies that if they ask about legislation in relation to a matter, anything can be raised. That does not in any way put in order a question on the Order of Business because if it were allowed one could ask a question about anything under the sun.</P>

    <Title>Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 (6) of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 (No. 17 of 1978), hereby confirms the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979 (S.I. No. 17 of 1979), made under Section 2 (5) of that Act.</P>
      <P>The Mergers Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 is such a recent enactment that I am sure I need not go into any great detail regarding its various provisions.  Deputies will no doubt recall the constructive level of debate we had in this House prior to the Act's passage into law.  A few brief words on the Act might, however, be useful at this stage.</P>
      <P>Section 2 applies the provisions of the Act to any merger or take-over where the gross assets of each of the enterprises involved exceeds £1¼ million or where the turnover of each exceeds £2½ million.  Any such proposed merger or take-over must, under section 5, be notified to the Minister.  The proposed merger is then either approved or referred for investigation to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  In the latter case, the Minister may, having considered the examiner's report and if he thinks that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, either clear the proposed merger or prohibit it either absolutely or except on conditions specified in the prohibiting order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may recall that a good deal of the discussion on the Act on Committee Stage in this House centred on section 2 (5).  That subsection allows the <Col N="1396" /> Minister, where he thinks that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, to declare by order that the Act applies to mergers of a particular class, despite the fact that the enterprises involved in a merger of that class may be below the qualifying assets or turnover &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; specified in section 2 (1).</P>
    <P>Deputies may also recall that during the debate in the House on section 2 (5), the use by the Minister of his powers under that subsection was discussed at some length.  The main instance mentioned where an order might be made was the newspaper sector.  It was agreed at the time that this would probably be one of the first areas which would be looked at under the section.  If I remember rightly, Deputy Kelly fully supported the making of a newspapers order.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Minister made an order on 25 January 1979 entitled, &ldquo;Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979&rdquo;.  While the order was effective from that date, it is nevertheless required under section 2 (6) of the Act to be confirmed by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days in each case.  The effect of the order is that any proposed merger or take-over, irrespective of the size of the enterprises involved where at least one of them is engaged in the printing or publication of newspapers should be notified to the Minister under section 5 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Such proposals would then be submitted to the tests of the Act and would be accordingly either approved immediately by the Minister or referred for more detailed investigation by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  As I have already indicated, this latter investigation would be followed either by a clearance, or absolute or conditional prohibition.  By virtue of the application of all of the machinery of the Act it will be recognised that there is a realisation that all proposed mergers in this area will not be prohibited.  It is accepted that there will be mergers which for various reasons it would be in the public interest to allow to proceed.  On the other hand it is essential that the Minister should have the necessary powers to allow him to act in cases where a proposal in this very <Col N="1397" /> sensitive sector would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to go into any great detail about the sensitivity of the newspaper sector.  Given its very responsible function of informing the public, the Government must be concerned to ensure that as wide as possible a variety of outlets for the public expression of opinion is preserved.  Conversely, I think the House will agree that generally it would be very undesirable to have the dispersal of views and opinions on matters of public importance vested in an ever-decreasing number of hands, whatever the reasons for this decrease might be.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that for the past number of years there has been an overall trend towards steadily increasing concentration of the press.  The evidence of this trend is that more newspapers are forming part of publishing groups controlling substantial proportions of total newspaper circulation.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the House will agree that it was right to make this order and that it will support the motion proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I warmly support this motion.  My recollection is that it was I who mentioned in the House that the newspaper world was one which cried out for control irrespective of the money size of the business in terms of assets or turn-over. In welcoming the motion I wish to put three points for the Minister's attention in the hope that she will bear them in mind and, perhaps, in respect of two of them, amend the form of the order now or at a more convenient time.  The criterion which the Minister mentioned is the same as I would have supported, the importance of preserving as wide a variety of opinion as possible and the accessibility for the public to as many different kinds of opinion as possible.  I agree that the process whereby newspapers would tend to become concentrated in an ever-smaller number of hands is an undesirable process nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems, looking back at the Act, that we were probably all at fault&mdash;I must <Col N="1398" /> carry my own share of that blame&mdash;in not drawing attention to the relative unsuitability of the criteria mentioned in the Schedule to the Act for the purpose which the Minister is now trying to effect. I did not make this point then.  The criteria mentioned in the Schedule to the Act entitled the examiner to consider the desirability of a merger against a set of different standards.  None of these is really appropriate to the standards which the examiner should have in his mind in connection with the proposed acquisition of newspapers.  The values which the Minister has given expression, with which I agree, namely the desirability of preserving as diverse a range of opinion as possible and the desirability of giving it as varied an expression as possible, do not fit comfortably into any of these criteria.  It is possible, by twisting words, that one could describe a newspaper as providing a service but it seems that it would be a reasonable interpretation of the expression, &ldquo;provision of service&rdquo;, to regard it as something more material than the provision of a range of opinions.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly criteria (b) to (h) do not have anything to do with the value to which the Minister has given expression. It is conceivable that one might squeeze the value the Minister has mentioned, and with which I agree, into criteria (i), namely the interests of the consumer. However, I can imagine an honest examiner taking the view that the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in its ordinary sense meant the consumer of material goods and that what he was being mainly asked to do was to guard against a monopoly which could, by making a corner, drive prices up and keep them up.  The consumer element mentioned in those criteria does not, naturally, include the consumer in the sense we are talking about, the potential recipient of opinions.  I make that point without rancour because it is just as much my fault as the Minister's for not having made sure that the Bill when it was going through the House was so drafted that it would comfortably accommodate the value of diversity of opinion.  It seems to me that the criteria mentioned in the Schedule do not comfortably or obviously include it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when replying, should <Col N="1399" /> at least informally tell the Dáil that it would be her intention, in the event of the examiner deciding that the criteria in the Schedule do not entitle him to take into account questions of diversity of opinion or questions reflected in the values which the Minister mentioned, to amend the Act in such a way as to make it clear that the criteria which would then be in the Schedule include the desirability of making sure that the range of opinions available to citizens is not curtailed by the acquisition of newspapers and that the value, which is mainly an issue here, is the value of diversity of opinion.  An honest examiner might find himself unable to extract that value from the criteria in the Schedule.  The Minister should look at that matter to see if she can give the Dáil the undertaking I have asked for.</P>
    <P>The other points I wish to make are, essentially, drafting ones.  I do not advance them contentiously but I should like the Minister to look at them and, perhaps, amend this order by a further order.  In my view the order is unnecessarily broad in its present drafting.  Article 3 of the order states:</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared that, notwithstanding section 2 (1) the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 (No. 17 of 1978), that Act shall apply to proposed mergers or take-overs of the following class, namely, proposed mergers or take-overs involving enterprises at least one of which is engaged in the printing or publication (or printing and publication) of one or more than one newspaper.</P>
    <P>It does not make it clear that what we are aiming to do is to prevent newspapers from being taken over.  As it stands this article would subject to scrutiny, quite unnecessarily, the take-over by a newspaper enterprise of an enterprise which had nothing to do with the formation of opinion or the expression of it but was quite a subsidiary thing, for example, a distribution enterprise.  When one looks at the definition of &ldquo;merger&rdquo; in the Act one finds that a merger is there defined as including a transaction involving enterprises one of which may be completely <Col N="1400" /> outside the State.  The control envisaged by the Act is engaged if even one of the enterprises involved is in the State. For example, suppose the Independent Group wished to acquire a distribution agency in the form of a company in the North of Ireland&mdash;that is not an impossible situation&mdash;they will be brought within the scrutiny, irrespective of the relative modesty of the distribution agency, of the Act by the wording of the order as it now stands.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to raise a scare about this and I know the Minister or the examiner will not behave unreasonably but the drafting of the order appears to be excessively broad in this regard.  There is no need to include transactions of that kind.  We are aiming to prevent the taking over and either extension of or excessive control of an organ of opinion which at present is independent.  In doing that the order appears to be casting a net over transactions of a different and completely innocuous kind.  I do not think that is what the Department intended, or if it is, it does not come through in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to make is that the definition of newspapers in the order could be improved.  Were I drafting the order from scratch I would do it differently. As it stands the newspaper is defined as a periodical consisting substantially of news and comment on current affairs.  There are provincial newspapers in which less acreage is devoted to news or current affairs than to advertising. There are also important little organs circulating in city suburbs which consist almost entirely of advertising but with a certain minimal content of news and comment of a local kind.  Politically, it is of an important kind.  Those papers are known as throw-aways and have a very large circulation.  One of those papers could not be said to consist substantially of news and comment on current affairs but, nonetheless, for the purposes we are speaking about they ought to qualify as a newspaper and be subjected to the same measure of scrutiny as the Minister intends for larger newspaper enterprises.  I would like to see this Act interpreted in such a way as to include throw-away journals which circulate in the Dublin suburbs and other <Col N="1401" /> places.  However, as article 2 of the order is drafted it appears that they are outside control.  It seems that it would be possible to take over a company which runs <i>Southside</i> or other throw-away publications while avoiding the control which the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is only in a humble way that one could describe a paper with local news and comment as an organ of opinion but it may be politically quite important.  I would have wished that take-overs of that kind would be just as much under control as take-overs of more regular newspapers.  That is apart from the question of whether some provincial newspapers in which the proportion of news and comment to advertising is small will automatically fall within the definition here.  With all modesty, I suggest that had I been drafting this article instead of saying, &ldquo;consisting substantially of news and comment&rdquo;, I would have said, &ldquo;containing a substantial proportion of news and comment&rdquo;.  I know that the phrase &ldquo;a substantial proportion&rdquo; is one about which lawyers could argue but there are precedents for holding that the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; means something which is other than nugatory, something which is other than minimal.  I may be raising an unnecessary scare but it would have been better to draft the article in such a way to make it clear that even a periodical which consists largely of advertising but had some news or comment ought to be just as much under control as the larger more regular newspaper enterprises.  I hope the Minister will take my remarks as being intended to be helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I recall, I raised in the House by way of oral question the attitude the Minister proposed to adopt at the time of the take-over of Sunday Newspapers Limited by the Independent Group.  The Minister of State who has introduced this order was answering questions then and was extremely forthcoming in reply to supplementaries. The Minister made clear her concern at the state of affairs and indicated that the Government, and her Department, were <Col N="1402" /> investigating the situation and that action would be taken in the reasonably near future on it.  I am sure that this order represents the action she was then contemplating and which the Department have thought appropriate.  This is a very necessary and positive step because for too long our attitude, especially the attitude of our public institutions such as the Oireachtas, to what the Constitution describes as the citizens' rightful liberty of expression, has been a neutral one. We have been slow to take positive steps to encourage and facilitate that rightful liberty of expression.  On some occasions we have been content to do nothing when we should have been taking action to protect that liberty when it was under threat.</P>
      <P>I make that statement in the knowledge of the fact that there is always a certain gulf fixed between the Oireachtas, in particular, and the newspapers which, among other institutions, embody this rightful liberty of expression. One might best describe it as being a relationship of armed neutrality and, having straddled both sides of that fence, I suspect that that is probably the right kind of attitude for us to have between each other.  At the same time I am sure that those who have the best interests of the newspaper industry at heart, and not just the best interests of that industry but the best interests of the people at heart, will welcome this as a positive step which has substantial good implications.</P>
      <P>The situation with which it is dealing is fairly readily described as one in which there is an increasing concentration of newspaper ownership in this country.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 January 1979 there is a report of a survey produced on behalf of the European Commission which stated:</P>
      <P>Newspaper publishing in Ireland is highly concentrated in terms of ownership, . . . . </P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the survey, carried out last year by a team of Irish consultants, says that while such an advanced degree of concentration would be seen as alarming in a large country like Britain or West Germany, it should not be so regarded in a small country like <Col N="1403" /> Ireland, or Denmark.</P>
    <P>Indeed the report says that if population is taken into account, there is less concentration in the smaller countries.  It points that the United Kingdom has a population 18 times that of Ireland, but has only six times as many morning newspapers, four times as many Sundays, 26 times as many evenings and 12 times as many weeklies.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph says:</P>
    <P>Newspaper publishing here, the report says, is dominated by the Independent Group, which has a 43% share of the morning paper market, a 42% share of the evening, and a 33% share of the Sunday market.  The Independent and the Irish Press Ltd. together have well over 50% of the total newspaper market.</P>
    <P>With all due respects to the authors of this report I cannot agree that the advanced degree of concentration which they discern in the Irish situation is not something that we should worry about on the basis of the fact that, comparatively speaking, we do rather better than the more densely populated countries.  The important reality here is not the relative position of press ownership in Ireland compared to other countries but the absolute position within our own borders, and that absolute has been deteriorating steadily over the past few years.  The take-over by Independent Newspapers of Sunday Newspapers Limited at a single stroke reduced the number of news sources here from six to five.  These five sources are RTE, which is controlled, sometimes I think despite the best efforts of the Government by the RTE Authority under the framework of the Broadcasting Acts, the Independent Group of Newspapers, <i>The Irish Press</i> Group, <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  We must not ignore the fact that the major group we are talking about here, the Irish Independent Group, quite apart from their holdings and their share of the national market, also have a large and increasing share of the provincial market.  Their share of the provincial <Col N="1404" /> market is concentrated in turn along the densely populated east coast from Dundalk to Wicklow and Wexford.  It is this combination of circumstances which creates the situation to which this order is addressing itself.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the structure of these enterprises, it is very plain to see that the ultimate decisions about the world that will be supplied to the readers of these national and local newspapers can be made by a very small group of people.  The <i>Cork Examiner</i> is controlled by one family: <i>The Irish Press</i> is controlled by a small group of shareholders, the <i>Irish Independent</i> Group is controlled by a small group of shareholders, and could quite conceivably be controlled by one individual, and <i>The Irish Times</i> Limited is controlled by a trust but like many enterprises of this kind is deeply indebted to banking institutions, and that also raises problems in connection with the independence and the ultimate survival of a free press here.</P>
    <P>Apart from the concentration of ownership, there is another aspect of the problem which I should mention very briefly, that is, the constraints which tend to make newspapers as institutions more rather than less vulnerable to threats of merger or takeover and to the creation of monopolies.  The National Prices Commission in their Monthly Report, July 1978, put the case for the special nature of newspapers very clearly. In paragraph 8.3 they said:</P>
    <P>The newspaper industry is fairly unique in that it must operate, to be free, entirely in the open market, or rather, in two markets, for, the newspaper depends on advertising as much as on direct sales.  It has collected its readership on the basis of its news service or its political line or its entertainment value and has then sold its audience onwards to a series of advertisers. . . .  The newspaper had therefore become economically an extremely delicate and complex phenomenon; a thing dependent on the narrowest of margins, sensitive to the mildest winds of change; an economic downturn in a given society causes a drop in advertising and a newspaper is thrown into sudden loss,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> That was a very sensible and straightforward statement of the situation as it affects newspapers.  I believe that while this instrument we are debating here today should be welcomed, the Government should be looking in terms of a positive assistance to the industry in the name of facilitating and encouraging what the Constitution calls rightful liberty or expression.</P>
    <P>In the issue of <i>Forum</i> published by the Council of Europe, No. 1-2/78 there is a very perceptive article on this theme by Claude Durieux, journalist with <i>Le Monde</i> who points out that in relation to France every year the Government give positive assistance to the press.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>This assistance takes various forms: preferential postal rates. . . . lower rates of VAT, tax exemption for up to 80% of the profits made by dailies in the form of investment allowances, subsidies to offset the rising costs of newsprint etc.</P>
    <P>As a result of this policy about 10,000 publications out of a total of just under 15,000 qualify for positive Government help of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the situation is almost the reverse.  If one looks across the spectrum of different European countries, one will find that between one thing and another, there are 14 possible ways in which Governments can positively strengthen the newspaper industry in order to avoid a diminution in the outlets for news and creative expression.  Of these 14 possible ways of providing positive help to newspapers, Ireland operates only one&mdash;training and research grants.  The time has surely come in the name of freedom of expression which is built into our Constitution not just to take fire brigade actions as are envisaged in this order, helpful though they may be, but to think in terms of positive help for an industry whose not only survival but development is essential for our democracy.</P>
    <P>It is important and it is serious that we should have only five national sources of news in this country.  The Government as well as trying to ensure that these sources of news should not be further reduced, should be adopting positive <Col N="1406" /> policies to ensure that there are more sources of national news.  The danger is that the trend is always towards monopolies.  We have already heard rumours of the possible involvement of newspaper interest in local radio stations, for example.  While appearing to add to the channels of information and communication to the public, this would only add further to the monopoly situation. This is not a matter which can be brought within the scope of this order because it refers specifically to newspapers. I would hope that if there is a development of local broadcasting the Minister would be very conscious of the danger of the extension of the monopolies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal.  The Minister deserves to be congratulated for a response to a situation, even though unfortunately one national source of news has already been absorbed into another. I trust that the Minister and her successors will operate this order conscientiously in the best interest of the community and of freedom of expression.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Kelly and Horgan for their warm welcome for the order and the motion before the House.  I do not think there is any need to comment further on the importance of ensuring the greatest possible freedom in the expression of public views and opinions.  It would be very undesirable if control of this matter were in the hands of an ever-decreasing number and that point has been reinforced by both Deputies who have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly raised the criteria which apply.  I would agree with him that criteria (a) and (i) could be taken as including the newspaper industry.  He said that consumers may not be regarded as the recipients of information given the the newspaper industry.  I would not entirely agree with that view.  In the event of the examiner finding that the order cannot be properly applied by virtue of the criteria already given in the Mergers and Monopolies Act, an amendment will be introduced if necessary.  The point was made that the scope of the order is <Col N="1407" /> too wide.  It was the intention that the scope would be wide but it is envisaged that take-overs and monopolies in the industry may be desirable for various reasons and it is not intended to prohibit them.  The main reason for making the order is to ensure that those which are not desirable should be fully examined and a decision made as a result of examination by the Minister or the examiner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also made the point that subjecting to scrutiny a newspaper being acquired by a non-newspaper enterprise was wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant it the other way around.  I was referring to a newspaper which acquires a distribution agency, maybe outside the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an acquisition could be just as unacceptable as a merger between two newspapers or two people involved in the newspaper industry because we are dealing with the question of concentration of ownership. The matter could be just as troublesome where newspapers are owned by a non-newspaper person or another part of the newspaper sector.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly made a very important point in connection with &ldquo;throw-away&rdquo; papers and we have them in the provinces as well as in Dublin.  They can be a very important part of the life of the people living in urban areas.  Most of these papers are delivered every week and we have no control over whether or not we receive them.  We are concerned in this order to control newspapers mainly concerned with the dispersal of news.  If a problem developed in relation to the type of newspaper Deputy Kelly mentioned, the matter would have to be examined and the necessary action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the genuine concern expressed by Deputy Horgan and I would agree with most of his remarks.  Some of his latter points might be more appropriate to another time and another debate, but they are points which are continually being examined within the Department with a view to ensuring the dispersal of news to as wide a number of <Col N="1408" /> people as possible.  I concur fully with Deputy Horgan's views in connection with the EEC survey and it was because of the very high level of concentration in the industry that this order was made.</P>
    <P>I express my sincere thanks to both Deputies for the welcome they have given.  All of us must be genuinely concerned to ensure that freedom of expression is given to all views and that as many people as possible are involved in the industry.  We should not allow the industry to be caught in the hands of a small number of people.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1979: Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the increases in the rates of social welfare payments announced in the budget and other changes in social welfare schemes.  The detailed provisions of the Bill are explained in some detail in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies with the text of the Bill but I would like to comment on them briefly here.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to maintaining the value of social welfare payments by increasing them regularly and bringing about, whenever possible, real improvements in the living standards of social welfare recipients.  This is evident in the level of increases in rates of payment provided in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year sees a departure from the pattern of a uniform percentage increase in all weekly rates of benefits.  People on long-term payments, such as retirement pensioners and old age pensioners, are generally regarded as requiring special attention in the social welfare context and the desirability of higher increases in their case will be readily conceded.  For that reason long-term payments are being <Col N="1409" /> increased by 16 per cent and short-term payments by 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>When related to the projected increase in the cost of living this year, the increases provided stand up fairly well. The increase in the consumer price index is probably running at present at around 8 to 9 per cent but it is projected in the budget statement to fall to 5 per cent towards the end of the year.  If this target is realised, the 12 per cent increase in short-term payments will provide a substantial real increase in the living standards of social welfare recipients while the 16 per cent increase in long-term payments will give a very worthwhile increase to the categories involved.</P>
    <P>Turning to the increases provided in individual payments, the maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being raised to £15.80 for persons aged under 80 years.  It will go up to £17 for persons aged 80 years or over.  The reduced rates of pension payable where weekly means exceed £6 are also being increased.  On this occasion, steps are being taken to ease an anomaly which is due to the application in recent years of uniform percentage increases to all reduced rates of pension.  This has resulted in a scale of pensions under which weekly pensions are reduced by £1.40 for every increase of £1 in means.  The Bill provides that, as a step towards achieving a scale where pensions will not be reduced by more than £1 a week for each £1 increase in means, the stages between rates will be reduced to £1.30 as from April.  As a result there will be two additional rates of pension in the table of rates, so that reduced rates of pension will be payable up to a means limit of £17.  For a pensioner with qualified children, of course, the means limit will be greater than £17.</P>
    <P>The maximum rate of payment in respect of an adult dependant under pensionable age is being increased to £7.85. Therefore, the overall maximum payment for a pensioner with a dependent spouse will be increased to £23.65 and where the pensioner is 80 years of age or over, to £24.85.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being increased <Col N="1410" /> to £8.80 and the addition to pension for a pensioner living alone will be raised to £1.30.</P>
    <P>The additions to pension payable to pensioners with qualified children are being raised to £4.25 a week for each of the first two children and to £3.20 a week for each other child.</P>
    <P>The new scale of weekly means and rates of pension is set out in Table A in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the increases in the rates of unemployment assistance.  The increase in the personal weekly rate of assistance will bring the maximum to £13.15 in urban areas and to £12.70 in rural areas.  The rates for adult dependants are being increased to £9.60 and £9.35 respectively and the rates for dependent children to £4.10 for each of the first two and £3.10 for others.  Thus, the rate of assistance for a married couple with two children is being increased to £30.95 in an urban area and to £30.25 in a rural area.</P>
    <P>Means for unemployment assistance purposes are, in the case of smallholders in certain areas, assessed notionally by reference to rateable land valuation. Where the valuation is £10 or less, the new rates of assistance will be as I have just outlined.  Those smallholders with valuations between £10 and £15 are currently in receipt of assistance at lower rates which are also being increased by 12 per cent.  Smallholders on the notional system of assessment whose valuations are between £15 and £20 did not benefit from budget increases in recent years and are currently in receipt of assistance at rates established in 1976. These rates, however, are also being increased by 12 per cent on this occasion and this involves the creation of an additional schedule of rates in section 3. Smallholders with valuations over £20 are, since 1977, not eligible to have their means assessed on the notional basis.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for a revision of the notional method of calculating farm means for unemployment assistance purposes in the case of smallholders resident in certain specified areas.  The White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo; indicated the Government's intention to introduce revisions of the scheme this <Col N="1411" /> year to take account of the increase in agricultural incomes since the scheme was last revised.  I believe that the changes provided in the Bill are reasonable in present circumstances, particularly as the increase of 12 per cent in unemployment assistance rates will, as I have said, affect all smallholder applicants for assistance.  At present, the national multipliers used to assess the annual income of smallholders covered by the scheme are £20 per £ land valuation where the valuation is £15 or less, and £30 per £1 valuation where the valuation is over £15 and up to £20.  The £20 multiplier has not been changed since its introduction in 1966 and the £30 multiplier is unchanged since 1976. Section 4 provides for the following increases in the multipliers from the beginning of April next.  For those with valuations of £10 or under, who number almost 13,000 of the 20,000 smallholders on notional assessment, the multiplier will be increased from £20 to £30.  For those with valuations over £10 and up to £15, of whom there are almost 5,000, the multiplier will be increased to £50 and for those with valuations over £15 the multiplier will be increased to £60 per £1 land valuation.</P>
    <P>Any smallholder covered by these provisions, who feels it would be to his advantage, may have his means assessed on the factual basis which applies to smallholders with valuations over £20 and to applicants generally.  In that case he would be eligible to receive the current rate of payment appropriate to his means as factually assessed.  The provisions of section 5 of the Bill will give the option of factual assessment in these cases.</P>
    <P>Increases in all rates of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are provided in sections 6 and 9 of the Bill, the maximum weekly personal rate of widows' non-contributory pension being increased to £15.80 and the amount for each qualified child to £5.20. As in the case of non-contributory old age pension, provision is being made for uniform reductions of £1.30 in pension for each £1 increase in means which will mean that reduced rates of pension will be payable where weekly means do not <Col N="1412" /> exceed £17.  Where the widow has qualified children higher means limits apply.  The changes in widows' pensions automatically apply to the social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>The allowances for single women aged between 58 and 66 are being increased by 16 per cent in section 10 of the Bill, bringing the maximum to £13.65.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 the rates of supplementary welfare allowances are being increased to maintain the parity between the rates of supplementary welfare allowance and the rural rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases in children's allowances are provided in section 19 of the Bill.  The monthly allowance for the first child is increased by 52 per cent to £3.50, for the second child by 34 per cent to £5.50, and for the third and each subsequent child by 13.4 per cent to £5.50.  For a two child family the overall increase will thus be 41 per cent, a four child family will gain 24 per cent and a six child family 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>When the Government decided to reduce the food subsidies, they recognised that this step would seriously affect the household budgets of social welfare recipients and lower paid workers.  We were anxious that the effect on this section of the community should be cushioned to the greatest extent possible. As an interim measure, compensation was given to persons in receipt of assistance payments by an adjustment in the value of the EEC butter scheme vouchers.  Children's allowances, however, offer the best mechanism to offset the effects of the reduction in subsidies for the majority of families with lower incomes.  These allowances have not been increased for some time and were in need of adjustment anyway.  The increases now provided should help to ease the burden of increasing costs for social welfare recipients and lower income families.</P>
    <P>Because the reduction in food subsidies took effect from 1 January, the Government were anxious to bring these increases in children's allowances into operation from the earliest possible date. The increases will, therefore, take effect <Col N="1413" /> from 1 April, not 1 July as has been the practice on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>I now come to the increases in the rates of contributory benefits and pensions under the social insurance system which are set out in section 20 of the Bill.  The increase in disability and unemployment benefit is to £16.05 in the personal rate and to £10.45 in the rate for an adult dependant.  Allowances for children with these benefits are being increased to £4.65 for each of the first two children and to £3.80 for each other child.  Maternity allowance is also being increased to £16.05.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of invalidity pension, which is a long-term payment, is being increased to £16.65 with an addition of £10.85 for an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of contributory old age and retirement pensions for persons under age 80 go up to £18.60 and, for those over 80, to £20.00.  The addition to pension for an adult dependant is being raised to £11.90 where the adult dependant is under pensionable age and to £14.05 where the adult dependant is aged 66 or over.  Therefore, a married couple both over pensionable age will get £32.65 as compared with £28.15 at present and, if the pensioner is aged 80 or over, £34.05 as compared with £29.15 at present.</P>
    <P>In the case of widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit, the new personal rate will be £17.00 for those under age 80.  This amount is raised to £18.25 for those aged 80 or over.</P>
    <P>The additions to widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit for qualified children are being raised to £5.70 for each child.  A widow or deserted wife with four qualified children will now get £39.80 as compared with £34.20 at present.  In the case of other social insurance pensions, the new additions for child dependants will be £4.80 for each of the first two children and £3.95 for each other child.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system the Bill provides in section 25 and 26 for corresponding increases in the rates of benefit payable under the occupational injuries scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> Again this year the Government are availing of this legislation to effect a number of improvements generally in the standard of the social welfare services. Improvements of this nature, while they do not attract the same degree of attention as the general increase in rates of payments, are, nevertheless, well worth while because of the benefit or alleviation they bring to individuals or small groups of persons.  The most significant of these, in terms of the cost involved, is the provision in section 22 extending to 312 days the maximum period of payment of unemployment benefit to married women who are now limited to 156 days.  In 1978, provision was made for the removal of the special conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance by single women and widows. The present provision represents a considerable further step towards the elimination of discrimination against women and the progressive achievement of equality of treatment between men and women in the social security field to which the Government are committed.</P>
    <P>In keeping the system under continual review, the need for improvements comes to light from time to time.  Two further improvements in social insurance schemes which appear to me desirable and which were announced in the budget are included in this Bill.  The first of these involves an improvement in the maternity allowance scheme and is provided for in section 23.  Maternity Allowance is payable at present to a women for six weeks prior to the expected date of confinement and for six weeks thereafter. Where the birth of a child occurs prematurely, the mother loses the unexpired portion of the six weeks' payment prior to the expected date of confinement. Section 23 provides that the allowance will in future be paid in all cases for a minimum period of 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>The second improvement concerns the position of a deserted wife who becomes widowed while in receipt of deserted wife's benefit.  While the contribution conditions for widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit are the same, the dates on which these conditions must be satisfied are different&mdash;the date of desertion in one case and the date of the husband's death <Col N="1415" /> in the other.  It is possible, therefore, that a deserted wife, though in receipt of deserted wife's benefit, would fail to qualify for widow's contributory pension on her husband's death, if his insurance diminished after he deserted her.  Section 24 of the Bill provides that such a woman will automatically be entitled to widow's (contributory) pension, whether or not the contribution conditions are satisfied in her case.</P>
    <P>On the social assistance side the Bill provides for a considerable number of improvements in addition to the increases in rates.  The need for many of these changes has been shown by the examination carried out into the possibility of removing anomalies and inequities in the means test and by analysis of complaints received during the year.  I have already referred to the steps being taken to remove the anomaly whereby social assistance payments are reduced by more than £1 for every £1 increase in means over a certain limit.</P>
    <P>Another change is in section 7 of the Bill.  This deals with the unsatisfactory situation which exists at present in that widows with non-contributory pensions may have their pensions reduced when they reach old age pension age.  This is due to the fact that there is more favourable treatment of income from capital in the case of a widow's pension than for old age pension and a widow with savings may thus suffer a reduction when she transfers to the old age pension. This is an obvious source of hardship to any widow so affected.  The position is now being rectified by allowing a widow to continue to retain her widow's non-contributory pension after she reaches 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>Other changes are in sections 13 and 14.  These provide for an increase to £200 in the amount to be disregarded in assessing income from capital for means test purposes.  The present amounts which may be disregarded are £25 in the case of old age pensions and £100 in the case of widows' pensions and equivalent allowances.</P>
    <P>Again, section 15 will ensure that any unearned income of a child, such as income from a trust, a portion of which is at present assessed in determining a <Col N="1416" /> widow's means, will no longer be so assessed.</P>
    <P>Under section 16 the amount of a person's earnings which is disregarded as means where there are qualified children will be increased to a uniform £104 for each child from £39 in the case of an old age pensioner and £78 in the case of a widow.  The section also provides for the adoption of a uniform definition of earnings for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There is a provision, at present, whereby old age and widow pensioners do not suffer an overall reduction of income when other statutory pensions to which they are entitled are increased. This provision, which applies only to pensions payable under statute or by another Government, is being extended by section 17 of the Bill to embrace any occupational pension to which the pensioner is entitled.</P>
    <P>In assessing means in future, dwelling houses and farm buildings, which are at present assessable, will be disregarded, by virtue of section 18 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from these improvements related to means tests, there are also certain other provisions relating to the social assistance schemes in the Bill.  The main one of these relates to the scheme of prisoner's wife's allowance.  Under present legislation the allowance ceases to be payable immediately the husband is released from prison.  Released prisoners often find it difficult enough to adjust to freedom and normal living without having the added problem of an immediate financial crisis in the home.  I think it desirable to help the prisoner to rehabilitate himself in a stable home environment by easing this immediate problem.  I am providing in section 8 of this Bill, therefore, that prisoner's wife's allowance will continue to be paid for four weeks after the prisoner's release.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 27 of the Bill is designed to alleviate the effects of an existing provision which can be a source of considerable hardship to old age pensioners in certain instances.  This is the provision affecting old age pensioners only which requires a pensioner to repay any pension overpaid as a result of a failure on his part to notify in due time an increase in his means.  Such failure may be due to oversight or lack of <Col N="1417" /> knowledge on the part of the pensioner and the requirement to repay, which is mandatory, can cause hardship.  Section 27 will enable the Minister for Social Welfare to exercise discretion in dealing with the question of overpayment of pension in such cases.</P>
    <P>The overall cost in 1979 of the rates increases and other improvements being provided for following the budget is £65.7 million.  Of this, social assistance accounts for £33.7 million, all of which is borne by the Exchequer.  The total cost on the social insurance side is £32 million and this must be met out of the Social Insurance Fund which is financed by contributions from employers and employees with an annual subvention from the Exchequer.  The Exchequer will meet an estimated £6.4 million of this extra cost leaving £25.6 million to be borne by contributions.  A new system of fully pay-related contributions will, under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978, commence in April next and the cost to contributors of the social insurance improvements in this Bill will be met from these contributions.</P>
    <P>I have now outlined the areas of improvements provided for in this Bill.  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill represent an improvement in the position of social welfare recipients and a further advance in the development of the social welfare services.  I, therefore, commend the Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>The most depressing aspect of the Government's policy since their return to power has been the consistent departure from the concept of trying to achieve social justice and towards the notion that the strongest do best.  Recently at Question Time the present Minister wondered why virtually everybody was on strike or in dispute with the Government.  He asked if the House knew of anybody who was not on strike and it was difficult to answer that question.  The trend towards encouraging the idea that the strongest do best has been central to the thinking of the Government since they published their manifesto in 1977.  The manifesto can only be described as being designed to <Col N="1418" /> foster the notion that money was to be had from the State provided one was big enough, vocal enough and exerted enough electoral muscle.  From that time that trend has been evident and is embodied in the White Paper with its extraordinarily defensive paragraphs on social matters, its paranoiac obsession with clamping down on social welfare offenders and its suggestion in relation to taxing social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>That lack of understanding has also been carried through into both the publication of the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare for 1979 and the approach adopted in the budget to the entire social field.  The Estimates published by the Minister's Department envisaged a cut-back in the total amount of unemployment assistance during 1979 on the debatable claim that so many more people would be employed that the total number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in the course of the full year would mean that a lesser amount would need to be paid by way of unemployment assistance. It could equally be argued that the cut-back was there, leaving a total budget to be spent following the most rigorous examination of claims for unemployment assistance in an effort to force people off the live register.  Many of us have been given first-hand examples of officers of the Minister's Department carrying out the most stringent examination of an applicant's means in a manner which has not been carried out for many years.  I can only suggest that the concept of cutting back on the weakest section of the community is one that has been consistent in the thinking of the Government since they came to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their first budget, the Government adopted the uncaring lazy approach of merely giving a 10 per cent increase to all social welfare recipients.  At the time that increase was criticised by my party as being inadequate and destined to ensure that the elderly, the infirm and the sick fell further behind in their struggle against poverty.  That approach was then compounded by the refusal of the Government to introduce an autumn increase in social welfare allowances, as had been the custom of the previous <Col N="1419" /> Government.  In the context of that mere 10 per cent increase to social welfare recipients in 1978, it should also be remembered that they are the very class of people who were not destined or intended to benefit from the cash handouts provided for in the Government's election manifesto.  It was highly unlikely they could have benefited from the abolition of car tax, domestic rates or from the now obviously illusory increase in grants for new houses.  They were not that class of people.  They did not own cars or houses and they were not in a position to buy houses.  Any sort of short-term benefits by way of cash in their pockets that the election promises held out for other sections of the community did not apply to social welfare or social assistance beneficiaries.  There was an inadequate increase for them in the 1978 budget but more important there was a refusal to carry out a review of real standards of living by comparison with the situation in June 1977.</P>
    <P>Consequently, from mid-1977 Fianna Fáil have been sowing the seeds and fostering the concept of class division, of encouraging the strong, the organised, to exert their muscle at the expense of the weak, the elderly, the poor.  Now in our society a very regrettable trend is being developed, the casting of the rural dweller against the urban dweller.  Can the Minister fairly say that the policies in the manifesto and the attitude of his Government since assuming office have not helped to nurture that concept?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that between us we have made the point.  It is regrettable that the Irish values of neighbourliness, care of the aged, caring for and assisting the less well off, should be eroded by no less an agency than the Government, to such an extent that the 1978 Green Paper could refer to the health, education and social welfare areas as being non-productive and therefore not only to be denied any substantial improvements but to be reduced in priority, to be subject to regular financial scrutiny and restriction.</P>
      <P>There is a simple electoral lesson to be learned from this, and it has been followed in the most callous way by the Government: the poor are unorganised; they are not a powerful electoral lobby, they do not possess any real bargaining power and being the weakest section, they are the easiest to ignore.  If difficult options have to be faced, they are the section to be discriminated against.  That is why I have referred to the organised sections, those who have electoral muscle, who have bargaining power, who can force Governments to back down from stated budgetary policy.  It is unlikely that the recipients of old age non-contributory pensions, that the widow with her mite, the deserted wife or the prisoner's wife, will band together and be successful in achieving the débâcle we have seen since the budget.  The weaker have not the ability to force a frightened Government to mend their hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it was too much to expect that the party who held out golden carrots to those who already had the silver spoons in their mouths during the 1977 election campaign and who subsequently set about dismantling the taxation structure designed to spread the tax load more evenly, would place the improvement of the lot of the underprivileged as a priority, but the frightening part is the manner in which the Government have neglected to maintain existing services.  I have spoken of the position of social <Col N="1421" /> welfare beneficiaries during 1978, of the fact that their position has been disimproved radically <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sections of the community, particularly in the second half of 1977 and throughout 1978.</P>
    <P>However, apparently our criticism of the across-the-board 10 per cent increase of 1978 has been heeded and the Government, in an effort to head off further criticism, have decided to introduce two separate rates of increase, 12 per cent for short-term beneficiaries and 16 per cent for pensioners.  That may sound fairly good, and indeed the Minister said early in his speech:</P>
    <P>When related to the projected increase in the cost of living this year, the increases provided stand up fairly well.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister for Social Welfare can have felt very proud of his achievement in this Bill, or that of the Government, when the best he can say is that they stand up fairly well.</P>
    <P>The amount payable in unemployment assistance or in single women's allowances comes to less than £2 per day. I made the point here some months ago that lunch here costs £2.50, and dinner costs more.  The increases given in this Bill &ldquo;stand up fairly well&rdquo; when they give an elderly woman less than £2 per day for food, clothing, lighting, heating and rent.  The non-contributory old age pensioner will get £2.25 per day, less than the price of a single lunch here.  Of course if such a beneficiary has a child she will be paid 74p per day to pay for total outgoings in respect of that child.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is quite clear that the increases of 12 and 16 per cent are hopelessly inadequate, that they will not be sufficient to match the rise in the cost of living between 1978 and 1979. Figures published recently showed that the increase granted to the average industrial worker in the private sector in 1978 was between 16 and 18 per cent. Social welfare beneficiaries got 10 per cent, and what happened at the end of 1978?  The Government decided to remove food subsidies, which is to the detriment of all sections but militates <Col N="1422" /> most against the weakest and the poorest.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that changes in the method of assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance&mdash;changes which do not stand up fairly well especially in the designated counties&mdash;were not outlined at all in the budget but are outlined now with the publication of this Bill and in a speech which the Minister made recently in this House.  In those designated counties smallholders who have a valuation under £10 for their total property&mdash;who are not men of means, we all agree&mdash;are going to have the method of assessment of their means, the multiplier, increased by £10 from £20 per £1 valuation to £30.  The smallholder with property between £10 and £15 valuation is going to have his multiplier increased by £20 from £30 to £50, and the smallholder on valuation between £15 and £20 will also see an increase of £20 in his multiplier from £40 to £60.  On Thursday, 1 March the Minister revealed that that will mean that 2,000 people in those designated counties&mdash;and the only reason why they are so designated is that in living standards they are by far the poorest counties&mdash;are going to lose the smallholders' assistance completely.</P>

      <P>By no standard can these people in those areas be described as anything but poor, yet they are the people who have had the greatest amount of attention in respect of investigation by officers, according to my colleagues in those constituencies, and now in respect of the sweeping changes being introduced in the percentage increase of the multiplier being applied to the valuation of their property.  Also it is not at all clear yet that they will not end up on 1 May being asked to pay the 2 per cent levy as well.  Yet the Minister says that the provisions stand up fairly well.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the situation in relation to the increases in children's allowances which the Minister dealt with at some length.  He said that substantial increases in children's allowances are provided in section 19 of the Bill, and he went on to set out what they were in cash terms. Because the Social Welfare Bill can be introduced in the House separately from the Finance Bill the House is invited to speak in the unreality of the cash increase for children's allowances while apparently being invited to forget that there is also a rejigging of the taxation allowance given to the ordinary worker. What is the real effect of the increase in children's allowances on the ordinary worker paying tax?  The real effect is an increase of 13p per week for the first child, not 52 per cent as the Minister said.  There is an increase of 17.5p per week in respect of the second child and&mdash;the Minister failed to mention this&mdash;an increase of one new farthing per week in respect of the third and subsequent children.  This year of 1979 has been designated the International Year of the Child.  It is a year that this Government choose to introduce the farthing per week on children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome certain small items in the Bill, particularly in those areas where changes have been brought about on <Col N="1424" /> foot of matters raised by us here constantly over the last two years.  The system whereby a widow's pension could be reduced because she had arrived at qualifying age for old age pension purposes and there was a different method of assessment of capital employed was clearly iniquitous and in need of change.  That that change is being brought about by sections 6 and 7 of the Bill is certainly welcome, as is the provision whereby prisoners' wives will be paid their allowance for four weeks after the release of their husbands.  There are also worthwhile provisions in sections 13 to 17 of the Bill in relation to minor amendments.  We have been constantly complaining that married women are paid unemployment benefit for a total maximum period of only 156 days, or half the period that it is paid to other persons.  That inequity has at last been acknowledged and section 22 of the Bill has brought about the desired change. The provision in section 23 for the payment of the 12-week maternity allowance to women irrespective of the time of their confinement is well worth while, but I have a question to ask about this.  This came to light because of various complaints voiced by me and other Deputies.  Is there now to be an adjustment in regard to the relatively small number of women who have been discriminated against over the course of the last year or so, and will they now be paid in respect of the weeks for which they were previously refused payment?</P>
    <P>The matters that have been attended to are of a minor nature, annoying and unfair to the people involved, with the possible exception of the increase in the period of eligibility for married women. There are a great deal of other major items in the social welfare field which still have not been attended to or have not received the attention that they deserve.  On the day that the Minister quoted the figures in relation to those who would be removed from the smallholders' assistance allowance he told the House that there was a total of over 100,000 people eligible for dental treatment on the waiting list at present.  I quote from the Official Report, column 595, Volume 312:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> . . . .  58,343 national school and preschool children awaiting routine dental treatment and 10,159 awaiting orthodontic treatment. . . .  The number of other patients awaiting dental treatment on that date was 35,675.</P>
    <P>These figures relate to people with present entitlement irrespective of the dependence of insured persons who have no entitlement at present.  There has been no attempt to improve that situation in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt to recast or rejig the creaking, inefficient and unfair cheap fuel scheme that has operated&mdash;or, like so many of the public services in the last year, not operated or operated merely in an intermittent fashion&mdash;to the detriment of so many elderly and poor people who are entitled to cheap fuel.  Despite all the promises there is no change in that situation. There was not in 1978 the introduction of a uniform scheme for the country in anticipation of the winter of 1978-79, which turned out to be the harshest for many years.  There is no attempt in this Bill to do anything about that situation for next year.</P>
    <P>The people who fare best under the social welfare code are, as the Minister was at pains to point out, the contributory old age pension couple who will now receive £32.65 a week.  We know from other figures that the average industrial worker is now earning between £80 and £90 a week and he is destined to get increases of an undefinable amount during 1979.  It is becoming more and more evident that there is very little point in different Governments coming in here and praising themselves for giving 35p extra a week to one class and 47½p extra a week to another class when the total amount of payment which those people get still bears very little relationship to the average working wage or the average cost of living of a family.</P>
    <P>There is a real need by whatever Government are in power to relate the amount of pensions, assistance and benefit payable to the cost of living of <Col N="1426" /> the average family.  This would mean that as that cost of living and that average industrial wage moves as the consumer price index moves so also should the level of benefits move.  There is no evidence that there is any thinking along those lines by the Government. There is evidence that they are prepared to concede to those who are strongest, most vocal and best organised.  They are only prepared to give the minimum possible, as grudgingly as possible, to those who are least organised, are not vocal, who have not muscle but who need it most.  Nobody in the House can put any other interpretation on it.  The people who most need increases of an unusual nature are the people who have suffered through the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>When I looked at this situation recently I felt that it was as if the Catholic bishops had never published their pastoral on social justice, as if the statements of bodies like the Association of Social Workers, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Alone organisation, the rather lonely voice of a man like Bishop Cathal Daly, had never been heard, when one relates all of those things said on behalf of people who cannot speak for themselves to the approach which the Government adopted to the entire social welfare field, cutting back on the total amounts available for unemployment assistance, re-jigging in a savage way the multiplier and the size of the valuation for the smallholders in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>The other political parties in the House have a special duty to defend the rights and to speak up in favour of the underprivileged.  I give notice to the Minister, the Government and all others who may have an interest that the Fine Gael Party will assume the task, as an organised group within parliament, on behalf of those who have no pressure group to put their case or no union to represent them, who have no powerful lobbying voice to convince Fianna Fáil that they are electorally a desirable group to woo.  We assume the task of speaking on behalf of those who have not the voice to speak for themselves.  It is important for the evolution of our society that there should be a strong and <Col N="1427" /> constant parliamentary watchdog on behalf of the poor.</P>
    <P>I outlined at the beginning of my contribution how social welfare beneficiaries fell behind during 1978 as a result of their treatment in last year's budget. That worsening of their position, combined with the abolition of the food subsidies and the need to adequately compensate them against whatever rise in the cost of living occurs during 1979 would have meant that there should have been a radical change, an increase of an unusual nature for 1979 in the budgetary policy if social welfare beneficiaries were merely to return to the relative position they held in 1977.  If the Government had a real commitment to social justice there should have been as well a desire to improve in real terms the lot of those people.  I see no evidence of that in the thinking of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence, when we look at the Green Paper, the White Paper, the Minister's speech on the budget, the various flights of fancy of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, that the Government have any real desire to improve the lot of the social welfare recipients.  We are not prepared to stand by and see the face of Irish society change to an unheeding one, through the lack of concern on the part of the Government.  I believe there is a need to develop this country as a caring society, that the policy of trickle economics, so often enunciated by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, a policy which was dear to the heart of the Minister for Social Welfare when he occupied other portfolios, will not work when that trickle has dried up long before it reaches as far as the less well off.  The old theory that a rising tide will lift all boats is not true.  It certainly is not true if some of those boats are already damaged, neglected and uncared for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always the first to pay tribute when I see substantial improvements in social welfare benefits. When I gave a cursory glance at the benefits announced in the budget I was deluded into thinking that at last we were making some headway on the road <Col N="1428" /> to ending inequality in our society. When I examined the benefits given very closely, I came to the conclusion that we are trying to delude this section of the community that we are providing for them and caring for them.  I have no hesitation in saying that the emphasis now is all on economic growth and we are paying lip service to helping the underprivileged sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The benefits announced in the budget and in this Bill are farcical because one major section, the underprivileged, those on social welfare, have been dealt a very serious blow by the removal of the food subsidies and there was no provision made to compensate them in the vital three months before the social welfare increases come into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people have been very shabbily treated in those months by the very substantial increase in the cost of living and because they were not compensated in time.  The budget and this Bill have failed to narrow the ever-widening gap in living standards between social welfare recipients and the rest of the community.  We must rid ourselves of the notion that social welfare recipients are parasites who are evading their obligations to society.  Are old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives, the people who cannot find work, the handicapped and the disabled defrauding the State?  These people and their families are the lower income groups and the underprivileged and they are being put under the stigma of being parasites.  About 40 per cent of social welfare spending goes out in pensions. The people receiving this money are entitled to their share; they are not parasites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government policy places all the emphasis on economic growth but there is no commitment to the underprivileged and the social welfare recipients sharing in this economic growth.  There is an economic plan, but no social plan.  There <Col N="1429" /> is no evidence that social welfare benefits have kept in line with the cost of living.  The increased benefits are not the great leap forward claimed by the Government.  Inflation for 1979, as estimated by the ESRI, is 11 per cent and it may go higher during the period April 1979 to April 1980.  In that case, the short-term recipients of social welfare benefits will incur a drop in their living standards and there will be little or no change in the living standards of long-term recipients.  In the year ending April 1979 social welfare benefits will have increased by 10 per cent, which is likely to be less than the rate of inflation for the year, indicating a further drop in living standards in the past year for social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>For some inexplicable reason when we talk about social welfare recipients we think of the unemployed who do not bother to work.  We should think of the pensioners, the widows, the deserted wives, the disabled and the handicapped who have also suffered a drop in their incomes in 1979.  While they suffered a drop in their living standards wage increases of 17 per cent occurred, so that the social welfare recipients dropped further behind.  Social welfare recipients are being stigmatised as being parasites. We are being encouraged because of this stigma to believe that we should not only maintain the gap in living standards but that we should widen it.  I condemn this attitude.</P>
    <P>The social welfare policy of the Government is a policy of benign neglect.  They pay lip-service to meeting the needs of the social welfare classes but refuse to bring their living standards into line with the rest of the community. If the Government had a serious commitment to the underprivileged they would link the social welfare increases to the rises in the average industrial earnings. If the Government did that we could not argue against it.  It would be obvious that the underprivileged were getting their fair share of the rise in GNP and the Government would be making a serious attempt to eliminate poverty.  No matter what the Minister says about increases in children's allowances or in unemployment benefit and so on, it is of no <Col N="1430" /> use unless the increases are linked to the increases in the average industrial earnings. If this is not done it shows that the Government do not give a damn about the poorer sections.</P>

      <P>It is more difficult for a married woman than for a married man to qualify for unemployment assistance. It is also more difficult for married women to qualify for increases in benefits in respect of dependants in the case of all benefits.  In addition, married women with children are being automatically disqualified for unemployment benefit.  What measures has the Minister taken since he gave me an assurance that he would introduce what I suggested in the appeals system to ensure that there was no discrimination against women?  The EEC directive will cost £30 million or £35 million to implement, so where is the commitment in the budget to ending discrimination against women?  Why should it take six years? Are women's social rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing personal against the Minister in what I am saying, and I want him to be assured of that.  I realise his limitations.  He is not able to implement everything he would like.  I am conscious of that.  It is a damning indictment of the Government that they have not given priority to social growth.  The emphasis is on economic growth.  Where is the social policy?  It is not evident in this Social Welfare Bill. This is not a personal reflection on the Minister.  Please believe me.  Perhaps the Minister has not fought hard enough, but there is no social commitment on the part of the Government.  That is what I am denouncing and attacking.</P>
      <P>A six year period for the implementation of the EEC directive is an indication of the low priority given by the Government to equal rights for women, not only in the matter of social welfare but in every other sphere as well.  If the Government said they would ensure that this will be implemented by 1980 or 1981, it would be some evidence of their sincerity in that field.  It costs £30 million to £35 million to do this.  They spent £28 million on the abolition of car tax.  That is an indication of their priorities in the social sphere.  It took one year to abolish car tax and it takes six years to give equal social welfare rights to women.  I would give a much higher priority to implementing equality for women than to abolishing car tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the first to pay tribute where I see real benefits.  Irrespective of party, I will always pay tribute to good positive measures.  There is an apparent neglect and disregard in the Government's treatment of the aged.  If I may say so, there is contempt for this growing section of our community, the least vociferous section, those without political muscle.  We are able to capitulate to some sections of the community, but we ignore the weaker sections who have no voice.  That is a tragic lesson in our democracy. Those with the strongest muscle get everything.  Therefore more and more groups are encouraged to lobby and to force the Government to capitulate, or to bring about the downfall of the Government.  It seems apparent to me that that will happen in our society.  The underprivileged will be trampled on in <Col N="1433" /> the mad rush for the rights of others in our society.</P>
    <P>There was no lowering of the pension qualifying age.  The 16 per cent increase for the aged is not likely to wear well with inflation.  Pension levels remain massively out of line with earnings in the rest of the community.  The non-contributory old age pension is a mere 16 per cent of average industrial earnings. That is very serious, and the budget is unlikely to change it.  Average industrial earnings will continue to go up while the non-contributory pension goes up by only 16 per cent.  It has become apparent that the gap between the living standard of those on social welfare benefits and that of the community at large is growing wider and wider.  We are expecting our aged to exist on incomes which are less than one-fifth of the average industrial wage.  That is a measure of our concern for the aged.  We say to them: &ldquo;You can exist on that. What matter?  We are taking care of those with the muscle.&rdquo;  That is showing a disregard for those people.  We are not even allowing them to retire with dignity or with any comfort.</P>
    <P>The policy is one of benign neglect, of paying lip-service to meeting the needs of the elderly, but failing to deliver the goods where they count.  There was no mention by the Minister of financing a proper retirement pension scheme.  What happened since the Green Paper was issued in 1976?  Income-related pensions are now the norm in all the other EEC countries.  We stand out as the country with the worst social service system in the Nine.  We hold the record as having the worst social services in the Nine.  I will show more and more evidence of that.</P>
    <P>We have over 400,000 workers who have no pension cover other than the social welfare pension.  That is a damning indictment of any Government who profess to be concerned about the plight of the people.  How can they be expected to live on less than one-third of their income if they qualify for a contributory old age pension, or less than one-fifth of their income if they qualify for a non-contributory pension?  That is what they are expected to live on.  The fact that we are not bothered about them is evident in <Col N="1434" /> this Bill and in the budget.</P>
    <P>The present pension system is institutionalising poverty in our society, especially among the aged.  There is not even a whisper from the Minister or the Government about a well-financed pay-related pension scheme under which minimum pension levels would be fixed far above those in the existing social welfare code.  We cannot talk with pride about what we are doing in the social sphere unless we produce a proper pay-related, income-related retirement pension scheme.  The only people covered by such a scheme are public servants and people in white-collar employment.  That is a very serious indication of our lack of concern.  Outside the public service, few pension schemes have been able to cope with inflation with the result that many people have suffered hardship and have received nominal sums.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were sincere and committed, if he wanted a social policy in line with our economic policy, he would introduce immediately a national income-related pension scheme covering all workers, including the self-employed. A basic pension with supplements for dependants, topped up to give the recipient about two-thirds of his previous earnings, would be an indication of the Minister's commitment to social reform.</P>
    <P>We have seen evidence of growing poverty in our society.  We know what happened during this very severe winter. People in the cities accumulated their fuel dockets by the score.  They were unable to get fuel.  Where was the Minister's commitment to helping those people?  Why did he not provide an emergency relief fund for them with contingency moneys from his Department? What did he do about it?  These people had to stay in bed all day to keep warm. Where was the Minister's social concern? Where was his policy of concern for those people?  Was it evident?</P>
    <P>Could not the moneys have been provided?  Could he not have issued a directive to health boards to ensure that these people were provided with electric blankets?  Could he not have mobilised the forces of the Red Cross and the health boards?  Did he issue a statement? His silence on this issue was deafening. <Col N="1435" /> Could they not have been issued with electric fires, other heating appliances, electric blankets?  Did he know these people had fuel dockets only to keep them warm?  They could not get the turf. Some of them stood and waited in queues but could not get turf.  Did the Minister move in with a national emergency relief campaign to help those people?  No.  There was no concern for them.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister who comes in here and talks about the wonderful improvements in the social welfare scheme, the massive improvements and the massive increases.  There is no evidence of them, I am sorry to say.  People have been living in poverty and some people have died as a result.  One person is to blame: the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  The buck stops on his desk, but he remained silent.  One word from the Minister would have mobilised all the forces of the health boards and Red Cross to help those people, but he was silent on that issue.  I issued a plea to him to move in on that issue, but he never responded.  His silence was deafening. He could have asked for a contingency fund from health boards and so on. Instead, we were told it could not be done.  I was inundated with requests for any sort of fuel to save these people, but there was nothing done about it.  I indict the Minister because of his lack of concern. From what I see anyway, there is no evidence that he is concerned.  So many of these people lost their lives&mdash;indeed there are so many about whom we know nothing, who just disappeared from the face of the earth because no concern was shown for them&mdash;it is near criminal negligence that we allowed that to happen and ignored he responsibility to get the scheme working properly.</P>
    <P>There has been a voluntary lobby for the reform of the free fuel scheme.  Suggestions have been made for a comprehensive scheme allowing for all forms of heating.  Where is the concern or the reaction of the Minister in relation to such a scheme?  Nothing was done. There was no reaction.  It has been ignored. Seemingly there are other matters engaging the attention of the Minister for <Col N="1436" /> Social Welfare.  I believe that is wrong. From what I understand the affairs of his Department are not the concern of the Minister at present and that constitutes a sorry state of affairs.</P>

      <P>I would not like the Minister to think I was hurling abuse at him in any way.  Unfortunately, the buck stops on the Minister's desk.  What I have seen in recent months has been the direct responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare because it is they who allocate the funds.  The Minister is the Minister in charge of that Department and, unfortunately, he is the man who must accept the blame.  There is nothing personal directed against the Minister in this.  We have had a very severe winter. We had people who died.  We had a Department with direct responsibility. The Minister may contend it is the responsibility of the health boards but they can only act in response to a directive from the Minister.  I issued an appeal to the Minister to initiate an emergency relief campaign with contingency funds. I do not want to labour this point but I am now on this issue and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has said: we have done this, that and the other as evidence of our concern for the lower income group and the underprivileged in our society.  All I am saying is that the evidence is not there.  I believe that what happened is evidence of criminal neglect on the part of a Department, and a Minister is responsible because it is with <Col N="1438" /> him the buck stops.  That is the only reason that I am saying the Minister as a Minister and not as a person.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The aged have not got their share and are not being given the priority they deserve in our society, people who have given years of service to the country and to whom the country has an obligation. The country has not honoured that obligation and the Government in power are responsible.  The Government have not honoured their obligation to the aged and the Minister for Health and Social <Col N="1439" /> Welfare is not meeting his obligation to them.  There is no evidence of efforts being made to bring their standard of living anywhere near the level required in the final years of their lives.  From what I can see, retirement appears to bring penury.  That is a serious matter and one that must be of deep concern to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I do not see any policy evident to ensure that all of the needs of the aged are met in an organised fashion by the State, aided by organised groups.  One in every 12 of our people over the age of 65 lives in an institution. What is being done to ensure that their basic human rights are protected?  There is no evidence of any action.  Surveys have shown that 75 per cent of people over the age of 65 have died lacking nutrition.  That is a very serious matter and demonstrates the measure of serious poverty in our society.  Three-quarters of people over the age of 65 have inadequate diets. Therefore there is malnutrition among three-quarters of our aged people.  Where is this policy of commitment to improving the standard of living of the underprivileged and aged in our society? There is no evidence of it there.  Thirty thousand old people are living alone, very often in substandard accommodation. It is a very serious matter.  There is no indication of any concern for them. What I want to do is explode the myth that this Bill is providing for these people in our society.  It is not.  A quarter of our elderly are widows.  Where is the evidence of concern for these?  What are we doing for them?  There is no evidence; it is conspicuous by its absence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would feel very upset if the Minister thought I was launching a personal attack on him.  It is not my intention to do that.  I recognise that he is only one person in that Government and that he has to fight his corner at the Cabinet table and he can only fight so hard.  All I am saying is that by attacking the Minister as a Minister, not as a person, I am attacking the Government. I would be the first to walk behind him and vote with him if I got this promise of a social commitment.  The Minister knows that I can be objective and attack all Governments.  What I am saying is that we have not given a proper commitment to the underprivileged, the poor and the aged in our society.  None of us has done it.  I am not just shedding crocodile tears; there is no question of that.  But these people do not have a voice; they do not have this powerful lobby that the farmers have that they can come in and force the Government to withdraw something.  That was a very serious matter in this democracy of ours that a Government could make a conscious policy decision affecting this country and be forced to reverse it by virtue of this powerful political muscle in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the weakest section in our society without a voice speaking on their behalf.  We have an obligation in this House to speak up.  I was never in the position where I could actively introduce any particular policy as the Minister can.  If I had been in that position maybe I might not have been able to fulfil some of the great ideas I have.  I do not know.  But I feel that we should keep highlighting the injustices towards this section of our community.  Unless we <Col N="1441" /> develop a social conscience nothing will be done for this section of our community. Adding £1 here and 50p there is not doing anything; the only way we can help them is to link the social welfare benefits and the pensions and so on to the average rise in industrial earnings.  If that is done then it is an immediate positive measure to eliminate poverty from our society because then they will not fall behind.  No Government and no political party should be trying to make political capital out of this.  If social welfare benefits are linked to industrial earnings automatically then there will be a situation where a positive measure has been taken.  That is all I am asking.  But this business of a Government giving £1 here and £1 there and taking all the credit for it is all wrong.  No Government has the right to take the credit for it.  This should be done positively in the way that the national wage agreements are drawn up so that the average industrial wage goes up in line with production.  If we were to do this then we would have a proper social services system here.  We have not got that at present.  Nothing has been done for the aged.  Nothing has been done about a national income-related pension scheme.  We have done nothing in that sphere and we should be doing something about it.</P>

If work is being done behind closed doors I will congratulate the Minister.  I am delighted to hear him say that something is being done because we are very far behind in this field.  We have been doing nothing for years and action is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the food subsidies because it relates to the social welfare benefits, as I see it, food costs rise faster than the consumer price index.  In 12 months food prices have increased by 13 to 15 per cent.  Again this section of the community have suffered; their standard of living has been greatly worsened as a result of the removal of the food subsidies. <Col N="1442" /> The removal of the food subsidies has added 8p to the price of a pound of butter, 2p on milk and 3p on bread. Many of these people cannot afford that. Surveys have shown that social welfare families spend 50 to 75 per cent of their total income on food and that is a very high percentage of the social welfare allowances. They have suffered three months of food price increases and this is a gross injustice for which budget measures have not compensated.  If we had a situation here where there would be a statutory linkage of all social welfare benefits to the consumer price index or to average industrial earnings it would take this whole issue out of the realm of statistical arguments and party political posing.  Any Government who would do this would get credit then for the real increase in the living standards of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make every effort to get back from his colleague in the Department of Finance the October increase to take account of movements of the consumer price index.  It was a retrograde step not to have these increases implemented on a regular basis. A Government which is concerned about this problem should agree on a percentage of the increase in the gross national product which would go to reform and expand social welfare services. This is the only way it can be done; a slice of the gross national product must be devoted to eliminating poverty in our society, to narrowing the ever-widening gap between social welfare recipients and the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>I would like to get a commitment from the Minister that there will be a lowering of the pension age.  This is overdue. Again there has been a retrograde move by the present Government in not continuing this reduction in the qualifying age for the old age pension and that is deplorable.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad, encouraged by public representatives, that social welfare benefits are a charitable handout of the State.  We must get rid of this notion in our society.  We must understand that these are rights that the social welfare recipients have.  They and the employers pay most of this money into <Col N="1443" /> the social fund and when they apply for this they must be treated in the same way as insurance beneficiaries making a claim.  Unfortunately there is evidence of a lack of concern for these people and the denial of their rights by the social welfare department.</P>
    <P>I was passing Oisin House just a few weeks ago and it was raining very heavily and there were people queuing outside for their benefits.  I could not understand why they could not queue inside.  I accept that they have to queue but why were they forced to remain outside in the rain?  I would like the Minister to say why this is allowed to happen?  Why can he not issue directives to each Department that these people be brought in. They are not beggars queuing for soup at one of these kitchens; they are people seeking their entitlements.  On that subject, during the recent difficulty over payment of social welfare benefits, there were serious problems in the outlying areas of Dublin because social welfare beneficiaries were unable to collect their money.</P>
    <P>I got in touch with the Department of Social Welfare and was told that the supplementary welfare allowance could be paid.  However, the problem was that the community welfare officer only called twice weekly and as this was a Friday there was no money for them.  I was referred to the health board and they told me they did not know what they could do about it.  The supplementary welfare allowance was supposed to act in cases of emergency but despite all the assurances given by the health board the people went without their money at the weekend.</P>

      <P>The Minister might consider drafting a code of rights for social welfare recipients and publicising it.  There should be a proper appeals system with access to an independent appeals tribunal.  The Minister could include this without extra cost.  More attention should be given to publicising the benefits available.  The book published by the Department of Social Welfare is a maze of confusion and it does not give adequate information.</P>
      <P>The Department might consider issuing leaflets setting out the rights of social welfare recipients.  These people should be treated as though they were consumers. It is important that social welfare recipients be treated properly by officials and that information be given to them.  They should not be treated as though they were trying to evade their responsibilities.  All of this is part of the Bill.  Besides providing money in order to improve the living standards of social welfare recipients, we should make sure that they are aware of their rights and that they get them.  More information should be available in information centres.  We should emphasise that it is their statutory entitlement to get benefits and we should get rid of the notion that it is a charitable hand-out from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits of economic growth are not filtering down to this section of the community.  Social justice must be planned for and targets must be set.  Unless we do this we will continue to have 20 per cent to 23 per cent of our population suffering from poverty.  We must ensure that the benefits for these people are on a par with the benefits for industrial workers.  There is no evidence from the Minister, his Department or the Government of a social welfare policy to <Col N="1445" /> eliminate poverty from our society.  The Minister's and the Government's philosophy is that the poor will be with us forever.  That need not be the case if we are determined in our efforts to help the poor.  It need not be the case, it should not be and if there is a proper policy it will not be the case.</P>
    <P>Poverty affects 20 per cent to 23 per cent of our population and this is a high figure.  We are doing nothing about it. The Minister has boasted that we have increased children's allowances.  The amount being given would not even feed a child.  It is a paltry sum to provide for a child in this age of serious inflation. There is no evidence there of a philosophy to improve the lot of the poor.  No effort has been made in this Bill or in the budget to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots.  There is no evidence that we are a caring nation.  The evidence of poverty among the older section is due to the lack of a proper retirement pension scheme.  If the Minister tells us that this will be his priority something might be done.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is not operating as it should.  The growing evidence of rejection of applications is another indication that somewhere along the line there has been a curb on this scheme.</P>
    <P>The work of the committee dealing with poverty is not meriting the attention it deserves.  By my thinking the Minister has not given it his full support.  If he has given the committee his full support it has not been made known.  As far as I can see, it is in a veritable limbo and I should like to know what the Minister is going to do about the matter.  Have the Government a social commitment to the elimination of poverty or have they succumbed to the view that poverty will be with us forever?  Unless they have a positive policy to eliminate poverty we will have a serious problem affecting thousands of aged people, widows, deserted wives and handicapped and disabled people.  When I speak of a positive policy I mean a guaranteed minimum income related to the number in the household and linked to the cost of living. This would be a positive alternative to the supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>If the Government were serious in <Col N="1446" /> their concern for the underprivileged they would be positively discriminating in their favour.  I should like to quote again the Bishops' statement:</P>
    <P>If we are to ensure basic human rights for everyone we will have, quite deliberately, to begin to discriminate in favour of the poor.  A real transfer of money and of opportunity must be made by the better-off sections of society to the poorer group if the latter are to be raised to minimum standards of human dignity and if we are to lay claim to be a just and Christian society.</P>
    <P>I have read in detail the submissions from the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  They have shown very clearly that we are not as a State or as a Government making a serious attempt to help this underprivileged section.  They say that substantial increases in childrens' allowances are needed first for the lower income group.  I examined the tables they prepared and they are very interesting. In Appendix 4 they say that where the consumer price index base was 100 in November 1969 it went up to 290 in 1978 but the allowances for, say, three children was only £118 in 1978. This shows a very serious fall in childrens' allowances with people getting less than half what they were getting in 1969.  Even the increases proposed in this Bill and in the budget do not come near meeting the increase in the consumer price index.  This is a serious fall in allowances for children especially for people in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>The removal of food subsidies caused a very serious drop in the standard of living of the very people who spend up to 75 per cent of their incomes on food.  They are the people worst hit.  The non-contributory old age pension is now only 16 per cent of average industrial earnings. That is very serious and it looks as if it will become worse.  If industrial earnings increase further, it will not even reach that level and will drop below 16 per cent.  These are areas in which the Minister and the Government have failed to meet their obligations to the poor and the underprivileged.  In the light of that I do not see how the Minister can say here: &ldquo;We have done so much; we <Col N="1447" /> are really taking care of them; we are producing a positive plan to eliminate poverty.&rdquo;  I say that is farcical; it is a shame; they are not meeting their commitments; they are concerned with one thing.  They talk about economic growth but if we are a concerned society we must match economic growth with social growth and that it not evident in this Bill or in the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole social welfare area has become so complex and complicated in recent years that the vast majority of people do not know their entitlements. They do not understand the various schemes operating and the overlapping that occurs within these schemes.</P>
      <P>In the case of children's allowances the increase of one new farthing extra per week for the third, fourth and each subsequent child is farcical.  I taught in a school where the children of two families easily passed the retention figure for keeping on a second teacher.  The Minister in his increase in this area has not taken account of the productivity rate, so to speak, of Irish people, particularly in the western area.  There should be a substantial increase in the amount allocated for the children's allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>In regard to women's unemployment benefit, the number of cases that I have to attend to where these people are refused benefit through being considered as not eligible for work is all the time increasing. Even though many of them produce evidence from employers that they are able and willing and available for work they still seem to be refused benefit.  I ask the Minister to examine that matter.  The number of disability benefit appeals outstanding is increasing and the period of waiting for assessment by the Department's medical referees is inordinately long.  Many applicants who would qualify have to wait very long periods before being assessed.  I should like the Minister to look into that matter also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in receipt of contributory pensions from Britain or the US, particularly in western areas, find it very difficult to understand why each increase in their <Col N="1448" /> pensions reduces the Irish pension. These are people who, forty or fifty years ago, either through Government action or their own will, left the country to work abroad to support themselves, their families and relations at home.  I raised this matter with the Minister previously and I know there are difficulties involved in it but as a rural Deputy I find it hard to explain to these people why, having got nothing from this country while they worked abroad, they should, due to budgetary increases in pensions in other countries, have their Irish pensions, minimal though they are, phased out or decreased drastically. Despite the legal complications I would ask the Minister to look into this matter to see if anything can be done to improve the position.  In many cases I know the pensions they receive from abroad are higher than the Irish pensions but it is hard to explain the position to them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that widows' pensions should be taxed.  Many of them are living on the poverty line and find it difficult to make ends meet.  The Minister should review the limits set for taxation of widows' pensions.  I would also ask the Minister to consider the position of widowers who are left to look after a fairly large family.  They get a minimal housekeeper allowance through the taxation system but this is not enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally I want to refer to the much-maligned farmers' dole which is payable in the counties of the province of Connacht, Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Longford, Monaghan, and the congested districts of West Cork and Limerick.  From the beginning, this system has been maligned and has given those who received it a bad name, as it were.  I have not heard many Deputies refer to small farmers' unemployment assistance in the House.  As a rural <Col N="1449" /> Deputy from the county which selected the Minister concerned as the Man of the Year&mdash;fair play to him for that&mdash;I find it strange that the relevant section of this Bill should affect the vast majority of small farmers in that county.  Directly the number of farmers involved will be between 24,000 and 25,000 while the saving on the part of the Government, £2 million in a full year, is very small in terms of the national budget.</P>
      <P>I would not wish to give the impression that I am attacking the Minister on this issue.  This system of unemployment assistance for small farmers has been abused and is being abused but this is only by a minority.  It is unfortunate that the cases of abuse are always highlighted to the extreme thereby giving rise to a general impression that the whole system is being abused.  We know this is not the position.  The common agricultural policy is very important to us.  It guarantees prices for about 8 million people within the Community and it has stabilised prices in some areas to the benefit of about 200 million people.  But there are disparities in incomes in the various regions.  There are differences, for instance, in the incomes of farmers in the congested districts of the counties I mentioned compared with the incomes of farmers in other areas.  The income from beef in the western counties compared with the rest of the country is of the order of about three-to-one.  In addition the physical barriers with which many of the farmers who are in receipt of unemployment assistance have to contend would not appear to be taken into account by the Department of Social Welfare.  Many of the holdings concerned are very small and fragmented and there are also disadvantages as poor quality soil, poor drainage and so on and these disadvantages as well as the price increases in the basic necessities of life make life very difficult for the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four categories involved in this legislation.  The single farmer with a valuation of £10 would be deemed notionally to have an income of £3.85 a week.  His benefit would amount to £7.50 per week.  The social welfare benefit has been increased to £12.70 but the multiplier has been raised from 20 to <Col N="1450" /> 30.  This change would mean a payment to the farmer of £6.90 but this amount would represent a reduction on the 12 per cent increase in social welfare payments. There are about 13,000 farmers in this category, many of whom are living in the county I represent.  There is much time and effort involved in trying to make a living from holdings that are small and fragmented.  This whole problem is one that will take many years to solve but it should have been considered by the Department of Social Welfare in relation to these proposed changes.</P>
    <P>The second category of farmers affected are the 5,000 farmers whose valuations are between £10 and £15. The multiplier in their case is being increased to 50.  Consequently, all single persons within that category will lose their entitlement to social welfare assistance while many of those who have families will experience reduced payments.</P>
    <P>The third category includes about 2,500 farmers who are in the £15- to £20-valuation group.  When the Griffith valuation was undertaken in western counties those areas in which, for instance, there were a lot of hazel trees&mdash;a very valuable commodity at that time&mdash;were valued more highly than were other areas in the vicinity.  That timber has long since disappeared and there remains only barren and rocky soil or at least soil of very poor quality.  That is not a situation for which the Minister is responsible but it is something that the Department should have considered in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>The fourth category, those in the £20 and more valuation group, will lose all entitlement to social welfare assistance. The saving to the Exchequer of the total removal of the dole from 2,000 farmers and the reductions in the payments to about 5,500 farmers will be a paltry £160,000.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot these days from the PAYE people but they are able to look after themselves for the most part.  In recent weeks it would appear that the Government have been able to facilitate pressure groups.  These same pressure groups are the ones who can be seen frequently coming from the various <Col N="1451" /> Departments where they have been making their case.  But I am here today representing many PAYE people who do not have the strong voice that some of their more organised colleagues have and I am speaking also for the small farmers who do not have a platform and who, consequently, are not heard complain of what is being done to them. However, in June these people may make their resentment known in a different way.  Many of these people will suffer as a result of the changes proposed here.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Department have been gradually and successfully cutting down on whatever abuse was taking place in relation to unemployment assistance to small farmers.  Some of the abuse related to cases of farmers who had three or four holdings, perhaps as a result of legacies, with the result that their real valuation was much higher than the valuation on which they were assessed but because of the follow-through methods used by officials of the Department in recent years much of this type of abuse has been eliminated.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Minister realises fully the extent to which the standard of living of most of those people who will suffer as a result of this legislation will be affected. Unfortunately, these are the people who are not in a position to exercise their influence on the Government not to interfere with the system of unemployment assistance.  The action taken by the Minister will influence them to an unnecessary degree.  I believe the number of abuses within the system was decreasing and eventually would have been eliminated.  Therefore it could have been left as it was.</P>
    <P>People on small holdings in the west will not get any unemployment assistance. The soil on these fragmented holdings is of very poor quality.  This is a point the Department have missed and they should look at it again.  That is why I am making the case here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are engaged today in the annual exercise of debating the Social Welfare Bill designed to give legislative effect to the adjustments made in the rates and schemes of social <Col N="1452" /> welfare under the recent budget.  The adjustments in income that this Bill is designed to bring about are of a dimension that would not be tolerated by any other section of the community.  We are dealing with a section of the people who are relegated to a standard of living which would not be acceptable to the rest of us.  I am talking about the old, the ill and the disadvantaged generally. Down through the years what the Social Welfare Acts have done for them has always compared badly with the adjustments in income for the rest of the population. This year it is in starker contrast when compared with the treatment that has been meted out by the Government to the very wealthy in our community. That is why today speeches have been more loudly stated and expressed with greater emphasis than in the past.  This is something we all feel strongly about.</P>
      <P>In the first paragraph of the memorandum we talk about percentage increases of 12 and 16 per cent.  Percentages mean nothing to the people in the lower income group.  To a very large extent we are dealing here with the elderly people, of 65 years and over, who form 11 per cent of our population&mdash;240,000 people.  Of these 85 per cent are dependent on state pensions of one kind or another.  Half of that 85 per cent have a means test pension which means that they will be expected to survive on £15.80 per week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland mentioned the cost of a lunch in this House.  It might be dramatic to say that that £15.80 is the price of one meal in some of our costlier eating establishments.  Admittedly, these meals can be written off on expense accounts. This matter needs to be mentioned to highlight the vast differences in wealth and means that society continues to tolerate.  Some people without any thought spend on one meal what we expect another human being to survive on, to pay for all the expenses of home, food and so on, in a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent survey by the National Prices Commission showed that three-quarters of the people surveyed were over 65 years of age whose diets were deficient in energy in one or more respect.  As Deputy O'Connell stated, a number of them suffer from hypothermia <Col N="1453" /> because of lack of heating and the money to pay for heating.  One in five old age pensioners lives alone.  These people need all the comforts society can provide more than the rest of us, yet the majority of them do not have any comforts. As the majority of the old age pensioners living alone do not possess a fridge to store their food, they are compelled to buy their food in small quantities and this can be much more expensive. They do not have washing machines.  They are the people who, because of their years and their inability to cope as the younger people can, need such comforts.  They do not have private transport.  In recent years they have been given free public transport but they might benefit more from private transport. In rural areas many of them do not even have running water and have no way of providing that facility for themselves.</P>

The gardaí can summon the owners under section 98 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, if there is an element of obstruction involved.

      <P>I am aware that a number of road authorities also have been approached about particular projects in their areas.</P>

      <P>I listened to the senior Minister's comments on Second Stage and Committee State debates.

      <P>It is open to Limerick Corporation to apply to my Department for grants, under section 24 of the Housing Act, 1966, for carrying out improvement works to their rented dwellings.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of the necessity to conserve existing capital resources for the provision of much needed new houses, there are at present no capital funds at my disposal out of which moneys can be made available to finance the balance of the cost of such works.</P>
      <P>The general question of the financing of improvement works to local authority houses is currently under consideration in my Department in the context of the present local authority housing subsidy arrangements, the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and the recently revised national differential rent and tenant purchase schemes.</P>

A reminder was issued in February 1978 but the applications have not yet come to hand.  It is understood that work on the pilot scheme has been completed at an estimated cost of £28,000.  The maximum State grant payable to the corporation under the old scheme was £200 per house.  Grants under the new scheme operate at the level of £600 per house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is intended to introduce any controls on the increasing prices of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In February 1973 a form of control was introduced under section 35 of the Housing Act, 1966, in relation to the prices of new grant-type private houses in groups of four or more being provided for sale.  This control is operated by way of the issue of a certificate by my Department in cases where the price proposed to be charged appears to be reasonable.  Concurrent with the introduction of the £1,000 new house grant in July 1977, this control was extended to cover grant-type houses and flats provided for sale.  In August 1978 the scope of the controls was again extended to cover a wider range of houses for which building society loans were approved, including non-grant-type houses.  A new housing Bill, which I <Col N="1465" /> propose to circulate to Deputies in the near future, will contain measures to strengthen the present statutory basis for the control of prices of new private houses and flats being provided for sale.</P>
      <P>Regarding the reference in the question to the &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; price of houses, the Deputy will be aware that statistics of the average gross prices of new houses for which loans are approved by the main lending agencies are contained in my Department's quarterly bulletin of housing statistics.  The notes to the appropriate tables indicate that the houses concerned are not necessarily comparable from quarter to quarter or from area to area.  Subject to this reservation, the latest edition of the bulletin shows that the average quarterly change in the gross, price of new houses was plus 11.7 per cent in January-March 1978, plus 8.4 per cent in April-June 1978, plus 3.4 per cent in the third quarter of 1978 and minus 0.2 per cent in the last quarter.</P>
      <P>It would be impractical to regualte the prices of previously-occupied houses. These prices are determined by market conditions generally and prices will vary considerably depending on the location, the amenities offered, the state of repair and the general potential of the house.</P>
      <P>The Department's quarterly bulletin of housing statistics also shows that the average gross prices of previously-occupied houses for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies increased by 20.8 per cent between the last quarters of 1977 and 1978, respectively, and decreased by 3.4 per cent over the last three months of 1978.</P>

When the Minister talks about market condïtïons, ïs ït not due to the tact that there is shortage of local authority houses and that young people are pushed into buying private houses?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Act annexed to the Decision of the Council of the European Communities dated 20 September 1976 and a further Council Decision on 25 July 1978, the elections to the Assembly of the European Communities are to be held in all the member states within the period from 7 to 10 June 1979.  In our case it has been decided that the elections will take place on Thursday, 7 June and the Minister will in due course make a formal order fixing this date as the polling day.  The period for receiving nominations will be from 5 to 12 May inclusive. Under the provisions of the Council Act of 20 September 1976, the counting of the votes cast at the Assembly election may not begin until after the close of the poll in all the member states.  In accordance with this provision, counting may not commence until Sunday evening.  As announced some time ago the Government have decided that the local government elections will also be held on 7 June.  The detailed arrangements to facilitate the taking of the two polls together are being considered at present by my Department in consultation with returning officers for the Assembly and local elections.</P>
      <P>It is expected that detailed arrangements will be finalised within the next few weeks and effect will be given to these arrangements, so far as may be necessary, by regulations under section 91 of the Electoral Act, 1963, which makes special provision for holding two or more polls together.  It is intended that the necessary segregation of the ballot papers used at the two elections will take place on Friday 8 June and that the count of the local election votes will then take place in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of holding the referendum on the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution (Adoption) Bill, 1978, on the same day as the other polls was considered. <Col N="1478" /> However, it was decided, after consulting returning officers, not to hold the referendum on the same day because of the possibility that taking the three polls together and four polls in urban areas could give rise to confusion.  As announced recently, the intention is to hold this referendum on 5 July 1979.  A further referendum on the question of university representation in the Seanad may also be held on that date, if the relevant Constitution Amendment Bill, which the Minister for Education will be introducing, can be processed in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is not.  Experience has shown that in 1937 a referendum and an election were held on the same day and in 1945 a presidential election and the local elections were held on the same day.  Does the Minister not think that in the intervening years people have become more enlightened and educated and it would be quite possible to hold the two elections on the same day?  I suggest that in larger polling booths or, indeed, where necessary, any difficulty could be avoided by the appointment of further staff, presiding officers and poll clerks.</P>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 12, do I understand from the Minister that it is only proposed to use one ballot box, because that is what he seems to suggest? Is it suggested that all ballot papers be put into the one box and that they are then brought to a centre in each county, opened there and sorted out?  Is the Minister satisfied that amending legislation will not be necessary to do that in so far as the European elections are concerned?

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I just want to finish this. When the legislation was going through the House there was a suggestion that the presidential system should be used with a separate count in each consituency up to the point of the first count and that the papers then be removed to a central counting place for the completion of the count.  The Minister's Minister of State stated on that occasion that that was not either possible or permissable.  What has changed in the meantime?</P>

      <P>The position is that the Government decided not to hold the referenda on the same day as the local elections and the EEC Assembly elections because by having four polls in some areas and five polls in urban areas it would give rise to a confusion and an unsatisfactory high level of spoiled votes.  In urban areas there would be urban council elections, county council elections, the EEC elections and a vote on each of the referendum proposals, which would make five.  I believe that this would give rise to a very high level of spoiled votes.</P>

      <P>Is that not a reflection on the intelligence of our people, given that in the USA 20 or more issues are voted on simultaneously?  In regard to the use of the one box, is the Minister satisfied that this is legal under our existing law and that the arrangements made are in conformity with the agreement reached at the European Council? Is it a fact that the reason for using one box is that we have not made any new boxes since the British did it in 1898?  Is it the intention of the Government that, as those boxes run out, elections will cease completely because they will never manufacture any more?</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's non-denial of what has been said about a circular suggesting that votes for the European elections be checked face upwards, is he aware of the nature of the agreement reached at the European Council, at which I personally participated, that a condition of the elections being held over a period of days in different countries was that the boxes containing the European votes would not be opened so that there would be no danger that any assessment of the results would come out in one country in advance of others which could pre-judge the result of the election in other countries?  Is the Minister aware, that it was on a proposal by this country that that procedure be adopted that other countries accepted in good faith the idea of the elections being held over a period of days and agreed that we, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom would hold our elections on Thursday, three days earlier?  If it is proposed to allow these votes to be checked face upwards, this would be a serious breach of faith <i>vis-à-vis</i> our partners in the European Community because the tally men would produce results which could affect elections elsewhere.  We guaranteed that that would not happen and it was on that condition we were allowed to have the election on Thursday.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment, I was beginning to make the case that the response of successive Governments, but more particularly of the present Government, to the needs of social welfare recipients was in stark contrast to their response to the needs of all other sections of the community.  I was making the case that this has applied down through the years but, because of the activities of this Government in other areas since they came into office, it stands out in greater relief this year.  I was making the case that it is inappropriate to rely on percentages, whatever their magnitude might be, to redress the situation because we are talking about a percentage of what is a very small base indeed. <Col N="1493" /> £15.80 per week for an old age pensioner is, by any standards, totally inadequate. As I said earlier, these people to whom we donate £15.80 per week enjoy none of the conveniences that others regard as essential to their comfort and happiness in this life and, indeed, they are short of many of the necessities of life.  This often results in undernourishment and the hypothermia to which Deputy Dr. O'Connell referred.  It also results in a great deal of general hardship for these people.</P>
      <P>Heating is a subject which is of very great relevance to the needs of old age pensioners.  In particular I would say that all of us at local level, as members of health boards or advisory health boards, were made aware this year of the Minister's refusal to sanction a request by the Southern Health Board to increase the free fuel allowances to £12 per month.  We were very disappointed indeed.  The Minister chose instead to cut this allowance back to £7 per month. This is a gesture which was not at all worthy of the Minister and it indicated a penny-pinching attitude towards the members of the community who need help so much.  I would appeal to the Minister even now to ensure that some greater relief is given, if not this year, next year to those who must rely on supplementary income of that kind to get the basic necessities of life.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 4,000 elderly people are applying for supplementary welfare allowances and it is very difficult to qualify for this allowance.  I do not quite know what the criteria are but cases have come to my notice which, in my estimation, were deserving cases indeed and yet they failed to qualify for the supplementary welfare allowance.  I would like somebody to tell me what the criteria are.  I believe that one would have to be absolutely destitute before one would qualify for this allowance.  I understand that this is an area where a great deal of discretion is given.  I would ask the Minister to impress on those to whom the discretion is given to be a little more lenient because obviously this allowance is not meeting at present the need for which it was intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in that category rely to a great <Col N="1494" /> extent on supplementary benefits of that kind.  They rely too on voluntary agencies to ease their discomfort.  We have very good service run by people who are doing their utmost to bring relief to certain sections of the community by bring ing through schemes such as Meals on Wheels.  But it is estimated that the reach only a very small proportion of the community who need that service. know that by providing the service and by giving their time they meet a need which otherwise would stand out as very great need indeed in this society and which probably would stand out a a greater indictment if the service was not available.  But their service can only reach a very small proportion of the total need that exists.  I was making a case for increasing the income of a these sections of the community.</P>
    <P>To increase it by any percentage is not meeting the case.  If the Minister said he was increasing the old age pension by 50 per cent it would sound very magnanimous but to increase the sum of £13.60 by 50 per cent would mean only £20.40.  The rest of us would not regard that as sufficient to provide the necessities of life.  If we take the £15.80 which this Bill will give to old age pensioners and if that were to be increased by 50 per cent it would still be only £23.70. Increasing by percentages might sound good but in terms of pounds and pence and of meeting the cost of living it is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>We must have a realistic assessment of the needs of the people to whom we pay social welfare benefits.  We must relate it to the standard of living that applies to those in employment and which we consider appropriate for other sections of the community.  As a previous speaker pointed out, it is not right that old age pensions and social welfare benefits should amount to at most about 20 per cent of the average male industrial wage.</P>
    <P>There is a great lack of ancillary services for the aged.  The major burden of caring for them falls on relatives.  Possibly that would be a good thing if the relatives in question were supported by adequate State aids.  This Bill proposes to increase the prescribed relative's allowance <Col N="1495" /> from £7.60 per week to £8.80 per week.  A relative has to forego employment and all the benefits that go with it in order to look after an old person; yet we pay him or her less than we pay the unemployed.  Usually it is a daughter who cares for the old person but in recent times I was glad to see that the allowance has been paid to a son. The least we can do is to pay such relatives the same rate as that paid in unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>In their post-budget submission in February 1979 the Society of St. Vincent de Paul expressed great concern about this and rightly so.  They have great experience in these matters and they have a lot to do with the lower income families.  They know their needs better than the rest of us.  The society were primarily concerned with the position of low income families with children.  They made the case that the income of such families goes on essentials only and there is nothing left for anything else.  Of course, food is the first essential.</P>
    <P>The society say that 75 per cent of the total income of low income families is spent on food and they call for an increase in children's allowances as the best way to sustain families against the increased cost of food.  The Minister appreciated this and took their point in his speech today.  In his contribution he talked about what he described as substantial increases in children's allowances, although many of us might differ from him in what he calls a substantial increase.  He made the case that when the Government decided to remove food subsidies they recognised that the step would seriously affect the budgets of social welfare recipients.  He said that the Government were anxious that the effect on this section of the community should be cushioned to the greatest extent possible and he referred to the EEC butter scheme and other matters.  He told us that children's allowances offer the best mechanism to offset the effects of a reduction in subsidies for the majority of families with lower incomes.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister pointed out the increases: £1.20 for the first <Col N="1496" /> child; £1.40 for the second child and 65p for the third child.  This was to cushion families in receipt of social welfare benefits against the effects of the removal of food subsidies on 1 January. We can ask ourselves how the measure proposed by the Minister will help those families.  On analysis we see that it does not compensate them for the increased food costs brought about by the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I suppose milk could be regarded as a primary and essential item in the diet of children and I do not think anyone would argue with me when I say that one pint of milk should be allotted to each child every day.  As a result of the removal of the food subsidies milk was increased in price by 3½p per pint.  If a person buys 30 pints of milk per month for a child he or she will pay an increased bill of £1.05 per month.  Having regard to the increase allocated for the first child, there would be a balance of 15p to pay for the increased cost of bread and butter.  In the case of the second child there would be 25p left to cover all the essentials but in the case of the third child the family is short 40p.  I am not talking about the increased cost of bread or butter.  In addition, there is a shortfall from January to April when none of the children gets any increase in respect of milk, bread and butter.  This is not a compensation for the removal of food subsidies.  We are not talking about cut-backs in the tax-free allowances because in the main they are not relevant in this context.</P>
    <P>The attitude we have had towards children under the social welfare code does us no credit and this applies to successive Governments.  I should like the Government to decide what it costs to keep a child.  There is a plethora of rates in existence.  We pay £4.65 if the parent or guardian is on disability benefit; we pay £4.25 in the case of an old age pensioner; we pay £5.20 to a non-contributory widow and we pay £5.70 to a contributory widow.  I do not know how we arrived at these various rates of allowance in respect of dependent children but it strikes me as a ridiculous situation.  They are a senseless set of figures worked out by somebody at <Col N="1497" /> some stage and increased by percentages from time to time.  They have no relevance to what it costs to keep a child. It would cost much more than £4 or £5 to keep a child in elementary comfort.</P>
    <P>This is the Year of the Child and there have been many groups set up to discuss the needs of children.  Here we have a basic need.  The Minister responsible for co-ordinating activities in the Year of the Child is present and I appeal to him to set out what it costs to maintain a child and to ask parents to realise that what his Government have done in removing the food subsidies is something that would set back the situation of children, particularly among the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the position of widows who in the main in recent years have organised themselves so as to make known their plight.  Once again most of their pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  I concede that there have been marginal improvements for widows in this budget and others but we still have the situation where a widow with two children is asked to survive, sustain herself and the children on £26.50 a week.  Widowhood brings about a very sudden drop in income but there is no drop in overheads or in the financial or other demands of running a home which might in fact be increased because there is now only one parent and only one adult perhaps in the house capable of doing things for which, if one were not able to do them, one has to pay.</P>
    <P>This woman is asked to survive with her two children on perhaps half or very often one-third or a quarter of the income to which she was accustomed. Because of the means test, if this woman can find work&mdash;she has no facilities for child care; we have done nothing about providing child care facilities worth talking about except what voluntary organisations have tried to provide&mdash;despite lack of back-up facilities, perhaps by going out in unsocial hours and perhaps at great personal expense to get a job to buttress her income, if she earns more than about £20 a week, her pension ceases.  If she is a widow of a husband who had stamps <Col N="1498" /> and if she goes out to work she is taxed on a very low margin.</P>
    <P>As regards the special needs of widows there must be a realisation that all the overheads of running a home and maintaining a family are still there and very often increased.  Many widows are trying to manage on an average of one third of the income available when both parents were living.  We are doing grave injustice to widows at present and to their children for whom one must make a special plea.</P>
    <P>Back in 1972 the Commission on the Status of Women recommended that the alleviate this problem of the sudden drop in income on the death of an earning partner the pension or allowance to the survivor should be doubled for six months after the death.  The last Government went some way towards that in paying disability benefit if it was payable for six weeks after the death of the insured person.  This at least tided the widow over the period between the death of her husband and the payment of widow's pension.  It does not go all the way and it does not go at all towards meeting the particular needs of widowhood at that time.  Therefore the recommendation of the commission on the Status of Women that the pension on allowance be doubled for a period of six months was a very good idea and one which I would appeal to some Government to implement in the very near future.</P>
    <P>We measure in pennies what we give to social welfare recipients.  There is an example of this in the present Social Welfare Bill where we increase the unemployment assistance rate.  We have rounded it off for urban areas to the noble sum of £11, but we pay rural people £9.05.  I do not know how we arrived at the 5p; perhaps it is now we have arrived at the 5p because there has been an increase of £1.05 in the rate of unemployment assistance payable to people in rural areas.  The doling out of an additional 5p highlights the Government's whole attitude towards this section of the community.  There is no question of rounding it off or reaching anything approximating the figures to which the rest of us aspire when we have wage adjustments <Col N="1499" /> to meet cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the treatment of women under the social welfare code.  I should like to begin with single women over 68 for whom a special allowance was introduced recently. That allowance still stands at £13.65 per week in 1979.  We ask an adult who is getting on in years and who has given a life of service to either the home or the community or society generally to survive on that sum.  If that woman has an income of between £1 and £2 we reduce her allowance to £12.35.  We give her nothing at all if she has over £11.  These figures give an idea of the standard of living to which we relegate these people and the complacency shown in the very minor adjustments in the rate of benefit, adjustments which have never kept pace with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In the context of women generally, there has been reference to the EEC directive giving the Government six years to eliminate remaining discrimination against women in the social welfare code.  First, six years is far too long.  I would point out that the directive did not say the Government must take six years but that it must be done in six years.  I would appeal to them to do it in two years; I wish they could do it in one. Secondly, the terms are too restrictive as they apply only to women in the employment situation.  We have here discrimination which will not be tolerated any longer and it should be eliminated as soon as possible.  The Government should not bask in the knowledge that the EEC have given them six years. There will be a great deal of pressure within the country for earlier elimination of discrimination.</P>
    <P>The decision to extend the period of payment for unemployment benefit from 156 to 212 days is a step in the right direction which I welcome.  There are still many areas of discrimination against women which I hope will be eliminated on the next occasion that some Minister will get an opportunity to do so.  For instance, a married woman in employment pays a full contribution but when unemployed, instead of getting the normal national rate of £16.05, she gets £14 because she is married.  I say that <Col N="1500" /> £2.05 of such a person's entitlement is wrongfully kept by the State.  If a case were brought&mdash;possibly it is the way of righting many wrongs nowadays&mdash;I cannot imagine the case of any woman whose £2.05 was kept by the State wrongfully would not succeed.  We are dealing with a section of the community who are not likely to seek redress in that way.</P>
    <P>Going very strongly through the whole welfare code there is the concept as a man as breadwinner and a woman as dependant.  That thinking has resulted in a great deal of discrimination and a great deal of hardship for women.  The demand for the elimination of what discrimination remains will grow very strongly in the near future.  We have an outmoded and inadequate social welfare code generally.</P>
    <P>In the areas of unemployment benefit and disability benefit there is bias against married women.  By way of motion in the House not very long ago this party highlighted the situation in relation to married women obtaining unemployment benefit.  Invariably, the argument was that a married woman was not available for work and that, consequently, she did not qualify for unemployment benefit.  I know of many married women who live in the same homes as their mothers or mothers-in-law and these in the main are active middle-aged women who are quite prepared to look after their grandchildren while the mothers are at work.  However, many married women have succeeded in their claims for unemployment benefit but in their efforts to this end they have been caused much inconvenience.  Because the appeal's officers decision was final there was no redress for women who were refused benefit.  That situation would not be tolerated today under any other code. From these benches we called for the setting up of an appeals tribunal and for the right of an applicant to know why she was being refused benefit.  In any other circumstances this right would be considered as merely basic justice but the attitude is very different in respect of social welfare and its application to women.  I am reiterating my plea to the <Col N="1501" /> Minister to rid our society as quickly as possible of these injustices.</P>
    <P>I wish to make an appeal also on behalf of people in the voluntary contribution category and who up to recently appeared to have full health cover for themselves and their families.  There is much concern among this group in relation to the scheme being introduced by the Minister.  The situation is to be that if the income of a manual worker exceeds £5,500 his eligibility will cease.  This is a step in the wrong direction and the people concerned will make known their resentment as strongly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a gap in the social welfare code in relation to the adult dependants of the people who have paid social insurance contributions in so far as dental and optical services are concerned.  This is an old chestnut and one which is highlighted on each occasion on which either a Bill or an Estimate relating to the Department is before the House. From my 14 years experience of the needs of people I am aware that this is an area in which there is great hardship. Every adult, regardless of how healthy he may be, requires either dental or optical care at some stage in his life.  Having regard to the large contributions made by workers and employers in respect of social welfare it is difficult to understand why the insured are not covered for these aspects of the health services.  The same situation applies to children between the ages of 12 and 16. They are without cover for these benefits during this important period of their lives except in instances in which their families have medical cards.  An entirely new approach to this whole question is required from the Department.</P>
    <P>Basically what we should insist on is the provision for the sick, the aged and the unemployed of a standard of living which reflects the standard of living generally in the community.  Up to now we have not been applying the same yardstick in this respect.  Even allowing for the 12 per cent increase in social welfare payments this year, we are not providing an adequate standard of living for the people concerned.  We must have regard to the question of what it costs to <Col N="1502" /> maintain a person, of what should be regarded as a minimum income and particularly in this Year of the Child we should pay special attention to the needs of children.  Some children do not have enough to eat and there are many others who are deprived in other ways.  For example, they are denied facilities that are available to other children in the form of extra-curricular activities which can only be availed of by children whose parents can afford them.  We must do everything possible to provide the kind of environment that will enable our children to grow up to become healthy and balanced adults.  There is need for immediate research in this area.</P>
    <P>We need also a national pension scheme.  For some time past there have been calls for a scheme for that 30 per cent of our population who are self-employed. While we continue to neglect this category there is no point in aspiring to the provision of adequate health and social welfare cover for all our people. The Minister has said that the provision of such a scheme is under active consideration.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Two of the most overworked words in the English language in this country today are &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; and &ldquo;shambles&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; is used daily by those in the media and by others to describe the state of the elementary public services to which a normal community are entitled and the word &ldquo;shambles&rdquo; is used frequently to describe the state of the Government's policies, for instance, the financial and budgetary policies.  The cause of the chaos and the shambles is attributable in no small way to the Government's 1977 manifesto and to their approach to budgetary matters, to social welfare policies and to social welfare provisions of the kind we are discussing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second Social Welfare Bill the present Minister has introduced.  We are also dealing with the second budget this Government introduced since they were returned to office.  The 1978 Budget, implemented by the Social Welfare Act, 1978, gave to what I referred to as the social welfare classes 10 per cent increase right across the board.  The <Col N="1504" /> same budget gave enormous concessions, running into hundreds of pounds and sometimes a couple of thousand pounds, to well-heeled, articulate and hard working people.  When I say &ldquo;hard working people&rdquo; I mean people who worked hard to put the Fianna Fáil Party into Government.  They were given enormous benefits in the form of derating, abolition of car tax and large income tax concessions.  The result of these two operations was to create a very unfavourable and unfair comparison as to how one section of the community were being treated by the Fianna Fáil Government compared with the other section.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe the Fianna Fáil think-tank decided, when thinking about the last general election, that there were not as many votes in looking after the social welfare classes as there used to be. They decided that the votes were to be found in attracting young, hardy, healthy people who resented being taxed, who never thought they would be unemployed and who did not fear the day when they would get old.  They were the people Fianna Fáil decided commanded voting strength and voting power.  It is obvious that they set their aims at looking after those people, or at least attracting them into their party.</P>
    <P>It was the well-off and well-heeled people who benefited from the 1978 Budget to the virtual neglect of the lower income classes.  I said, by way of passing comment, that people with big houses, with two or three motor cars and in the upper band of income tax, did well; but the social welfare classes who live in houses with a £5-£7 valuation, in round figures £50-£70 rates, do not own motor cars and if they are married with one or two children are not involved in paying income tax.  They benefited out of the 1978 Budget by £50 or £70.  The people who primed the Fianna Fáil funds, provided the Fianna Fáil transport for the last election, benefited to the extent of a couple of thousand pounds.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is what has the Government where they are today.</P>
      <P>I have shown how the two classes fared in the 1978 Budget and in my opinion, why they fared that way.  Since the 1978 Budget a number of things happened which affected more severely the lower income groups than anybody else. The most important was the removal of food subsidies to the tune of £22 million. This happened contrary to a solemn assurance given by the present Minister for Agriculture on 7 June 1978 in a radio programme on which himself and the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, spoke.  He said then that food subsidies were not nearly high enough and that on return to power Fianna Fáil would increase food subsidies to cushion the underprivileged people.  We know he did not do that.  That was reported in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on 7 or 8 June 1978.</P>
      <P>Food subsidies were removed between Christmas Day and New Year's Day when people were not thinking very much about these things.  The result of that operation as Deputy E. Desmond said, was to completely neutralise and devour the increases in children's allowances given by the budget.  The increase in milk alone did that.</P>
      <P>Since this Government were returned to power they have been very busy in regard to health cards.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I may be thick but it occurs to me that, if a person in a social welfare category has to pay a doctor and to pay for medicines, he needs more generous treatment from the Minister for Social Welfare.  I may be stupid but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I cannot quarrel with the Chair, but it sounds logical that, if a man has to pay for services in 1979 which he enjoyed free in 1978, he will need more generous treatment from the Minister for Social Welfare.  I will not have a long discussion on health cards but I want to tell the House that 86,000 health cards were removed, cancelled or withdrawn between 1 July 1977 and the present day.  That puts the people who lost them into a more needy category.  Some people who were entitled to them had them withdrawn but you could have an argument about others.</P>
      <P>I suppose one could say that food subsidies are not the responsibility of this Minister but of the Minister for Finance, but of course this Minister is concerned.  The withdrawal of food subsidies and of health cards left the social welfare classes going into this budget under a handicap.  They were given a heavier weight to carry.  Perhaps that is a good way of putting it in these days of the Cheltenham meeting, although these people are far removed from Cheltenham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases of 12 per cent and 16 per cent in social welfare benefits announced in the budget are entirely inadequate having regard to the normal increase in the cost of living which has occurred during the year and the statutory increase in the cost of living represented by the withdrawal of food subsidies and health cards.  It was stated that under the former Government there was an increase in the cost of living, but it was not <Col N="1507" /> an increase due to Government action. The increase in the cost of milk for a child virtually accounts for the increase in the children's allowances.  The cost of clothing and footwear has also risen and the cost of bread and cheese has gone up because of the removal of the subsidy. One could produce a long list of increases in the cost of foodstuffs since this Government came into power, but the increases as a result of the removal of food subsidies come most readily to mind.</P>
    <P>There are several other items in this budget which strikes one very forcibly. The old age pension qualifying age still stands at 66.  This administration have been in power for the greater part of the time since we became independent.  The old age pension qualifying age in 1907 was 70 years of age.  I always know when it was introduced because of a little play called &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; which dealt with it.  When the National Coalition Government came into office in 1973 the age was still 70.  We reduced it year by year to 66 years of age and Fianna Fáil have decided to leave it at that.  This is the second budget since they returned to office and they have not reduced the age to 65, as the Coalition Government had promised to do.</P>
    <P>As people near the age of 65 or 66, they feel more like retiring and doing less work than formerly.  This Government pretend to be very anxious about job creation and I think they created that neat and attractive little phrase.  One of the best ways of helping job creation would be by encouraging more people to retire.  By reducing the non-contributory old age pension qualifying age to 65 they could encourage people to retire who might be in doubt about their fitness to continue working or their financial ability to retire.  Retirement at 65 years of age is the practice in the State service and in most employments throughout the country.  By encouraging people to retire jobs could be made available for young people.  If I were keen on statistics I would be able to tell how many people would then be able to avail of the old age pension and retire, but the Minister has <Col N="1508" /> that information available in his Department. That would be a better system of job creation than knocking down a wall and building another and then rebuilding it when it falls, which has happened to my knowledge as part of the job creation activity of the Government.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife's scheme is being too harshly operated by the Minister's Department.  It should be relaxed.  Desertion is not something that can be measured with a computer or an inch tape.  When it is established beyond doubt that a marriage has broken down and that the couple have lived apart for years and when the woman has no source of income, she should get a deserted wife's allowance and should not be told that she left her husband of her own accord.  Marriages do not break down of their own accord; they break down for a number of reasons.  The husband could put his wife out of the house or things could be so unbearable that the wife must leave.  The two people could be completely incompatible.  A humane Minister and a humane Department should regard that as technical desertion and give the wife an allowance.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable to tell a wife who has no means at all, in a country where there is no free civil legal aid, that she should follow her husband and extract an allowance from him and to contact the Department again if she fails to obtain such an allowance.  My experience leads me to believe that this scheme is not being operated on a realistic basis and is being operated too rigidly.  The test should be: are they living apart and is the wife in want?  That is a fair method of deciding whether the wife should get a deserted wife's allowance.  Of course she could be so cranky that nobody could live with her but that is not her fault.  She is as God made her.  She entered into the state of matrimony and it did not work. She is then thrown out as an odd lot into an unsympathetic world.  She may take up domestic service for as long as she can, or as long as anybody will employ her, but she is still an odd lot and is told to sue her husband for maintenance.  If the Minister studied the matter he would come to the conclusion that the scheme is being operated on too harsh a basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> In his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare the Minister co-operates with other Departments in providing facilities for elderly and disabled persons.  For example, he co-operates with the Minister for Tourism and Transport in providing free transport for elderly persons and other categories.  He co-operates with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in providing a subsidised telephone service. So far, that scheme has not worked. First of all, the people had to have their phone installed which was an expensive job in many cases.  As many of them could not afford to pay for the installation of telephones they did not qualify for free rental.  Recently there has been some change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That made it a farce altogether.  I came across an unfortunate woman with a badly retarded son who, to make matters worse, was suffering from epilepsy, and she did not qualify for a living-alone allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am glad.  I should like to think that I played some small part in bringing that about by writing to the Department.  Under the scheme, as originally operated, an incapacitated wife or an incapacitated husband did not qualify for the allowance.  I agree that the situation has been improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another underprivileged category are those without homes and without relatives who either have accommodation for them or who are prepared to keep them.  These people are housed by local authorities in prefab buildings. Many elderly people are housed in prefabs.  Last week I heard of an old man who is partially paralysed and who had to leave his brother's house because his brother had nine children.  He has now moved into a prefab provided by his local authority.  In many of these cases the local authorities do not provide electric light.  As a result, old people have to hobble around in the dark and cold <Col N="1510" /> and have to use open-flame lamps, candles and all sorts of dangerous heating and lighting appliances.  As the guardian of these people, the Minister should try to get a subsidy from the Exchequer for the provision of electricity in prefab buildings.  It is flying in the teeth of fire regulations to have a naked flame as a source of light in a wooden building.  I suggest that the Minister should inquire into this matter.  In the year 1979 there should be basic toilet facilities in these dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the provision of such facilities is a matter for local authorities.

Surely the provision of toilets and other facilities is a matter for the people providing the accommodation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A week after the budget was introduced I found it necessary to draw attention to the fact that the budget debate was being conducted from the Labour and Fine Gael benches with the exception of some Fianna Fáil backbenchers who were persuaded to come in from <Col N="1511" /> city constituencies.  I am not surprised that we are having the same type of debate today with not a word from Fianna Fáil Deputies from the city of Dublin or the provinces of Connacht and Ulster, or the underprivileged seaboard area. The budget proposes to take from thousands of smallholders the farmers' supplementary allowance or the small farmers' dole.  It also proposes to reduce the allowances payable to thousands of others.  I am surprised that Deputies like Deputy John Callanan, Deputy Mark Killilea, who has a good pair of lungs, and others from the West, are not in here to either approve or disapprove of it.  Fair play to them, they did their best in the party room and they are ashamed to come in here to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it has ever happened before that we have had a Social Welfare Bill before the House without a word of welcome from the Government benches. The usual formula has been for Deputies behind the Minister's bench to congratulate him and to welcome his innovations, one increase or another.  This debate will be closed today without a chirp of welcome or congratulation from the Fianna Fáil benches.  Somebody once called Fianna Fáil &ldquo;the party of reality&rdquo;.  Their backbenchers on this occasion are realists&mdash;they are letting the Minister carry the burden alone.</P>
    <P>Since he became Minister for Health and for Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey has been starved of finance with which to do the things he would have liked to do.  I congratulate him on being innovative in things that do not cost anything.  Were it not for that he would be a sorry sight.  He has worked hard jogging and in matters regarding smoking but he has been only setting up a smokescreen to get the people to forget that he has not got any money for anything.  I congratulate him on his ability to weather the gimmicks of the Minister for Finance and his other Cabinet colleagues in regard to the so-called goodies in social welfare.  The Minister for Social Welfare has been left <Col N="1512" /> with the dirty work today, particularly in regard to the cutting of the farmers' dole. He put the cat among the pigeons at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in that regard.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the small farmers and their unemployment benefits. Anyone who has had a farming background, who has been brought up on a farm, knows that farmers were extremely poor for far too long.  It is true that since we joined the EEC those with farms of more than £35 valuation have done well, their standard of living has been improved.  I do not begrudge them. I was reared on a farm and I am old enough to have experienced the thirties and the forties when things were extremely hard for farmers big and small.</P>
    <P>Even now there is no question of the farmer with a holding of £10, £15 or even £20 valuation being well off.  He is only beginning to get his head above water, to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I wonder how many of the Dublin Ministers&mdash;we heard a lot about them during the days of the National Coalition&mdash;the Dublin economists, know how these farmers live.  Many of them are still in old houses built years ago.  Occasionally we see applications for permission to provide private sewerage facilities in their houses.  Many of them live at the end of old boreens badly in need of repair and in respect of which there is a five-year waiting list.</P>
    <P>They are the people against whom this budget, this Bill, has been aimed. Call it dole or supplementary income or unemployment assistance, this benefit made all the difference to those people between living in semi-primitive conditions and enjoying a standard of living more in keeping with that of their big farmer brothers or their brothers and sisters in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about tax dodgers and tax evasion.  When I hear about abuses of farmers' dole or of unemployment assistance I immediately think that any system of taxation or of social welfare depends on all concerned telling the truth and making a full declaration.  I am sure some people abuse the unemployment assistance system.  I am sure some self-employed people, whether professional or business, abuse the income tax <Col N="1513" /> code but you do not hear much about it. The abuse which a small farmer is accused of is not an abuse, because the guidelines have been laid down.  Any few pounds he gets out of it are spent on improving his house, on making life a little more bearable for his wife and family.  It does not go into a bank and it is not spent out of the country.</P>
    <P>The abuse that the self-employed or better-off person is guilty of is that the money that he reaps out of that is spent either in expensive hotels&mdash;not always in this country&mdash;at various sun-drenched beaches or at places like Cheltenham racecourse.  There is no comparison between the two types of abuse.  The income that the small £10-£15 valuation farmer of Connacht or Ulster is getting&mdash;and I hasten to say that I am not a European candidate when I speak of Connacht and Ulster&mdash;finds its way into the village or small town till.  The money from the other abuse is spent either out of the country altogether or on imported goods.</P>
    <P>In 1977, our last year in office, we recognised that there were some people in the small farmers' social welfare scheme who should not be in it and we were brave enough&mdash;the Minister will probably say daft enough&mdash;to tidy up that in the 1977 Budget.  The Minister now comes into office with a majority of 20 and he makes a savage attack&mdash;I cannot describe it as anything else&mdash;on the small farmers' dole.  A small farmer with a £10 valuation is deemed now to have an income of £200 and from 1 April it will be £300.  If his valuation is £15 now, his income is deemed to be £450; from 1 April it will be £750.  If his valuation is £20, he is deemed to have an income of £600; from 1 April it will be £1,200.  Those figures are altogether too high and it is no reply to me for the Minister to say that the yardstick for income tax for the better-off farmer is not a multiplier of 60 or 50 or 30 but of 125. If that is so the people who have a multiplier of 125 will put in accounts and we know what the result will be.</P>

The Minister tells me that the small farmer can have a factual valuation.  I do not know whether the Minister remembers, as I do, when the social welfare officer used to come to the house and count the hens and the eggs and probe and make a general inquisition into the whole place.

I believe that the backroom boys, who did surveys in the country and who found out where the votes were, tuned the party into the younger people who are in jobs.  That is the only explanation of the way the present Government treat the social welfare classes as against the other classes.

This is the first time that we have ever had a budget introduced, half of one important part of it thrown out a week afterwards as a result of pressure, and the other half thrown out about a week later, followed by an onslaught from another section of the community.  I do not know where this country is going and I do not know where this Government think they are leading it.  This is the Fianna Fáil Manifesto, and Deputy Leyden, sitting up in those benches a few months ago, described it as an historic document.  I am afraid that the manifesto of 1977 and the budget of 1979 will certainly go down in history.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in the debate to make a few observations on certain anomalies and injustices which prevail in the social welfare code in this legislation. It is a system and a code of legislation very much outmoded and archaic.  The Bill before us is remarkable not so much for what it contains but rather for what it omits; not so much for what it gives to the social welfare beneficiaries but rather for what it takes from them.  In view of present high prices, which are spiralling virtually every day, and in a situation where we face another crisis of rampant inflation, resulting in particular from the increase in the price of oil particularly, a malady which afflicted this country a few years ago and seems likely to repeat itself, the increases contained in this Bill are totally inadequate from that standpoint to maintain standards or to improve the lot of the weakest, the poorest <Col N="1516" /> and the most afflicted section of the community.</P>
      <P>When I look down at the table showing the increases which are being given from 1 April I see figures like £2.55 increase in the personal rate of retirement, old age contributory pension.  Surely that is a miserly amount of money in these days?  What will it purchase for these people?  Men all over the country are not able to grasp the significance of increasing costs because we do not take shopping baskets to the various supermarkets all over the country.  The increase in prices generally was brought home to me dramatically this week when I entered a certain hostelry to buy two pints for one of my colleagues and myself and I found to my consternation that I had to dip my hand into my pocket for the second pound in order to pay for those two pints of stout.  The Government will probably find themselves in the Guinness book of records for making the pint cost over 50p in many establishments.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Health will take the view that this is all the better for our health's sake but the pint is a very welcome drink for the poor man.  We also have to consider the price of a pound of meat and a pound of butter which was deliberately increased by the Government recently when they removed the food subsidies.  When we consider all the price increases in recent times the increase of £2.55 in the old age pension and £4.20 for a husband and wife are totally inadequate.  It is almost a year since those people received an increase in their pensions and they will have to wait until this time next year, apparently, until they get a further increase. There is no indication from the Minister in his speech that he will have a second look at the situation before the end of this year.  It was the practice of the previous Government to review social welfare pensions in the autumn of each year and increase them proportionatley with the increase in the cost of living.  This was a very humane thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that this year we face massive inflation and a massive increase <Col N="1517" /> in costs apart from the increase in the price of oil over which the Government have no control.  The working-class people of the country are entitled to substantial increases in wages and salaries to compensate them for those increases, which will be reflected in the cost of living and will affect the poor and all those other people in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>A lot of problems the Government are facing result from their inaction but the extra allowances which social welfare recipients are receiving this year are already outdated and must be improved. We have seen our people survive a very bad winter.  The social welfare recipients suffered a lot and very little was done to help them.  They face a worse summer and winter unless something positive is done and their allowances substantially increased in accordance with the wishes of all sectors of our society.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society, who work very closely with the poor in every city and town in the country, have made their recommendations to the Minister.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the widows of the country, the handicapped and many other categories have made their appeals but so far they have fallen on barren ground.  I ask the Minister to indicate that he realises that the increases given to those people are inadequate, that they need to be substantially increased, that he will review them in the autumn, as his predecessors have done, and will revise them upwards in accordance with the increase in inflation which by next autumn will be in double figures.  Every economist knows that inflation cannot be contained in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister must look again at the less well-off section in our society, those dependent on social assistance, the deserted wives, prisioners' wives, unmarried mothers and all the other unfortunate sections in our society.  The increases given here are less than those given to the other classes to whom I referred.  There is only an increase of £2.20 given to the old age non-contributory pensioner.  We have to compare that increase with the price of butter, fuel, light and meat.  I am afraid that meat is a luxury for the poor and something they can only afford on Sunday. <Col N="1518" /> An increase of £1.20 is given in the prescribed relatives' allowance.  That is a niggardly amount by any standard. Unemployment assistance, the dole, goes up for the single person by £1.40 per week.  One could cite other figures at random.  The best one can find is an increase of £2.35 for a person who is over 80 years of age in the old age pension category, non-contributory.</P>
    <P>Many of the allowances to which I refer are subject to income tax.  I was astonished at a case which came to my notice recently, that of a working man with a young family whose wife is a chronic invalid, bed-ridden, who was in receipt of the appropriate allowance. That allowance was taken into account for income tax on the husband's earnings. I brought that case to the notice of the appropriate Minister but nothing positive was done about it.  While it is not the direct responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare, he has a moral obligation to ensure that the increases he provides for these unfortunate categories of persons are not removed by a colleague of his in the Cabinet, that what he does to improve the lot of the social welfare classes is not undone by the Minister for Finance or anybody else.  However, that anomaly is only too evident as one goes down the list of categories of persons here.  It is particularly true in respect of children's allowances which have been increased meagrely on this occasion by amounts of £1.20 for the first child, £1.40 for the second child and 65p for each subsequent child per month.  Subject to correction I think it is true to say that the childern's allowances in Northern Ireland are about to be increased, if they have not already been, to £4 per child per week&mdash;an odious comparison. Despite the smallness of the amounts of these increases now being given in children's allowances here, of 30p per week for the first child, 35p per week for the second child and 16p per week for each subsequent child, for the first time in the history of the State they will be brought into the PAYE tax net.  The mother of a family who looked forward so much to the receipt of these allowances on the first Monday of each month must now realise that a goodly <Col N="1519" /> amount is about to be deducted from her husband's earnings; the intrinsic worth, the real value of children's allowances has been done away with by this Government.</P>
    <P>I shall deal further with some of these anomalies as I continue.  It seems to me that the avowed policy of this Government is that the poorest must wait until the rich of this country are placated before receiving their fair share of the national cake.  Unfortunately this reality is recognised by our poor, if not by the Government because, since this Government assumed office, we have seen the living standards of the poorest in our society&mdash;meagre though they were&mdash;fall further behind those of average earnings, not to mention all those who benefited from the abolition of the wealth tax.  We know that the poor did not participate in last year's artificial consumer boom nor did they buy new imported cars or take holidays abroad.  Neither did they share in the substantially increased spending on alcohol and entertainment.  The truth is that not alone did they fall behind the rest of society in relative terms but many suffered cut-backs in their real living standards.</P>
    <P>When one takes account of the fact that food prices have increased at a faster rate than did general consumer prices and that social welfare recipients devote a high percentage of their incomes to foodstuffs, it becomes abundantly clear to all of us that the cost of living has increased in the period to which I refer, and not decreased by 6 per cent, as has been suggested by several Government spokesmen.  I am afraid the Government never had, and do not have now, a commitment to social welfare recipients.  They know that the poor are without power and therefore do not need to be reckoned with or taken into account in any political calculations the party may make.  The withdrawal of the food subsidies affected, in the main, the poorest of our people and that is positive proof of that non-commitment.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister comment on remarks made by my colleague, Deputy Eileen Desmond, that he was anxious to claim full credit for the income-related <Col N="1520" /> pensions scheme talked about.  I believe the facts are that this document was published during the period of office of the last Government.  Indeed it is the handiwork of the Leader of our party, Deputy Frank Cluskey.  It was his intention to implement, in their entirety, the salient features of that income-related pensions scheme.  But I am not here to score points in that regard.  It is a matter of complete indifference to me whether it was Deputy Cluskey who was the author of this important income-related pensions scheme or the Minister, Deputy Haughey.  We do consider it to be of very great importance and urgency and I appeal to the Minister to implement the scheme at the earliest possible date.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say he hoped to do so this year.  It is urgent and compelling when one considers the many thousands of industrial workers who face retirement without the possibility of any worth-while pension, save the contributory old age pension which is totally inadequate even to maintain existing living standards.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the implementation of this scheme which will give our industrial workers and the self-employed the assurance that when it comes to the twilight of their lives, when they are no longer able to continue working, they will find solace and comfort in the knowledge that they will have a worthwhile pension which will be comprised of not less than two-thirds of their income at the time of retirement.  Much as I respect some worth-while schemes being offered by life assurance companies and the like I hope these groups will not be permitted to skim off the cream but that this legislation will cater specifically for the categories of persons to whom I have referred and that no Deputy will be allowed to inhibit this scheme in any way or indeed to delay its implementation.</P>
    <P>Social insurance for the self-employed is again vitally important and I would hope that the Minister will include this category in the income-related pension scheme.</P>

      <P>We shall have to wait and see what the Minister really means by getting moving on this important legislation this year.  I appreciate that it is a voluminous document and that it may be difficult to implement, but it has been in the Department now for a number of years.  It is known to have been in existence during the term of office of the last Government.  Many of my colleagues in industry who are in their late fifties and sixties are gravely perturbed that there is no provision made by their employers for a decent pension for them.  This is greatly to be deplored. This lack of regard for the worth of their workers when they come to retirement is a niggardly attitude on the part of private employers.  These workers look to the Government and the Minister to give them this guarantee of some semblance of security in old age.  The implementation as quickly as possible of a really worth-while income-related pension scheme will receive the full backing of this party and, I am sure, of our colleagues in Fine Gael.  I urge the Minister to advise his office staff to get cracking on this as a matter of top priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already talked about this pay-related pension scheme, which was initiated by the leader of this party, Deputy Cluskey, when he was in Government.  Since comparisons are being made in respect of social welfare now and in the past, it is only right and proper that these records be compared <Col N="1522" /> properly.  Let me indicate some of the initiatives undertaken between 1973 and 1977.  The income limit for eligibility for social insurance was removed when pay-related benefits were introduced by the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey.  The pension age was reduced from 70 to 66 years and the means test for eligibility for non-contributory pensions was eased considerably.  When does this Minister propose to reduce the age still further to 65?  It was a consistent policy of the previous Government to reduce the age from the 70 years they found it at when they took office, to reduce it each year by one year until it was down to 66 years.  It has not been lowered since 1976.  So I would ask the Minister to continue the good work and bring the old age pension age down to 65 years of age.  It is a matter of astonishment to many people that this was not done.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances were dramatically increased.  In the case of the second child, for example, the increase was 173 per cent and, in addition, these allowances were made payable to the mother.  An October review of the payments was introduced.  I have already harped on that and I repeat that, while there was reason for review in the past, there is more compelling reason today for a review in October next by reason of the spiralling costs and inflation of a kind which will be very difficult to contain this year.</P>
    <P>Deserted wife's benefit was introduced for the first time.  Similarly, an allowance for unmarried mothers was introduced.  Single women's allowances and prisoners' wives' allowances were introduced and a Bill to consolidate all previous social welfare legislation was introduced.  Free travel for invalided pensioners was inaugurated as well.  A new scheme of supplementary allowances was instituted and a national committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty was launched.  The rates of increases in payments during the period in question were of the order of 125 per cent.  I believe that record compares more than favourably with the Government's, particularly when one remembers that it occurred during a serious recession. <Col N="1523" /> However, there is no room for self-congratulation in this matter, and I am not indulging in that, but I think it is important to put the record straight in regard to what was done and what was not done and by whom it was done.</P>
    <P>The fact is that at present the poor are getting poorer and, given that reality, there can be no moral justification for the Government's declared policy that social welfare recipients must wait until their projected economic miracle has occurred. That miracle is not going to occur. That is evident now to all.  For as long as we remember the poor have been asked to wait for some economic miracle and they are still waiting, and will continue to wait, as long as that philosophy remains.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again briefly to the unfortunate fact that children's allowances have been interfered with and that it is intended to have a clawback by including these allowances in the PAYE net.  I do not know what can be done about it at this stage but it seems to me to be nothing short of trickery and deception to purport to increase children's allowances on the one hand and, on the other hand, to take it away from the husband's earnings.  That kind of trickery and deception, by permitting the tentacles of PAYE to reach into the area of children's allowances, is another one of the things responsible for the many tens of thousands of marching feet in this city and in other towns and cities here at present.  It is unfair and deceitful to give with one hand and take away with the other.  It is not possible to &ldquo;con&rdquo; all the people all the time.  The buck has stopped but unfortunately it has not stopped in this Parliament.  It has reverted to the streets of our towns and cities and it is a bad day for the country and for democracy when people have to protest in such a way in order to secure social justice.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the dole for small farmers has been interfered with.  This assistance has not been paid to a great extent in my constituency, not that we have not poor farmers also, but for some strange reason it has been difficult to obtain unemployment assistance.  Invariably they have been refused the <Col N="1524" /> qualification certificate, even though they were not any better off than small farmers in the west of Ireland.  I deplore the interference with this assistance to small farmers.  Many of them depended on it and its loss will prove a great hardship to them and to their families. They had become used to it and it had become an integral part of their family income.  To withdraw it now at a time of high prices and rising inflation is a severe blow.</P>
    <P>There was no intimation of any kind in the famous Fianna Fáil Manifesto that the dole would be withdrawn or that children's allowances would be taxed. Many small farmers and their families voted this Government into power on the basis that they were best suited to serve the needs of the people.  They have had a rude awakening and they will not forget the deception that is involved in legislation of this kind.  There are many other points that I could raise but they would not be in order in this context. However, they can be referred to at another time.  I have asked the Minister to think seriously about increasing the allowances and, if this is not possible, to give some crumb of comfort to our people and ensure that they will be reviewed in the autumn as heretofore and increased proportionately.</P>
    <P>There are many facilities available to people in the cities and towns that are not available in rural areas.  The free fuel scheme is a valuable concession to poor people, but is confined to the cities.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the scheme to other parts where there is just as much poverty as in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway.  If the Minister does not take steps to cushion the impact of inflation and high prices he will be guilty of a dereliction of duty and of callous disregard for the most needy and helpless in our society.</P>
    <P>There are some anomalies in the prescribed relative allowance to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  This is a valuable and much-appreciated help, but it could be much higher.  The allowance is being increased by £1.20 to £8.80 per week.  This allowance helps to keep an aged parent in the home.  It inculcates a desire on the <Col N="1525" /> part of the family to keep the parent and to care for the old person.  Any increase in this area is money well spent, especially when we consider the cost of maintaining such a person in a hospital or county home.  Today I made inquiries as to the cost of maintaining a person in a country home and I was informed that the cost was estimated at £80 per week. Let us compare that cost against the pittance of £8.80 per week as set out in this Bill.  There is a tremendous desparity in the amounts.  The Minister is anxious to reduce the numbers in hospitals and institutions. I ask him to provide better allowances so that relatives will be encouraged to keep elderly people at home.</P>
    <P>The allowance in respect of home help is desirable.  Home help will care for an invalid, an old person or a mentally or physically retarded adult or chil, but the amount paid by way of allowance is miserly in the extreme.  A sum of £2 or £3 per week is offered for home help and this is an insult in these times of high prices.  It has reached a stage where people are not prepared to do this work of mercy for the pittance offered.  I ask the Minister in his capacities as Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health to do something positive to increase the allowances in respect of a prescribed relative or home help so that fewer people will be sent to hospital and more maintained at home.  That is good economics.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly here in that the prescribed relative allowance is paid to certain designated categories of persons and is not payable to a daughter if she is married.  I appeal to the Minister to end that situation.  Whether the daughter is single or married, if she is doing the work of mercy of caring for her aged father or mother she should be paid the allowance.  There is no reason for a distinction between married and single in this instance and the Minister should do what I ask as an encouragement to people to maintain elderly relatives at home. Many of these married women have heavy responsibilities and find it very difficult to make ends meet without expecting them to bear the additional burden of caring for and maintaining an <Col N="1526" /> aged parent over a long time, doing the work of nurse and doctor, feeding, cleaning and caring for him or her without any recognition or recompense from the Minister's Department.  The married daughter is discriminated against.</P>
    <P>There is also an anomaly or injustice in respect of the administration of the free electricity allowances, free TV &mdash;radio licence and free travel schemes which are much availed of and much appreciated. Is it not wrong if an old couple are in receipt of these &ldquo;perks&rdquo;&mdash;to which they are entitled because the husband is an old age pensioner&mdash;that when the husband dies these &ldquo;perks&rdquo; are withdrawn if his widow is under 66?  To my mind, that is a serious injustice.  They enjoy these important facilities when the husband is alive and they have double the income.  On the death of the husband the income is reduced by half and these important facilities are withdrawn, worsening out of all proportion the situation of the widow.  This is something the Minister should consider with sympathy and understanding and have it rectified. Where these &ldquo;perks&rdquo; are being given the Minister and the Department should be very slow to withdraw them except for most compelling reasons.  It is certainly wrong to do it in the case of an old age pensioner's widow.  Perhaps the Minister can do what is required in this Bill or perhaps he can do it by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>As regards free travel, which is very important, another anomaly arises because in certain areas recipients of free travel are unable to avail of it because no transport is provided on their roadway, public or private, or transport is provided by private enterprise but the proprietors are either unable or unwilling to participate in the scheme.  I have areas in my constituency where private transport is operating, doing a very good job at reasonable cost for the public, but they will not take on free travel recipients.  Some unfortunate people with free travel tickets in their hands are unable to obtain the free travel to which they are entitled by law.  I do not know why these private transport operators are unwilling to co-operate in the Minister's scheme.  There may be good and cogent reasons.  It may be that the <Col N="1527" /> amount paid for such purposes are inadequate or that there is a good deal of red tape and delay concerning payment or the amounts accumulate or something of that kind.  I ask the Minister to see what he can do to make free travel available to all who are entitled to it and try to come to some understanding or agreement with the private operators.</P>
    <P>I think it important that I should designate the areas in question, although the Minister will perhaps know them since I have already been in touch with his Department and I have raised the matter by way of Dáil question.  I realise the Minister's difficulty.  People have a legitimate right not to participate in such a scheme if they wish, but the Minister also has the primary obligation of ensuring that free travel is available to those entitled to it.  Along important stretches of roadway in my constituency where these people have no means of travel it is a great handicap and hardship resulting in much privation.  Very strong representations have been made to me.  I do not wish to reflect on the proprietors of private transport: they have their rights and obligations and they are giving an excellent service, but for some reason they are unable or unwilling to operate the Minister's scheme.  The bus services involved are those from Thurles town serving the areas of Two-Mile-Borris, Gortnahoe, Glengoole, Killenaule and Clonmel.  The same service operates from Clonmel to Fethard, Killenaule, Laffan's Bridge, Ballinure, Horse and Jockey and Thurles.</P>
    <P>There are probably other areas where this is happening.  I hope the Minister will interest himself in the matter and find some suitable arrangement to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to many categories of people involved in this legislation is still too rigid, too extreme in respect of claims for unemployment assistance. It is a matter of astonishment in these times when young men come to you and say &ldquo;I have no stamps to qualify for unemployment benefit.  I had to seek the dole or unemployment assistance. I have qualified for the appropriate certificate and in terms of the means test but all I have been granted is <Col N="1528" /> 50p per week.&rdquo; Sometimes the amount granted is £1 or £2 per week.  Invariably when one queries a case such as the one I have outlined one finds that the income of the boy's father has been taken into account for the purpose of the means test.  We are talking here of ordinary working-class families in which there are young men but where the father is the only person at work.  In such circumstances the shelter of the house is taken into account in the application of the archaic and rigorous means test.  This is a scandalous situation.</P>
    <P>The situation is scandalous also in regard to non-contributory old age pensions in respect of which there are inordinate delays experienced by people who transfer property to a member of their family in the hope of qualifying for the maximum non-contributory old age pension. The transfer of the property involves legal proceedings that can be long and protracted, perhaps continuing for a number of years before the title deeds are presented and the matter cleared up legally.  Although the Department know that this is the position and although legal evidence is presented to the Department to the effect that a property has been transferred to a member of a family, the Department will not act until such time as the title deeds are presented to them.  Where a solicitor intimates to the Department that legal proceedings are in train in regard to the transfer of property with a view to the securing of a pension, the Department should accept that information in good faith and grant the pension. I have known of cases in which the applicants died before the legal proceedings were concluded.</P>
    <P>The provision in respect of telephone rentals for old age pensioners has caused much confusion.  Many people approached me seeking clarification of the situation.  They were under the impression that they were being provided with a free telephone service in the strict sense and that this would include the cost of installation and also the cost of calls but they were very surprised on my explaining to them that the scheme provided only for rental remission.  The vast majority of old age pensioners, especially those in the non-contributory category, <Col N="1529" /> could not possibly afford to have telephones installed and the Minister knew that when he was devising this scheme.  It was wrong to give the impression that these people were being provided with a telephone service free of charge.  Admittedly, the scheme has been of some benefit, but it is not the service that people were led to believe it would be.  In my constituency many old age pensions were helped by their children in regard to the installation of telephones and generally the pensioners pay for the calls themselves.  Even if the scheme provided for the free installation of telephones, it would be impossible in Clonmel, for example, to have the telephones installed because people there who are entitled to top priority, either because of their businesses or because of the service they are providing, are not able to have telephones installed because of the delays in this regard in the Department concerned.  Taking all these matters into consideration I suggest that the Minister be somewhat more reticent in regard to this scheme until such time as it can be backed up more realistically.</P>
    <P>Regarding the free electricity allowance, free travel and free television licence facilities, certain categories of persons are designated as being entitled to these facilities while others are not included, although they too would appear to be entitled to them.  This situation may result from an omission on the part of the Department, or it may be that there is some intention to discriminate against some people.  One case I have in mind and which has been turned down by the Department is that of the widow of an Old RIC man.  This woman is more than 80 years old and qualifies for the electricity allowance, the television licence and the travel facility, but because her RIC pension is paid from Britain she is disallowed these facilities because the category to which she belongs is not designated as one in respect of which the allowances are conceded.</P>
    <P>In respect of the various allowances, the qualifying categories are specified. For instance, in respect of the free electricity allowance the persons <Col N="1530" /> specified are those receiving old age pensions, blind or invalidity pensions from the Department of Social Welfare, persons aged 66 or over receiving contributory widow's pension or deserted wife's allowance and persons aged 66 or over receiving a Garda widow's pension. There is a similarity here.  Why not include old RIC widows as well as Garda widows?  Included also are persons aged 66 or over who are receiving retirement pensions from Britain and Northern Ireland and persons receiving disability allowances.  There may be other categories of persons also receiving pensions from Britain, such as war pensions, who are not included but who are otherwise qualified and who, because their pensions are not specified here, are also disallowed.  I ask the Minister to look at all these categories and have them included.</P>
    <P>The men in the RIC served their country and did their duty as they saw it at that time.  Few if any of them were motivated by malice towards their fellow Irishmen.  Many sacrificed much to serve the cause of freedom in this country, threw in their lot with us and helped to achieve independence.  Many of their sons and daughters distinguished themselves in all walks of life&mdash;in the professions, in the civil service, in business, in commercial life and in the church.  There are very few RIC widows living and I would ask the Minister to include them.  This will not cost the Exchequer very much and will remove the feeling that might be abroad that these people are being discriminated against.  Let us rectify that.  We should honour the reciprocal arrangement which exists between Ireland and the British Ministry of Social Security that all categories of British pensioners living here are given the same facilities as are given to our own people, such as free television licence, free electricity allowance and free travel.</P>
    <P>I want to mention briefly the fact that we are unable to communicate with our constituents.  This affects to a very high degree the categories which we are concerned with in this Bill, the social welfare beneficiaries.</P>

      <P>I understand there are many hundreds of pension books delayed in the post and this is relevant. These pensionsers cannot get their pension books and are suffering hardship because they cannot get the money to which they are entitled.  That is a matter of concern for this Minister and everybody in this House.  We have all been inundated with requests from people who are entitled to receive disability and other benefits.  Their cheques are not coming through the post; they are bereft of their income and have had to resort to supplementary welfare allowances, or home assistance as it was called.</P>
      <P>There are countless thousands depending on the Department.  Their cheques, old age pensions books, widows' and orphans' pensions, invalidity allowances and so on have been held up. I appeal to the Minister to intercede personally, to do the big thing, to help initiate talks to resolve this problem.  Talks can, should and must take place.  Too many people are enduring too much hardship, especially the poorest in our society.  Those responsible for labour relations in the Department directly concerned have a lot to answer for.  They are obviously trying to solve the problems of 1979 with the methods of 1930.  Surely they do not think they can starve people into submission with these archaic tactics? The strictures laid down by the Department must be removed and there must be a meeting of minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to have regard to the categories for whom he is responsible and to try to resolve this problem with his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If the Minister for Health and Social Welfare takes the initiative in this matter, I believe he will find a fund of goodwill and co-operation in bringing this dispute to a speedy and honourable <Col N="1532" /> settlement.  I ask in the name of the poor, the weak and the underprivileged for which he is particularly responsible to do something positive in this area.</P>
      <P>The supplementary allowance scheme was passed by the previous Government to replace the old home assistance scheme which was most degrading and humiliating to all who were obliged to avail of it.  I am sorry to say that this supplementary welfare allowance scheme has solved nothing.  It is still being administered in the same old way by the same people.  Despite the scales laid down in legislation, the same old odious means test still applies.  It seems that the spirit and intention of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Act is not being implemented. Nothing has changed but the name.  The old poor law system still prevails.  The system is still intimidating. It offends, it humiliates and it still degrades.  There is no such thing as a strict entitlement to benefit.</P>
      <P>Means tests are applied rigidly and there is, to my personal knowledge, interrogation in depth of the applicant.  It is astonishing that this should be the case because in the majority of cases the provision of a supplementary welfare allowance can only be regarded as tantamount to a loan.  It is recouped especially in respect of all those who are entitled to social welfare benefits.  When social welfare is to be paid, the amount already paid out in supplementary welfare allowance is deducted at source in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada.  Many of the people to whom I refer would be better off going to their friendly grocer and getting a loan rather than going through this ordeal of getting something which will be taken from them anyway when their social welfare benefit comes to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were not so serious for the unfortunate people concerned, the appeals system involved in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme could be regarded as huge joke. People have to face the harrowing experience of interrogation in depth into all aspects of their lives.  There is no provision made for these people to be represented by a friend or an agent, nor are there any facilities provided in <Col N="1533" /> respect of travel, meals and so on.  The system is a farce.  I have brought this to the notice of the Minister.  He says he is doing something about it, but so far nothing has been done.  There are cases to back up my argument in this regard and urgent action is required.</P>
    <P>The spirit and intention of the Act passed by this House is not being implemented. I believe it is being baulked and stymied.  We are still left with the odious system and people are still in fear and trepidation of availing of it.  I have always maintained that the problem is the attitude of mind of those who administer the system.  Even under the old Home Assistance Act the administrators had wide powers to give.  Some gave generously, others did not.  I believe that still prevails.  The Minister should insist that the spirit of the Act is evident, that there is a proper appeals system where people are entitled to put their case and be represented and where justice is seen to be done.  It seems to be the essence of hypocrisy to purport to hold an appeal and invite a person bereft of income or with only a minimal income to travel a distance of, perhaps, 20 miles, provide food and return home without any recompense.  Let us have a decent system.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Eileen Desmond, referred to the appeals system in respect of the social welfare code generally where decisions are made by deciding officers and conveyed to us as final and binding.  Many of us felt that some of these decisions were wrong and unjust and could be proved to be so if we were only afforded the opportunity.  One individual decided the issue and his word was law.  Neither the Minister nor this House could interfere or intercede on behalf of the aggrieved person.  Let us change that system.  Let the supplementary welfare allowance system be seen to operate justly.  The attitude of many of the people who administer the scheme seems to be at fault.  Scales are laid down and in the majority of cases the money is paid out.  There is no reason why there could not be generosity and the money paid with good grace.  It is easy to be nice to people and that is all we ask. <Col N="1534" /> Many of these officers are kind and humane but the attitude of others leaves a lot to be desired.  It is difficult to understand whether this is due to lack of training or ingrained arrogance.  It is alleged that some are influenced by political motives.  If this is true, it should be a matter of grave concern to all Members of this House.  Some of these people are known to participate actively in politics.  Fair play to them, as long as they do not bring this into their job.  The system must be seen to work fairly.</P>
    <P>I do not mind anybody taking me on politically in any arena, as long as he is out in the open, but I am entitled to resent the cowardly act of discriminating against the poorest and weakest in our society in order to try to get at me politically.  That is totally reprehensible and whenever it rears its ugly head I will challenge it.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters I wish to raise on this Bill.  There will be scope for greater and enlarged debate when the Minister's Estimate comes before the House.  I hope that the Bill before us will be changed radically in respect of the amounts mentioned therein and that the Minister will see to it that they are increased at the earliest opportunity, certainly not later than the autumn as was the practice heretofore.  Never were increases more justified than at present and we all know that the situation will get progressively worse.  The greatest sufferers will be those against whom the winds of adversity blow hardest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an exceptional and important Bill for many people, especially the lower income group, the aged, the incapacitated and those needing special attention.  During the months ahead, from now until 7 June, I am sure that a great deal will be heard about these people.  Why have there been no contributions from Fianna Fáil?  Is it because Fianna Fáil, who over-bid for votes and succeeded in getting 84 members elected, are now in a position to silence them?  Am I right in assuming that that is the attitude of the Government?  Did Deputy Haughey as Minister for Social Welfare say to them, &ldquo;You must not contribute.&rdquo;  If he did not, am I to assume that the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1535" /> Deputies are satisfied with the Bill?  The Minister is a lonesome figure with no help or assistance of any kind. Presumably that lack of help and assistance is at his own bidding.</P>
      <P>Having read the Bill and the Minister's statement, I noticed a discrepancy between the contents of the statement and the contents of the explanatory memorandum.  This discrepancy mainly relates to section 4 of the Bill, the section relating to unemployment assistance for smallholders. Three classifications are listed in the explanatory memorandum&mdash;one, up to £10 valuation; two, from £10 to £15: three, from £15 to £20.  We are told that the present system of assessment is £20 per £1 land valuation for those within the first group, that is, up to £10; £30 for the second classification, that is, from £10 to £15; £40 for the third classification, that is, from £15 to £20.  The Minister said that there were only two classifications at present and I think he is correct.  The explanatory memorandum which we received with the Bill is misleading.  If it is not misleading, then the Minister's statement is.  I am satisfied that the Minister's statement is correct.</P>
      <P>All aspects of our social welfare system are being covered during the debate.  However, it is only right for me, as a Deputy from a rural constituency, to comment on section 4.  Section 4 deals with the reduction of allowances for farmers who qualify under the notional system of assessment.  All such farmers are within the £20 valuation limit.  The proposals in section 4 should not have been included in this measure and the section should be withdrawn.  In recent years there has been a great deal of criticism of the payment of unemployment assistance to farmers.  In some cases the criticism was justified.  The situation was rectified by the introduction of the factual assessment for farmers with valuations of more than £20 who sought unemployment assistance. Whether we like it or not, the position now is that many farmers who qualify for assistance under the notional system are in poor circumstances.  The payment of this assistance has been of great advantage to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> I know as much about farming as any other member of this House as I was born and reared on a small farm. Recently we have heard a great deal about increases in farm incomes but those increases in incomes have not been given to the small farmers.  There is a big difference between a big farmer and a small farmer.  The majority of farmers in the Berehaven Peninsula, the Mizen Head Peninsula and the Sheep's Head Peninsula qualify for assistance.  It has helped them to improve their living standards, to clothe themselves and their families and to provide educational facilities for their children.  It is all very well to say that education is free but we all know that there are many incidental expenses involved in keeping children at school.  There is no doubt that that type of farmer benefited from the scheme. Without that benefit it would not be easy for them to make ends meet.  Therefore, I plead with the Minister to remove section 4.</P>
    <P>Surely a party who said to the people in April, May and June 1977: &ldquo;We believe we can do certain things if we are elected&rdquo;, a party who said to the wealthy: &ldquo;We believe that it is unfair for you to have to pay £10 million in wealth tax in 1977, vote for us and we will remove that tax&rdquo;, who said to householders, big and small, some with valuations of up to £150 in Dublin, Cork and other urban areas, &ldquo;We will not ask you to pay rates.  We are in a position to wipe out rates if we are elected&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all related to the Social Welfare Bill, section 4. They said to motor vehicle owners: &ldquo;Give us an opportunity and we will not ask you to pay tax&rdquo;.  That is how they bought votes in the last general election. That is how they have got the country into its present mess.  Is it not completely out of place 18 months afterwards to say to small farmers that they must accept substantial reductions in their incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will illustrate how small farmers are affected.  A farmer with a valuation of £19 will have his income reduced by <Col N="1537" /> £570; a farmer whose valuation is £12 will have £360 less; a farmer with £10 valuation will have £300 less; and a farmer with £9 valuation will have £90 less.  Is that justice?  This money was paid out in parts of west Cork, in Kerry, Galway, Mayo and the other poorer parts where the land is indifferent and the yield low, where it is hard to get production without feeding the land with fertilisers at very high cost.  Not only was this money used to help production but it also helped the grocers, the drapers, the publicans and other business people in those localities.</P>
    <P>As I have said often since I was first elected to this House in 1951, I do not agree that people should be given money who are not entitled to it.  I have more knowledge of the problems, financial and otherwise, of those people than most people in the streets.  I know their backgrounds, I have shared confidences with them, and I say it is completely unfair that this should have been done to them at a time when Fianna Fáil said to the well-to-do: &ldquo;Keep the wealth tax except the part of it you give to us for the election campaign&rdquo;.  That is what they said, and 18 months afterwards they have asked small farmers with £10 valuations to accept a reduction of £300 a year and those with £16 valuations to accept reductions of £490.</P>
    <P>I recognise the Minister as a reasonable man.  I have more faith and confidence in him than in any other member of the Government, and I am asking him to reconsider section 4 in the circumstances of this year.  Perhaps it could be considered again in future years.  I would not be taking up the time of the House if I did not feel strongly about this.  These benefits have been criticised by people who have no knowledge of the recipients.  I agree that a small percentage were getting these benefits who should not have been getting them, but the system was good.</P>
    <P>The old and the disabled are my next concern.  I suggest that the old age pension system should be restructured, to use a word now in general use.  The only restructuring we have had was in relation to the two-tier system, one concerning <Col N="1538" /> those older than 80 years and the other those between 70 and 80 years. The Minister should have a good look at the entire system.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the National Coalition reducing the age limit to 66 years, many old age pensioners are now reasonably active, enjoying good health.  Perhaps they have assigned their businesses or farms to members of their families and this has entitled them to free maintenance, with some pocket money to boot.  Such pensioners are entitled to the maximum rate and some people might think they are doing well.  They are living with close relatives who are reasonably well off and in some cases the pensions might be described as pocket money.</P>
    <P>On the other side are the incapacitated, the feeble, the bedridden, those suffering from mental deficiencies. They are still entitled to only £13.60 per week unless they are older than 80 years.  There is a wide difference between their circumstances and the others I have mentioned.  I had thought health boards would make up for this difference because even with the extra £2 being given to them they still need special consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy spoke about places in South Tipperary and about payments under the supplementary health scheme. Everything he said about South Tipperary applies also to other places.  I am told that in West Cork, no matter how incapacitated a person is, once he or she is getting the maximum rate of old age pension that person will not qualify for a supplementary allowance.  At one time such people used to get home assistance. Whatever it is called, there should be some variation in this system so that those people get increases over and above other classifications of pensioners. In West Cork&mdash;and I suppose this applies all over the country&mdash;it costs £100 a week to maintain an old person in the district hospital.  District hospitals all over the country are now catering for geriatric patients.  Deputy Treacy said it costs £80 in South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>People prefer to stay in their surroundings and do not like having to go to those geriatric hospitals.  I have been visiting hospitals and institutions for <Col N="1539" /> many years and I have never found a person, no matter what care or attention that person got in the hospital, who did not prefer to remain at home.  Health boards are no good as far as those people are concerned.  I made an application for a supplementary allowance for two cases in West Cork and both of them were rejected.  The Minister may say that we provide home help allowances for people living alone.  In limited cases the highest allowance of £10 a week is paid; in other cases it is £3 or £4 a week. While I maintain that it is the obligation of children to care for their parents, nevertheless we meet difficult cases. There are many families with limited means, where the mother or father is bedridden and needs constant care and attention.  Some person must be in the house at all times to attend to a person like that.  The home help allowance or the disabled person's maintenance allowance should be paid to such people.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of the Cork health authority I tried, as hard as I could, to get this scheme applied to old age pensioners.  We were told at that time that legislation gave local authorities power to pay a disabled person's allowances to certain classes of incapacitated pensioners.  I believe the Minister for Health will take a special interest in the people I am speaking for: those who have lost their physical capabilities, who suffer from arthritis or who are physically or mentally incapacitated. Those people should be given financial assistance.  Our hospitals are full of old people at the moment.  If we were more liberal in making welfare allowances available under a means test, many of those old people could remain at home.  It is not a good idea to send our incapacitated people to hospital if they can remain at home.  I ask the Minister to try to bring in some legislation to make this allowance available to incapacitated people.</P>
    <P>People over 80 years of age qualify for some additional allowance.  This should be paid to people much younger than that.  I was amazed on one occasion to hear a person say that he knew some of those old people who bought drink with the money they got from a State allowance. <Col N="1540" /> Who wants a half pint of stout, a drink of punch, rum or brandy more than those old people?  Who needed it more during the severe weather we had in the first few months of this year? Punch is not available free of charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of the great variation in old age allowances.  I am sure he will be active when he reaches old age, but there are many people who are not very active.  He should take a leaf out of the Coalition book, although I am sure he does not like reading that book.  It is no harm to be boastful at times.  If we had been more boastful in 1977 perhaps there would be more of us here now than there are. Perhaps we were too bashful and allowed the people over there to make the running.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a tremendous innovation that in the period from 1973 to 1977 we reduced the qualifying age for old age pensions by four years.  When the British Government established old age pensions in 1908 they laid down 70 years as the qualifying age.  In the 65-year period between 1908 and 1973 how often did I pose questions to various Ministers about a reduction in the qualifying age for old age pensions, maintaining that everything had changed since 1908? However, the qualifying age obtained.  It was contended that it would be too costly to implement a reduction, that it would be out of place.  But what happened then?  How did we address ourselves to Bills such as this one?  Not alone did the Coalition Government reduce the qualifying age for men, but they included wives irrespective of age and eased the means test beyond measure.  That did not happen so long <Col N="1541" /> ago.  Perhaps it could be said that eaten bread is soon forgotten.  Apparently some of that bread was forgotten on the 16 or 17 June, on whatever was the date of the election.  It must be kept on the plate now and the Minister must sustain the reduction we initiated.</P>
    <P>We were all out in our guesses because we thought that, with the European and local elections this year, the Government might reduce the old age pension limit to 65.  But I suppose, having paid so much in 1977 for office&mdash;if I may use that term&mdash;they got fed-up. Perhaps the Minister for Economic Planning and Development thought it would be unwise to go into the auction mart again, particularly on social welfare.  I would appeal to the Minister, if not this year, then next year, to consider a further reduction in the age limit and the advisability of following the example of the National Coalition when they effected two reductions in the one year&mdash;one on 1 April and another on 1 October.  With food prices increasing so much on essential commodities like butter, tea, sugar, that kind of injection is warranted for the benefit of old people and can well be justified.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the system of determining claims.  I know that the means test has changed completely and that the vast majority of pensioners now qualify without question.  Nevertheless, there are some who qualify, but who do not receive the pension.  The system is completely different from what it used to be in the old days.  For example, when I first came into this House one could go along to the Department of Social Welfare, sit down with an appeals officer, discuss the position of a particular applicant with him and he would make a decision.  He would listen to all the points one would advance and then arrive at a decision.  It was an excellent system.  At that time the appeals officers were the right type of people for the job.  They were approachable, understanding and had the attributes and qualifications needed by such people.  They were only too willing to listen, to discuss the pros and cons of different cases.  But that system was abolished by Fianna Fáil, because the Minister handed over all of <Col N="1542" /> his powers.  As I understand it now, theoretically, the Minister is almost naked of power.  That is not a good idea. Regardless of what Government is in power, I believe that any Government Minister should have the final authority. I do not think it should be farmed out to anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was done under the Supplementary Welfare Act by which the Coalition Minister divested himself of the power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was gone before then, and it should not have been the case.  Since the Management Act was enacted here some years ago it has been the practice of parties to divest themselves of power, to hand over to enterprises of one kind or another, even to hand over to State boards and bodies. The country is swarming with commissions, boards and so on.  I have always been a firm believer in the Minister of the day having the final say in his Department. That is what democracy is all about.  The Minister and his Government must go to the country to seek approval or otherwise of their policies, whereas other people can remain under shelter. They are not at fault; rather is it the fault of this House which divests itself of almost all its authority and hands it over to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Oral hearings are seldom held in non-contributory old age pension cases.  I would ask the Minister to inform whoever is in charge of that section that oral hearings, when requested, should be allowed.  I applied for an oral hearing on behalf of two applicants quite recently, a husband and wife.  If what those applicants told me repeatedly was factual, then they were being denied the maximum rate of pension to which they were entitled.  The decision of the appeals officer was that they were not entitled to a pension of any kind.  I asked for an oral hearing.  These people, in the winter of their lives, were prepared to come along, take the Bible in their hands, swear to their means, but that was denied them. That type of practice, this high-handed manner of determining such cases, is completely out of place.  I want the Minister to take cognisance of the position <Col N="1543" /> of applicants who seek oral hearings and who, additionally, are prepared to swear to their testimony.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting the increasing inadequacy of the road network and the steady deterioration of rail rolling stock, calls on the Government to implement the CIE proposals for the Dublin Rapid Busway and rail system as a matter of urgency, thereby providing an effective commuter service whilst also creating much needed employment.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allocating the time for this discussion.  The topic that Fine Gael have chosen for discussion today is one that concerns over a million people who are living in this congested city of ours and in its environs.  It is very ironic that Dublin, which was once noted for having the most efficient tramway service in Europe, should now have the slowest and most inefficient public transport service in Europe.  This is due not to any lack of dedication or efficiency on the part of the public transport authorities but to the accumulation of neglect on the part of other authorities in this region for several decades past.  A crisis has now been reached which requires an immediate solution to cater for the movement needs of our people for several decades to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public transport is required in any modern city to answer a human need. The purpose of a public transport system is to assist people in moving from their places of residence to their places of work and as they go about their <Col N="1544" /> business.  But the congestion in Dublin is now so great that for many hours every day public transport is unable to move at all.  Journeys that are scheduled to take, say, half an hour may take an hour-and-a-half or two hours.  Buses which ought to be collecting passengers, receiving revenue from them and operating efficiently are often forced to remain stationary in the street within sight of potential passengers who are unable to get on them because the buses are unable to move towards the stops where the people are waiting.</P>
    <P>This matter has not been overlooked by the transport authority.  They have made many requests over the years that greater facilities be given to the public transport vehicles in the public streets but most of those requests have, unfortunately, fallen on deaf ears.  But in 1972 they took the very sensible step of producing a Dublin transportation study and in 1975 CIE published a Dublin rapid rail transit study which was then submitted to the local authorities concerned and to Government Departments. A more practical and specific step was taken by CIE when they made a proposal for the urgent implementation of the first phase of a new Dublin rapid rail transit system which would involve the electrification of the existing railway from Howth to Dublin city and beyond to Bray.  That study is a most convincing document about the various systems which can be operated to move people about any modern metropolis.  What is most convincing, and I believe unanswerable, is the case they make for using our existing rail lines for the movement of people who so urgently require to be moved efficiently.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael find it very distressing that a Government, who before they were given power by the people made a promise to have an urgent study of the problem carried out, have to date apparently not accepted the arguments which have already been put before them but took nearly 18 months after they went into office to establish yet another committee of their own to evaluate what had already been submitted by CIE.  We will accept the <i>bona fides</i> of this study, and indeed the <Col N="1545" /> Government in their amending motion suggest that Dáil Éireann should note this study and should await its outcome. But even before the study has been completed we now have a Minister of the Government being highly critical of any proposal to electrify the railways or to provide a rapid rail transit system such as CIE propose.  When we find that that is the Minister who is charged with the responsibility for planning we must naturally despair and feel that, instead of having an objective study, an effort is being made to clobber the suggestions and the proposals which have already been put before the Government.</P>
    <P>Any Dublin person must be very concerned that this city is coming to a standstill, that it is virtually being strangled and that what was once a pleasant city to live in and to move about in is now becoming one that people try to avoid.  They know that, if they go into the centre of the city during any average working week, they are likely to find themselves at a standstill, be it in a bus or in a car or, if they happen to be pedestrians, obliged to walk all the way home to the suburbs.</P>
    <P>I suppose everybody tends to become a traffic expert as a result of his own experience.  Personal experience has taught me that it is often much faster to walk from the centre of the city to Terenure, which is distance of three-and-a-half miles, than to rely on public transport which will not come, not because the vehicles are not there but simply because they cannot move.  My personal experience today contrasts very sharply indeed with my childhood experience when trams ran in the area and when one could get in or out of town in a matter of 15 or 20 minutes.  Trams were taken off the roads, ironically enough, because they were regarded as being too slow and lacking in mobility.  But they kept to the lines and got people to and fro, although admittedly then the streets were not choked with private transport.</P>
    <P>We must avoid the temptation to treat the private motorist as the villain of the situation.  The private motor car is here to stay until some better way of getting people around is invented.  But quite a <Col N="1546" /> number of the private cars operating in the Dublin region today are operating because potential users of public transport are so frustrated with public transport and so disappointed with its non-availability that they have in desperation taken to their own cars, thereby of course aggravating the problem.  But no city in the modern world has been able to find a solution to its transport problems by imposing a ban upon private transport.</P>
    <P>What is obviously needed is to separate public transport and private transport.  That is not a new concept.  If we travelled in this European Community of ours we would find innumerable cities, on mainland Europe in particular, where there is separation of public and private transport going back for decades and generations.  I am not talking about railways or subways.  I am talking about the public streets where the paths for the public service vehicles have been kept free because there was a recognition that, where public service vehicles were moving a large number of people, they should be given priority over private vehicles which tend to take up much more space and transport a much smaller number of people for any given length of the roadway.</P>
    <P>The situation at the moment is appalling. It is very distressing to see in the White Paper of January this year, which apparently was intended to indicate the Government's mature consideration of earlier talks published in the Green Paper in June 1978, that the Government are apparently running away from the concept of public transportation which received a kind of mild approval in their earlier paper.  It appears now that CIE are being prepared for a let-down and a rejection of their proposals.</P>
    <P>There is a recognition in both papers that there is a real problem in the movement of people in the Dublin region.  It is unfortunate that sufficient attention is not being given to the much more serious problem that will arise in Dublin in the next ten years.  The latest indication is that the Government simply propose to maintain the existing rail system.  One certainly hopes that at least they will provide some new rolling stock and better station facilities and also increase <Col N="1547" /> the number of hours each week during which the system will operate. Even assuming that will be done, it will be only scratching the problem.  It will not begin to provide a worthwhile solution and it will not even serve the needs of 1979.  By 1990 the Dublin region will have a population of about 1,500,000 people and it will not be possible to serve that number even if the road network is improved substantially and bus lanes introduced on the streets, thereby reducing the space available for private vehicles. By 1990 it will not be possible to move the people of Dublin in a reasonably efficient manner unless there is a dramatic improvement in the rail facilities on the lines recommended in the Dublin rail rapid transit study report.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in the light of further experience it will be necessary to amend the specific proposals made in that report, which is worth reading and is deserving of mature consideration.  The enormity of the problem and the challenges ahead cannot be faced if the Government are going to deal with the matter in the rather mealy-mouthed way outlined recently by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in an interview he gave to a new journal called <i>Southside.</i>  The journal stated the following:</P>
    <P>The rapid rail plan is not the only option for the future of suburban rail, according to the Minister for Economic Planning.  He said, &ldquo;There is nothing to prevent modernisation of the existing system which would be done for less than one-fifth of the cost.&rdquo;  Dr. O'Donoghue also blamed CIE for the delay in a Government decision on the rail plan.  CIE had sought sanction for the electrification of the rail as a first stage but the Government had asked for details of the entire plan.</P>
    <P>It is our information that CIE have given all the information sought by the Government, and if the situation is otherwise I ask the Minister in the course of this debate to indicate what information has not been supplied.  This matter is extremely urgent if we are to <Col N="1548" /> answer the needs of the people of Dublin to get on the move again.</P>
    <P>I recall&mdash;and the Chair will understand my cynical feelings in recalling it&mdash;the slogan of the administration now in office during the election campaign. They asked the electorate to give them office in order &ldquo;to get the country moving again&rdquo;.  Public transport, and all transportation in Dublin, has slowed down seriously in the past three years. There was a time when people could avoid the delays and congestion of peak hours by selecting other times to get through their city, but now on many days one can be certain of serious traffic congestion from 8 a.m. until 7.30 p.m. The situation is getting worse.  The problems are being multiplied every year and in that situation I was extremely disappointed to hear a member of the Government, and the Government themselves in their White Paper, contemplating merely to maintain the existing rail system.  That cannot hope to transport any more than a tiny fraction of the numbers who want to move about this city.</P>
    <P>In 1970 the existing rail system was transporting 14,000 commuters every day.  Eight years later the same system, with antiquated rolling stock and with depleted services&mdash;they were reduced in the interim&mdash;was transporting 33,000 people on the antiquated rolling stock that was breaking down frequently.  We have a situation now where there are no rail services on Sunday in the Dublin region and the services on Saturday are less than those on weekdays.  Although the central Dublin shopping areas do a large proportion of their business on Saturdays and people want to get into the centre, in many cases the rail services are not here to answer the public demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no rail services to the Dublin suburbs after 8.30 p.m.  The last train on the northern line leaves at 8.25 p.m.  If there is a very valuable piece of capital equipment that is capable of transporting people efficiently, one should want to attract the <Col N="1549" /> greatest possible number to that system, but because of the decaying conditions of Dublin rail rolling stock CIE have been forced against their will to reduce their services.  They have been forced to limit the number of hours each day in which they can use their locomotives because they have to be withdrawn for frequent servicing.</P>
      <P>That is a deplorable situation.  The experts engaged by CIE for the study estimate that if modern, efficient rolling stock was made available on the existing line from Bray to Howth they could cater for 82,000 people each day instead of 33,000 people.  I think that figure is pessimistic.  I think the number who avail of an efficient electrified rail system on the existing line from Bray to Howth would be more than 100,000 people each day if the service was provided and operated as it should be in a modern city from 6 a.m. to midnight and seven days a week.  If such a service were available its attraction would be obvious and many people who at present through frustration are forced to use their private vehicles to get to the city would leave them at home.  I have been so assured by many acquaintances living in places as far apart as Dún Laoghaire, Killiney, Booterstown, Howth, Sutton and Raheny but they will not do it unless and until that service is provided.  It is no solution to the problem to suggest that in this day instead of electrifying the existing lines new diesel locomotives and new carriages would be provided which could not operate on an electrical system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be highly undesirable that our rail system should be dependent on the availability of diesel oil alone.  Admittedly, the larger proportion of our electricity is generated today from foreign energy sources but at least some of it is produced locally from hydro-electric stations and turf.  I recall the days of the last war when those who were fortunate enough to live on the tram line which in those days operated by electricity had the joy of having a really excellent travel service beginning at five o'clock in the morning in Terenure&mdash;my colleague and neighbour from Terenure knows what I am talking <Col N="1550" /> about&mdash;while the rest of the city had very limited bus services, bus services which used to have their terminus in the centre of the city but which had their terminus changed to points in the suburbs on the tram line because the electric trams were able to continue to operate. At that time, of course, a much higher proportion of our electricity was generated from hydro-electric stations but I quote the instance simply to remind the House of the fact that electricity is generated from a variety of sources and when you have such an essential service as public transport there is a lot to be said for operating it by electricity.  Electrified railways have been found in countries abroad invariably to be the most efficient way of transporting people in an urban environment.  It is most unlikely that our transport problems are much different from theirs.</P>
    <P>Briefly I should like to put on the records of the House the proposals made in the CIE report on a Dublin rapid rail transit system.  They have asked for £41 million in order to electrify the existing line from Howth to Bray.  That sum at 1978 prices would electrify that line completely and would also provide all the rolling stock and motors required to operate the system.  The second phase, which CIE have not yet put before the Government because they are waiting for approval of the first one, would involve an expenditure of £45 million and would provide a similar electrified system to Clondalkin and Lucan, with a spur to the city of Tallaght.  Tallaght is now almost as large as the city of Cork but the only public transport system through that city is now so inefficient that, although CIE have trebled the number of buses on that bus line in the last three years, the people of the area are obliged, sometimes beyond their private means, to purchase motor cars in order to transport themselves in and out of the area.</P>
    <P>The county council, with immense foresight and in consultation with CIE, reserved a strip of land from the existing Dublin-Cork line to the centre of Tallaght and to construct a railway line along that stretch now would require the acquisition and demolition of only <Col N="1551" /> twenty buildings.  Yet the people of Tallaght and the environment are obliged to suffer the inconvenience of spending one and a half hours per trip each way to and from the suburb, which I think is seven miles from the centre of the city to get to and from work because the buses are unable to move along the choked roads.  The Government White Paper suggests that the problem can be met by simply maintaining the existing system and remarks of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in the last fortnight would suggest that apparently that is the limit of their appreciation of the problem.</P>
    <P>Tallaght is not the only area of population explosion.  We have it in Blanchardstown and Clondalkin.  CIE, with considerable foresight, pointed out in their report that these areas which are going to be new cities as big as Cork in another five or ten years cannot be adequately serviced unless the rapid transit system on rail is provided for them.  I say rail because it is not possible to provide efficient public transportation unless you separate the means from streets already choked with private transport.  I assume that a Government that abolished car tax in order to encourage people to buy more cars will not now suggest that people should be penalised for bringing their cars to the city&mdash;or perhaps that is what they have in mind; certainly, that is the logic of what was said in the White Paper and in the most recently published remarks of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Dublin transportation survey, the third phase recommended that a new line be built to Blanchardstown and also a line to that metropolis which is now 14 or 15 years old, Ballymun.  If and when such a line is constructed I think it should go further and a line should be taken to the airport which is only across the fields from Ballymun. That can be looked at in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>The final phase of the recommended rail system for Dublin would involve tunnelling in the central area of considerable congestion and business density so as to link all these radial lines <Col N="1552" /> which would provide Dublin with some element of efficient transportation of people as we enter the 21st century.  If we do not do that, Dublin will continue to die.  The strangulation of the centre of the city is adding enormous cost to our economy and our society.  One of the tragic things is that when people are talking about alternative transportation systems too little attention is paid to how much the existing inefficiency is costing us.  CIE say that traffic congestion in Dublin is now costing them about £1.5 million per annum.  I think that figure is probably understated.  That is not the end of the cost.  What is it costing in human misery, anxiety, frustration, wear and tear on people's nerves every day?  It costs an immence amount.  What does it cost in the running of private cars and the massive consumption of fuel as cars sit in choked streets?  A few minutes walk from this House brings one to Pearse Street where daily there is traffic congestion in which both public and private vehicles often must spend half and hour negotiating a distance of five yards.</P>
    <P>This is the situation despite the existence of a new bridge across the Liffey, even if that bridge was built about 50 years too late.  I am amazed that, in the light of this appalling situation, the Government appear to be prepared to allow the matter drift.  We are told that they have established a study group to consider the matter, but all they have to do is to walk around Dublin any day to realise the extent of the problem.  What we need is a solution, but anyone who knows Dublin will be aware that an adequate solution will not be found on the streets of this city alone.  The population of Dublin is expected to increase to almost 1,500,000 people in 11 years' time.  Many of these people will find themselves confined to the dormitory towns of Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan, Ballymun and so on, effectively cut off from the excitement and the commercial life of central Dublin, unless we tackle the transportation problems in the way suggested by CIE in their excellent report.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Dublin was noted once for the efficiency of its transport <Col N="1553" /> system.  That is a matter of public record.  Today the average speed of public transport in Dublin is the walking pace of four miles per hour, and during peak times of movement of people this average is reduced frequently to a mere one or two miles per hour.  That is the sort of situation that leads to the death of a city.  Therefore, I urge the Minister and also all of his colleagues in Government to give to the question of the transportation needs of Dublin the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be political in this instance, though perhaps it is difficult not to adopt a political stance on every argument one offers after 20 years' experience as a Member of the House. However, on this matter we must be above political rivalry.  The problem of the movement of people in Dublin is so serious that it must be given priority.  We are in the happy situation now that we are to receive from the EEC, as a result of the introduction of the EMS, a bonanza of £70 million for a few years for the purpose of providing the infrastructures we need.  I suggest that a significant proportion of that money be earmarked for dealing with the transportation problems of this city.  I have thought often that one of the effective ways of helping the west would be to improve the roadway from Dublin to Kilcock.  Travellers could then arrive in the west of Ireland an hour earlier than would otherwise be the case.  Therefore, we would be helping the whole country by dealing with the congestion problem in the capital.  The problem would be eased if we were to adopt and implement quickly the proposals in the Dublin rapid transport study.  Not merely would this provide for an easement of the situation but it would lead to a situation in which people would abandon the use of the private car in favour of a transport system that would enable them to reach their destinations in a quarter or perhaps a tenth of the time required now.</P>
    <P>Each day 33,000 people are transported by means of a hopeless and antiquated system.  If the four phases suggested by CIE were to be implemented, as many as 250,000 people would be moved by rail in Dublin every day and <Col N="1554" /> journeys which now require an hour or an hour-and-a-half to accomplish would be accomplished in about 15 minutes. That would constitute an improvement in the quality of life in Dublin so exciting and so necessary that it should be given immediate priority.  If we do not make this move in the dynamic and dramatic way suggested, the existing service will become much worse and this city will die before our eyes.</P>
    <P>We must endeavour to separate the problem of public transport from that of private transport.  Otherwise, there will be an increasing number of private cars on the road, there will be more congestion, CIE will lose more money and the Government will be required to provide more money by way of subsidies in order to maintain, as they suggest in their Green Paper, the existing services even though it is clear that these existing services are not adequate.  If we adopt the plan we will have a situation in which Dublin can begin to &ldquo;move&rdquo; again.  It is my privilege to be a member of the European Parliament.  Unfortunately, because that is a &ldquo;flying parliament&rdquo; one is required to move around a good deal. Recently I calculated that I had visited 52 European cities in a 12-month period. From my personal observations I can say honestly that the traffic congestion is not half as bad in any of these cities as it is in Dublin.  This is because other people recognised the problem and dealt with it.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, we have always been limited in terms of capital, but we are now to receive increased resources for infrastructure.  Never before have we had a better opportunity than this for earmarking funds for such a worth-while project as the easing of our traffic problems.  If we take this step now we will be providing employment for 12 years for about 1,500 people.  Arrangements have been made by CIE with a continental electrical firm for the manufacture of the equipment needed for the electrification of a transport system in Ireland.  Therefore, apart from the very obvious need to provide better transport facilities in Dublin, we would be providing 1,500 jobs for 12 years.  If we take this action now Ireland can become a new industrial base for the supply of electrical equipment for urban <Col N="1555" /> rail systems across the rest of the Continent.</P>
    <P>At the end of 12 years I would not regard the 1,500 jobs to be at an end because, with the continued expansion of the country and the hoped-for increased prosperity, there would probably be a need to extend further the electrification of our railways.  If we accomplish this plan we will have a situation in which 250,000 people will have access to a rail system within ten minutes of leaving their homes and will be able to reach their employment within half an hour. But if we fail to implement this plan we shall be condemning these people and their families to living in a city in which it would be much faster to walk than to travel in any type of vehicle, be it private or public.  I am sure the Minister would be thrilled if he was able to satisfy his personal ambition to start or to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The Minister will get every assistance in applying pressure where it is needed in order to get the resources for the construction of a Dublin transportation system which will be not merely a matter of prestige.  I have not at any stage suggested that we should have a public transport underground because other cities have them, but I am arguing that we must have it if people are to be able to move when they want to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> I feel that many of those who complain about the public transport system and the traffic congestion in Dublin and who call for immediate and simple solutions fail to appreciate the nature of the problems involved and the complexity of the issues which arise.</P>
    <P>The first thing that should be remembered is that the problems we are talking about are a reflection of the reasonably rapid economic growth we have had and the tremendous improvement in social standards and conditions which our people have achieved in recent years.  It is not long since Dublin was a compact city in which journeys to work, to shop and for recreational purposes were short and convenient.  The level of car ownership was relatively low and traffic could move fairly freely through the streets.  Public transport, for the reasons I mentioned, was efficient, reliable and profitable.</P>
    <P>There has been a very significant change since those days.  Economic growth has cut emigration, increased employment and led to a rise both in population and in standards of living. Our cities and towns have grown in size and in the case of Dublin we have seen the development of large new residential areas in places where only a few short years ago we had green fields.  With the rise in prosperity a much larger proportion of our people could attain to car ownership and this has led to very substantial commuter traffic by car to and from the city each day.  In addition, the general level of trade and commerce has caused a considerable growth in the number of commercial vehicles using the roads.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which have brought an increase in our population and which have brought car ownership within the reach of so many are of course a matter of pride and satisfaction for all.</P>
    <P>They have, however, also brought with them many of the problems of modern life which other large cities already experience including the problems of congestion, noise and pollution. As a consequence of congestion, public transport services have declined in quality with consequent loss of passengers and revenue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> These problems are common to all developed countries and have been the subject of considerable study, debate and experimentation in Britain, in Europe and in North America.  There are different schools of thought about how these problems should be tackled and, over time, ideas as to the best solution have changed according as experience and circumstances have demonstrated the inadequacy of many of the policies adopted.  Despite the dissatisfaction and frustration which we complain about I doubt if many people would want to go back to the standards and the life-style which they had a couple of decades ago. I was interested to hear Deputy R. Ryan mention trams as if the congestion at that time was anything like it is today. We all want to enjoy the benefits of the economic, technological and social changes of recent years and so we are faced with the problem of how to retain these benefits while freeing ourselves as far as possible from the unwelcome features.</P>
    <P>These issues have not arisen overnight. They have developed over a period of years.  The Government before and since taking up office have shown a keen awareness of the problem and I believe that the question of public transport has received greater attention from the Government over the past year than at any previous time.  Our awareness of the importance of the transport sector and the various problems arising in that sector are evident from the fact that our pre-election manifesto contained a commitment to establish a body whose terms of reference were</P>
    <P>to investigate and report on the measures necessary to achieve the most efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers having regard to the need to maintain a flexible competitive transport system&mdash;thereby ensuring the facilities necessary for industrial development through the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>This commitment has since been honoured in the establishment of the Transport Consultative Commission.  I <Col N="1558" /> will return later to the work of this commission in so far as it relates to today's motion but I should emphasise that pending their deliberations and report the Government have by no means ignored the problems of urban transport, which have received particular attention in the economic planning documents issued as part of the regular planning cycle.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper on National Development referred in particular to the problem of urban traffic congestion, to the serious delays which this is causing in the movement of passengers and goods and to the consequent increases in costs and frustration to the travelling public.</P>
    <P>The White Paper recognised that there is no easy solution to the vicious cycle of increasing traffic congestion leading to deterioration in bus services which in turn causes people to rely still further on private cars, a trend which inevitably causes greater congestion of traffic, increased costs and loss of revenue to public transport and consequently increased Exchequer subvention.</P>
    <P>The White Paper referred to the various measures which might be taken to alleviate the problem&mdash;for example, the extension of parking controls, stricter enforcement of parking regulations, extension of flexi-time in the public service and the staggering of school opening hours.  The White Paper also recognised that improved public transport services could lead to a substantial alleviation of the problem and stated that the Government accordingly saw public transport as having a developing role in urban areas.</P>
    <P>In this context the Dublin commuter rail services have a particular value and in the White Paper the Government made it clear that they are committed to the retention of these services&mdash;they would not accept Deputy R. Ryan's definition of the word&mdash;and recognised that their contribution helps to reduce the flow of road vehicles, both buses and cars, which would otherwise be entering and leaving the city during rush hours.</P>
    <P>As is generally known the existing rolling stock and support equipment of these services are not in very good condition <Col N="1559" /> and the fulfilment of the commitment to maintain the services as part of the city transport system will therefore involve new investment and this investment could be very substantial.  The question of what type of system we should provide must therefore receive careful examination.  This is necessary not only because of the financial implications but also because we are anxious to ensure that whatever approach is adopted is appropriate for the overall transport needs of the city.</P>
    <P>These considerations indicate the need for a very careful look at the proposals for the future of the service.  In order that I could approach the matter in an informed way, I went last year to see the transport services in a number of cities and to familiarise myself with how things were done elsewhere and what lessons might be learned from the experience of other cities.</P>
    <P>I visited Newcastle-on-Tyne where a modern rapid transit system is at present being developed.  I was particularly interested in that city because I found many analogies with the position in Dublin.  In Newcastle they had a commuter rail system based on mainline track.  It was regarded as unsuitable for modern travel needs and it was losing money.  They are now converting it to a modern rapid transit operation linking the old lines with some new track, including about four miles in tunnels.  It will be interesting to see how it will perform in terms of passenger carrying, relief of congestion and financial results.</P>
    <P>A feature of the position in Newcastle was the high place accorded to public transport in the approach to road use and traffic regulation.  There are a large number of exclusive bus lanes and other bus priorities which enable the bus services to escape at least some of the congestion and to provide a better public service.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I welcome the increased interest here at home in the relationship between the quality of public transport and the approach to traffic management and control.  A useful and welcome result of the increased concern here about transport problems is the greater public understanding <Col N="1560" /> of the difficulties of transport undertakings.  It is entirely understandable that people waiting for buses or affected by interruptions in train services should tend to blame CIE and to assume that the difficulties are caused by failures in that undertaking.  There is now, however, a growing realisation that the growth in car traffic and commercial vehicle traffic causes tremendous interference with the movement of public transport vehicles and makes it very difficult to maintain schedules.  I believe people understand also that, while draconian curtailment of private cars may not be acceptable, some measure of priority for public transport is essential. Public transport is a service for the community as a whole and I think that public opinion is beginning to recognise this.  I am sure that, given the support of the public and of all the interests concerned, CIE can provide a service to meet the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific CIE proposals for the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban rail line, including the acquisition of new rolling stock and the provision of new signalling. There has been criticism about the time taken in reaching a decision on these proposals.  It must, however, be recognised that the expenditure involved&mdash;over £42 million according to the latest estimate available to me&mdash;is very considerable, in spite of what Deputy Ryan thinks of it.  While the Dublin commuter rail services make an important contribution to the city's transport services, nevertheless they must be considered within the context of total public passenger movement in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of the city and in particular the development of new areas, there are large numbers of people in other areas for whom public transport is essential for travel to and from work and who find the present transport services inadequate.  Given the inevitable limitation on the overall resources available, we must take account of the needs of the total community and ensure a balanced pattern of investment and development.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated also that the city bus and rail services incur losses which <Col N="1561" /> have to be met by Exchequer subsidy. Although the proposed improvement in the Howth-Bray services would attract additional traffic, there is no prospect that they could operate on a totally commercial basis, meeting capital and interest charges.  The extent to which the deficit might be reduced depends on the volume of additional traffic which the improved services might attract.  CIE would propose to operate a frequent service throughout the entire day and, while this would no doubt be welcomed by the residents of the areas served, it is necessary to consider whether the total population served and the volume of the traffic generated would be adequate to support regular off-peak services to a level commensurate with the very large investment involved.  It has been suggested that the numbers travelling could be trebled.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious, therefore, that the CIE proposals had to be very carefully examined by my Department and the other Government Departments concerned. This examination entailed the identification and examination of possible alternative options for continuation of the services&mdash;for example, by retaining diesel traction and operating at various levels of service.  A variety of options faced us.  Consideration had to be given to the forecasts of traffic and revenue made by CIE, the various costings for the electrified system and the alternative options, how the expenditure would be financed and so on. This was inevitably a lengthy process.  The matter is, however, now at the stage of being considered at Government level.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the Government are committed to the continuation of the Dublin rail commuter services.  What has to be decided, however, is whether electrification of the Howth-Bray line is the best course to adopt at this stage in the light of available resources and of the overall transport needs of the Dublin area.  The proposals are under active consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion refers to CIE's proposals for the Dublin rapid busway and rail system.  I am aware that CIE commissioned consultants to carry <Col N="1562" /> out a study of rapid transit systems for the Dublin area and the consultants in a report completed in 1975 entitled <i>The Dublin Rail Rapid Transit Study</i> recommended a rail rapid transit system. The features of this are already well known, the first being the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban line.  That was to be followed by rapid rail extensions to the three new towns at Tallaght, Ronanstown and Blanchardstown and also to Ballymun.  There was also a condition relating to a tunnel in the centre city area and some other features.</P>
    <P>While a copy of the consultants' report was sent to my Department by CIE, the board have not yet submitted any definitive proposals to me for implementation of the rapid transit system, except as regards the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  The most recent estimate available to me of the cost of the rapid transit system proposed by the consultants is £220 million at 1978 prices.  I do not think anyone would dispute that this is an enormous sum and that a very careful assessment of the proposals would have to be made before any decision could be taken.</P>
    <P>Proposals of this scale and cost cannot of course be looked at in isolation.  A growing economy makes great demands for capital investment of all kinds.  In the area of transport alone, the needs of air, sea, road and rail require substantial infrastructural investment.  There are also demands from other sectors&mdash;health, education, telecommunications, industrial development and so on.  No matter how desirable particular proposals may be in themselves, it is never possible to implement them all and so priorities have to be established.  The Government have recognised the importance of the transport sector and will ensure that, within the framework of their overall economic programme, resources will be made available to ensure as far as possible that the transport sector is enabled to provide the services necessary for economic and social needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to traffic figures and the need to relieve congestion. While we are considering demands for the electrification of the Howth-Bray line or the introduction in full of the rail <Col N="1563" /> rapid transit system for Dublin, there are certain points which we must keep in mind, which are fundamental to any investment in the transport area.  We must be clear in regard to the areas which would be served by any new transport system, the numbers likely to use the service and the acceptability of the system measured by the effects which the service will have on existing travelling patterns and arrangements.</P>
    <P>We must look at the economics of the proposals which will be dependent on the success of the system in attracting the forecast numbers and in achieving the revenue forecast and the expected economies in operating and maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>In regard to the electrification of the Howth/Bray line, the present daily carryings are somewhere in the region of 27,000 persons.  Under the proposals which are at present before the Government it is envisaged that the numbers carried will rise to a level of 82,000 persons per day&mdash;a trebling of the traffic. This is a significant increase in existing numbers.  The basis on which these forecasts were arrived at and the likelihood of their being attained must be considered carefully.  Any significant shortfall in numbers would have an adverse effect on the economics of the service.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations would apply to the question of the introduction in full of the rapid rail transit system.  In the examination of the proposed system it will be necessary to test the various assumptions on which the proposal is based.  We will need to assess the probable effect of the system on the overall split between public and private transport.  There are many factors involved, tangible and intangible. While an efficient and speedy transport system has much to commend it, many car owners are reluctant to give up the flexibility and the personal mobility which they have.  If the traffic levels envisaged are not achieved, we would not only be faced with a service requiring continued heavy support from public funds but would still have a serious congestion problem in Dublin. We are talking about a very large capital <Col N="1564" /> investment both in the specific proposals for the Howth-Bray line and in the longer term proposals for the rapid transit system.  We will need to satisfy ourselves that there is a reasonable assurance that the expected beneficial results will materialise.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that, while the introduction of the rapid rail transit system would have a significant impact on public transport in the city and the suburbs, a large number of people would still be relying on bus services.  These needs cannot be overlooked.  We are most concerned to ensure that the overall transport needs of the Dublin area are met.  The Transport Consultative Commission which I have appointed will be directing their attention to the reports in the context of what other measures are available to see that these needs are met.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a statement by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I have seen the report on the comments attributed to him.  The main point made by the Minister and quoted in the report was that the rapid rail plan is not the only option for the future of surburban rail.  This is correct. The rapid rail proposals were developed by consultants engaged by CIE and their report listed and examined a number of possible approaches to the Dublin transport problem.  These options included strategies based on rail and on priority bus lanes and a combination of these. The various options showed a considerable range of cost.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development referred to these options and to the cost differentials, though I understand that he did not use the figures attributed to him in the report.</P>
    <P>While CIE made specific proposals to me in relation to the Howth-Bray line they have not yet put any specific proposals before me in regard to the implementation of the overall rapid rail transit system.</P>
    <P>In formulating policies and investment strategies in the transport area, I attach considerable importance to the work of the Transport Consultative Commission. While the terms of reference of the commission are very wide, I have asked the <Col N="1565" /> commission to devote their attention to urban needs in the first instance.  This, again, is evidence of the awareness of the Government of this important issue.  I have, accordingly, drawn the commission's attention to the serious problems existing in relation to urban transport passenger services, particularly in the Dublin area, and I have asked the commission to consider as a matter of priority the arrangements for the provision of urban passenger services.  I have asked the commission to have regard in their examination to the appropriate role of public transport, the potential benefit of traffic management schemes, the need for co-ordination between the various bodies having responsibility in this area and the relevant social, environmental and energy considerations.  I have also requested the commission to pay close attention to the role of the Dublin suburban railway because of the contribution it makes towards easing the Dublin traffic congestion problems and to take account of the possibilities of future extension of the suburban rail system.  I also drew their attention to the various studies and reports that had been undertaken in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the commission are pursuing their investigations with all possible speed.  They have, as I am sure Deputies are aware, produced a discussion paper on passenger transport in the Dublin area and on 23 January they invited interested parties and organisations to make written submissions to them on the subject, with particular reference to the main issues as seen by the commission and set out in the discussion paper. The paper ranges comprehensively over the main problems and the possible solutions both in the short term and in the long term.  The questions raised cover a very wide field including bus services, train services, road developments, private cars, taxis, traffic management schemes, flexible working hours, the possible need for a Dublin transportation policy and so on.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have stated that the question of passenger transport facilities in the Dublin area is receiving the close attention of the Government and that <Col N="1566" /> the necessary examination is in train with a view to alleviating the problems of traffic congestion and the difficulties which this causes for commuters and other users of the road.  I am very anxious that the city should have an efficient public transport system which can satisfactorily meet the needs of the public.  At the same time, it must be appreciated that the Government cannot embark on very costly schemes without being satisfied that the investment is justified, not only in regard to the contribution which would be made to the city's transport facilities but also in the context of competing demands for scarce capital resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in saying that, in drawing up a comprehensive answer to the extreme traffic congestion in our capital city, one needs to consider carefully the various options before one.  Large capital sums are involved and it is true that grave errors could be made if one were to rush into adopting one solution rather than another.  However, there is no need for an extraordinary, lengthy examination of the position in Dublin to come to the conclusion that traffic in the city is now at a standstill, literally.  We have the evidence of CIE bus drivers that runs which up to two or three years ago took 15 or 20 minutes now take one hour or one hour and 20 minutes.  Therefore, we can say that, though it is necessary to consider long term options carefully, we need quickly some response to the existing impossible situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister poses the choice of more investment in public transport as against individual family preference for private locomotion, the car, but I do not wish to enter into that argument.  Obviously people see a lot of advantage in car ownership, but I am certain there are many commuters living in large suburban areas outside the city which have grown up in recent years who, if there was the choice on their morning run to work of an efficient public transport service as against the use of their cars, would opt for the former.  The problem is, certainly not through the fault of the operatives concerned, that the road network is such, the volume of traffic is <Col N="1567" /> such, that the congestion causes delays and that, apart from the coastal run, the public transport system is not adequate to give a real choice to commuters in outlying areas.</P>
    <P>Of course part of the difficulty is that Dublin is at the centre of the national transport system, that the city has to carry a good deal of national traffic as well.  When we plead tonight for immediate priority investment in Dublin as an interim short-term attack on traffic congestion in the city, we are not looking at it merely as little Dubliners but from the point of view of the national interest, because Dublin's traffic congestion is a national question which affects national prosperity.</P>
    <P>It is true that large investment in infrastructure must be made if a long-term solution is to be found.  Moneys will be coming up shortly under the EMS and we suggest that some of that money, if not all of it, should be earmarked for the infrastructural development needed for traffic improvement in Dublin.  Making his case tonight, the Minister referred to weighty options to which consideration must be given.  He referred to his tour of various European cities to observe their situation.  After all, the Minister belongs to a party which gained quite some political support in a recent election by inducing people to buy cars.  In the past year we have seen car ownership jump upwards, by more than 100,000 new cars, the vast majority of them coming on the roads of Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>The Minister would cite that as evidence of our growing prosperity.  That may be the case, but we have not accompanied this vast increase in traffic with a commensurate increase in our road network, and the position is that in many parts of the capital our roads are worse than in some of the most remote rural areas.  For instance, if the Minister's car proceeds down Westland Row tonight it will be at the risk of its springs being damaged.  Many other roads in Dublin are covered with potholes, trenches, streets permanently dug up&mdash;that is the appearance of the fabric of the roads in our capital city, evidence of starvation of funds for road maintenance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> I would not direct attention to long-term options.  The motion refers to the present difficulties which cannot be overlooked.  An interim solution is called for.  If we were talking about this city in a different epoch, its inhabitants would be deserting it as a place in which civilised living no longer was possible; at another period in history the inhabitants would just leave and set up an alternative city elsewhere.  Naturally we cannot do that now, but I do not exaggerate when I say that transport conditions in Dublin are such that for many people living has become very difficult.</P>
    <P>People along the coastal belt are fortunate in having a rail system, and the CIE plan calls for renewed investment in improving that service.  The Minister pointed out that that service caters for a certain proportion of the population. That is true, but I would maintain that if that portion of the population now using the Dublin commuter rail service must take to their cars and proceed to the inner city we will have added even greater difficulties to an already bad situation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, money is called for.  At the very heart of this motion is the requirement for more money.  When we are talking about transport we are talking about heavy capital investment, but if it is not made things cannot be allowed to stand still.  CIE have made the point that their present financial situation is such that the maintenance of their rolling stock will require a greatly increased subvention to the company.  I understand it is possible that they will need to transfer some of the existing rolling stock, at the moment being used in the suburban service, to other parts of the company's operations.  I understand that it is possible because of their financial position that they may be shortly forced to discontinue the Dublin suburban rail services.</P>
    <P>I am looking at the situation here tonight as it meets the everyday commuters, the person attempting to come in from Howth and Bray.  The disastrous error of the Harcourt Street line robbed part of the city of the benefit of a CIE suburban line.  No one has referred to that costly error tonight.  It does not disprove the case for an improvement of <Col N="1569" /> the existing suburban rail service to say it is of advantage only to a limited number of the population.  My suggestion is that that service be improved so that those who have the advantage of that service may continue to use it with greater frequency.  If we wish to do that we must have immediate investment in rolling stock.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the commission are considering all the inter-related aspects of the problem in the context of long-term solutions.  That is a necessary examination but it should not cause us to postpone consideration of urgent problems which call for quick decisions if the terrible transport situation facing the people of Dublin is to be eased.  The situation at the moment is part of the reason for much of the bad industrial relations within CIE&mdash;the total frustration of men who cannot get vehicles from point A to point B with any kind of rapidity.  Traffic is stalled at every hour of the day in every part of the city.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Minister in his travels has encountered a capital city of the size of Dublin with traffic problems as bad as they are in every part of the city at the moment.  All of our transport moves on roads which have not attracted the kind of investment needed to cope with increasing traffic.  We have, with a wave of our electoral wand, abolished taxation on cars&mdash;let them pour out on to the roads&mdash;but when it comes to the answering side of that equation, more investment on the roads, there was no wand in the politicians' hands.  We have 100,000 new cars travelling on roads which have continued unchanged.  We have a pothole network of roads in the city which have remained untouched and apparently a complete shortage of public money to keep them properly maintained.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is considering the long-term problems of public transport in 21st century Dublin let him not forget the crisis which exists in traffic in 20th century Dublin tonight and not, as it was on one occasion, the traffic congestion of a Friday afternoon.  The Friday afternoon is every hour of the day every day of the week at the moment.  What must this cost industry?  The Minister painted <Col N="1570" /> a picture, if not of a pastoral land echoing to the laughter of athletic youths and happy maidens, that of a prosperous land humming to the tempo of efficient industry.  There cannot be any efficient industrial future for this city if nothing is done to improve the existing traffic situation.  What is one to say about firms who find that transport through the city becomes impossible? How do they get their products through the docks?  How can they communicate with the airport?  What is to happen to industrial employment in a city whose transport system is steadily grinding to a halt?</P>
    <P>We need to tackle this question very urgently.  We need a short-term plan.  I do not believe that no-parking zones will make much improvement.  I believe that these are simply tinkering with the problem.  We require a vast infusion of extra funds.  With regard to the CIE plan for the electrification of their existing system, we should try to come to some decision as rapidly as possible on that matter.  I do not pretend that this will be the final solution to this problem.  Part of the problem in Dublin is that over the years we have neglected the capital side of the improvement of transport.  We have never conceded to public transport its deserts in terms of cash and public support.  We have starved it of money. The result is that we now find that CIE are almost bankrupt, unable to keep their rolling stock up to modern standards, coming to Parliament ever more frequently asking for more money to keep going from month to month.  We cut back in the January budget on the subvention to CIE and now we find CIE forced to come to the Prices Commission looking for increases in bus fares.</P>
    <P>The Government are depriving CIE of needed cash and forcing the commuters in places like Dublin to pay ever-increasing amounts for an inefficient service. The Government stand back and say they are looking at the matter in its long-term aspect.  We cannot evade this question much longer.  We cannot pretend that painting yellow lines down one side or two sides of a street will change anything in Dublin.  We have a huge car population in Dublin and we do not <Col N="1571" /> provide decent public transport.  We have not invested sufficiently over the years in that public transport system and it is making living conditions and industrial conditions impossible in Dublin, particularly in places like Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Tallaght.  How are the people in those vast satellite cities to get into work on time?  Many of the people in those places work in offices or factories miles away from their places of residence.</P>
    <P>It is not within the ambit of this discussion to consider the question of how, higgledy-piggledy, we have permitted industrial development in this city.  It is sufficient to say that in many cases residents from one area must travel right across to the other side of the city.  We can picture the effects this has in bad industrial relations when a person who has got to be in a factory at eight o'clock or earlier has to get up at least two hours earlier to get to his work in time.  It is obvious that there is a spin-off in bad relations with all sorts of strange claims under the guise of wage negotiations coming into the contract between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>All of those things can to some extent be attributed to the bad transport situation which exists in Dublin at the moment. It pervades every area of national decision-taking.  If we have a bad transport system it must affect all of those other thangs.  We do not give a real choice to the commuter to travel on <Col N="1572" /> public transport.  We force him back to the car.  The Taoiseach attended a meeting in Paris this week where Heads of State committed themselves to cutting fuel consumption by 5 per cent in the coming year.  They committed themselves to a target reduction and energy conservation because of events in Iran and elsewhere.  Is it not a fact that the more efficient and the more attractive we make the use by the public at large of the public transport system it makes sense in terms of energy conservation? It makes no sense in terms of energy conservation if we force people against their will to buy and use cars.  I am not against the use of cars.  They are very handy vehicles but if we can make it attractive to the people of Dublin to use public transport and give them a service providing a real choice so that they can use buses which travel frequently and have some possibility of moving in getting to work, they will use them in preference to taking their cars into the centre of the city.</P>
