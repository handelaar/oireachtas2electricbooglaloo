    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the basis on which he estimates that two nuclear power stations may be required and if a new cost-benefit analysis has been made, including an environmental impact statement, on the proposal to build a nuclear power station in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach to outline the full text of his discussions and any decisions taken on nuclear energy, as it affects Ireland, at his recent meeting with the EEC heads of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach to outline in greater detail his reference to a second nuclear power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The special tribunal to be established by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will consider all aspects of the proposal for a nuclear power station, including economic, environmental, safety, security of supply and other aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 June I made a statement to the <Col N="1504" /> House on the outcome of the European Council in Strasbourg and laid the Conclusions of the Presidency before both Houses.  The statement gave an outline of the discussions, in so far as they can be made public, and the Conclusions indicate the decisions taken at the Council.</P>
    <P>After the Council I said that a second nuclear power station might be required depending on the way our economy grows, our need for energy, the availability and price of oil, and other factors.  That remains the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any environmental impact statement been prepared in draft form or otherwise by the Taoiseach's Department or by any Government Department in relation to a nuclear power station in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The environmental aspect and other matters affecting the situation are under consideration by a high-level inter-departmental group. Their conclusions will be published and will be made available to the public generally and, if and when the tribunal sits, to that tribunal as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that his statement given, after the Summit meeting, in relation to a possible second nuclear power station was perceived by many people here to pre-empt the entire exercise of a public inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, there are three questions to the Taoiseach.  He has taken the three of them together.  Does the Taoiseach not consider that his statement after the Summit, in the minds of many people, pre-empts the whole exercise of a public inquiry?  If the Taoiseach is already favourably disposed to a second nuclear station surely an inquiry into the first one is academic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I favour is not a matter of issue now.  I was answering a question put to me by journalists as usually happens after meetings of this <Col N="1505" /> nature.  I was asked what capacity would one nuclear station have and I said that I was advised that it would supply only about 15 per cent of our total requirements. The question was then asked if that would be sufficient having regard to our existing dependency on oil and I replied that if our economic growth rate continued and if our dependency on oil, which is a declining resource, was very high we might have to think of a second nuclear power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to press this, but does the Taoiseach not feel, as Leader of the Government, that his comments and the way in which they were reported, pre-empt the whole exercise of a public inquiry?  May we now take it that the Government are committed in principle to the idea of a nuclear power station irrespective of the outcome of the inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The inquiry will be independent and obviously its findings will have to be very carefully noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm, in the light of his replies to these questions and his comments in the discussion on the statement at the European Council, presuming there was no decision made about energy affecting Ireland, that in fact there was no pressure from the European Council on this subject affecting this country, contrary to the impression given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no pressure. I think the word pressure was perhaps used by some person who wrote a headline on the interview I had with journalists.  I said that on the margin a member of one country had said that we ought to proceed more quickly because I had told him that if we decided to go ahead we did not expect to have nuclear power before the mid-1980's.  So there was no question of pressure.  The Deputy will of course be familiar with the findings in which it said at paragraph 4 that it was the understanding of the Council that without the development of nuclear energy in the coming decades no economic growth would be possible and <Col N="1506" /> that nuclear programmes must therefore be given strong, fresh impetus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would this not confirm what I suggested in my reply to the statement that there is a view in the European Commission that there is no particular urgency about a nuclear station for Ireland and that it is not something to which we should definitely commit ourselves at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the view of the Commission is but there is an overall view, certainly in the member countries, that unless some other alternative source of energy emerges that we would have to depend, to a large extent, on nuclear energy.  We have no alternative source other than might be available to the rest of the Community so that is very speculative as far as other sources are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that a contrary view has been expressed by the Commissioners in respect of this country because of its very small size in terms of total energy requirements? If he is not so aware will he cause an inquiry to be made as to what is the view of the Commission on the subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what the views of the Commission are, as far as my country and its future are concerned, I would not want to be overdependent on imported resources.  We know exactly where that has got us at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that a copy of the memorandum submitted by the French to the heads of government at the Council meeting on nuclear energy be placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand this is a memorandum submitted to the Taoiseach for his approval prior to the energy Ministers dealing with the question of nuclear energy.  Has the Taoiseach given his approval to that memorandum?  Could we see a copy of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1507" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether my approval of a memorandum issuing from a member country is called for.  As far as making a copy of the memorandum available is concerned I would have to check the propriety of such an action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the French in particular have been trying to flog nuclear reactors to this country and other countries and that the purpose of the exercise of the memorandum submitted to him in Strasbourg was to pre-empt and commit him along certain lines of purchase and that we are entitled to see that memorandum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House, and the Deputy in particular, that we will not be subject to any commercial pressures from any source.  We look to our own future and to our own good in whatever decision will ultimately be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach respond to my request that the text of the transcript of the telephone conversations from Three Mile Island be put into the Library of the House for Deputies to see precisely what happened on that occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the propriety of doing such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a newspaper report.  There could surely be no impropriety in providing a copy of a newspaper in the Dáil Library?</P>

Accordingly, only those posts remaining vacant after this will be advertised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned them in the House already.  One is that, as there had been a considerable backlog, we thought it was advisable to provide physical education halls where the builders were still on the sites as this would help to reduce the cost.  Size is another one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not saying that. I am saying that a number of them where building was in progress had been told when the schools were planned that they would not have physical education halls.  I have changed that decision and have decided that they will have physical education halls.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report. The relevant responsibilities of schools are laid down in the rules and programmes for secondary schools.  The approved course for junior pupils must include civics.</P>
      <P>The special object of a course in civics is defined as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to ensure that pupils acquire an adequate knowledge of and a proper respect for local and national institutions, and of their own rights and responsibilities as citizens&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The detailed syllabus provides for instruction in regard to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> Industrial relations and Organisations;</P>
    <P>Trade Unions; Employers' Federations; The Labour Court; Conciliation and Arbitration Schemes.</P>
    <P>In addition, the obligatory history section of this year's intermediate certificate examination dealt with the history of the modern world from circa 1890 to circa 1966.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, at leaving certificate level, the subject Business Organisation includes instruction on &ldquo;employee and employer association; producer and consumer associations; trade associations and federations; chambers of commerce, etc.&rdquo; and these are specially studied under section 7 of the Business Organisation syllabus, which deals with &ldquo;People in Commerce&rdquo; under the specific heading of &ldquo;Labour&rdquo;, which covers trade unions, role of Congress, Labour Court, conciliation and arbitration procedures; works councils, shop steward, collective bargaining and wage agreements.</P>
    <P>The syllabi for the subjects Economics and Economic History deal with trade unions and industrial relations as also does the syllabus for Home Economics (Scientific and Social).</P>

Would the Minister direct his attention to this because of the growing demand among both parents and pupils for a much fuller, a more comprehensive and <Col N="1514" /> widespread treatement in the schools of this subject?</P>

I am not aware that there is widespread unrest or dissatisfaction with it, but I should like to get from the Deputy any evidence he has in regard to it.  With regard to the specific question before me, as the Deputy is aware from my reply, the students are not depending on civics only for information with regard to trade unions but may also depend on the syllabus in business organisation, economics, economic history and another section of the history course.</P>

The number on the live register on 30 March was 97,755, a fall of 3,167 since 29 December last.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, this amounts to a decline of just over 5,000 or 5.2 per cent in the first quarter, compared with an average reduction for the four quarters of 1978 of 3.1 per cent.  The number on the live register on 31 March 1978 was 111,014. The reduction for the 12 months to March 1979 was 13,259 or 11.9 per cent.

If he looks at earlier surveys he will note that the trends between the two EEC labour force surveys point in a different direction to that suggested by the movements in the live register. This demonstrates to me that the general quality of the information in the unemployment area is poor.  I said this on a number of occasions over the last two years.  I would prefer that we tackle this problem by introducing new arrangements for improving the quality and regularity of data on movements in unemployment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the 1977 labour survey published here indicates that the quality of the information has been improved in this respect, as the Central Statistics Office indicated?  Therefore, the 1977 figures, which are regarded by the CSO as more reliable than 1975 and which approximate to the live register figures at the time they were taken, offer a good indication that the live register is a correct order of magnitude of employment, contrary to the Minister's attempt to evade this over the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Research in other countries has established the basic conditions that are necessary in order to exploit tidal flows for electricity generating purposes.  A relatively large tidal range is essential for a tidal power <Col N="1526" /> project to be a commercial success. Ireland is not favourably situated in this respect, having a spring tidal range of a maximum of 4.5 metres in the most favourable sites, and considerably less than that for the greater part of the coastline.</P>
      <P>The only full-scale tidal plant in existence is at La Rance in France, where the mean spring tidal range is 11.4 metres.  While technically successful, this scheme is not fully economic.</P>
      <P>In Canada, a project is under consideration in the Bay of Fundy where the mean spring tidal range varies from 13.3 metres to 16.2 metres.  This is the order of the tidal range required for this type of electricity generation.</P>
      <P>The tidal ranges in Lough Foyle and Mulroy Bay have been surveyed as being considerably below the viable levels for electricity generation.</P>
      <P>In the context of the current and foreseen energy supply situation I am, of course, keeping the whole question of research and development into alternative energy sources under review.  If evidence can be adduced that tidal flows at any of our estuaries, including those mentioned by the Deputy, are such as to warrant their further consideration for electricity generation purposes I would be prepared to consider the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo;, published last January, adopted as an employment target for 1979 a reduction of 25,000 in the numbers out of work. Since then the outlook for the economy has deteriorated because of domestic developments and the slowing down of world trade stemming in particular from scarcity in the supply and rises in the price of oil.  In the light of these developments it would be unrealistic to retain <Col N="1527" /> the employment target set out in the White Paper for this year.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to state at this stage what revision in the White Paper figure will be necessary as information on the development of employment has been held up by the postal dispute.  I can say, however, that job creation in the public sector has not advanced as rapidly as expected again because of the postal difficulties and in other areas slower growth generally is having an adverse effect on employment.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald was saying, &ldquo;That is the Government&rdquo;.  The Government have never said that this is the sole domestic factor.  On the contrary, in this House on previous occasions I have pointed out, as set out in the White Paper and elsewhere, that a number of preconditions had to be satisfied if we were to achieve the very ambitious targets set out in the White Paper.  Part of those essential preconditions was a satisfactory climate in industrial relations.  I have made no bones of the fact that it is totally unrealistic to imagine that very ambitious targets can be achieved and very ambitious results attained if we are to suffer the damage and disruption of major strikes or other major interruptions of output.  At this juncture it is not constructive to try to apportion blame as between parties, which would be necessary in order to take the point as to how much is to be attributed to the Government or to any other grouping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo; published last January set out the employment and inflation targets for each of the years 1979 to 1981.  In view of the adverse effects on the economy since January last, domestically, of industrial unrest and, externally, of oil price increases and the prospects of further increases, these targets can no longer be regarded as realistic.  Pending information on the actual development of employment so far in 1979, the receipt of which has been delayed by the postal dispute, it would be premature to state what revision of the employment target for the current year will be necessary. As regards the inflation rate, present indications are that the rate of increase at the end of the year will be higher than the 5 per cent target envisaged in the White Paper.  A figure of about 6 per cent now looks to be the best attainable.  The year-on-year increase from November 1978 to November 1979 is expected to be in the region of 12 per cent.  Looking beyond 1979, the Government's economic and social policies will continue to give priority to the elimination of unemployment and a reduction in the rate of inflation to a level compatible with economic stability and the maintenance of the international competitiveness of Irish-produced goods and services.  If a sustained downturn in the international economy can be avoided and if we have the national will to avoid further industrial disputes and not to attempt to compensate ourselves for oil price increases through higher money incomes, the prospects for attaining these objectives remain good.</P>

I said that as regards the inflation rate, present indications are that the rate of increase at the end of the year will be higher than the 5 per cent target envisaged in the White Paper and that a <Col N="1534" /> figure of about 6 per cent now looks to be the best attainable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

I am trying to help the Deputy and the House by supplying the best information available to me.  I have indicated quite clearly that they do not now expect it will be possible to achieve a 1.25 per cent increase in the last quarter, but I am advised that it is still possible the increase will be in the region of 1.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>With respect, that is the greatest rubbish.  Progress has not been attained at the fastest possible rate.  The House will recall that the whole purpose of the White Papers was to lay down the maximum attainable rates of progress and to set our sights as high as possible.  Given that there has been some deterioration resulting in a slower rate of progress than was originally hoped for, that tells nothing at all about the effectiveness of the policy. There may or may not be some policy revisions called for but they do not arise simply as a result of a slower rate of progress.  On the contrary, it may well be that what is needed is a redoubling of efforts to enforce the policy originally enunciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The collection of Government revenue and the disbursement of Exchequer payments were held up by the Post Office dispute.  It is estimated that revenue was reduced by about £200 million.  This backlog will now be followed up without delay with the resumption of Post Office services, but the arrears may not be made good in full before the end of 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> Exchequer expenditure as shown in the end-June statement of Exchequer receipts and issues was not significantly affected by the dispute.  However, a significant element of the expenditure shown represents payable orders prepared for issue but which, because of the dispute, could not be transmitted to the payee for encashment.  These payable orders will be cleared fairly quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of the £200 million does the Minister expect he will not get in at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is difficult to estimate. It relates primarily to Post Office services, things like telephone calls not made and telegrams not sent.  Any figure I would put on it would be extremely tentative.  It might be in the region of £4 million or £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>About six or eight weeks ago there was mention of the figure of £11 million in lost revenue to the Post Office.  Would almost the entire sum be irrecoverable at this stage, apart from any further losses which have occurred in the intervening period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures in regard to the Post Office would be quite different.  The question relates to non-recoverable losses.  The answer I have given is the best I can give at the moment.  It is very tentative and I should not like to be tied to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether any element of these losses might be related to interest charges which the Government have had to pay and which may not be recoverable from any other source?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if interest will be paid to the taxpayer in cases where adjustments to tax-free allowances have been withheld owing to the postal strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in existing law for the payment of interest <Col N="1537" /> in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy.  The introduction of such legislation would raise wide issues such as whether provision should also be made to provide for the payment of interest to creditors by persons (including the State) who incurred debts which they voluntarily or involuntarily failed to discharge during the postal dispute or indeed during any other industrial dispute.</P>
      <P>I am of the opinion that the issues of policy and administration raised by the question are of an extremely complex and wide-ranging nature and that the introduction of legislation on the lines implied in the question would not be feasible in the short-term at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that is exaggerating the whole situation?  What I am endeavouring to point out is that taxpayers who had extra allowances, and therefore dropped from one tax bracket to another, have been paying tax at the upper rate now for over three months and that the Minister should pay them interest on the money he has had the use of for those three months.  I do not think it involves any further implications than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it does go further than that; it would not be possible to deal with it just on that basis.  The question would arise in regard to other payments due by or to the State or State bodies, in exactly the same way and on what basis could one confine it to this dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>One confines it by having the legislation so limited that it caters merely for those taxpayers who are paying money to the State which they would not have had to pay but for the fact that there was a postal dispute and they did not receive their certificates of tax-free allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald should be aware that the law provides very specifically in regard to the payment of interest by taxpayers or payment of interest by the Revenue Commissioners in specific circumstances relating to income tax and other taxes. Deputy FitzGerald will be aware of that. But what is dealt with here is something for which there is no provision in existing law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be done by way of legislation and, as I have indicated to the Deputy, if one were to introduce such legislation it would raise some of the issues I have mentioned and indeed others I have not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that severe hardship is being inflicted on people who have had deducted from them money which they were not due to pay, whose overdrafts accordingly were increased or deposits, if they had them, reduced and were out of pocket to that extent because the State did not fulfil its obligation and that the State refused, even when people came directly to the taxation offices, to give them certificates?  In those circumstances would the Minister not accept that he has a moral duty to take steps to reimburse the people who have been affected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this but, to give some idea of the kind of issues that arise here, I am sure Deputy FitzGerald will appreciate that in the cases he has described many of the people concerned will have had a contra benefit in the sense that they did not pay bills which they would otherwise have had to pay.</P>

      <P>Before reporting progress on Thursday last I had, I hope, made it quite clear that I was totally opposed to the levies proposed in this Bill.  I hope I made it abundantly clear also that the proposed levies cannot be viewed in isolation from all the other product and service levies imposed by the present Government since they assumed office two years ago.  This future proposal for a series of levies comes particularly badly from a Government that made so many extravagant promises, I might say, fraudulent promises in the General Election campaign just two years ago now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then we have seen farmer confidence totally eroded and the development of the agricultural industry take a down-hill turn.  We have more than sufficient evidence to support this contention.  I am surprised that the Minister has not asked himself seriously why that it so.  For example, has he considered that the series of levies on products and services has a very significant effect on the development of the agricultural industry?  And I am sure the Minister would be the last person in the House to question the fact that one of the most important features of our economy is the development of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>Certainly there is nothing in this Bill that will help increase livestock numbers. Indeed the Minister referred to his concern about livestock numbers.  Of course, he gave other reasons than the correct ones for the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the criticisms of me by the Minister it would be no harm for me to place a few figures on the record.  For example, the year before I took office exports of beef amounted to £59.3 million. The year I left office those exports had risen to £300.5 million.  Again when I assumed office live cattle stood at £58.6 million and subsequently rose to £130 million.  Dairy products rose from £46.4 million to £226.5 million, and total agricultural exports from £240.8 million to £975 million.  Anybody who likes may criticise me in regard to those figures but <Col N="1551" /> certainly I am not ashamed of them.  I might add that if the Minister leaves office after a similar period with a similar record, certainly I will not come into the House and be critical of him.</P>

      <P>We cannot be too narrow about this.  If we object to levies we must give our reasons for objecting.  The objections to the levies are so serious that they should be put on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for the development of the agricultural industry is beyond question. A recent NESC report pointed out that agriculture plus its dependent industries accounts for the same proportion of GNP as all other industries combined and also pointed out that a high rate of development on farms along with intensive processing of our meat and dairy products could over a period of ten years generate up to 76,000 extra jobs.  I am concerned because we are in a situation <Col N="1552" /> where supplies of cattle to the factories in the first four months of this year were down by 25 per cent and exports were down by one-third.  I do not know what the six-monthly figures will be like, but I do not expect them to be good.  I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will seriously consider the destruction being wrought by the introduction of a Bill with these additional levies and will go back to his Cabinet colleagues, who had the figures in front of them when they made their decision, and say that he could not get one Deputy to back him in the House because they are all afraid to do so.  Any Deputy in contact with the realities of the situation knows the damage these levies are doing and the depressing effect of them.</P>
    <P>At a Baltinglass mart recently a man with a nice bunch of cattle sold them for £500 each.  I remarked that it was a nice bunch of cattle and that I hoped he had done well.  The man said that he had kept exact figures on the cattle and that his net profit was £40 each but that he had to pay the Government a 2 per cent levy which amounted to 25 per cent of his net profit.  If the present levy is added on the Government will get well over 30 per cent of his net profit.  Anybody who knows anything about cattle or beef farming knows that the profit margin has always been poor in dry cattle.  It is one of the sectors of farming with the lowest margin.  It is imperative that we expand our dairy herds because our dairy herds supply both the milk and the beef industry.  The Minister has not made a case that anybody could support in relation to these additional product levies which are depressing the industry.</P>
    <P>It has been a long time since there was a comparable loss of confidence, where plans for expansion are being dropped and investment is being reduced, but this has happened because the farmers do not know from day to day what will next come on their backs.  There is no long-term decision making in relation to the development of the agricultural industry and this creates a very serious situation. Having condemned the levy as fully as I can I would remind the Minister that in 1977 we had a volume output increase in agriculture, a massive increase of 9.5 per <Col N="1553" /> cent.  In 1978 it was reasonably respectable but well down, and the forecast from the Department earlier this year is for another decline this year.  In these circumstances is this what the Government should be doing and the Minister agreeing to?  Obviously no other Fianna Fáil Deputy agrees or he would be in here supporting the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that I fully realise the urgency for disease eradication.  This deserves not only the support of every Member of the House but the support of everybody because so much depends on the livestock industry where cattle, beef and milk alone represent approximately two-thirds of total output.  Everybody is paying some of the cost of disease eradication.  I agree with a lot of things in this Bill although I disagree with some items.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the second main provision to allow the operation of a price differential by creameries, pasteurisers and other milk processors as between milk supplied from disease free herds and that supplied from infected herds.  This could be extremely unfair.  I know of a large herd not 100 miles away from here that was extremely well managed and was disease free for years but was subsequently wiped out by disease through nobody's fault.  A farmer who finds himself in that position is faced with a dreadful loss, but if he has the further imposition of a substantial fine in what he gets for his milk he will be out of business.  Anybody with experience knows that a breakdown can occur for which the herd owner cannot be held responsible.  In these circumstances will this reduction in the price of milk be imposed? A lot can be said for a bonus over and above the ordinary going price for milk supplied from disease free herds.</P>
    <P>That would be an inducement to people to make an extra effort.  It is totally wrong and is unfair interference to allow a reduced price to be paid to a man who made a very serious effort to clear his herd or who had his herd clear for a long time but who found himself in serious trouble through circumstances beyond his control.  The Minister talked about a significant reduction in the price for milk supplied from herds <Col N="1554" /> with either TB or brucellosis infection; this could prove also to be a most effective way of letting herd owners know that we can no longer tolerate continuing delay in regard to the eradication of disease. I have referred already to the cases of the herd owners who, at no expense whatsoever to the State, have cleared their herds of brucellosis but who now must pay for the clearance of other people's herds.  These are areas in which there is not a fair deal.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for a great deal of interference in the affairs of the processing industry, whether the individual industry considered is a co-operative or a meat- or milk-processing industry.  If there is a situation whereby somebody from a Government Department can walk into a business, take away the books and keep them for as long as is considered necessary to find out certain matters, we are very near to a totalitarian-type State.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the provision in respect of the levies will be bulldozed through the House.  We may talk about the proposal for as long as we wish but we know that the Minister will have a sufficient majority to ensure that the legislation will be passed.  However, I should like him to tell us whether, in relation to the use of the money that will be collected, it is his intention to continue the 30-day test.  Now that this test has been in operation for a considerable period, would the Minister not agree that it is doing more by way of spreading disease than eradicating it?  My information is that cattle are passing freely from one herd owner to another because there is a 15-month period within which the tests are carried out.  A farmer might hold cattle for five or six months and then sell them to a neighbour whose herd is disease-free.  In the main cattle are not being sold at present through the normal channels.  Initially I thought there might have been some good in this scheme of testing and, consequently, I did not oppose it publicly, but I am of the opinion now that it should be discontinued.  I expect it is a costly operation but it is proving to be harmful.</P>
    <P>The Minister might tell us, too, the length of time involved now in a full round of testing.  If the 30-day test were <Col N="1555" /> discontinued, would it be possible to have two full tests within a year, at least for a sufficient time to get eradication really under way and to bring about a significant reduction in the level of disease? We should not be afraid to take stock of matters such as this and if we think that what we have been doing is not doing the job that was intended, we should try something else.  All the people concerned in disease eradication are represented on the Animal Health Council. Having regard to the human health question involved in animal disease eradication and also to the possibility of our reaching a point quite soon when we might be very restricted in export outlets for the products concerned, it should not be beyond the ability of the people on that council to decide whether certain practices should be continued.</P>
    <P>Regarding the checking at cattle marts and in the processing centres is the Minister satisfied that there is an adequate number of staff engaged in this work?  I suspect that the answer is in the negative and that the level of staffing is hardly sufficient for supervision in these places.  However, that is only an opinion.</P>
    <P>I have a fair idea of all the malpractices that have obtained down through the years, for example, tag switching, fiddling with cards, the unscrupulous shifting of diseased animals into disease-free areas and so on.  I commend the Minister for being tough with offenders in this regard.  The fines that are being proposed are not in any way too high. Anybody who is found to be guilty of the type of offence concerned should not be shown any mercy because the eradication measures of the diseases in question have cost far too much up to now while there has been exceedingly little progress in the field of eradication. All of us who are concerned with the development of the agricultural industry should be anxious that diseases in herds be eradicated as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  I shall support the Minister fully in any measure he may take in an effort to wipe out the type of malpractices of which we are all aware.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the imposition of the levies, having regard to the depressing <Col N="1556" /> effect that this proposal is having on the development of the agricultural industry. Nothing is more important to our economy than the development of this industry but it is an industry in which development has been halted and in which there has begun a downhill turn.  I trust that the Minister will accept my contribution in the sincere manner in which it has been offered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of bovine disease eradication is not in issue.  Up to now the cost of the eradication schemes has been borne by the State but the Minister is proposing to offload a large part of the cost to the farming community. However, the levies proposed in this Bill will have serious implications not only for the farming community but also for the urban dweller.</P>
      <P>Considering the situation from the farmers' point of view, I recall the situation during the term of office of the Coalition when efforts were made regarding the introduction of the payment of income tax by farmers whose valuations were of more than £100. Though I was not here then, I recall the tears, crocodile or otherwise, that were shed by Fianna Fáil on behalf of the farmers.  Bearing in mind that party's approach, while in Opposition, to the farmers and having regard also to their pre-election pledges to the farmers, both written and oral but perhaps more important, the oral promises, it is obvious that the farmers have been misled seriously by this Government.</P>
      <P>However, we have a situation now whereby a substantial amount of revenue is being raised from the farming community by unfair, inequitable and generally obnoxious means.  Any proposal to raise taxation from any sector of the community by way of a levy is not worthy of support in this House. Raising moneys by this means results in members of the farming community paying tax whether or not they are in a profit situation.  Surely that is an unjust situation.  I come from an area where there are many small farmers and I observe that there is no exemption for such small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of a herd in the Bill includes a herd consisting of one animal <Col N="1557" /> only.  The Minister has closed the loophole of the small farmer with one animal only.  There are such herds in the country.  However, to be honest, many of the small farmers that I represent have more than one animal.  At the same time many of them would be exempt from income tax applied according to any PAYE system because their incomes are not such that, after allowances, they would be in the tax bracket.  This Bill makes no allowance for people in that category.  Small or big, with one cow or a hundred, they all have to pay.  Many of these farmers have such a poor level of existence that they are in receipt of assistance from the State. Surely it is wrong social thinking to have a situation where people in that category are pushed into the tax net.</P>
    <P>The whole outlook of the present administration appears to be to raise money from the farming community by a system of levies.  Whether it is that they are afraid to tackle the problem head on or whether it is that they hope to mislead the farmers by dealing with the matter on a piecemeal basis, I am not sure, but they seem to be attracted by the notion of abstracting money from the farming community by a system of levies.  We have the 2 per cent levy, the dairy inspection levy, the CBF levy and the EEC levy.  The whole system is wrong.  I would not object to a proper and fair system of farm taxation.  However, I do object to a system which is unfair and unrelated to ability to pay.  In regard to the 2 per cent levy, I recall that the Minister for Finance made certain exemptions. I suggest that the Minister for Agriculture should consider some form of mitigation for the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I said that the Bill has implications for the urban dweller as well as the farming community.  The charge in regard to the slaughtering of animals will ultimately be added to the cost of meat and will, in certain circumstances, be ultimately paid in part at least by the consumer through higher charges.  In regard to milk, the Minister may well respond that there is price control.  However, I am not aware of any effective system of price control in regard to meat.  In that situation the consumer has an interest.  The consumer <Col N="1558" /> can expect that the increased charges will be added in whole or in part to his bill.  From that point of view the urban dweller has an interest in this Bill and in the system.  There is another interest for urban dwellers, particularly those employed in meat processing plants, because any type of approach which limits production will ultimately affect the end product and will therefore affect employment.  All this relates to the system which has been adopted by the Minister and his colleagues of attempting to abstract moneys from the farming community by using a number of subterfuges to abstract the money and hoping that they will not notice the accumulation. Apart from that, the Minister must consider the injustice of the approach.  It is not too late to call on the Minister and his colleagues to revise their thinking.</P>
    <P>The Bill is entitled an Act to provide for the raising of money for the purpose of facilitating the eradication or the prevention of the spread of bovine diseases. The Bill does not contain a section providing that the moneys raised will be used for the purpose of facilitating the eradication or the prevention of the spread of bovine diseases.  Section 20 provides that &ldquo;Moneys paid to the Minister in pursuance of any provision of this Act shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such a manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.&rdquo; If my suspicions are correct and moneys paid under the Bill are going via the Minister for Agriculture directly into the Exchequer, surely it is pure camouflage to include in the title of the Bill the suggestion that the moneys are being raised for the purpose of facilitating the eradication or the prevention of the spread of bovine disease. If I am correct, I strongly suggest that it is not the way in which legislation should be framed and that the title should be removed from the Bill.  The Minister should tell the people honestly and bluntly what the situation is.  If he is raising tax that is going to be paid into the Exchequer he should tell the people so.</P>
    <P>The other aspect in the early part of the Bill which gives cause for concern is the fact that the Minister reserves power <Col N="1559" /> to increase the amounts of these levies at any time by order.  For instance, I see that there is a specific amount referred to in section 2 for animals slaughtered or exported live and this amount is mentioned in the Bill as £3 per annum.  But there is a proviso that the amount can be the amount per animal standing for the time being prescribed for the purpose of this paragraph.  I presume that the Minister has no notion of reducing the amount even if, as we hope, the disease is eradicated or virtually eradicated.  I can only assume that the Minister intends to push up this figure every now and again when the purse strings are tightened.  For all we know this figure of £3 could be £10 before the year is out. This then is certainly quite a disturbing provision.  The Minister will probably be basing his defence of this Bill on the figures which are included here, the 5p per gallon of milk and the £3 per animal slaughtered or exported.  But that is not the basis on which he must defend the Bill.  There is the safety clause, the escape hatch for the Minister and it is a very dangerous one indeed; it is one that, whatever about the justification for the Bill itself, cannot be justified under any circumstances.  The Minister can come into this House and double or triple the amount raised under these provisions by mere order.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for service of notices by an inspector of the Department.  I am referring to sections 6 and 7 and the powers of the inspector.  Here I would like to make a general point.  While all of us would like to see bovine disease eradicated we must at the same time bear in mind in the means taken to do so, the personal and individual rights of persons who may be affected by these measures.  To a certain degree there could be a conflict between this very ambition to eradicate disease and those individual rights.  Section 6 gives the inspector of the Department power to serve a section 7 notice as a result of a belief which is not illustrated in any way and which does not have to be based, so far as I can see, on any evidence.  It may be a belief based purely on a flight of fancy and that type of power can be a <Col N="1560" /> dangerous one.  I know and accept that the officials of the Department of Agriculture in the main are not going to abuse this power.  But there may be one individual who, for one reason or another, would do so.  Surely when we bring in legislation now for the future we have to bear in mind the principles involved and not just the individuals presently in the Department.  This is a draconian power given to a departmental inspector under section 6.  It is a power that apparently can be exercised on the basis of a belief on the part of the inspector that does not have to be based on any solid evidence of any description. Even worse, it is a power that can be exercised without any right of appeal to anybody.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that this is a section that should be reviewed.  He may have a strong case for giving an inspector this power.  It may be a weapon that is absolutely necessary in the interests of disease eradication but all power given to the State must be balanced and it must be counter-balanced; it must be counter-balanced to the extent that individual rights are protected and not restricted or reduced to an undue degree.  Here there is an overriding draconian power given to a departmental inspector which can be exercised on a mere belief on the part of the inspector and against which there is no right of appeal.  That is not the type of legislation which we should have and I would strongly suggest to the Minister and his advisers that there should be some modifying clause put in to provide for the situation where even if only one individual is unjustly treated by the exercise of such power, that individual could raise the question and, if it were proved that the power had been unjustly exercised, receive some form of compensation. It could happen and it is the duty of the Minister and this House to ensure that if that did happen such individual would not have his individual and personal rights restricted by legislation put through this House.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Bill which, coming from small farmer country, concerns me seriously is the section which provides for a reduction in the amount paid to a farmer who is unfortunate enough to have diseased animals in his <Col N="1561" /> herd.  This certainly is something to which serious exception must be taken.  I am not a farmer but through people coming to see me about constituency problems I am very well aware of the serious upset and the tremendous financial loss which is borne by farmers, particularly small farmers, when there is an outbreak of TB in their herd.  These farmers are assisted, to some small degree, by the State.  If I recollect correctly there is a grant of £130 given by the State to help in replacing infected animals.  Despite this there is a very considerable loss which, in many cases, can run to perhaps £300 or more to be paid by the farmer to find a replacement.  The Minister now suggests that in addition farmers should be further penalised.  If the Minister came into this House and suggested that he was doubling the amount of the grant to help farmers to get back on their feet and find replacements and get on with the business of farming that would be a reasonable approach, but to come into this House and suggest that the farmer should be further penalised by a reduction in the price of milk is just beyond comprehension.</P>
    <P>It is even worse that a farmer is put in this situation because of the serving of a notice under section 6 of the Bill.  This is the notice to which I took exception and which can be served on the farmer because an inspector believes that an animal in that man's herd is infected. There is no appeal against that decision by the inspector.  A farmer put in that situation has a reduction made in the price of the milk which he sells to creameries.  The Minister has not yet specified the rate of that reduction.  This can be prescribed in an order from time to time.  Surely this is a blatant injustice?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the principle is wrong. A farmer in that situation who suffers a breakdown in his herd must be helped to get back on his feet.  The manner in which the Minister proposes to have this draconian power exercised is totally unjust and I suggest it its possibly unconstitutional. It seems to be a complete denial of the individual rights of the citizen in this situation.  I ask the Minister to think again about this procedure in relation to the principle of it <Col N="1562" /> and the manner in which he suggests this power should be implemented.</P>
    <P>Those are particular points which strike me in relation to this Bill and I ask the Minister to take account of them.  It does not take from my overall opposition to this Bill which is of significance to the farming community and the urban dwellers.  This Bill will have consequences for everybody.  We could do without this measure.  I am totally opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice in opposition to the Bill and to support the view expressed by the members of my party.  In case anybody is under any misapprehension I want to say that I believe that disease eradication in our national herd is a matter of urgency.  The Minister will have the full support of the Fine Gael Party in any effort he makes to speed up the eradication of disease in our national herd.  We are totally opposed to the system by which the Minister proposes to pay for this eradication.  I believe this is a major job and that we have been very lax in the past in regard to disease eradication.  We have not come to grips with the seriousness of the problem.  We should bear in mind that our time is running out.  There is still a lot of work to be done and a number of factors which are contributing to the spread of disease. The Minister should come to grips with this matter.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support the penalties the Minister proposes to introduce against those people who are involved in every kind of trickery to try to avoid the steps being taken to eradicate disease in our national herd.  I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the complaints we regularly get from people involved in the dairy industry in particular who find that farms next door to them or in their vicinity are let to cattle dealers. They are very concerned about the way cattle are moved freely in and out of those farms.  There are many streams throughout the country which are the only source of water supply for cattle. This water could be flowing through 30, 40 or 50 farms.  We have not considered those problems in the past and therefore we have done very little about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> The vast majority of the farming community are very conscious of the seriousness of disease eradication and the problems which are involved in eradicating TB and brucellosis from our national herd.  I support any of the penalties which will be imposed on the people who are in breach of the law in relation to this matter.  I readily concede that the Minister has great knowledge of the agricultural industry as far as the grain growers and the beef and bullock men in the midlands are concerned.  Is he aware of the problems which are facing the dairy industry at the moment?  I come from the heart of the dairy industry in Munster and I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the problems facing that industry.</P>
    <P>This Bill is imposing another levy on all of those people.  We are just out of the worst winter which farmers have had for a long time when they had almost six months of having to feed their cattle indoors with the high cost of feed and the high cost of labour.  The farming community, particularly dairy farmers, were looking forward to their monthly cheques to pay for feeding stuff and to pay for the heavy losses incurred as a result of the bad winter.  The Minister now proposes to extract another levy from them.  Farmers are infuriated that this is an extra levy imposed on them.  While the income to farmers has remained static the cost of production over the last two years has increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>A farmer who receives a creamery cheque has several deductions made from it.  There is the co-responsibility levy, the Bord Bainne levy, the 2 per cent tax and other levies which the Minister is not responsible for, levies in which farmers contribute to their own organisation, the IFA and the ICMSA. All those deductions are made each month from the creamery suppliers' cheques. It is constant dripping which wears the stone and the last straw which breaks the camel's back.  Deputy O'Keeffe dealt with the legalities and the niceties of the Bill but farmers, particularly dairy farmers, in the south are concerned that this is just a subtle system of taxation.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider <Col N="1564" /> the position of the farming community at the moment.  We are opposing this Bill because there is no consideration for the capacity of farmers to pay this levy. Many farmers are heavily in debt.  I have already mentioned the deductions from the creamery cheques but it is quite possible that because farmers were encouraged to modernise by the creameries and the co-ops further deductions have to be made for a number of items which farmers have installed in their efforts to try to improve their production.  I believe that this levy will hit employment.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned about the number of people who are unemployed. I had occasion recently to visit three major co-operatives in County Cork employing approximately 1,100 people. These co-operatives are geared towards further expansion and the creation of more jobs in the area for farmers' sons who have to leave the land.  So far as dairy farmers are concerned, this levy will militate against increased production and it will hinder efforts to expand the agricultural industry.  The levy will also affect housewives.  I am sure the Minister is aware that they have demonstrated against and objected to the levy.  There is no doubt that ultimately it will hit the consumer in a major way.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware of the dramatic reduction in our exports of beef and meat in the past few months.  Two years ago when Fianna Fáil were campaigning in the general election we were informed by them that the taxation introduced by the National Coalition was unfair.  Many promises were made by the Minister, his party and by other Fianna Fáil candidates and farmers fell for them.  At the moment the farmers are up in arms at the attitude of the Government. There was an example of this recently.  When the Minister for Finance in his budget imposed a 2 per cent levy on farmers they demonstrated against it. There will be further demonstrations by the farming community because they are not prepared to continue indefinitely to pay levy after levy.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine what has happened since he took office with respect to the income of the farming <Col N="1565" /> community.  The agricultural grant is to be reduced to £40 in 1980, the tax threshold has been reduced to a PLV of £40, the multiplier has increased to 125, there has been the 2 per cent tax, the removal of the lime and fertiliser subsidies and now there is talk of a resource tax of 15 per cent.  This accumulation of taxation on the farming community has hit production and stopped expansion of the industry.  Consideration should be given to the capacity of small farmers to pay these taxes.  In this levy no consideration is given to whether a farmer is in a position to pay; nobody cares.  Irrespective of whether a farmer is in debt, whether he owns one cow or 200 cows, he will have to pay the levy.</P>
    <P>It will be very difficult to implement the charge of £3 for every animal slaughtered.  Many problems will be created.  In the past few years people have been buying and killing their own animals.  How can the Minister trace an animal that is slaughtered by a butcher who does this work privately for a farmer?  Will it be necessary to have a horde of inspectors?  That would defeat the purpose of the Bill, which is to raise extra taxation.  The Minister should take note of these points.  I doubt very much if the measure can be implemented.</P>
    <P>For example, does the Minister consider that hoteliers should pay a levy because of the work of Bord Fáilte in trying to attract tourists here?  It is unfair that the farming community should be asked to pay the charge proposed by the Minister.  I would ask him to consider seriously the situation of the dairy farmer who is supplying milk to the creamery, who has considerable expenses and whose income is eroded daily by levies of this kind.  At this stage the levy is small, but as money becomes scarcer and as the Minister for Finance demands more there is nothing to stop the Minister increasing the levy.  This appears to be the work of an economist who is not aware of the problems of the farming community.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the importance of disease eradication.  We know that time is running out and so far as Fine Gael are concerned we will support every effort to eradicate disease.  It is something that can hit the economy very severely <Col N="1566" /> and we could lose valuable markets. However, we disagree with the way the Minister is financing the disease eradication schemes.  It is totally unfair and inequitable and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>The Government have the necessary votes to push this measure through the House in spite of opposition from the farming community and in spite of the efforts of the Opposition in this House. However the Minister will have difficulty in administering the scheme and in extracting by subtle means more taxation from the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us accept the fact that disease eradication is a vital element in the future development of our agricultural industry.  We are aware of the detrimental effects of bovine TB and brucellosis on the expansion of our agricultural industry and the realisation of its potential.  However, I reject completely the concept of the levy.  The eradication of bovine diseases is a matter of urgent national priority.  Because of the vital importance of agriculture to the national economy, because the potential of this small nation depends on the development of agriculture, disease eradication should be a national charge. The elimination of disease will lead to expansion of our agricultural exports and, inevitably, this will benefit the national economy.  For these reasons the cost of disease eradication should be borne by the Central Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is becoming known as the Minister for Levies.  This Government introduced a new concept into agricultural financing and farm taxation.  Week after week new levies are being imposed on the farming community.  My main reason for contributing to this debate is that I believe the concept of a levy as applied to any aspect of agricultural development is a bad idea.  The levy concept is socially unjust and economically and socially indefensible. There is no way one can attempt to justify the levy concept on the basis of equity and social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a crazy approach to apply the levy concept to the eradication of animal diseases.  We are penalising farmers when we should be making every effort <Col N="1567" /> to help them eradicate animal diseases. There is no doubt in my mind that the morale of the agricultural community is being detrimentally affected by the continuous sequence of levies being imposed on them by this Government.  Their morale will sink even lower if the Minister continues to think up new ways of imposing unjust taxes on the farmers.</P>
    <P>We cannot close our eyes to the very significant report published last week dealing with the present position and the future prospects particularly of smaller farmers.  The report indicated that a growing number of smaller farmers were going out of milk production.  If so, this is a very serious and alarming situation for the future development of agriculture.  If we accept that agriculture is the foundation of our national economy, we must be logical and admit that the dairy industry is the most fundamental and vital part of our agricultural industry.  I am very concerned about the continued imposition of levies, particularly in the dairy industry. It is a crazy idea to impose levies on the farmers when we should be encouraging them to eradicate animal diseases.</P>
    <P>I want to re-emphasise that I am convinced that the levy concept, and particularly the sequence of new levies which have been introduced by this Government and implemented by the Minister, represents the most retrograde step in the history of Irish agriculture. This is the most retrograde step taken by any Minister for Agriculture in the history of Dáil Éireann.  I appeal to the Minister to have a serious rethink on this whole question and to analyse very carefully the short-term and, more particularly, the long-term implications for Irish agriculture of the imposition of indefensible and socially unjust levies such as that which the Minister is seeking to introduce in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to record my opposition to this Bill.  When the Minister was appointed to his office in 1977 it was felt in many quarters that he would hit the Department with increased vigour, even beyond the tremendous heights reached by his predecessor.  He would not be considered in a very <Col N="1568" /> favourable light in many parts of the country now.</P>
      <P>The imposition of yet another levy on farmers, particularly those in the west, is another nail in the coffin of many small farmers who had to struggle to reach the relatively low standard of income they have at present.  As an island nation it is imperative that we rid the country of diseases that infect our animals.  Nobody would disagree with that.  We may have tackled disease eradication in the wrong way previously.  It is possible that we might have eliminated many of these diseases if we had adopted a different approach. Be that as it may, we are now imposing a £3 levy per beast under this Bill.  There is a dangerous element in this Bill.  It does not limit the Minister to £3. Next week it could be £5, or £10 the week after.  If the Minister ever contemplates raising the levy and then travels beyond the fringes of the Shannon, let him beware because he may meet very strong verbal opposition from many of the farmers in the west.</P>
      <P>Many of these people worked very hard on fragmented holdings with poor agricultural land to raise their standard of living.  In 1979 they are faced with another levy.  I want to record my opposition to the imposition of the levy of £3 per beast for bovine disease eradication. I agree with the principle that we must rid the country of bovine diseases, but the levy could be made a national charge or it could be borne by the Community.</P>
      <P>In the west where a farmer may sell four, five or fewer animals per year off ten acres of land, with possibly an undivided share of something like 18,000 acres of commonage which is no good to anybody in its present state, his profit margins are very small, taking into account inclement weather, bad winters and very small amounts of fodder.  It would be difficult for him to accept another levy on top of this small profit margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As possibly one of the last speakers from this side of the House, at this late stage I ask the Minister to record my opposition to this.  I ask him to bear in mind the many thousands of farmers who have worked constantly down the years in very poor conditions with little <Col N="1569" /> encouragement.  This type of legislation is not in keeping with what these same farmers were promised only two years ago or with what they thought the Minister for Agriculture would do.  It is in keeping with their ideas of what the principals of the Department of Agriculture should be doing, that is ridding the country of these bovine diseases, but it is not at all in line with the way they thought these schemes would be implemented.  It is all right to talk about them, it is all right to introduce them, but when they hit the farmer's pocket it may be found that the farmer's pocket has very far-reaching effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Opposition Deputies who contributed to this debate if for no other reason than that they exemplified the extraordinarily and dangerously cynical approach of Opposition Deputies to this whole matter of disease and its urgency.  In almost all of the contributions their remarks were prefaced with some ritual &ldquo;against sin&rdquo; type of observation about animal disease. They proceeded to say that they opposed the raising of any funds from within the industry itself to attain that purpose.  Some of them went so far as to become the advocates of the tag switchers, the people who cheat in the matter of breaking regulations.  Today Deputy Clinton and Deputy O'Keefe were pleading about the rights of individuals, and on the last day we discussed this matter Deputy Griffin's heart was bleeding for the sufferings of the tag switcher, the cheat and the disseminator of disease and at the notion that the penalties would be increased radically and that the time for the pursuit of a particular case would be extended greatly in order to allow this to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, there was no discernible common approach on the part of the people who spoke in this debate, although they pretty well all came from the Fine Gael Party.  They seemed to be repeating a parrot cry with some local variations, some of them very interesting, such as the one I have been talking about, the distress that they felt for the sufferings that are in store.  I hope that they are in store for the thief, the <Col N="1570" /> criminal and the tag switcher who are playing a big part in holding up the eradication programme that we are getting under way in a very encouraging and satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>Several of the Deputies spoke today of the utter decline in farmer morale. The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, gloated over the fact that there was, it seemed to him at any rate, a decline in the numbers of cattle.  I have been expressing very grave concern about this.  I told the House on the Financial Resolution the origins to which I would attribute principally the decline that Deputy Clinton was talking about and glorying in.  He was glorying in the fact that he was selling off all our cows and increasing our exports of beef by selling our breeding stock.  The present situation is that we do not have those any more and, therefore, there is a decline in the amount of beef being processed by the meat factories.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton went on, as some of his colleagues did also, to do some public weeping about the very successful 30-day test.  He betrayed the absolute cynicism of the Fine Gael Party and the approach of that party to the whole question of disease eradication, by not admitting that the introduction of the movement certificates for the protection of herd owners&mdash;the real purpose of this&mdash;from infection by animals from infected herds was really effective.  We can show that many hundreds of reactor herds have been detected in this manner that would not have been detected if the tests had not been made.  If that alone were the fruit of this 30-day test it would have been well worth while, but it is not the only fruit.  A very notable by-product of the introduction of this movement certification has been a growing awareness and a growing insistence on the part of herd owners, in my experience and among my acquaintance, of the really pressing problem that we have on our hands.  We have heard umpteen trite, glib, meaningless acknowledgments of the reality of this programme but we have also heard a total reluctance and refusal to face the facts on the part of a party who purport to be responsible.</P>
    <P>The facts are grim in the matter of animal disease, and let nobody pretend <Col N="1571" /> that they are not.  Neither let anyone pretend that the eradication of disease is going to be accomplished without some very difficult passages to be got through. No work as important and worthwhile as this was ever accomplished without some unpleasant phases.  There will be unpleasant phases in this eradication scheme, and let everybody know that that will be the case.  We do not say this with any glee but with a sense of feeling obliged to give farmers notice that it is no intention of mine, or on the part of the Government either, to relent in any way in our pursuit of the success objective in this eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>Great amounts of money are needed for this eradication scheme.  A farmer myself, I do not subscribe to the opinion expressed by pretty well every Fine Gael Deputy who spoke on this, that this should be a matter that should be passed on to the taxpayers.  As one might say in colloquial English about PAYE payers, how would that grab them?  They, like the farmers, are prepared to pay a just amount of tax but, in order to be fair, herd owners must acknowledge that they and they alone will be the first beneficiaries of the successful eradication of animal disease.</P>
    <P>I have some figures here and it is worth while to look at them.  I can even recall them from memory.  For animal reactors for disease eradication in the whole island of Great Britain £135,000 was paid in compensation last year.  In our part of this island of Ireland over £4 million has had to be paid.  Obviously, that money was subscribed by farmers, workers and everybody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The urgency of the eradication of disease is further pointed out by the time limit mentioned by Deputies Creed, Bruton and Bermingham. They have a notably responsible approach to this matter.  Each of them mentioned aspects of the eradication programme, such as Deputy Bruton's reference to the very real dangers to human health occasioned by both tuberculosis and brucellosis.  Only now are farmers, veterinary surgeons and others who have to do with cattle discovering the alarming incidence of human infection and the difficulty of eliminating this terrible plague among cattle and people.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to devote a great deal of time to contributions such as that made by Deputy O'Keeffe.  It was clear that his thinking was so divorced from any farming matter that, try as he might&mdash;and he is a very capable man&mdash;he could not relate to the realities of the disease eradication problem, which concerns people in rural Ireland before it concerns anyone else.  He, like some of his colleagues, worries about the negation of tag switchers' right and about the extension of what he called draconian powers to Department of Agriculture inspectors in their pursuit of criminals and tag switchers.  We will be as draconian as we require to be in the pursuit of these criminals and there is no other way in which these people can be brought to their senses and the public in general and herd owners in particular protected from their ravages.</P>
      <P>Speakers have dwelt at great length on the inequity and injustice of this levy. They would do well to contemplate the future of the same herdowners if we adopted the means adopted by the Coalition Government of abandoning disease eradication altogether.  The prospect then would be total extinction. Some speakers painted heart-rending pictures of appalling losses but the losses will be even greater if we do not finally come to grips with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy questioned the value of the 30-day test.  It is a bit of a nuisance but Deputy D'Arcy and others <Col N="1573" /> must realise that it is a nuisance in the same way as several other measures we must yet adopt will also be a nuisance.  It is a nuisance which gives very valuable and real protection to the purchasers of cattle.  Deputy Clinton referred to the widespread trafficking of animals among farmers, some of the animals being diseased. Farmers who buy animals without movement clearance certificates do not deserve what they get but they do deserve to be punished.  They punish themselves most and may well become propagators of disease, just as the group Deputy Clinton spoke about.  He spoke with a certain approval about the traditional practice of buying and selling cattle, but now they had better get a movement certificate first.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hegarty was one of the softly softly group of Deputies who did not like this Bill's rugged approach to the criminal element in this problem.  He would prefer more grants and incentives and pats on the back.  Not once did he mention the unpleasant problem of money.  Any farmer knows that, a lot of money will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny is worrying about the sufferings of farmers in the west and how the levy will affect them.  Certainly the levy will bear on their small milk production but traditionally farmers in <Col N="1574" /> the west have been in the store cattle market.  It is not clear whether Deputy Kenny was talking about this levy or the 2 per cent levy.  The disease eradication levy will be exacted at meat factories, ports of export and urban points of slaughter and in the case of transactions in small store animals it will not be that heavy.  On the other side of the coin as far as the west is concerned, we have an undertaking from the Council of Ministers that by 31 December they will have approved a second scheme for the improvement of the infrastructure of the west, as well as the drainage scheme which has already been approved.  That should make a decided counterbalance in the scales on behalf of the farmers Deputy Kenny is worried about.</P>
    <P>Deputies Bruton, Creed and others were honest enough to see the reality. Deputy Creed spoke plainly on the matter and as a farmer he sees the grim realities.  It is not a time for sitting down, wringing our hands and weeping about it.  There is a very big job to be done.  If Fine Gael Deputies think that the morale of the Irish farmer will sag, his courage break and that he will fly in the teeth of that kind of challenge, then they do not know him as well as I do.</P>
    <P>On the question of leucosis mentioned by Deputy Bruton, as far as I know that disease was inadvertently introduced during the period of the Coalition Government by the importation into this country of Canadian Holsteins.  I do not approve of the importation of Canadian Holsteins.</P>

They were for the eradication of disease but they were against the imposition of penalties on the whole, not all, and they were against the exaction of any money in the process.  All of these things are necessary.  The exaction of huge amounts of Government money and farmers' money must go into this campaign because it is the intention of the Government that it will be successful and final.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the White Paper on National Development the Government indicated their intention of revising the fees charged for dairy inspection services provided by the Department of Agriculture in order to meet the growing cost of such services.  The Bill is to give effect to this.</P>
      <P>No new principle is involved in the Bill.  The fee at present charged for dairy inspection services was fixed by the Dairy Produce (Amendment) Act of 1941 and has not been increased since. despite the fact that the cost of the inspection services has increased very significantly in the meantime.  The current fee brings in only about £14,000 per annum in revenue against an estimated cost of the inspection service in 1979 of about £900,000.  As indicated in the White Paper the Government consider that a continuation of this situation whereby the shortfall in financing the service is met by the general taxpayer is undesirable and should be corrected.</P>
      <P>As butter is now only one of a number of dairy products manufactured in this country the fee on butter fixed in 1941 is to be abolished and replaced by a comprehensive fee on all milk sold for manufacturing purposes.  The inspection services provided by the Department cover all dairy products manufactured for the home or export trade.  The Bill will also apply to milk sold for the liquid trade in respect of which my Department also provides an inspection service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the fee will be payable by the first purchaser of the milk so there is no possibility of the fee being payable more than once on any particular lot of milk.  Thus for example under section 2 butter factories will not be liable.  The immediate reason is that they do not purchase milk.  But the basic reason is that the butter they blend will have been made at a creamery from milk on which the fee will have been charged. Viewed in this light butter factories will be in no different position from any dairy produce manufacturers who take in milk <Col N="1579" /> on which the fee has previously been charged at other premises.</P>
    <P>Likewise farmers with highest grade licences are exempt though the Department provides an inspection service for them.  Such licensees account for only a very small fraction of the total milk processed and in any event about half their annual production is bought by pasteurisers who will pay the fee on it.</P>
    <P>Among other sections of the Bill are those providing for the keeping of records, section 4, recovery of fees, section 5, inspection of records by officers of the Minister, section 6, and cancellation, revocation or suspension of registrations or licences in case of refusal to pay the fee, section 7.</P>
    <P>As to the rate of fee being provided for at section 3 (1), one-tenth of a penny per gallon can only be described as a very modest imposition.  In terms of the current milk prices it represents less than 0.2 per cent of the price paid for manufacturing milk and even less for milk purchased for the liquid milk trade.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This piece of legislation is very much mistimed.  It proposes a very dramatic increase in the amount to be deducted from the price being paid to farmers for milk.  It is stated that the reason for raising the levy is to pay for the inspection of creameries.  However, this change is being made at a time when the price being paid to the farmer for milk is being reduced by reason of a number of other factors such as the 2 per cent levy, the bovine diseases levy and the co-responsibility levy imposed by the EEC, to mention but a few.  The change is being made at a time also when the price of milk has been frozen by the EEC Commission.  The net effect of this Bill, taken with the other bills which will mean reductions in the price of milk as paid to dairy producers, is to reduce severely the income of farmers at a time when the costs being borne by those same farmers are being increased greatly.  One might not have objected to the principle of this Bill if it had been introduced in isolation and if the Minister had come in two years ago and said, for instance, &ldquo;I wish to pay for a larger <Col N="1580" /> share of the cost of dairy inspection from the fees which are imposed under the Dairy Produce Act, 1941&rdquo;, but the whole situation is different now.</P>
      <P>That is why the Bill could not have been more mistimed.  Indeed, its introduction now gives credence to an impression that there is a belief on the part of the Government that the right and proper way of raising revenue to pay for services is by means of levies whether the levy be in respect of dairy produce, of bovine diseases or whether what is involved is a 2 per cent levy on sales.  I do not wish to argue at length on the question of the levies.  Though the levy proposed here is small at this stage it is to be paid regardless of whether there is a loss or a profit situation on the part of the producer and regardless of whether there is involved a small producer or a big producer.</P>
      <P>I have some objections to the Bill. Section 3, subsection (1), provides that a fee shall be paid at the rate of one-tenth of one new penny for every gallon of milk produced but the subsection provides further that this proportion of one-tenth of a penny can be increased by way of regulation.  In other words, it would not be necessary to have the approval of the House for any further increase so that the levy could be increased to a full penny or even to ten pence per gallon simply by way of a regulation.  All the Minister would have to do would be to lodge an order in the Library of the House to the effect that the levy was being increased and the increase would be effective immediately unless some Deputy moved a motion to annual the regulation and was supported by a majority of the House.  In effect, therefore, there are no proper means for parliamentary supervision of any increase in the levy at a future stage.  There is no statutory guarantee in the Bill that the levy would not be increased to a figure that would be out of relation to the cost of the services for which it was supposed to be paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services concerned cost about £900,000 annually and we are told that the levy proposed will bring in about that amount or perhaps a little more. However, there would be nothing to prevent the Minister next year saying that <Col N="1581" /> the cost for these services had increased to, say, £1.1 million but that because there was a shortage of money, he might as well as increase the levy so as to bring in £2 million, thereby having a little to spare.  In such circumstances there would be no obligation on him to keep any extra money for the purpose of dairy inspection improvement because it is stated clearly in section 9 that all fees payable under this Act shall be disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the direction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent the raising of a surplus by means of this levy and the Minister for Finance could say in the event of a surplus situation that the money should be used for the upkeep of the National Museum or for the provision of grants for industrialists or for more boats for fishermen.  It is incorrect to describe as a fee what we are concerned with in this Bill.  The normal understanding of a fee is that it is a payment for a specific service but that if the service is not provided, the fee is not paid.  There is no guarantee in this Bill that the service concerned will be provided.  If the Department discontinued providing the service at certain creameries the fee would continue to be paid.  In addition there is no guarantee that the money paid in the form of a fee will not be used for purposes quite unrelated to dairy inspection.</P>
    <P>I also object to the excessive powers contained in sections 4, 5 and 6 which allow authorised officers to enter creameries to ensure that fees are being collected.  They can inspect premises at any time, inspect records and take them away.  It seems that these officers are being given too much power.  The Bill gives authorised officers the possibility of engaging in what can only be described as harassment, if they so wish.  There should be some check on the excessive use of these powers and to this end I shall be introducing amendments during the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been reluctant to give us information about the inspectors. It is unfortunate that the Minister chose to leave the House so soon after he introduced the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport and at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, there is not much point in talking to Deputy Fitzpatrick. It is difficult to assess the Bill without knowing the extent of the responsibilities of the inspectors for whom we are being asked to pay.  If it is purely an inspection for the benefit of the farmer, there is a case for it being borne by the cost of the produce.  If it is something which has a public health dimension, then it is a matter of national concern.  Therefore, the producer should not be asked to bear the entire cost of the inspection.  If that were the case, a levy should be charged on all food sold for the entire cost of the inspection of all premises.</P>
      <P>I made a number of points during the debate on Second Stage of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Bill in relation to dangers to health from the consumption of unpasteurised milk.  I should like to know if the powers of inspectors under this Bill will extend to checking on the sale of unpasteurised milk.  The Minister failed to answer the case I made that approximately 25 per cent of the milk on sale for human consumption is unpasteurised and that a large quantity of this milk is potentially infected with a variety of diseases.  If it came from a herd in which brucellosis is endemic there could be brucellosis in the milk. There is also the risk of salmonella being in the milk.  I understand that local authorities can make an order requiring that all milk sold for human consumption in their areas be pasteurised and that some local authorities have not exercised this discretion.  I believe that the responsibility for ensuring that all milk sold for human consumption be pasteurised should be centralised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply to the debate on the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Bill the Minister did not reply to this point beyond a passing reference to the need for protection against diseases which <Col N="1583" /> were endemic in animals.  I hope that the Minister will answer the point when he is replying to this debate.  I should also like to know if requirements exist for the regular inspection of machinery used in the pasteurisation of milk.  There are references to the subject in the report of the Joint Services Committee on zoonoses in milk which are common to animals and humans.  This report was presented to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Erskine Childers, and the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy James Gibbons in 1972.  The committee recommended that to be sure that the pasteurising of milk was efficient one needed to inspect the machinery being used at least once every hour.  According to the committee there was no legal requirement to ensure that inspections took place every hour or with any degree of frequency.  The committee also referred to the sale of what was described as the highest grade milk.  I understand that there are only 16 registered producers of highest grade milk.  The committee felt that this category had outlived its usefulness and should be abolished because there was no requirement that it be pasteurised. That would seem to be a reasonable recommendation.  It is unfortunate that this report, which covers the whole range of public health, was never published by either the present or previous Ministers for Health and Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I believe that we must be vigilant in regard to the cost to be borne by farmers for the dairy inspection service.  One must bear in mind that the number of premises which have to be inspected is declining and this should lead to a reduction in the cost of inspection in the sense that there will be less ground to be covered.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could illustrate the extent of the decline by pointing out that between 1975 and 1977 the number of premises registered under the Dairy Produce Act fell from 389 to 245.  In other words the number of premises at which milk was being dealt with, creameries, cream-separating stations and butter factories, was reduced by almost half in two years. This should surely lead to economies in <Col N="1584" /> the cost of the dairy inspection service. If the Minister says that this service is costing £900,000 a year to operate, I take it that he is telling the truth.  But if this is the rate at which the number of premises that have to be inspected is being reduced, almost half in the two-year period for which the figures are available, far from expecting this levy of .10p per gallon of milk to be increased in the future, we should expect that it would be reduced because as the number of premises which have to be inspected declines, the number of inspections and the number of inspectors and hence the cost of providing the service should also decline.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister expect that this figure will be at least stable and possibly declining in the years ahead?  I believe that the proper manner of dealing with these fees would be to set up a separate fund called the dairy inspection fund and all fees received under this Bill should be paid into that fund and that fund should be used solely for the purposes of dairy inspection.  If the cost of dairy inspection is less than the amount in the fund the levies or fees for the subsequent year could be reduced.  This fund should be jointly managed by the creameries, the farmers and the Department of Agriculture.  If that were built into the legislation it would be far more acceptable. But at the moment it is quite possible for the fees contained in this Bill to be increased out of all relation to the actual cost of the service they are supposed to be paying for and for those moneys to be applied for purposes not related to dairy inspection or even to agriculture. Therefore the setting up of a fund such as I have mentioned would be a much needed safeguard in this legislation and would make it acceptable.  As it stands at the moment it is unacceptable because of the lack of safeguards as to the use of the money and because it is mistimed in that it is yet another load on the farming community at a time when so many other levies, must less justified perhaps than this one, are also being imposed upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this levy for the same reasons as I am opposed to all kinds of levies.  Levies are <Col N="1585" /> unfair and unjust.  Because this levy is so small it may seem that it is something not worth bothering about.  But the principle is the same whether the levy is 2 per cent, 1 per cent or .10p on a gallon of milk.  The idea behind the levy is the same and on those grounds it is not right.</P>
      <P>These levies usually end up being paid by the consumer.  I know it is a levy on milk but the argument will be made later on for price increases.  This levy is an extra cost and will in the long term be borne by the consumer because the profitability in milk is being eroded by the various levies so that a case can be made for an increase in the price of milk.</P>
      <P>The principle of introducing levies is a wrong method of collecting fees for the services provided.  That is not the way they should be collected.  It is unfair to the smaller producer.  If a person puts in a small amount of milk they will only pay a small amount but it is unfair that his small profit should be eroded while the bigger producers with a larger amount of profit have only the same minimal amount to pay.  The levy bears no relation to the person's ability to pay and that is where all levies fall down and I oppose it for that reason.</P>
      <P>There are some other things in the Bill which the Minister could claim as being reasonable.  For instance, he could say it is reasonable to increase a levy which has not been increased for 40 years.  If this was done in isolation it is something we could accept but it is being done now in addition to the other levies which are being brought in.  This is the second one we have been discussing and we will be discussing the third one before too long. We have the 2 per cent levy, the beef levy, the bovine TB eradication levy and now we have this levy.  Together they are fairly substantial.  They are unjust and unfair because they do not take into account the ability of the producer to pay and in the long run these costs will be taken into account when a case is being made for price increases and ultimately they will be paid by the consumer because it is known that the cost of production of any item is, in the long term, paid for by the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of inspection <Col N="1586" /> it is not quite clear to me what exactly will be inspected.  This point has been made already but it is a very important one.</P>
    <P>It is important that all our milk be pasteurised.  I believe that only pasteurised milk should be available to the public.  Proper supervision of pasteurisation plants is necessary because I have been told by people who have had reason to examine some of the milk available to the public and which is alleged to be pasteurised that it was found not to be so and not to be disease-free as it should have been if it was pasteurised.  So I would hope that there would be full inspection of creameries and dairies to ensure that what is alleged to be pasteurised is in fact pasteurised. From information I have received from people who are in a position to examine pasteurised milk under a microscope I know that this is not the case at present. If this Bill does something to improve that situation I will be very happy.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will do something to improve that situation.  Every effort should be made to ensure that milk is fully pasteurised.  I do not believe that this is the right way to pay for it.  The Department of Health should surely be involved more in this very intricate business than the Department of Agriculture.  The Department of Agriculture should be involved a lot more in ensuring that pasteurised milk is what it is claimed to be.  Some of the funds necessary to carry out this work should come from the Department of Health.  It is a well-known fact that unpasteurised milk carries brucellosis and bovine TB and that there is serious danger to the health of the people.</P>
    <P>The inspection of those premises should be the concern of the Department of Health and funds for this purpose should be contributed from that Department. It could be said that it is reasonable for the Minister to increase those charges, which have been the same since 1941.  I believe that a system which is not equal, because it bears no relation to a person's ability to pay, is a wrong system.  The imposition of levies has to be paid for by the consumer.  I believe this one will be no different. <Col N="1587" /> While the levy being asked for at the moment is small, there is no guarantee that it will not be increased at any time or that the money which the Exchequer gets from this levy will all be used for the purpose stated by the Minister.  We hope that more money will be received from the levy when there is an increase in the production of milk.  If there is a surplus will the money be used to improve the quality of the inspections and the service to the public in general?</P>
    <P>Those are important points in the Bill. The imposition of a levy is not the proper way to finance anything.  I believe that eventually the consumer will be contributing to the payment of this levy.  I feel, in regard to the inspection of dairies, that where there is a serious health hazard, as there is in all sales of milk if it is not pasteurised, a contribution should come from the Department of Health to pay at least some of the cost.  The inspection should be very thorough in order to protect people from the various diseases that can be carried and passed on through milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I again voice my objection to the principle of levies.  They bear no relation whatsoever to the income of the person paying them.  It seems clear to me, as it is to many others, that the policy of the Government to extract money from the agricultural community to pay for all services will be implemented by levy.  The Government are failing to ask the stronger sections of the farming community, the large farmers, to pay income tax.  They go back then to the system of levies.  I feel very sorry for the small farmers.  It is clear to me, when we see so many levies introduced in the one year, that this is an attempt to get the people used to the levy system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already had a 2 per cent levy for which there was no need.  All the Government had to do was to deduct the 1 per cent VAT and it would practically realise the same amount of money. There was the .5p levy for disease eradication and now we have the .10p per gallon levy.  The timing of all those levies is the important thing we should look at.  I do not mind what the Minister said in reply to the last debate.  The confidence <Col N="1588" /> of farmers is cracked by all those levies which they find in the reductions from their milk cheques.</P>
    <P>When I tried to get some information from a very large creamery this morning they told me that the increase in milk production this year would be very small.  They said that their plans for the extension of their factories must now be put back for another year or two so that they can have a look at the situation.  I believe that the introduction of those levies will seriously set back the growth of agriculture.  The Minister said at the end of his speech:</P>
    <P>As to the rate of fee being provided for at section 3 (1), one-tenth of a penny per gallon can only be described as a very modest imposition.</P>
    <P>When we add up all the levies we find that 2.57p per gallon is being charged in levies this year.  The Minister cannot fool anybody by saying that those levies are small or that farmers can afford to pay them.  How can they afford to pay them in a year when they have had the most expensive spring ever as far as feeding stuffs is concerned and when there was no increase in the actual price per gallon for milk?  When those figures are added up we find that as far as profits are concerned farmers will be in the region of 25 per cent short on last year.  This is the year the Government have chosen to introduce all those levies one after the other.  If a reduction of 25 per cent in profits will not crack any person's confidence, what will?  If the Minister goes into any firm or any enterprise in the country and tells them that they will have 25 per cent less profits next year, will that encourage confidence for expansion? It will not, and the same will apply to the farming community especially after a year where their expenses were very high for feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an attack on private enterprise.  We are giving powers to the Revenue Commissioners to enter premises and to take away books for inspection. Why are we having such huge bureaucratic controls at all levels?  I come from a county where the farmers are not afraid to farm the land, where they are prepared to invest and to expand. <Col N="1589" /> This is the mid-term of the present Government and I presume they want to get as many of the unpopular jobs done as quickly as possible in order to smooth over things in the latter part of their term of office.  However, let us be clear about this&mdash;farmers will not forget what has happened.</P>
    <P>In his reply to this debate I should like the Minister of state to give us a breakdown of the £900,000.  I hope he will give us more information than we got from the Minister for Agriculture in the previous debate.  He treated the House with contempt.  He complained that we did not given any concrete suggestions. That is not so.  The Minister did not reply to the points we raised: he just picked out a few points here and there about which he could quibble.  I should like to know how the £900,000 is being spent. Is it being spent on sending health inspectors to creameries?  If so, I should like to know how many inspectors are involved.  I should like to know what equipment is being used and what level of salary is being paid to these people.  If farmers are being asked to pay for the services, at the very least they are entitled to know how the money is being spent.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that there must be considerable duplication with regard to collection of the levies.  The Board Bainne levy will be collected by the semi-State organisation; I am not sure who collects the EEC levy; the 2 per cent levy will be collected by the Minister for Finance.  I presume the Department of Agriculture will collect the disease eradication levy and this levy will be collected by the Department of Finance. How many sets of officials will visit creameries and study the books?  How much duplication will there be?  If we are so fond of the whole levy system, why not have one levy to cover all matters? Instead, there may be four groups of officials going to the creameries and demanding the books, each group trying to get its own share of the spoils, to get its share of the profits from agriculture.  I am prepared to accept that probably the same figures will apply to everyone, but I know that in each Bill provision is made to remove the books for inspection <Col N="1590" /> if necessary.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that certain powers are being given to the people who are entitled to collect the levies.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the cost of collection of the levies.  Is it being borne out of the £900,000 provided?  If £1 million is collected and if there is an increase in milk production, will the remaining £100,000 be given back to the producers or to the Minister for Finance to finance some other scheme?  It is high time that the farmers were given information about these matters.  They are the only section asked to pay.  The Dublin District Milk Board is a semi-State organisation but it includes producer members.  Many of the functions that are being paid for by agriculture should be handed over to semi-State organisations where there is farmer participation.  When the farmers are being asked to pay for services they should have a say in how the money is being spent.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to give us this information rather than picking out minor political points.  We are interested in this debate and want to know the answers.  In the previous debate the Minister for Agriculture treated us with contempt.  The debate was of no benefit to anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister of State and the Government that it is the opinion of many people that they are killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.  We are now discussing another levy having disposed of several other levies.  No matter how it is described it is a system of taxation imposed on the farming community. Nobody denies that farmers must pay their fair share of tax.  What has bedevilled farming and the agricultural industry in the past has been uncertainty with regard to planning.  This planning is necessary if a farmer is to succeed in making a profit at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past week a number of levies have been introduced.  Although it is difficult to estimate accurately, my guess is that a farmer supplying milk to a creamery or a co-operative will have to pay six different levies out of his cheque. He is at the mercy of the Government as <Col N="1591" /> to whether the levies will be increased in the years ahead.  It is a very dangerous precedent to allow a Minister, at the stroke of a pen, to adjust a levy upwards. I can see here a general reluctance on the part of the Minister and the Government to face the real issue, namely, farmer taxation.  If one goes back over the record of this Government on this issue one finds that the Minister for Finance a year ago introduced a budget that imposed a 2 per cent tax on produce which was amended at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  Further pressure was brought to bear on the Minister, the tax was dropped and then it was reintroduced.  It appears to everyone that the Government, because of political consequences, are afraid to face the problem of farmer taxation and to introduce a fair and equitable system.  The Minister of State understands the problems of the farming community.  If he has any influence with his Government he should tell them to scrap the levies and to introduce a fair and equitable system of farmer taxation.  The Government are not going to get away with this kind of subtle taxation.  At election times they can talk to the farmers about the taxation they are paying and they can do the same to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The proposals of the Government will create many problems.  They will create havoc particularly with the dairy industry and the farming industry as a whole.  In the past any time we had a serious economic crisis, it was the farming community who responded and got us out of our difficulties.  We are killing the goose that lays the golden egg by imposing levy after levy because this is bound to militate against the increased production needed to absorb the people looking for jobs.  Jobs will be available if we give the farmers an incentive to expand their enterprise.  That fact cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>Anybody with knowledge of farming knows that if vast areas of land lying idle could be brought into production, that would create employment.  This would enable us to deal with the social problem which exists at present.  I want the Minister to bear in mind that he is striking <Col N="1592" /> a deadly blow at the farming community and the agricultural industry who are contributing considerably to the economy.  He should consider dropping all levies and introducing a fair and equitable system of taxation for the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to think that when I speak in this House I am being fair. When in opposition in the past if something good was introduced I was not slow to praise it.  I am very disappointed with what happened over the last few weeks.  Like previous Deputies I condemn this levy.  This is another way of extracting money from the man who is up and doing.  We are taxing the man who is doing most to help the economy. This has been a tough year for the dairy industry.  It has been a long harsh winter. Until recently cows were being hand fed. It is only within the last few months that we had any sign of real growth in grass. This has been an expensive difficult year for farmers, especially dairy farmers.  It is not only the amount that is involved in this levy that we are complaining about; not only are we again asking these people for still more money but are asking them to pay for a service which should be provided by the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to score political points in the previous debate.  He said I was hindering the eradication of disease. This was reported in the media but my reply was not reported.  He asked how I proposed to pay for disease eradication. I repeat what I said then&mdash;that is his job.  In the 1977 general election Fianna Fáil squandered money right, left and centre; they spent money as if they had the right to print it.  They wanted to get into Government at any cost.  That decision put our farmers in the position they are in now.  They have to find this money.  The Minister got himself into this difficulty and it is not my job to get him out of it.  If a party deliberately jump into a pit from which there is no exit, they do not have the right to ask anybody, especially an opposition party, to get them out of it.  That is my message to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must not expect the farmers to come up with new payments week after week to get them out of their <Col N="1593" /> difficulties.  Since Fianna Fáil came into power we had to pay for 30-day tests, the 2 per cent levy, the multiplier has been raised to £120, valuation has been reduced to £40, agricultural grants have been removed over £40, lime subsidies have been removed, fertiliser subsidies have been removed; we have had increased levies at factories, bovine disease levies and this levy.  If we carry on like this, where will we finish?  Are we trying to discourage milk production?  Are we trying to do what some of the EEC people would like us to do&mdash;slow down? They talk about butter mountains and so on, but we did not contribute even one pound of butter towards that mountain. We always sold our produce in the market place.  Even if we had a surplus, it would not create as much as a pimple in the European market.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State who is a most reasonable man to work on his colleagues and point out that in his own part of the world especially, dairying is the one industry that can take Ireland out of her troubles.  If we expand the dairying industry and encourage farmers, the spin-off will be far greater than from any levy that could be conceived. The amount of revenue to this State and additional employment created will be far greater than from any penalty imposed on a dairy producer.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do as I ask&mdash;to shelve all these levies and have a good think about them during the recess.  I am sure that, given time, the Government will come up with a much more satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the people in dairying will slow down.  As I have said previously, they cannot afford to get out of it but they may slow down their production. Young people contemplating going into dairying may have second thoughts. That is a pity, because Irish land could not be put to better use.  These young farmers should be encouraged to expand, to borrow and to spend money in developing their dairy herds and improving the quality of their milk.  We should be giving them incentives.  You can lead an Irish farmer but you cannot drive him.  Leadership is needed at the moment and leadership is not being given by the <Col N="1594" /> present Government to the young farmers.  The man at the helm in agriculture should encourage them to advance, give them the necessary incentives and, more than anything else, initiate a long-term programme indicating to them what would be in it for them at the end of the day.  At the moment they do not know whether they are coming or going.</P>
    <P>It is all-important to put a stop to these levies and to tell the farmers that henceforth there will be no more levies and that on the contrary we will adopt a new approach.  We should give them every possible encouragement within our financial constraints.  We are limited in what we can do.  We must go to the lending agencies and encourage them to make money available to the young farmers for developing their dairy herds at a reasonable charge.  For those having difficulties with the present high interest rates we should endeavour to subsidise this interest until they get over the initial hump.  Even talk about things like that from a Minister or a Minister of State would give encouragement.  Instead of making political speeches, as he has done, the Minister should give some indication that this is the end of the line, and henceforth the coin will turn and that he is prepared as Minister to do X, Y and Z to help the dairy farmers along the road to success.</P>
    <P>There is job potential in dairying and the industrial jobs that could be created therein cannot be measured.  There could be numerous jobs in co-operatives, creameries, processing plants, transport, fertilisers and marketing.  As well as that the number of extra people will mean additional consumption of the products. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister that, instead of discouraging, he will use his influence and adopt a positive approach because that is what is needed.</P>
    <P>For goodness sake, do not ask us where the money is to come from if we do not impose levies.  The Government are the people who spent it in 1977.  It is their business to remedy the mistakes they have made.  But let them not remedy them at the expense of the people who are working seven days a week for 12 months of the year to produce milk so that they can make enough <Col N="1595" /> money to pay their bills, to raise their families and also to create substantial employment in this land.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use his influence with the Minister to stop all these levies now and, in God's name, to adopt a positive approach for the future for the Irish farmer before we end up in disaster.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for the contributions they have made on this Bill.  I would love to comply with the request to abolish this levy and all other levies if it were possible, but I am sure the Deputies would not expect me to do that, even though they have said they would in their speeches here this afternoon. Nobody likes tax.  That is obvious from the speeches we have heard on both this Bill and the other Bill which was before the House earlier today.  That is only natural.  Whether we are farmers, business people or workers, nobody wants to pay tax.  That is the unfortunate situation in this country.  Perhaps our history conditions us to that, because in the past we have not been used to earning the same as industrial workers in England and other developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This levy is a very small one.  It is not a new levy, and possibly the biggest mistake here is that this levy has not been increased over the years.  As I said in my opening remarks, it has been in operation since 1941 and it has never changed since then even though the cost of the service provided has increased substantially over those years.  It is still a necessary part of the whole system and naturally it has to be paid for.  I was sorry to hear Deputy Hegarty state that he would not be prepared to co-operate in trying to find the answer to any of those thorny questions of farmer taxation, levies and so on.  It is a pity that the farming organisations, the politicians and everybody else concerned could not come together and hammer out a system that would be fair, equitable and acceptable to everybody.  We hear from both sides of the House, from the Opposition and the Government, that farmers are prepared to pay their fair share of tax, but nobody seems to be able to say what <Col N="1596" /> that fair share is.</P>

Then we might be able to cut out a lot of the political cross-fire in the House about farmers' tax and so on.  However, politics being what they are in this country, that will not be possible because what would be acceptable to the Opposition I cannot see as acceptable to the party in Government, nor to the farming organisations for that matter.</P>
      <P>I will answer briefly some of the points raised by the Deputies.  Probably I will not be able to satisfy them in full but I will do the best I can to refer to some of the matters they raised in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton and Deputy Bermingham both stressed the need for pasteurisation of all liquid milk.  I agree that this would be very desirable but, unfortunately, it is not relevant under this Bill so there is nothing we can do about it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the levy, Deputy Bruton suggested that it can be increased and used for Exchequer purposes. This is not the intention and the safeguard for this is provided in section 3 (3).  The fee can be increased only by order which can be annulled by either House of the Oireachtas.  That is the safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no safeguard at all.  The Government have a majority and could hammer through anything they liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>A Deputy as observant as Deputy Bruton would not be prepared to let that go through without putting up a strong fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also raised the question of what inspectors do and suggested that it should be less than in 1975 when there were 389 creamery plants as compared with 245 in 1977.  A continuous official inspection service of dairy premises, plant and equipment is provided together with continuous monitoring of the quality of a wide range of dairy products manufactured.  More <Col N="1598" /> sophisticated dairy plant is now used and a much wider range of dairy products manufactured than when the fee was introduced in 1941.  It is necessary to ensure compliance with the quality standards demanded by purchasers of dairy produce on export markets and for this and other purposes two extra dairy science laboratories were established in recent years.  The volume of dairy produce for inspection has also increased considerably in recent years. For instance, milk intake in 1978 amounted to nearly 1,000 million gallons as compared with about 380 million gallons in 1957.  Considering that list of duties there does not seem to be any danger that those people would be idle at any time.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy raised the question of the cost of the service and how the £900,000 is broken up.  This figure was mentioned in the White Paper and is based on the average of the salary scales involved plus the supplementary costs, travelling and subsistence expenses.  I cannot give a more detailed breakdown at this time.  I hope I have answered all the points raised by Deputies.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up a statutory body, called Córas Beostoic agus Feola, to define its powers and to make provision for the financing of its work.  A body called Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta exists already.  It was established in 1969 under the Companies Act and is a company limited by guarantee.  It has no share capital and is entirely Exchequer-financed.</P>
      <P>The main functions of Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta, as set out in its memorandum of association, are to promote the export of cattle and sheep and the meat of cattle and sheep.  This body will be wound up when the present proposals become law.  I should like to record my appreciation of the work done by Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta since its establishment.  In spite of its limited resources and restricted brief it has made an important contribution to the very satisfactory growth achieved by the Irish livestock and meat export trade over the last ten years.  Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta has successfully promoted Irish beef and lamb abroad.</P>

Perhaps its most important and successful function has been the provision of an information service to the livestock and meat industry.</P>
    <P>Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta has always enjoyed a close working relationship with my Department.  It is my intention that a similar fruitful relationship should exist with its successor. It was always the intention that, in time, legislation would be introduced to put the organisation on a statutory basis. I am certain that it is now opportune to make Córas Beostoic agus Feola a statutory body and, in addition, to broaden the scope of its activities while making new arrangements for its financing. I have long felt that Córas Beostoic agus Feola has been unduly restricted and has been prevented from playing the kind of development role our livestock and meat industry now requires.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the recent increases in CIE fares approved by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure I will have the backing of every Deputy in the House in deploring the recent increases in CIE fares approved by the Government.  The Minister must be worried about introducing these increases at this point in time.  I put it to the Minister that never before were we in such need of an efficient national transport system.  It is absolutely imperative in the national interests that we encourage people to use the public transport system.  Judging from news reports it appears that the oil crisis is becoming more serious as time goes by and this affects us as much as everybody else.  We <Col N="1602" /> had an ideal opportunity to encourage people to use the national transport system, but what did we do?  Instead of encouraging them we substantially increased the fares by a minimum of 15 per cent and a maximum of 20 per cent. Due to the oil crisis the numbers using CIE were increasing but with the increased fares the people will go back to using private transport.  This happened before when an increase in fares was announced last May.  I do not have accurate figures, I can only repeat what a CIE spokesman stated, which is, that the numbers using CIE because of the oil crisis were increasing.  In America a record number of people are using public transport and are moving away from private transport.</P>
    <P>The size of the increases will bear looking into.  The amounts requested vary from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The National Prices Commission recommended a 17 per cent increase in train mainline fares and in long distance bus fares and the Government saw fit to grant the increase requested.  The National Prices Commission recommended a 15 per cent increase in road freight charges and that was granted by the Government.  The Government should not have granted the full request. The National Prices Commission Monthly Report No. 82 for March 1979 stated that, although the increases proposed fell far short of allowable costs, it was felt that these were the maximum the market would carry at that stage.  To give the maximum that the market would be able to carry according to the National Prices Commission and as accepted by the Government is something that one must seriously question. Although the National Prices Commission referred to the maximum the market could carry, only time will tell whether or not the market will be able to meet the amount.  It appears to be in excess of what the market will be able to carry.</P>
    <P>During the last few months for the first time in years there was freedom of movement on the roads due to the petrol situation.  People were beginning to use CIE more.  Because of the increased movement towards CIE the Minister should have taken his courage in his <Col N="1603" /> hands, gone to the Cabinet and stated that he was anxious to ensure that we had a public transport service worthy of the name and should have asked for funds to update the service and attract more people to use it.  This would have been a tremendous boon to the country. The Minister would have helped working men and women by making it attractive for them to use public rather than private transport when going to work. The Minister would also have benefited tourism interests by providing reduced fares rather than increased fares for public transport.  That would have been the wise course to have adopted at this time.</P>
    <P>I consider the decision to allow the increases to be a dangerous step, having regard to present circumstances.  Undoubtedly, these increases will mean a falling-off in the use of public transport. There has been such a falling-off in the past in similar situations.  At a time when people were turning more to public transport, the Minister had a unique opportunity to take advantage of that situation. Instead, his action is bound to result in a reversal of that trend.  It would have been in the national interest to have encouraged people to switch so far as possible from private to public transport because in that way the amount of petrol and oil being imported would be curtailed. Similarly, in regard to road freight the Minister has missed a unique opportunity to encourage people to switch from private to public systems.  The real effects of this increase will only be realised when future CIE reports have been published.</P>
    <P>The NPC report sets out the losses suffered by CIE down through the years. We note, too, that the subvention from the Government to CIE this year is £36,357.  However, we know that that is not the end of the matter because, in reply to a Private Notice Question in my name, the Minister seemed to imply that it may be necessary to increase CIE fares further.  He mentioned the fact that CIE had applied for an increase of from 15 to 20 per cent and said that the Government had decided that the board should be permitted to implement the increases sought, subject to there not being <Col N="1604" /> increases in respect of fare-paying school children.  The Minister said that, even with the increases in rates and fares, the subvention to CIE this year would be seriously inadequate and that the company had sought a substantial increase in the subvention, a request that he was examining.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consider the whole situation seriously because, if he is to allow further increases in fares, public transport will be hit badly.  He has a serious obligation in this regard.  We are told that on an annual basis the increases in fares that have been granted will mean additional revenue of about £11.612 million.  When the Minister is speaking to the debate I should like him to tell us what further subvention have CIE requested from the Department.  It is important that we have this informaton in order that we might know the exact position.  If there is a further major subvention being sought by the company, the House should be told the extent of that subvention and we should be told also the level of additional increases likely to be necessary in respect of rates and fares in the event of the Government not granting an increase in the subvention.</P>
    <P>In his reply to my Private Notice Question the Minister said also that it would be unreasonable to place the total burden of the increased cost on the taxpayer and that therefore those who use public transport should pay at least part of the increases.  I should like the Minister to confirm during this debate that there will not be further increases in CIE fares.  We want this assurance because if further increases should be made there will be a diminishing of the numbers using public transport and the consequence of that situation would be requests for further increases.</P>
    <P>This year there has been an increase of 8 per cent in passengers on mainline services.  That information is given in the NPC report.  The move towards greater use of public transport began in 1978 and the situation has improved substantially. I note from the Order Paper that the Minister has tabled the following amendment to the motion:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil <Col N="1605" /> Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>notes that CIE's application for an increase in fares has been examined by the National Prices Commission and that the Commission have found that CIE's allowable costs were greater than the revenue expected from the proposed increases and that the application fulfilled the normal criteria for price increases; and recognises that if the Government were to refuse to sanction the increase in fares the resultant Revenue loss would have to be met by the taxpayer in the form of subsidy or CIE would be obliged to withdraw services with consequential loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that between 1975 and 1 January 1979 the number of staff employed has been reduced by 3,652 to 16,292.  Instead of helping to maintain employment the increased fares will lead to fewer people using public transport and a consequential loss of employment.</P>
    <P>Never before have CIE needed an injection of capital.  The Government should take their courage in their hands and give CIE a substantial injection of capital.  The proper management of such capital would ensure that CIE had sufficient funds to modernise their services. Capital is also necessary to maintain an adequate transport system.  If the money were allocated to CIE under specific subheads for the improvement of their services it would be of benefit to all sections of the community.  I believe that CIE should be expanding their services instead of reducing them.  As the new Expressway service is a success, I believe that expanding the service would encourage more people to use public transport.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately CIE are working on a shoe-string.  They are working on a day-to-day basis and are depending for finance on the whim of the Government. This means that they are unable to plan for the further.  As the fuel which we import is needed for industry, tourism and many emergency services, we should be encouraging the public to use the services of CIE instead of encouraging them to use private transport.  Of course, the best way to do this is to try to ensure <Col N="1606" /> that CIE's services are economical.  The current increases in fares will only encourage more people to use cars.</P>
    <P>The increases have also hit the poorer section of the community who depend on public transport.  A 15 per cent to 20 per cent increase in fares is a large one for a working man and it will have a harsh impact on the standard of living of many families.  For that reason I regret that an effort is not being made to lessen the impact of the increases on those who use public transport to travel to and from their places of employment.</P>
    <P>As I said, the increases will lead to severe traffic congestion in our cities.  I know that the Minister will say that I cannot prove what I have said.  All I can say is that such increases lead to more people using private transport. Whenever there is an increase in CIE fares it leads to a situation where people ask themselves which is the most economical, the motor car or public transport.  These increases tend to frighten people away from public transport and this is happening at a time when the Government are encouraging people to conserve energy.  It sounds very strange to me that on the one hand the Government are advising people to conserve energy and on the other hand now increasing bus fares.  I cannot see the logic of it.</P>
    <P>While we are discussing this I feel we should touch on the present position in regard to what is happening to the transport authority promised by the Government at the last general election campaign.</P>

      <P>We are widening the scope of the debate if we are going to bring in transport authorities and things of that kind.  The motion and the amendment refer only to CIE fares.  I have allowed the Deputy a fair amount of latitude but he should not overdo it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at this time an urgent necessity for the Minister to meet and consult with CIE to try to improve bus, train and freight services here. There are improvements that can be made.  CIE themselves have met change in an excellent manner and have proved <Col N="1607" /> themselves able to adapt to change.  The Government should increase the subvention to CIE.  We are now in a situation where fares have been increased and one of the ways to avoid this would have been to increase the subvention.  By running down CIE, or even by appearing to do so, and by increasing fares the Government are in the long run going to have to go back to the taxpayers for further increases and they are damaging CIE's efforts to improve the service they are providing.  An increased subsidy at this time would certainly have been of benefit to them and would have avoided this increase in fares.  The Minister helped people with motor cars by doing away with car tax at a time when a subsidy to CIE would have been of benefit to the poorer sections of our community and to people who commute daily to work and who use buses and trains each day.  This increase in fares will mean much difficulty and a reduced standard of living in many homes here but it is no hardship for people with their own private means of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would put it to the Minister that never before was it so necessary for a Government to give a sizeable capital allocation to CIE to ensure that our national transport system is built up.  I am confident that if we build up the national transport system we will save enormously on energy consumption and that this will benefit the economy.  A sizeable capital contribution would safeguard the jobs of the workers in CIE.  The Government's method of handling the situation at present will lead to a reduction in the numbers using public transport.  It will lead to an increased demand for petrol and, in the long run, to further congestion on the roads.  All of this is totally unnecessary.  The Minister has the power to withdraw these increases.  By so doing he would be encouraging people to use public transport, he would be protecting the jobs of the people who work in CIE and he would be helping to improve the national transport system, something which was never more urgently needed than it is at present.  It is up to the Minister to take the initiative to ensure that the national transport system is put <Col N="1608" /> on a par with every other such system in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that CIE's application for an increase in fares has been examined by the National Prices Commission and that the Commission have found that CIE's allowable costs were greater than the revenue expected from the proposed increases and that the application fulfilled the normal criteria for price increases; and recognises that if the Government were to refuse to sanction the increase in fares the resultant revenue loss would have to be met by the taxpayer in the form of subsidy or CIE would be obliged to withdraw services with consequential loss of jobs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regret as much as anyone the need to increase bus and train fares, but the harsh fact remains that in a situation of rapidly escalating costs the increases are unavoidable.  In February 1979 CIE submitted proposals for increases in fares and rates ranging on average from 15 per cent to 20 per cent to meet increases in labour, materials and other costs which had arisen since the Board's last application to increase fares made in February 1978.  In submitting their application to the National Prices Commission CIE claimed that they had incurred cost increases totalling £16.404 million of which £10.351 million (or 63 per cent) was for wages and other labour costs, £3.148 million (or 19 per cent) was for increased costs of materials and a further £2.905 million (or 18 per cent) was for increased depreciation and financial charges due to new investment charges and higher replacement costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the CIE application was to secure increased revenue so as to contain, as far as possible, the board's subvention requirements for 1979 within the subvention provision of £35 million provided in the Estimate for my Department. When the National Prices Commission <Col N="1609" /> applied to the CIE proposals their strict criteria for evaluating the costs allowable for price increases, they found that £14.762 million of the total claimed by CIE came within their guidelines.  Thus the Prices Commission were in fact saying that CIE had incurred additional costs of £14.762 million which would qualify to be met by increases in fares.  However CIE were not seeking the full amount and were looking for a price increase which would yield £11.6 million in a full year or approximately 80 per cent of what the Commission said was allowable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on the basis of the costs shown in the CIE application the increases in fares and rates were justified. Moreover, while the application was under consideration CIE's costs continued to escalate, and it is now apparent that CIE's deficit in 1979 will substantially exceed their original projections. The increased deficit is due primarily to large inceases in labour and oil costs and the adverse effects on revenue of industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, having regard to the observations of the National Prices Commission on the application and in the light of the board's financial situation and the increasing burden on the Exchequer, the Government decided that the board should be permitted to implement the proposed increases in fares and rates subject, however, to no increase being made in the fares of fare paying school-children. I want to emphasise that there was no increase in the fares for fare paying school-children.  Even with the increases in fares and rates the £35 million subvention for 1979 will now be seriously inadequate.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is not possible to make a firm prediction of the size of the final deficit on CIE's operations for 1979, and while I will shortly be seeking Dáil approval for a Supplementary Estimate of £10 million for CIE in addition to the existing subvention provision of £35 million, there will nevertheless remain a further significant gap between revenue and expenditure which will have to be bridged.  The figures I am referring to here are no small amounts of money.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about this situation and I propose to have a critical assessment <Col N="1610" /> of CIE's financial position undertaken to see what remedial measures should be adopted and how savings might be achieved.  Pending this examination, the provision of £10 million in the proposed Supplementary Estimate, together with the board's temporary borrowings and the yield from the increased fares and rates, will enable CIE to maintain services and to meet the board's commitments.</P>
    <P>In the light of the situation I have depicted, I do not regard the increases of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent as unreasonable.  As I have already informed the House, there are to be no increases in the fares of fare paying school-children, while the increases on urban and town fares will be on a tapering scale so that the impact on higher fare values will be minimised.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the users of public transport are being asked to bear only part of the additional costs being incurred by CIE.  In fact, the increase in fares and rates will yield less than half of the total additional costs as at present estimated.  I do not think that anyone can argue that it would be equitable to place the total burden of the extra costs on the shoulders of the taxpayer, who is already paying a very substantial amount towards the cost of CIE's services.</P>
    <P>The increases in fares and rates may appear substantial, but Deputies should not overlook the fact that a very large percentage of CIE passengers avail of the concessionary fares offered on CIE services both road and rail.  These include the monthly bus and bus/rail commuter tickets which give unlimited travel facilities on the Dublin city services and which are particularly favourable to regular commuters.  There are, as well, a wide variety of return, season and other reduced fare tickets available on mainline rail passenger and provincial long distance bus services.  It is of interest to note that only 8 per cent of the total number of passenger journeys on the mainline rail passenger services represent adult full fares while concession fares represent 75 per cent of total travel on Dublin suburban rail services.</P>
    <P>Deputies should also remember that free travel is available to children who <Col N="1611" /> qualify under the free schools transport scheme, to all persons who are 66 years of age or over, to blind persons over 21 years, to veterans of the War of Independence and their wives and to the widows of those veterans.  For example, free travel of all types represents 28 per cent of total passenger journeys on provincial long distance bus services. The provisions in the 1979 Estimates for those free transport services amount to £23.837 million and when this is added to the £45 million which is being provided by my Department, it is clear that the Exchequer and, therefore, the taxpayer is making a massive contribution to the provision of transport services.</P>
    <P>It is on the railway that the bulk of CIE's losses are still being incurred.  In 1978 the deficit amounted to £31 million, an increase of £3.7 million on the deficit in 1977.  The present CIE estimate for 1979 indicates an increase of about £4 million over the 1978 figure. Successive Governments have approved of the retention of a national railway system for economic and social reasons while recognising that this would entail payment of subvention.  At the same time the railway must be operated as efficiently and as economically as possible. With this in mind additional capital moneys have been made available to CIE to enable them to carry out a modernisation and development programme designed to improve efficiency and attract new traffic.  The programme is based on the development of a radial rail network of some 70 passenger stations and about 45 freight centres.</P>
    <P>The programme for freight traffic, which was commenced some years ago is nearing completion.  The freight service has been totally redesigned and nearly all freight traffic is now carried in new purpose-built wagons on a block train basis.  The train is the unit of movement and wagons are not detached en route and shunting of wagons is eliminated.  Mechanical handling facilities and so on have been provided. The emphasis is on bulk haulage and unit load movements including the <Col N="1612" /> handling of sundries traffic in containers. Under the new sundries system, traffic is loaded in such a way that we have a much more efficient system than we had heretofore.  This arrangement was adopted because of the flexibility it provided in the interchange between rail and road and the greater mechanisation in handling arrangements which it allows.</P>
    <P>While there was an overall increase in rail freight tonnage in 1978 over 1977, the result was disappointing particularly because some of the operations were severely disrupted by external problems involving some of the major traffic flows such as cement and fertilisers.  The results of the introduction of the new sundries system have, so far, also been disappointing.  There has been a significant reduction in the amount of sundries traffic.  I would hope that this is only a temporary phase representing transitional problems in the change-over from the old to the new system and that CIE will not only recover traffic lost but will be successful in their objective of attracting a greater share of the freight market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by sundry services?  Is this the change-over to the new freight system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Development of rail passenger services is also continuing. This development includes the upgrading of the permanent way for faster travel and I am glad to record in this area that the pattern of increased passenger carryings on the railway is continuing. On the mainline service the increased business can be mainly attributed to the new timetables introduced in 1977, increased frequencies on all routes and a reduction in journey times, together with vigorous marketing activities and other developments.  The reliability of mainline rail passenger services was demonstrated in the early part of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carryings on Dublin suburban rail services also continue to increase.  The value of these services has been recognised in the recently announced Government decision on the electrification of the Howth to Bray suburban rail <Col N="1613" /> services.</P>
    <P>The project will involve electrification of the Howth-Bray railway line, the acquisition of new, modern rolling stock, the provision of new signalling and depot facilities and the opening of new stations on the line.  Employment for about 280 persons will be provided during the course of implementation of the electrification project, which will take from two and a half to three and a half years to complete.</P>
    <P>Electrification of the Howth-Bray services will bring about a substantial improvement on the existing suburban rail services in terms of frequency, speed and passenger comfort.  I do not have to go into the details of that as I have done so already.</P>
    <P>While, as I have stated already, the railway accounts for the greater part of the CIE deficit, losses on road passenger services are now giving cause for serious concern.  Present CIE estimates for 1979 indicate a doubling of CIE losses on Dublin city bus services over those in 1978 and a trebling of the losses on provincial buses.  At the same time the trend in recent years has been for a decline in the number using Dublin and provincial bus services and this trend has been accentuated this year by the effects of industrial disputes.  While it is true to say that some of the fall-off in traffic can be attributed to resistance to fare increases, there are quite a number of other reasons for the fall-off. Patronage of public transport services is also dependent to a considerable extent on the efficiency and reliability of the services.  I am aware that traffic congestion affects the quality of CIE's services in urban areas and, in turn, this leads to greater usage of private cars, still greater traffic congestion, loss of revenue to public transport and increased Exchequer subsidy.  That is why, as I said on an earlier occasion, that I have asked the Transport Consultative Commission which I established in 1978 to give priority to an examination of the arrangements for the provision of urban passenger services with particular reference to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the CIE's Expressway bus services are still proving successful.  As regards road freight, there <Col N="1614" /> was a decline in tonnage carried on CIE vehicles in 1978 due to a number of factors. It is hoped that that traffic will pick up again.</P>
    <P>In view of the inevitable attention which the CIE deficit attracts, I would like to record that the board and management of CIE have in recent years made commendable efforts to improve the financial performance of the undertaking. The board's policy has been aimed at solving the problems of rising costs and falling revenue by the reduction of overall manning costs and by providing services which would stimulate growth in the volume of freight and passenger numbers.  Some considerable success has been achieved in some areas.</P>
    <P>Since over 60 per cent of CIE's total costs is absorbed by salaries, wages and associated costs, the board's efforts to reduce staffing levels are most important. Since the beginning of its reorganisation drive which began early in 1975, there has been a reduction in numbers of 3,593.  The financial savings resulting from reductions in staff numbers are, however, not apparent in the years in which they are being achieved, as productivity and bulk severance payments tend to cancel the betterment in the short term.  The full benefit, consequently, will not be reflected in working results, especially on rail, where more than half of the savings are being achieved, until the overall reorganisation for each business is complete.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, CIE's financial results in recent years reflected the success of the board's reorganisation programme. A significant increase in productivity was recorded and most performance indicators showed improvements in 1976 and 1977.  For two years in succession, the results gave hope that the deficit was being stabilised in real terms.  The achievements of these improvements at a time of high inflation was most encouraging. It was all the more disappointing, therefore, that circumstances should have combined this year to cause a serious setback to the progress previously recorded.  Many of the factors <Col N="1615" /> contributing to the disimprovement this year were not within the direct control of CIE but the net result involves demands on the Exchequer on a scale which is causing the Government considerable anxiety.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the Government had to consider the current increase in fares.  One cannot escape the fact where there is a gap between expenditure and income, there are only two courses open&mdash;to reduce the one or increase the other.  Apart from the productivity measures I have outlined the only way in which CIE's expenditure could be further reduced would be by cutting services.  Since the bulk of the board's losses are on the rail services and on road passenger services, one would have to look in that direction.  I would remind the House that Governments in the past following an investigation by consultants, decided that the railway system should continue to be preserved subject to concentration and reorganisation in accordance with the concepts outlined in the consultant's report as developed in further studies made by CIE.  I hardly think that those who now deplore the increase in fares are recommending a reversal of that policy or a closure of large sections of the railway or drastic reductions in road passenger services. That is what a refusal to face the reality of increased fares would mean.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>If a reduction in services to bring about a saving equivalent to the yield in a full year from the increased fares and rates were contemplated it would mean an immediate reduction in services of the order of 12 per cent.  This in turn would result in the loss of revenue earned by the services terminated, which would in effect mean a further reduction in services and staff leading to the disemployment of a large number of people.  Is this what the public want?  I do not think so. I ask Deputies to take particular note of that.</P>
    <P>The other possible way of closing the gap between expenditure and income is to increase income either by way of increased subvention from the taxpayer or an increased contribution from the user. As I have already stated a provision of <Col N="1616" /> £35 million is included in the Estimates for my Department this year and a Supplementary Estimate of £10 million will be sought shortly.  I feel it would be totally unreasonable to ask the taxpayer to shoulder the full amount of CIE's increased costs in 1979.  Therefore, the Government have decided that at least part of the increased costs should be borne by the users of public transport.</P>
    <P>While listening to Deputy Enright talking about the size of the increases, a thought struck me.  When the Coalition were in office in August 1973 there was an increase of 22 per cent, in July 1974, one of 20 per cent, in March 1976, an increase of 33 per cent and in March 1977 a further increase of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is no pleasure for me to announce increases in CIE fares.  We should, however, see the matter in its wider perspective.  The operation of a public transport service involves costs in excess of the revenue which the service can earn.  It is essential, however, that we maintain a public transport system as part of our economic and social structure.  The State has recognised this need by providing substantial sums to bridge the gap between revenue and costs.  Like public transport undertakings in other countries CIE must contend with many difficult problems, including the increasing competition from private transport.</P>
    <P>There are, however, limits to the burden which the Exchequer should be asked to bear.  In present day circumstances and given the public service obligations which the board must bear, it would be illusory to expect CIE to operate on a commercially profitable basis, but we do expect that they will operate efficiently and economically and at least cost to the taxpayer.  The achievement of this objective requires not only a commitment by management and staff but also the co-operation of the trade unions involved.</P>
    <P>An efficient transport system is an important element in achieving economic growth and social progress.  The Government recognise that it is essential to carry out regular reviews of transport policy so as to achieve the best balance between public and private transport and to secure the maximum benefit from <Col N="1617" /> the transport system for the community as a whole.  That is why the Transport Consultative Commission was established. The terms of reference of the Commission are comprehensive but are primarily concerned with the problems of road and rail transport, both passenger and freight.  The commission's reports will provide a useful basis for reviewing policy in these fields.</P>
    <P>The deterioration in CIE's financial position in the current year is a subject which will require urgent consideration in the coming months.  Those who are critical of the fares increases have to choose between the alternatives.  Either all the burden should be borne by those who use the service or it should be placed on the taxpayer, as appears from this motion.  I have no doubt that the people who are so anxious to put the total burden on the taxpayers are the same people who were demanding reductions in PAYE and who supported the farmers' anti-tax demonstrations. The other alternative is to cut back on the services with consequent loss of employment, and I do not think anybody wants that.</P>
    <P>The attitude adopted by the Government in this case&mdash;and I think it was the proper one&mdash;was to spread the burden across as many shoulders as possible, that is, part of the deficit would be borne by the users of the transport system and part by the taxpayer.  The fares and rates increases recently announced were clearly necessary and unavoidable and I, therefore, ask the House to adopt the amendment I have tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on behalf of the Labour Party.  I cannot help but comment that, while the terms of both the amendment and the motion are concerned strictly with fares, the Minister's contribution would appear to make it open season on CIE.  It is sad to see a Minister with the experience of Deputy Faulkner meandering his way for half an hour in this House around the issue of transport policy, being forced to drag in references to what the Coalition did when the Coalition were last last in office, and then to end up more or less pushing the problem that is now on the <Col N="1618" /> Government's desk somewhere back into the middle of this Chamber, saying &ldquo;Do not hit the piano player, he is only doing his best&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, too many people in this country depend on the out-of-tune piano playing that this Government are frequently resorting to not only in transport policy but in other areas as well.</P>
      <P>The first absurd contradiction and instance of Government disarray is that in half an hour of discussion on transportation and CIE the Minister for Tourism and Transport&mdash;even the title indicates the priorities of the Department&mdash; did not in my recollection, although the record of the House may correct me, mention the words &ldquo;energy conservation&rdquo; once.  Yet we had the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy on the radio last Sunday giving advice to the Minister for Environment which that Minister will not take and appealing for some sense of energy conservation in relation to transport which obviously is falling on deaf ears with another Cabinet colleague.</P>
      <P>This is where the problem begins.  It is for the Minister to tell us what his internal difficulties are in trying to decide between the provision of revenue for CIE from either subsidy by way of taxation subvention or increased fares.  In the absence of an integrated transport policy for this country, this demonstrates the complete poverty of this Government in relation to transport policy.  The tragedy is that the Minister has enormous personal experience in this House in a number of areas.  He was well respected by many Deputies in this House, and is a member of a political party who, regrettably, have presided in office over many years.  He has not come new to office, nor are the Government party in office for the first time, yet we have the poverty of the Minister's submission in relation to fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases, sought in February, were not granted prior to 7 June when people went to the polls to determine their local and European representatives but, cleverly enough, were announced afterwards.  The consequences of these increased in the area of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway will be to take more people out of the public transport <Col N="1619" /> system, put them into their cars or their neighbour's cars, put them on to already congested roads to consume more of the precious black gold of which the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is now traipsing around the world trying to find new suppliers.  They will exacerbate further our balance of payments problems and generally upset the already bad situation in relation to the economic prospect of this country. Did we get any adequate reference to that from the Minister for Tourism and Transport to indicate that he did not know that those might be the consequences? Have the Department done any assessment of what the likely displacement of passengers from CIE on to the road system is likely to be?  In reply to a supplementary question by me in this House last week or the week before, the Minister, with his pained, doleful eyes, more or less invoked the character of a school-teacher telling Deputies to have some sense and not be bothering him.</P>
    <P>But the Minister does not have to come to work in a bus.  He does not have to suffer the difficulties of sitting in a traffic jam in a bus waiting for it to get in on time, nor is he docked time if he is in late.  Some of his officials might attempt to do the sums regarding the consequences of this governmental decision in the greater Dublin area and the other urban areas where the urban passenger services will be affected.  In doing those sums they are going to realise how difficult it is to have a transportation policy if responsibility for transport is split over three separate Government Departments and in reality nobody is responsible for transport.  The Department are, in their own terms of priority, titled tourism first and transport second.  When we return to office the whole Department responsible for transport will be integrated into the Department of the Environment. You cannot talk seriously about transportation policy and what is happening to your road structure in the absence of integrating the provision of public transport services with the provision of roads.</P>
    <P>Tragically for this country and for the people who cannot afford to run a car, the consequences of this prolonged <Col N="1620" /> decision&mdash;which is over many administrations and the Minister present is not responsible exclusively for it&mdash;have been the total schizophrenic split in transport policy between the Customs House and Kildare Street, so much so that when the Minister for Transport used to go to transport council meetings in Brussels it was an assistant secretary from the Department of Local Government who frequently would accompany him because of the integration of roads into transport matters generally.  If we had an integration of the Department responsible for transport with the Department of the Environment and if responsibility for CIE was vested in that Government Department we would not have the contradictory nonsense implicit in the Government amendment to this notion which talks about &ldquo;the form of subsidy&rdquo; by way of increased taxation. If fares were to be paid at the present level and if the extra deficit was to be met by extra taxation this would result in a subsidy to the travelling passengers.</P>
    <P>There is no mention and no recognition of the fact that this Government gave a massive subsidy to the carowning and car-travelling public of this country when they abolished car tax free, gratis and unsolicited two years ago by way of an election gimmick.  That was a one-off subsidy designed&mdash;successfully as it turned out&mdash;to gain some of the 84 seats.  There is no mention of a recurring subsidy implicit in the road allocation made each year to people who drive either cars or trucks, or of the implicit subsidy to freight hauliers who drive enormous trucks over our road system and cause considerable damage to that road system in certain areas, which is away in excess of the revenue which we get from the licences for those trucks.  There is no mention of that subsidy, again because of the split of governmental responsibility between the two Departments.  A vicious circle has bedevilled public transport operators in countries throughout the world, particularly in regard to operations in built-up areas.  An increase in fares will result in a decline in passenger traffic because passengers will seek to travel by way of private transport on the same road space as public transport, thus leading to congestion <Col N="1621" /> which in turn will decrease the quality and efficiency of the public transport service.  That decline in the quality of the service will precipitate a further number of people leaving public transport in favour of private transport, thus causing a drop in revenue; and the whole cycle starts again.</P>
    <P>The Minister frequently referred to the deficit funding for CIE, thus demonstrating the inbuilt prejudice of the Government in regard to CIE. Nobody refers to the deficit in the Department of Health or Education but we talk about the deficit in the Department of Tourism and Transport in regard to CIE.  The major portion of the subvention given to CIE is for the rail system which many people on that side of the House would like to have killed off entirely but which we are now very glad has been kept.  It was bedevilled by exactly the same cycle of increased fares, declining passengers, loss of revenue and further necessity for increased fares until a deliberate marketing decision was taken by CIE about seven or eight years ago when they slashed fares in order to generate passenger revenue.  Consequently there was a dramatic increase in the number of passengers carried by mainline rail services.  Why is not the same strategy now being applied to the public transport system in congested urban areas?  On the one hand we have requests for capital funds for part of CIE's development programme and current account funds to meet their subvention; on the other hand there are requests from the Department of the Environment to build major urban motorways to cope with traffic congestion which is in part a product of the imbalance between public and private passenger movement.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly asked for some degree of professional analysis, as distinct from opinion from a transportation consultative commission, from the Government Departments who are responsible.  We are still waiting for the answer.  The Ministers have the resources to do these sums and sufficient research and analysis has been done in other countries into the effective social <Col N="1622" /> cost-benefit which could result from subventing in a serious way the bus and rail services in the Dublin area and bus services in built-up areas throughout the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>In the continued moans from the Government benches one can almost hear the prose of the principal officers of the Department of Finance bemoaning the fact that more money must go to CIE, while at the same time they write cheques for the Department of the Environment to build wider and larger roads to cope with the congestion caused by the effective breakdown of the public transport system in urban areas. When will the Government realise that they cannot widen every street in the towns of Ireland?  Listening to engineers and the fashionable exponents of transport solutions in the mid-sixties one would have thought that the only thing wrong with Dublin or Cork was that all the buildings were in the way of the traffic and that if they could be knocked down and the streets widened the problems would be solved.  We cannot do that; yet we persist in the belief. Because of that we continue to refuse to give to the public transport system the degree of subvention required.</P>
    <P>All this post-election sanctioned increase will do is increase further the decline in passenger traffic using the bus services.  I have not the resources to analyse what the likely percentage decrease will be and it would be useful to know if the Government had that figure to hand before they sanctioned the increase. CIE sought £11.6 million which is 80 per cent of what would be considered acceptable by the NPC.  Is that 80 per cent considered to be the threshold beyond which there would be a precipitous fall in passenger traffic? Why did they stop at 80 per cent?</P>
    <P>The Minister made the misleading suggestion that the taxpayer was subsidising CIE through the social welfare allocation which is in the region of £28 million.  That is not a subsidy to CIE; it is a subsidy to the people who are deemed by this House to merit a transport mobility subsidy of their own.  It has nothing to do with CIE.  It is deliberately misleading to suggest that the taxpayer is being extremely generous <Col N="1623" /> to CIE when this amount is added to the subvention.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister, despite his meanderings through the role of CIE and the detailed description of the freight service, was so limited in his description of the electrification-rapid rail proposal for the Dublin suburban area.  It took them more than two years to analyse the application from CIE and it was a coincidence that the announcement was made days before the local elections.</P>

If the local elections had not taken place on 7 June it is possible that this would not have happened because there was no provision for it in the capital budget of this year. Will any of the £10 million which will now be sought for CIE be for capital expenditure?</P>

      <P>There is no question of amalgamation now at issue in this case.  The position as to the Carne National School itself is, however, that the Commissioners of Public Works have recommended to my Department, as being in the best educational interests of the pupils, the provision of a new building on a new site, to replace the existing building which is not regarded as suitable for retention.</P>
      <P>A site for the new school offered by the school authorities has been accepted as suitable and the preparation of sketch plans has been completed.</P>
