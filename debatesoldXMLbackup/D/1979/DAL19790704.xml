      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always the intention that in time legislation would be introduced to put the organisation on a statutory basis. I am certain that the time is now opportune to make CBF a statutory body and, in addition, to broaden the scope of its <Col N="1626" /> activities while making new arrangements for its financing.  I have long felt that CBF has been unduly restricted and has been prevented from playing the kind of development role our livestock and meat industry now requires.  I propose to give CBF certain important objectives and to make arrangements for adequate funds to be available so as to ensure that these objectives are attained. Our meat industry must capitalise on the opportunities now existing for increased production, processing, employment and exports.  It is reasonable to expect that those who will benefit from the activities of the organisation should contribute towards its financing.  Therefore I have included provision for a modest levy on cattle and sheep slaughterings and exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals contained in this Bill have been framed following consideration of written submissions by the interests most affected&mdash;the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Society Ltd., the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd., the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association Ltd., the Irish Master Butchers' Federation and CBF Teoranta.  The submissions concerned were, in all cases, the subject of lengthy discussions between myself or officers of my Department and representatives of the organisations concerned. Naturally, not all of the organisations consulted saw eye to eye on all aspects of the proposals but there was general acceptance of the need for a stronger body, with wider powers and a realistic budget.  One cannot reasonably expect all the views of producers, meat factories, live exporters and domestic butchers&mdash;whose interests are so diverse&mdash;to be reflected in a single set of proposals.  I have, therefore, had to strike a balance which I feel will be broadly acceptable and will provide a framework within which all sectors of the industry, whatever their interests, can work together for their common benefit.  In framing the legislation I have also had to take account of the constraints which our membership of the European Community imposes, particularly in relation to levies and to <Col N="1627" /> trading by State bodies.</P>
    <P>I shall now refer to the more important provisions of the Bill to give Deputies some idea of the thinking behind them.  Firstly, as regards the functions of the new board, these would, in brief, permit the board to engage in a wide range of promotional, informational and investigative activities in relation to livestock and meat including promotion on the home market.  In addition it may carry out, either independently or jointly, some export trading in livestock and meat.  This latter provision is qualified by the words &ldquo;to such extent and to such markets as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;.  I want to make it clear that I do not see CBF going into competition with our existing exporters&mdash;quite the contrary, in fact.  I intend that CBF will not have an exclusive selling role in any export market and will, initially at least, confine its efforts to third country markets. Pioneering work by CBF will, I feel certain, ultimately open up valuable markets for commercial exporters.  There is, therefore, no question of CBF using its funds, whether derived from the Exchequer or the industry, to compete with our commercial exports to any market. The board is being empowered to set up a subsidiary body or bodies to carry out its trading role.</P>
    <P>As regards membership of the board, it is difficult to give fair and reasonable representation to all interested groups and, at the same time, to keep the size of the board such as to facilitate the effective transaction of business.  There will be ten board members&mdash;three representing farmers, two representing meat factories, one representing live exporters, one representing butchers, one officer of the Department of Agriculture, and two people nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, one of whom would be Chairman.  The basic term of office of members will be three years, but in the interests of continuity, I am providing for retirement by rotation, so that one-third of the board will retire each year.</P>
    <P>The Board is being given power to establish committees to advise it in relation <Col N="1628" /> to its statutory functions.  Any such committees that might be established would have an advisory role only.  They could include people who were not members of the Board.  This arrangement would enable the Board, though itself a small unit, to draw on the expertise and specialist knowledge available to it throughout the livestock and meat sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the keeping of accounts by the Board and for the auditing of those accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is a special provision here&mdash;included at the request of the Comptroller and Auditor General&mdash;excluding from his scope the accounts of any subsidiary bodies of the Board.  Such subsidiary bodies would be financed not from Exchequer sources but from the proceeds of the levy obtained by this legislation and would, therefore, not be an area of responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The Board is being given the usual power to borrow, with the concurrence of the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance, for current and for capital purposes, and to charge its assets as security for such borrowing.  Provision is also being made for Exchequer grants-in-aid to finance the work of the organisation.  The new organisation will, therefore, normally have three sources of funds&mdash;the Exchequer grant-in-aid, the levy, to which I shall refer later, and borrowing. This should substantially increase the funds available to the body in contrast to the funds that have been available to the existing organisation, amounting this year to £642,000, exclusively from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes the usual provisions in relation to staff of the board, including the chief officer, and to their remuneration, conditions of employment and superannuation.  The existing staff of CBF will become staff of the new organisation on terms not less favourable than they at present enjoy.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I have already said, provides for a levy to help in the financing of the board's activities.  The levy specified is 50p on cattle and 5p on sheep and will apply to all slaughterings and all live exports of those animals.  I <Col N="1629" /> would expect the levy, which will be payable directly to CBF, to yield about £900,000 a year.  Since slaughterings for the home market are equally liable to the levy I have ensured that CBF will have power to undertake promotional campaigns on that market also.  I have no doubt but that the levy will be more than matched by handsome rewards to the cattle and beef industry and to the producers, when the work of the new body bears fruit.  The Bill also provides for the transfer of assets and liabilities from the old to the new body.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of my party.  In contrast to our attitude to the two previous Bills which the Minister introduced and which imposed levies, we will do everything in our power to facilitate its speedy passage through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It is well recognised by all concerned in the cattle industry that the CBF have been performing a useful role and if they are given extended functions on a statutory base they will be able to do their job more effectively over a wider field.  Everybody here recognises the importance of the beef industry.  It is worth noting that not only does it provide employment for the majority of farmers who are involved in one way or another in beef production, either in the production of stores of fat cattle, but it provides employment in towns.  Approximately 5,300 people are employed in the beef production industry in Dublin, Naas, Leixlip and in the other meat plants throughout the country.  That was the 1975 figure and it represented a significant increase on the figure of less than 4,000 employed when we entered the EEC in 1973.  Anything that will promote the expansion of the beef industry will help in the drive for increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain problems in the industry must be overcome if we are to achieve an increase in employment and in production. There is a problem in relation to seasonal supplies.  In the autumn approximately 50 per cent more cattle are presented to the factories for slaughter than are presented on average <Col N="1630" /> throughout the other months.  To cope with that peak which only lasts for a month or two the factories have to carry, at considerable cost, the capacity to deal with that number of cattle throughout the whole 12 months.  That includes buildings, equipment and men. It is not a very economical system from their point of view and it is particularly difficult in the case of beef because beef is a more perishable commodity than milk for instance.  It is not easy to keep beef in a frozen condition in which it will retain its quality, whereas milk products can be processed into commodities like butter and cheese which will retain their full quality for a longer time than beef.  A seasonal supply of beef not only causes problems with capacity but it must also be sold very quickly.  The public do not consume more meat in October than at other times so obviously difficulties are created if we suddenly want them to consume more meat in October than they consume normally during the rest of the year.  This means that very often Irish meat has to be more or less unloaded on to the European market at perhaps less than its intrinsic value.  It is seasonal, we have it when everybody else has it, we have perhaps more than the market can sustain, and we have to get rid of it at that time.  That obviously weakens our marketing position.  It also makes the making of forward contracts for beef much more difficult to manage; it makes it difficult to get the best value and a good steady price with high added value in processed products.  We must be able to promise our distributor, perhaps a supermarket chain in Britain or on the Continent a steady supply throughout the year.  A meat factory caught up in that situation with indeterminate supplies for most of the year and then a sudden rush would not find it easy to maintain a forward contract because not many supermarkets will want 10,000 tons a month, then in October be prepared to take 20,000 or 30,000 tons and then go back to 10,000 tons a month in November or December.</P>
    <P>That sort of deal is not on and the result is that much of our Irish meat does not attract the best price on foreign markets.  This results from the seasonal <Col N="1631" /> production situation whereby 50 per cent more cattle are slaughtered in these two months in the autumn than are slaughtered on average throughout the year.  The only way of breaking out of this seasonal production system is to winter on Irish farms more of the cattle which are normally sold for beef in October and November when the grass is becoming scarce and the farmer has not made arrangements to provide silage or hay.  In these circumstances it is usually necessary to sell the cattle even at a loss because they could not be maintained during the winter.</P>
    <P>There are two ways of breaking away from this system.  First, we could encourage the production of much more silage.  It has been estimated by Mr. Brendan Kearney of the Agricultural Institute that if we were to maintain a steady flow of beef throughout the year we would need to produce an extra 5.4 million more tons of silage.  Therefore, the obvious and immediate step that could be taken would be to encourage farmers to make more silage and more hay and to fertilise their ground in time so that they might feed their cattle during the summer on a smaller acreage and set aside more ground for silage than would normally be the case.  I think all people, whether experts or otherwise in the beef and cattle industry generally, would agree with that suggestion.  We should encourage more winter feeding.  I am aware that the Department are endeavouring to promote this idea but in the west of Ireland there is a need to do much more to encourage farmers to become involved in making silage.  The problems in that regard are considerable because a farmer must either have his own foraging machinery or must hire the machinery.</P>
    <P>In a small-farm area like the west it would not be economic for farmers to buy their own silage-making machinery because they might need to use the machinery only one day in the year. Therefore, the obvious course for them to adopt is to engage contractors to do the work but this raises a problem also since there are not enough of these contractors. The reason for this is that it is <Col N="1632" /> not profitable for the contractors to engage in this work in the west because of the number of small farms there and where only small amounts of silage would be made.  There is a sort of chicken-and-egg situation in that the farmer does not make silage because the machinery is not available and the machinery is not available because there is not a ready-made demand for it.  We must break this vicious circle and the way to succeed in this regard is for the Government, through the EEC westernaid package which is in the process of negotiation, to make money available for the provision of contracting services for silage making.  I am aware that this proposal is among those being considered but I would make one point which I trust the Minister will consider carefully.</P>
    <P>I understand the proposal is that this sort of aid would be available only to co-operatives. I do not consider that to be sufficient.  Aid should be made available also to private contractors.  I have nothing against co-operatives.  They are very useful but we should use every means possible to make silage contracting machinery available in the west and private contractors should be part of that scene.  If there were a sufficient profit element involved, the incentive would exist for contractors to do this work and to promote their services.  It might not be right in regard to this proposal to discriminate in favour of co-operatives and against private contractors. Such discrimination would not serve any purpose.</P>
    <P>The other alternative to coping with this problem of seasonal production is to have a variable system of intervention.  It would be desirable that a higher price be paid for beef in the spring in order to encourage people to keep cattle during the more expensive winter period.  If we had a system whereby a higher price was paid by the intervention agencies in the spring, farmers would be encouraged to keep their cattle until then and, consequently, there would be a more steady production throughout the year.  I realise that this might require EEC approval but the Minister should endeavour to introduce a variable level of intervention system on the lines I have suggested.  If <Col N="1633" /> we had this system farmers would be assured that if intervention was necessary, the higher price cattle in the spring would take account of the higher cost involved in keeping cattle during the winter.  I am fairly confident that the EEC would accept a proposal on those lines because a policy would ensure that better use would be made of our existing processing facilities.  This is relevant particularly if the EEC are to provide us with more money for improving our processing facilities.</P>
    <P>We face considerable difficulties as an exporter of beef because we are the only country in the EEC which exports far more of the beef that we produce than is consumed at home.  Most of the other members have larger home markets than export markets.  Usually a country producing beef has an advantage on the home market.  Because our competitors have bigger home markets than we have they have an advantage over us and there tends to be the situation that it is only when home production is not as good as it might be in these other markets that there is room for Irish beef. This means that we are much more susceptible to depressions in the international beef market than would be the case in respect of these other countries who can protect their own large home markets.  Therefore, a marketing effort such as that now being undertaken by CBF will be very valuable because it will give us a grip on export markets.</P>
    <P>Another point is that our home market has not been expanding to the same extent as our export market has been expanding.  Our home market has not been expanding as fast as our export market because our consumption of beef is 5 per cent below our 1974 level, whereas the consumption of beef in the EEC has increased by 2 per cent since 1974.  Oddly enough, the situation is that the consumption of beef on the home market has been falling while the consumption of beef on the Continent has been rising, although we produce an excess of beef.  It may be that the consumption of beef on the home market has reached saturation point though I do not believe that that is the case.  I think there is room for improvement in the consumption of beef on the home market. <Col N="1634" /> Not only have we a small domestic market for beef but we have a declining beef market, which is a matter of serious concern.</P>
    <P>I notice that CBF will promote the consumption of beef on the domestic market.  Their attention will have to be drawn to the declining beef consumption on the domestic market.  The situation is that funds are being raised to encourage the consumption of more poultry on the home market and now more public funds will be used to encourage the consumption of more beef.  As the consumer can only eat three meals a day, he may be encouraged to consume less poultry. It seems that more and more public money could be spent in encouraging consumers to switch products.  We would need to ensure that that does not happen and that money is not wasted. Our concern is with the agricultural industry and the consumption of more home-produced products, but we do not want to see public funds wasted in cancelling the activities of other agencies who are financed from the same source. The involvement of CBF on the home market is to be welcome, subject to that reservation.</P>
    <P>CBF have been concentrating their activities on the Continent because it is a big market for beef.  The EEC is only 95 per cent self-sufficient in domestically produced beef.  However, when one takes account of the various imports of beef under GATT, under the Lomé Convention, and under agreements with former dependencies of the UK such as Australia and New Zealand, the deficit position of 95 per cent is transformed into a surplus of 102 per cent or 103 per cent.  The EEC has more beef than it needs when one takes account of the beef produced domestically and of the imports of beef.  I have expressed concern with some of the agreements with Third World countries.  I believe, however, that we should encourage the beef industry in underdeveloped countries.  I would argue that certain arrangements made with eastern European countries are only adding to the problems of beef producers within the EEC.  The biggest loser in this situation is Ireland because we have the largest <Col N="1635" /> surplus for export.  The Minister should look carefully at agreements with eastern bloc countries to see if they are justifiable.  In particular, the Minister should look at the arrangements for the import of animals from Yugoslavia to Italy.  I would not go as far as some in attacking New Zealand because we must recognise that New Zealand is a vulnerable democracy, cut away from the rest of the world by totalitarian states in Asia and eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is straying too far from the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there are political considerations in the case of New Zealand but I think the Minister should be vigilant in relation to all imports of beef from outside the EEC.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome in that it gives a statutory basis to CBF.  CBF have been operating for some time with public funds and have been in receipt of Government grants.  Grants should not be made available to companies that are not statutorily established.  Public money should not be spent on bodies of any sort unless there is a statutory guarantee that the money will be used properly. Although CBF have been operating as a private company for a number of years they were not obliged to present to this House an annual report of their activities, even though they have been financed from public funds.  As we provide the money, we should be given an account of their activities.  There are no requirements in relation to the checking of their accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is regrettable that CBF have been so long in existence without being given a statutory form.  I welcome the fact that they are now being given a statutory form and that there are certain assurances in regard to their accountability for public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also believe that bodies in the category of CBF are not subject to sufficient scrutiny.  I have advocated that a Committee of the House be set up to review the activities of all of these bodies which are not at present covered by any committee of inquiry in this House.  I <Col N="1636" /> have a motion on the Order Paper at the moment for this purpose and I have included CBF in it.  It is important that any body receiving public funds should not only have to present accounts but should be subject to detailed scrutiny by Members of this House.  I hope the Minister will in due course see his way to accepting that.</P>
    <P>I also draw attention to the fact that there is no requirement that CBF present their annual report to this House within any specified time.  The requirements for an annual report are dealt with in section 16 of the Bill and the report could be presented anything up to five, six or seven years late.  I am aware that there are certain bodies which are required by law to present annual reports to this House and I know of one body&mdash;not under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;which, although statutorily required to so do, has not presented any report to this House since 1974. There are bodies under the aegis of the Minister, particularly an Foras Talúntais, which have been up to 18 months late in presenting their annual report to this House.</P>
    <P>It is just not acceptable for bodies in receipt of public money to be so late in presenting their annual report.  No private company would get away with that.  If a private company was more than 60 days late in presenting its annual report to the Companies Office they would be liable to prosecution.  There would be a lot of State bodies whose board of directors would be liable to prosecution if they had to present their reports to the Companies Office.  But they have to present their reports not to the Companies Office but to this House. One would have thought that they would have had a higher obligation rather than a lesser one in this regard and yet they have been late in the presentation of their reports.  I would like to see built into this Bill a requirement that CBF must present their report within a specific time and I would say that four months should be the maximum time from the end of the year to which the report applies.</P>
    <P>I also believe that there are certain new borrowing powers which are being given to CBF under the legislation. <Col N="1637" /> These are contained in section 17.  It is important that borrowing should only be undertaken by a State-sponsored body such as CBF to finance activities which are themselves intrinsically self-financing, that is, profit making or break even types of activities.  It is not right for a State body to borrow to finance activities for which it expects to receive a grant from the State.  In effect that involves holding a gun to the head of the State, because if they go ahead and do something with borrowed money they can then come back to the State demanding the money to repay the bank for what they have done.  We would then have a situation where the revenue being raised by the Minister for Finance is being more or less earmarked in advance by a body outside this House.  There should be a clear provision built into this Bill that while CBF should be free to borrow they should only be free to borrow in respect of activities which are of themselves self-financing.</P>
    <P>There should be an entirely separate accounting procedure and a separate fund established for the financing of self-financing activities in respect of which borrowings could be undertaken and another fund established for State-financed activities in respect of which borrowings should not be capable of being undertaken.  That is an important distinction in public finance which should be made.  There is unfortunately a situation where more and more bodies are being given the power to borrow even though they are not self-financing bodies, and that is not desirable.  I can well see the point in allowing State-sponsored bodies which are self-financing to borrow but not bodies which are largely or wholly financed by the State.</P>
    <P>In section 20 there is a reference to the disclosure of interest in any contract which the board proposes to make by a member of the board who might be interested in that contract.  The protections there are insufficient.  I do not want to get into specifics here but there is a possibility that members of the board may be people who are engaged in the meat industry themselves.  For instance, the chairman of the board could be involved in the meat industry.  As members of the <Col N="1638" /> meat industry they naturally would have an interest in making sure that they made the largest profit for their own enterprise and they will naturally try to make use of any information they can get to find new markets.</P>
    <P>I believe that any information CBF have about new markets should be given out on an entirely even-handed basis to all members of the industry.  There should be no one who would have any greater access to this sort of information than any other member of the industry, whether he be a member of the board or not.  There must be statutory safeguards, and I intend to propose amendments on Committee Stage to prevent any member of the board, whether he be the chairman or otherwise, from getting information from the CBF which would be commercially useful to him in advance of any other person in the industry.  I know that it would be very difficult indeed to operate such a protection, because ideas and so on will come up in the course of discussions at board meetings where information of this sort can become available.  However, I am sure the Minister will understand that, if one person is in a position to get that sort of information while other members of the same industry who are in competition with that person feel that they are not getting that information, there would be problems in the maintenance of a trusting relationship between the industry as a whole and CBF.</P>
    <P>The Minister must, if he wants to have appointed to the board people directly involved in the trade, provide a means of ensuring that those people do not have any privileged access to information.  I agree with the Minister that people who have experience in the industry and are directly involved in it should be on the board and I do not want to be construed as saying that I am opposed to such people being on the board.  But, if they are, there must be some method of ensuring that they do not or cannot make use of their position on the board in a way not open to people who are not on the board.  I do not belive that the terms of section 20 are sufficient to ensure that because they only extend to a declaration of interest in an existing contract which may be the subject of activity of <Col N="1639" /> the board.  I am not so much concerned about existing contracts but I am concerned about the possibility of future contracts which might arise in the case of one person who has, by virtue of membership of the board, earlier access to information that other people in the same industry with whom he is competing and on whose products a levy is being raised to finance CBF.  If that were to happen it would not be fair and I would like to see safeguards built into this legislation to prevent it happening.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that this is happening because obviously nobody would know if it was but, as I said, the possibility exists when people on the board are involved in the trade.  The provisions of the Bill should be extended to ensure that this possibility does not or cannot arise.</P>
    <P>The board are being given a new function: to provide for the exportation, either as principal or agent, of beef.  Up to now they were allowed to engage only in the promotion of beef, not in the actual export of the product.  If they are to export they must be able to buy and sell, because presumably they will export on their own account.  Nowhere are the board actually given the power to buy or sell beef, although they have the power to export.  In case this matter might be challenged at a later stage, it should be written into the legislation that the board have power to buy and sell beef.</P>
    <P>The board have been given the new power to engage in trading in beef only &ldquo;to such extent and to such markets as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;.  That is far too vague and seems to be giving the Minister too much power.  He will allow them to engage in trading in one market but not in another. For instance, they might be allowed to trade in a market where one Irish producer was already engaged but not in another market where another Irish producer was engaged simply by the Minister saying &ldquo;You may export to country A because I am not too worried about the Irish producer there, but you may not export to country B because you might damage an existing Irish factory there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said, &ldquo;I <Col N="1640" /> want to make it clear that I do not see CBF going into competition with our existing exporters&mdash;quite the contrary in fact.&rdquo;  That is his word contained in his introductory speech, but that will not be the law of the land.  The law of the land will be that they may export &ldquo;to such extent and to such markets as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;, without any limitation as to whether they may compete with other Irish producers or whether the Minister may exercise this function in a discriminatory fashion.  The criteria whereby the Minister may or may not allow them to sell in competition with private Irish exporters in given markets should be written into the law. The Minister should not be given the discriminatory power to say, &ldquo;You may export to Fiji but you may not export to Samoa.&rdquo;  The conditions under which the Minister may exercise his discretion to allow CBF to export to a particular market should be written into this legislation.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that it is not his intention that they should be in competition with other Irish producers because as the law stands there is no statutory requirement that this would take place.</P>
    <P>I am also critical of the method of appointment of the board, which will be by rotation with one-third of the membership retiring each year.  It is not a good idea to have somebody retiring from a board each year because one would never get the spirit of collegiality that is needed on a board.  The board should be able to plan for the following five years in the hope that if they do a good job they will be reappointed.  I realise the rotation system is to get an infusion of new blood on the board every year, but that is a trendy idea and I do not think it will have that effect.  The Minister would be better off if he changed this Bill and appointed the board <i>en bloc</i> for five years.  I hope he will consider that view carefully.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would give some information about the beef classification scheme.  Last year we provided on a statutory basis for the establishment of this classification scheme.  At that time I was critical of that scheme because the classification scheme on which Irish beef would be sold abroad did not and could <Col N="1641" /> not coincide with the type of classification scheme whereby French beef was being sold.  We were trying to export on the continental market in competition with the French, but our beef was not being classified on the same basis.  If we had the same classification scheme, a person buying our beef could make a quick and easy comparison between the Irish beef and the same class of the French beef.  It seems unusual that there should be a series of different national classification schemes in use on the same European markets.  How has this scheme been working?  Has the Minister considered altering the means by which the different classifications are set?</P>
    <P>I understand from a report on beef carried out by the Confederation of Irish Industry that one of the things needed to encourage greater trade in beef is the implementation of an internationally enforceable code of trading practice in beef and export credit guarantees for beef. Have the Department studied this matter and the extent of the problems being faced by the industry in the absence of any code of practice in the beef trade on international markets?  Can he take any initiative internationally to have such a code established, because I presume there is a genuine need for it?</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need for greater employment in the beef industry in the processing of beef products.  We cannot make much progress unless we can ensure that our beef is processed to the furthest possible extent before it leaves our shores.  There have been considerable improvements in this situation, particularly in the term of office of Deputy Clinton as Minister.  In 1974 only about 24 per cent of our beef was denoted before it was sold in individual cuts and the rest was sold as whole carcases. There was an improvement in that situation throughout the period of the present Government.  We should set a clear target for our industry by a particular date in the proportion of beef which should be denoted for export.  The Government should commit themselves to achieving that half of our beef is exported in a deboned form by 1982.  The more beef deboned the more employment there is for boners in the factories and for various people in the processing <Col N="1642" /> of the meat.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have been facing in ensuring greater processing of beef in this country has been the absence of any MCA on canned meat.  An MCA has been made available on chilled beef but not on canned beef.  I understand that the Minister has been engaged in discussions on this matter.  I would have hoped that something would have been done in this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps the Minister would give us a report in his contribution of what has been done in this context.</P>
      <P>The last point I want to make &mdash;perhaps the most important point of all&mdash;is that there will be no beef industry and no employment in the factories unless it is profitable for farmers to engage in beef production.  At present it is very doubtful whether beef this summer is going to be profitable.  The reason for this can be found in a number of factors. I will mention one&mdash;the fact that the price increase for beef this year has been very small, only 1.5 per cent increase granted by the EEC.  At a time when costs of production are rising by 15 per cent we have had only a one-tenth increase in the prices paid for commodities sold in terms of the EEC guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a very significant increase in interest rates.  Of all commodities produced on the farm beef is one which requires very heavy investment and very heavy indebtedness on the part of the farmer.  For a given level of output a farmer has to tie up much more money in much more stock to get a relatively small profit than he would have to in dairying, for instance, where a smaller number of cows worth less money in terms of their own value can produce in value terms a far larger amount of end produce in the form of milk than a much larger number of animals at a far higher price can produce in terms of net profit when the beef comes to be sold.  Therefore, a much higher level of indebtedness is required to engage in beef production than is required in milk production.  Much more <Col N="1643" /> again is required in milk production than in grain production where all you have to buy and carry from the beginning of one season to another is the price of fertiliser and seeds.  It is not necessary to go very much into debt in order to engage in profitable grain production.  Beef is hit much harder than any other form of agricultural production by an increase in interest rates, and the Minister knows that there has been a very significant in crease in bank interest rates in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look very carefully at the figures for the likely profitability of beef this year.  If confidence is destroyed and if profitability is not maintained at the end of this year people will not invest in more cattle afterwards.  If farmers get a bad burning in the autumn this year, if they lose money on the beef, they will switch for next season to grain or to something else and we will not have even the amount of beef being supplied at the moment, insufficient as it is, supplied to our factories. Definite action is needed by the Minister to restore confidence in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>A lot of people here had hoped that from recent price negotiations in Brussels the Minister would come back with some system of calf heifer scheme which would have led to the increased production of calves for beef.  He has failed and that has not come about.  In his reply the Minister should give an account of why he failed to get this calf heifer scheme. That possibility for restoring confidence in the beef industry has been removed.</P>
    <P>I say in all seriousness, with some personal knowledge and with more knowledge derived from others close to me who know more about the industry than I do, that there is a serious confidence problem in the beef industry at the moment and the Minister must do something about it or else this Bill and the CBF which we are talking about will be just another expensive superstructure in an industry which will not be existing in the meaningful sense.  We will not be able to achieve all the very optimistic targets for CBF if the beef itself is not produced.  One thing the Minister can <Col N="1644" /> and should do&mdash;and I ask him very seriously to consider this&mdash;to restore confidence in the beef industry is to have beef exempted from the 2 per cent levy. That could be achieved quite easily without any serious loss of revenue if in the case of beef the Minister would revert to not retaining the VAT refund. Quite a small financial cost would be incurred but a very important symbolic gain would be achieved which would have significant effects in restoring the battered confidence of people in the beef industry.  I am making this submission to the Minister because I believe this is financially and politically feasible.  The loss in revenue of such a measure would not be significant if the VAT refund were not to be retained in the case of beef, but the effect on improved confidence in the beef industry of removing the 2 per cent from beef would be very significant indeed. As Deputy Clinton pointed out here in a previous debate, at the moment that 2 per cent is absorbing not 2 per cent but up to 25 per cent of the net profit of people in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that because of prices not rising while costs and interest rates rise, profit has been squeezed to almost miniscule proportions and the 2 per cent levy on top of that can represent up to 50 per cent of net profit.  We may well have a situation at the end of this year where people will be selling beef at a loss.  If this happens it will be very difficult to get them back into beef production the following year. They may have made silage and in that case they will have to stay in beef and use up the silage for that winter, but they will make arrangements if they can get into grain the following year.  People are already switching from beef to grain and the value of grain to our economy is not as good as the value of beef in terms of potential added value in the meat factories. The effects on our entire economy could be quite severe.</P>
    <P>I have put forward the most feasible action which the Minister can take to restore confidence in the beef industry and I would ask him to put the case as strongly as possible to the Minister for Finance.  I am not making this point out of any wish to embarrass him or his colleagues politically.  I believe something <Col N="1645" /> like this is necessary to restore confidence in the immediate future.  Glorious ideas of what we might do in five or ten years' time are of little value if confidence cannot be immediately restored. The Minister knows this is the case.  We are facing a serious situation requiring exceptional remedies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, though I believe certain aspects need to be reformed, particularly in relation to potential conflicts of interest which can exist in the case of members of the board and also in relation to other matters which I have mentioned. The Bill lays the foundation for development of the beef industry in the years ahead but much more important is that action should be taken by the Minister now to restore confidence and to ensure that beef will be produced which can be sold by CBF in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. CBF were financed chiefly by public money and there were no statutory powers governing them.  This Bill goes a long way towards meeting that requirement. There are, however, a few points on which I take issue.</P>
      <P>Section 4 states that the function of the board shall be to develop, promote, facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and assist the export of livestock and meat. While I know that livestock will be exported on the hoof for a long time to come, I feel the emphasis should be on the export of meat.  There has been some falling off in employment in meat factories in recent times and I understand the Minister is doing what he can to keep one big meat producer in business.  It appears that priority may be given to the export of livestock but in my opinion the board should promote our beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Europe and elsewhere Irish beef commands a very poor rate in comparison with beef from other countries and I do not understand the reason for this.  I find Irish beef a lot more palatable than foreign meat.  Perhaps we are not producing the kind of meat demanded in continental markets and we should examine this matter.  Fianna Fáil made the far-reaching statement in their manifesto that we would process all our food.  I know it is not possible to do this overnight but I believe proper efforts are not <Col N="1646" /> being made to produce the kind of article our customer needs.  This board should encourage that kind of activity.  If we cannot produce the kind of beef required, we should develop alternative markets for our produce.  I have travelled in many countries and Irish beef is the best I have tasted.  However, it is not highly thought of and commands a lower price than beef produced in other European countries.  That is something with which we should be coming to grips, something with which we must come to grips, if we mean to expand our beef industry in the way we should.</P>
    <P>If the emphasis here is to export livestock in the same way as meat, we are on the wrong track.  If this meat has to be processed in some other country&mdash;we sell it as livestock when, naturally it has to be sold there&mdash;and we should be in there selling that meat and processing it here.  It may not be possible to do that completely but certainly we should be gaining ground continously on that differential.  Our eventual target should be that set out in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, that we process all our food because the additional value and employment in that field is of vital importance to our economy at present.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister specified how the membership of the Board would be compiled.  He said:</P>
    <P>As regards membership of the Board, it is difficult to give fair and reasonable representation to all interested groups....</P>
    <P>I accept that; it is difficult, because there will be many groups interested in being represented on this board.  I note there will be three representing farmers, two representing meat factories, one representing live exporters, one representing butchers, one officer of the Department of Agriculture and two people nominated by the Minister, one of whom would be chairman.  There should be trade union members on this board, representing workers in the meat factories and the meat industry generally. Perhaps that is what the Minister has in mind when he says there will be two representing meat factories but I would imagine what he means is two representatives from the management side of the <Col N="1647" /> meat factories.  On a board of this nature there should be representatives of the people employed in the meat industry.  I suppose they would amount to 4,000 or 5,000 anyway.  There are 1,000 directly employed in the meat processing industry in my constituency.  Those people should be represented on that board in some way, whether it be directly or through the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that all our meat should be processed but that is something that cannot happen overnight. The emphasis should be on developing, promoting, facilitating, encouraging, co-ordinating and assisting in the export of processed meat, and of livestock if that must continue, and it must for some time.  It was clearly stated in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that we would process all our food.  Yet nothing is being done to further that aim, and I am not foolish enough to imagine that that is something that can be done overnight. However, some progress should be made in that direction and this board used to explore the possibilities of achieving that goal.</P>
    <P>It appears that our meat, when exported and processed abroad is more saleable.  We export the livestock and it is processed wherever it has been exported. It seems to command a better market and, in a lot of cases, a better price than that processed at home.  I do not know whether that means we export our best cattle.  For example, does it mean that we are exporting the type of livestock that foreign processors want? However, we must ask ourselves if we were processing such meat at home would we be capable of competing with the highest prices obtaining on the European market.  From such inquiries as I made abroad it would seem that we are not doing that.</P>
    <P>This board should be engaged principally in the promotion of our meat industry. It would appear that we shall have to continue to export live cattle for some time.  However, I have not seen any evidence of the statement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto&mdash;that we will process all of our food&mdash;being implemented. Serious consideration should <Col N="1648" /> be given to the role of this board in promoting beef more than the export of livestock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his excellent contribution Deputy Bruton referred to people producing cattle in the west.  I welcome the Bill, its teeth, and the fact that it is setting up a statutory body.  I shall have some brief comment to make on the constitution of the board.</P>
      <P>Probably everybody is aware of the problems obtaining here in regard to beef production, to which Deputy Bruton made reference also.  The Chair may think I am being somewhat irrelevant but Deputy Bruton spoke for over an hour.  Everything he said was relevant but could also be said to be irrelevant, if one wanted to make that contention.</P>
      <P>This country is unique in that cattle are produced in one part&mdash;in my part &mdash;and finished in another, the eastern part.  This board is set up to sell beef and live cattle.  That pattern is changing but very slowly.  However, as Deputy Bruton has said, there is need for a lot more silage, sufficient to arrest the glut of cattle at the end of the year which pushes the load on to the factories, both in regard to storage and disposal, at that time.  On smaller farms in the west it is important to take cattle off grass altogether during the winter.  Big improvements have been made in that direction.  Most farmers are now taking two cuttings of silage off their small farms.  But there is a lot more to the making of silage and the equipment needed for that purpose.  For example, there is the building of the yards, which is important.  It has been a complete failure where it has just been made in a heap in a field.  To my way of thinking that method is out.  It was tried all over the country.  It has been discovered that it makes muck out of the whole area and silage cannot be kept if one has not the means for so doing.  Therefore taking a decision to have silage for the production of beef which, if one is to sell, this board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no point in having a board if there is no beef to sell. That is the point I am making.  That was the reason for my reference to silage, the production of silage in the west, changing a system obtaining for years under which we produced young cattle and were unable to finish them because we had not the relevant means.  We are now endeavouring to winter-feed cattle which is important, as Deputy Bruton said, so that there are not what we call grass-fed cattle coming off imposing on the factories a load which would not be there if we could balance it over the year as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to silage, unless one has the yard from which to feed the silage this cannot be done.  These yards cost a huge amount of money and we in the west are not getting the grants which are given to development farmers to erect this type of buildings.  The estimates which the departmental inspectors submit for these buildings are completely unrealistic, and if one is entitled to a 30 per cent grant, by the time the building is erected one is lucky to get about 20 per cent of the actual cost.  It is only since we entered the EEC that the farmers in the west have been able to make any move towards developing this type of feeding so that they can take their livestock off the land in the winter.  Something should be done about the grants and the unrealistic estimates.  This relates to the whole production of beef and to the switch from live exports to meat exports. Until we have this type of set-up in the west we will have to produce and sell small cattle at a loss to be finished in the <Col N="1650" /> east.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that an EEC incentive to beef production did not come this year.  Costs are very high and beef production is not very profitable.  People are inclined to produce milk, a commodity which is over-produced at the moment.  It is vital that every effort be made to encourage people to balance meat production over the whole year. This can only be done by increasing the making of silage and by increasing the grants to have yards built from which silage can be fed.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill refers to the power of the board to export.  Will the Minister clarify what is meant by that? If the board get an opportunity to export beef to a country to which no Irish exporter exports, can the board buy beef for export?  It is not stated in the Bill whether the board have power to buy as well as power to export.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the board power to buy and export as well?  I would like to be clear on that.</P>
      <P>I disagree slightly with the constitution of the board.  The board are to be a board of ten, but only three members of the board will be directly elected by farmers.  The board will comprise two representatives of the Minister, who could be either trade unionists, which I do not object to, or farmers.  There will be three representatives of the producers of bovine animal and sheep, two persons representing the meat export trade, one person representing meat traders and one person who shall represent the live bovine animal and sheep export trade. Only three persons are directly elected from farmers.  Any board dealing with farm produce should have a majority of producers on the board.  I was a member of a State board for a number of years and I know that it is inevitable to have clashes between the ordinary members and the producers.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at the constitution of the board with a view to increasing farmer representation on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to retirement, it is only right that each member should retire at <Col N="1651" /> the end of the year and give an account of his stewardship, but they should be eligible for re-election.  It would be a crime if a man who had proved himself on the board had to quit just because of a rule.  The board are very important and I hope they do a good job.  It is important that the Government finance a statutory body like this board.  I welcome the Bill.  It is important that the Government inspect the finances of these boards periodically to monitor their activities.  If we vote money to a board we should be in a position to see what they are doing with it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the outgoing CBF on what they have done in relation to the export of cattle.  Deputy Bruton said that the consumption of beef here had gone down but that it is rising in other European countries.  Therefore it is important that we have a board which will look at all the markets so as to keep this trade viable here.</P>
    <P>It would take very little more to pull the people out of beef production, particularly people now gearing themselves towards the production of beef by changing a system which existed for years, a system which does not exist in any other EEC country, that is, the unique situation where we produce cattle at one end of the country and finish it at the other end.  We are doing our best to change it but for financial reasons it will take a long time to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome this Bill, but with certain reservations. This is an opportune time to give the CBF statutory functions especially now that we have entered a new era with our membership of the EEC. When CBF Teoranta were founded in 1969 our entry to the EEC was imminent. The whole scene has changed radically since then.  I compliment CBF Teoranta on their work in beef promotion in the knowledge that they were limited financially and had only certain powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I have some reservations about the Bill, I commend the Minister for introducing it.  My reservations relate to the introduction of this further levy. <Col N="1652" /> An essential element for the success of the Bill or for the success of any Bill relating to agriculture is the confidence of the farming community, but unfortunately the confidence of the farmers is being eroded.  This Bill cannot be treated in isolation.  We must consider it in the context of the other legislation pertaining to agriculture that is going through the House this week.  Each of the three agriculture Bills being dealt with this week imposes a levy on the farming community.  Farmers have approached me, as I am sure they have approached the Minister too, to express their anxiety regarding the attitude the Government are adopting towards the farming community. Farmers have got the impression that there must be a special levy section in the Department who have thought up all these various levies and who recently decided on the removal of subsidies on cheese, lime and foodstuffs. The farmers are of the opinion that the Government are being selective in singling them out for this treatment and that there is a certain amount of farmer bashing in these closing days of this session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when replying, to let us know what is the intention of the Government and what is his intention in relation to agricultural affairs. The farmers fear that the Government have lost all sympathy with them and are trying to erode what little profit is left to the farmers either in milk or in beef production.  The situation has become so farcical that one could suggest two further levies in the nature of Bills such as a Size of Shoes (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979, or a Size of Chest (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions of the board as outlined in section 4 are to develop, promote, facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and assist the export of livestock and meat.  I would suggest that the first action of the board on meeting would be to insist that the levies being imposed by the Minister be removed.  In their reports the Livestock Exporters Association express concern that, for instance, the livestock cattle trade with the UK is at a standstill and the exporters fear that the cattle levy will ruin the trade.  They are concerned, too, that the introduction of this further levy of 50p per live animal to fund the activities of the board will be another disincentive to farmers and will do irreparable damage to the beef export trade.  The Minister must have regard to the views of the farming organisations because these are the people who are concerned and we must have their confidence if the legislation is to be effective.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of merit in the Bill.  I consider it essential that it be passed because, in terms of the great potential there is for us on the European scene, we must bring to bear all our resources, our expertise and our experience in order to derive the most from the EEC not alone for the farming community but for all our people whether they be rural or urban dwellers.  It is imperative that there be not a shred of suspicion in the minds of the producers regarding the intentions of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, consider membership of the board to be too limited.  For a board like <Col N="1654" /> this we should be able to avail of the best expertise and knowledge of individuals and groups.  Consequently, I would suggest that the proposed number be increased to 20 or even to 24 so that the board might be representative of advertising agencies and of trade unions as well as incorporating people who have had experience on the Continent, who have been involved on the Continent in the promotion of tourism and in other promotional affairs on our behalf.</P>
    <P>In addition I consider the term of office of members of the board to be too short.  Instead of appointing members for one year we should appoint them, initially at any rate, for a period of three years because it would take almost a year for a member to become <i>au fait</i> with the intentions and the responsibilities concerned. Appointment for a minimum of three years at the outset would give both individual members and the board as a whole a chance to get off the ground.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 7 is rather ambiguous and I should hope that the Minister, when replying, would clarify the situation in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the Minister may remove a member from the board at any time.  In fairness both to a member who might be so removed and to the Minister there should be laid down specific reasons for such action.  It is totally unfair to leave the situation as it is.</P>
    <P>The second function of the board will be to develop, promote, facilitate, encourage and co-ordinate increased consumption of beef on the home market. As the Minister will know, the price of meat, aided and abetted by the introduction of these further levies, has become dearer and this has resulted in a decline in consumption.  It appears that this trend will continue.  To encourage the consumption of more meat, I suggest that the Minister should remove the levies because they will ultimately be paid by the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not take too kindly to my remarks on the previous Bill. Perhaps he is over-sensitive to criticism but he must be told the truth.  We are not alone in our criticism of the Minister and of the Government.  At the moment there is a crisis in the farming community. <Col N="1655" /> They are concerned with the attitude of the Government towards agriculture.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to bring to the attention of the Minister the difficulties facing beef producers.  They feel that a 1.5 per cent increase will not meet their rising costs.  This year inflation is expected to be 12 to 15 per cent.  Feedstuffs have increased by £4 per ton. Diesel and labour costs have increased. The result of all these increased costs is that their profits have dwindled.  Like other business people, farmers are in beef production to make profits.  If the Minister wants the Bill to be a success he must get the support of the farming organisations.  I have been approached by various farming organisations on this matter.  The Minister should re-assure the farmers that there is no anti-farming lobby in the Government.  If they are given encouragement the beef producers will help to make the Bill a success.</P>
      <P>The membership of the Board should be increased to include people with expertise in marketing to help capture the British and continental markets.  I wish the new board success and compliment the outgoing board.  I am glad that the Minister has ensured that the staff of CBF will continue in employment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. The extension of the semi-State sector is the correct mix between public and private activity.  The Bill deals with what is probably our most important industry. The beef industry is our major natural resource because of its potential for foreign earnings and the creation of employment.  The beef industry has been very fragmented in the past six or seven years.  The only explanation for the current downturn in the beef industry is the mishandling of the industry during the period in which the previous Government were in office.</P>

      <P>During that period the farmer breeding small stock could do nothing but turn them out.  We are now paying heavily for that situation.  The Minister's recent announcement of a policy to increase herd numbers was very desirable.  On two occasions since assuming office the Government have dealt with the beef industry and the urgent need for a co-ordinated marketing programme.  This Bill will give statutory and financial support to that ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revamped organisation will have to deal with the companies involved in the beef industry.  There is a big difference in the companies involved in the processing of beef.  There are privately-owned companies and multinationals. One cannot help feeling that they have spoken with forked tongues for a number of years.  They have not produced co-ordinated plans for the betterment of the industry.  It should be put on record that the Government have acted positively by abolishing company tax on co-operatives, who are the largest operators in the beef processing industry. By abolishing company tax on co-operatives the Government gave a real injection of finance to farming and the members of those co-operatives who control beef processing plants should take that into account when they are adding up the sums they are contributing.  I feel that this was a right decision and a correct move that has put badly needed confidence into the co-operative movement in the beef processing sector.  They are still far from being on solid ground; the financial structure of the second largest co-operative is still very much in doubt and recently they have had reason to dispose of a processing plant.  At this stage it would be fair to say that the previous Minister for Agriculture, recognising that, made funds available to assist that co-operative at the time. <Col N="1657" /> However, the overall situation regarding the funding of the beef processing industry is fragmented.  I hope this Bill will not be seen as a way of leaving everything to CBF, of letting CBF do the marketing and the selling for the factories so that they can stay back at base and maximise the throughput of the plant without having any co-ordinated marketing policy themselves.</P>
    <P>In relation to the marketing and the role that the Minister has outlined for CBF, this brings forward a major area. which should be addressed.  That is the Government's investment activities in the beef processing industry.  I believe it is incorrect that it should be in the hands of another semi-State organisation under another Minister.  I would suggest that the funding of the Government's activities in the beef processing industry should rest with the Minister for Agriculture.  The IDA, with their other commitments, cannot give it the attention it deserves and in the shorter term the industry cannot deliver instant jobs. As a result investment in the meat processing industry should be looked at in a separate way.</P>
    <P>To try to improve the performance of the export side of the industry the IDA retained a well-known firm of accountants and consultants who produced a report on the beef processing industry. That was to show the guidelines for Government investment, the potential for marketing and the added value products that could be derived from the industry.  That report has never been fully implemented.  There were very positive recommendations in it and very general statements also about what could and should be achieved.  There has been an updating of that report because it was completed at a time when there were anomalies in numbers and when the industry was going through that period which I referred to earlier.  I feel that fragmentation in this way will not see the beef industry progressing on a planned co-ordinated policy.</P>
    <P>We now have a semi-State organisation getting Government funds, which is very desirable; it will certainly improve on the tremendous performance with very limited resources up to now.  But I feel that those people in CBF who will <Col N="1658" /> want the co-operation of the beef processors should also have a much greater say in what beef processor gets Government aid for investment in his plant, and aid should be directed towards the companies who are prepared to assist in the marketing drive and who are prepared to give a full commitment to maximising the products which require a certain amount of extra investment and additional staff and who have a commitment to the long-term benefit of this industry. It is important that we look a little wider and bring together the Government agencies who have a hand in the meat processing industry and are responsible for agricultural and veterinary responsibilities and now the marketing but not for the investment. There is an area there that the Minister might take into account.</P>
    <P>We have something over £400 million of a turnover in this industry.  It is crucial and it needs the full attention of the Minister for Agriculture in addressing the problems that presently exist.  It is ridiculous that we have had so much Government investment in an industry and now we have no cattle to put through these plants.  We have certainly made the money available over a number of years and it is ridiculous in a country like ours that we should now end up with no cattle to put through plants.  There are inefficiencies, a loss of employment and an uncertainty in this industry at the moment which are very damaging and very bad for the overall economy.  The IDA have recently revised their targets as a result of that report which I referred to earlier and they are projecting, over the next ten years, 1,200 jobs in more intensive processing.  CBF have been consulted on those figures and agree with them and will be a party to the implementation of same.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by welcoming the Bill and welcoming the extra responsibilities given to a semi-State organisation who fully deserve the confidence placed in them based on their track record in very trying times.  I hope that they get the full support of the processing industry and I would urge the industry itself to come forward and be much more co-ordinated and to plan for the long term.  We have a <Col N="1659" /> situation where the co-operative movement in particular must speak with forked tongues; they are representing the farmers on the one hand and on the other hand they are trying to maximise the performance of the co-operative organisations in the processing industry. The farmers are the ones that export live cattle and they also invest in meat processing; there is a difference of marketing policy there; they are the same men who make up the shareholders in the beef processing plants.  I would urge that they should have a greater commitment to their own co-operatives and support them in trying times.  I know the commercial pressure on the individual farmer is going to be to maximise his intake based on wherever the best prices prevail.</P>
    <P>The meat factories came in for considerable criticism during that period when they did very well financially. They did very well financially because the so-called live exporters were not available to take up the product in the market place.  They left maximum numbers to the factories which had to contend with a tremendous overflow of cattle at the time.  Admittedly they made profits but in the main they reinvested them in the industry.  But it was the live cattle exporters who were the root cause of the problem and this has not been mentioned forcibly enough.  I would like to put it on the record of the House that when there was adequate cattle and a bad market, the live exporters were not available.  For anyone to say that we need the relief of live export is to avoid facing the real situation.  Let us get to the situation where our meat plants can have adequate numbers and let us have live exports as well, but let us not have a situation where exports prevail and meat factories are in a run-down situation and are not maximising their throughput.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It is a move in the right direction.  But there is a lot more ground to be made up and a lot more power to be given to CBF in Government investment as well as marketing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see my colleague <Col N="1660" /> in west County Dublin taking an interest in this Bill because both he and I are aware of the difficulties which exist. However, I would suggest that there are gaps here and there in his knowledge which he would be well advised to take a look at.  There also appears to be quite a conflict between what he has to say and what the present Minister for Agriculture has to say about the need for a live export trade as well as a processing trade.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is not quite right in the reason he gave as to why bad prices were paid by the processors during a period of over supply.  The position was that we had half the present capacity at that time.  There was restricted capacity in the processing business and therefore there was no competition between processors.  The boot is on the other foot now.  There is double the capacity that existed then and there is a good deal of competition and greater possibility, even between processors, that there would be competition.</P>
      <P>When Minister for Agriculture I made a considerable effort to bring about the type of development proposed and envisaged in this Bill.  I had numerous meetings with the parties concerned and failed to get agreement between them on the sort of development that should take place.  We have a Bill here today and the Minister has failed to get agreement.  He rightly paid a compliment to the contribution made by the CBF as they now stand.  I, too, agree and would like to compliment CBF because they made a very substantial contribution to the development of our beef and livestock trade, to exports generally and to promotion work throughout the world. Without CBF there would be a serious deficiency.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives CBF a marketing arm. I am apprehensive about the fact that there is not agreement between the parties concerned and from whom these levies will be collected.  Nobody likes the sound of &ldquo;levy&rdquo;.  As Minister I sought a contribution from all the parties mentioned here and, while some were agreeable, others were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear we have a Bill before us that is premature and difficulties are likely to arise because of this failure to get agreement. <Col N="1661" /> We saw what happened in the European Court about the Pigs and Bacon Commission levy.  I know it is the intention of the live trade, who are opposing this Bill, to bring their case to the European Court.  The Minister would be very wise if he decided at this stage to postpone this Bill.  It can remain in the House, but there is not any great urgency about it at this stage.  It is very important that agreement should be got from all sides on the way this should be developed.  That agreement has not been secured.  It is likely that it will give rise to a very serious problem and will be challenged in the European Court.  The Minister should look very seriously at this and consider whether it is wise to proceed at this point.  I see the desirability of this type of development, but if one pushes too hard one can fail completely.  If this is brought to the European Court and the case succeeds, our chances of developing this type of organisation with a selling arm is gone for all time.  If it is not a compulsory levy, if the contribution is agreed by the various parties, no such difficulty arises. I hope the Minister takes a serious look at this.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Minister seeks to retain too much power to himself.  If a Minister sets up a board to do a particular job and that board are fully representative of all the interests concerned, he has a responsibility to show his confidence in the board by giving them the maximum freedom to operate and do the job they were set up to do.  If the board are fully representative I do not see any situation in which they will go completely off the rails and cause greater trouble.  There is no point in setting up a board who have to go cap in hand to the Minister every week and say &ldquo;Please can we do this, that or the other?&rdquo; No business can be done in those circumstances.  Semi-State bodies are established so that they will have freedom to operate like a commercial firm, not under the guidance, supervision and direction of a Minister who has too much to do to continuously observe every move that will be made and evaluate it.  This is one aspect of the Bill to which I strongly object.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a first-class board <Col N="1662" /> to go into the type of business described in this Bill but it must be a board in which all the people&mdash;producers, processors, live exporters and workers&mdash;must be interested and about which they are concerned.  There is very serious concern at present about the fact that a large political element has been introduced into the existing CBF in the last two years.  As Minister I either appointed or reappointed all the members of that board, even those I knew to be strong supporters of Fianna Fáil.  I never had any reason to regret doing that.  I appointed or reappointed them because I knew they had a worth-while contribution to make and I am satisfied they made a worth-while contribution.  Not all of them are there now but I made the right decision.</P>
    <P>What is happening now?  Every appointment is a political appointment.  It is worse still when somebody appointed has a serious conflict of interests.  This is not just my view; it is widely held.  Staff appointments and promotions are being handled on a party political basis.  This is appalling.  If it continues in CBF there will be serious staff trouble because there is discontent there already.  I am sorry to have to say this.  I want to see a first-class board because there is a great need for a first-class board.  When this is tolerated and promoted by the person responsible, it is something that should be deplored and mentioned in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully in support of the development of the CBF with a proper board in whom the people could have full confidence for the development of the processing and exporting of meat in all its forms.  I gave this board the fullest support in my time and I sought to gain more support from the various interests. <Col N="1664" /> I did not succeed.  I am greatly afraid that because this agreement has not yet been secured there may be disagreement and perhaps another European Court challenge.  On that account I suggest strongly that the Minister postpone further discussion on this Bill and seek to have further discussions with the parties who are objecting to it, getting their agreement if possible, before proceeding with the Bill.  It is an important development, and one which the country needs.</P>
    <P>The centralised marketing agencies that we have at the moment have been successful.  I have never been fully happy with the marketing developments in the meat industry itself.  It is not the intention in this to set up a fully centralised marketing agency.  That would be impossible at present, but if we can set up a CBF, so to speak, who will put up an impressive performance where such is not the case at present, they will prove themselves in time.  It is possible that in the distant future we could have a marketing agency as successful as Bord Bainne.  I know that we are dealing with a product very different from those of Bord Bainne, which are standard products.  It is much more likely that you will have a centralised marketing agency for a standard type of product than for one that varies so much in quality and variety.  It is not going to be easy to get centralised marketing there, but many gaps are not being filled.  A CBF with further powers and the type of powers envisaged in this Bill could fill these gaps.  In the past they have put up a very creditable performance&mdash;I agree with the Minister on this&mdash;on a very limited budget, and all of us in the country should appreciate that.  We should give them all the support and all the room for development that it is possible to give them within existing circumstances. There is further work to be done, otherwise this legislation is going to run into trouble.  If it does and if another court case in Europe succeeds, then the prospect of any development in this direction will be finished for all time.  The Minister is proceeding with too much haste at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin at the end because <Col N="1665" /> I happened to hear on the monitor some part of Deputy Clinton's appalling contribution.  He was making accusations against me and against other unnamed people whom in his cowardly way he refused to name.  He was making unsubstantiated and unsubstantiatable accusations of political corruption and matters of that kind.  Deputy Clinton and the party that he represents are the epitome of political corruption.  I recall to Deputy Clinton's mind the unprecedented outburst of political corruption that took place in the dying days of the last National Coalition and the loading up of the Land Commission, the High Court bench, and all Government boards with political nominees of one kind or another including defeated Deputies of this House.  Let him not come in here and make these unsubstantiatable, wild charges against me or any other unnamed people, because they mean nothing.  If they do mean anything he should have the gumption and the guts to say what they mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how the introduction of this Bill should be the occasion for such an extraordinary outburst from Deputy Clinton.  He cites his own nomination of the old board of the CBF, but there are other cases that he might well cite, including An Foras Talúntais and the now defunct NAA, some of whose members nominated by Deputy Clinton were nominated also to numerous other boards for some completely untraceable reason.  I did not imagine that a person who had until comparatively recently been the occupant of the Department of Agriculture as Minister would descend to such extraordinary outbursts of vituperation as we have seen from Deputy Clinton today.  I cannot understand it.  I suggest to him that if he has any accusation of the smallest kind to make against me or anybody else he should make it in the open.  If he had not the courage to make it here with the protection of the House it is doubly unlikely that he would make it outside.  It is in sharp contrast to the contribution made by his colleague, the Fine Gael spokesman on Agriculture, who welcomed the Bill and made many <Col N="1666" /> general observations about the undoubted problems of the meat industry at present, including the problem of supply.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with this on other occasions in the recent past but the problem remains.  The matter was touched on by other Deputies, as was the necessity for the flattening out of the annual hump in the supply position in factories.  This is easily recognisable and must be considered in the context of the traditional means of producing beef. This traditional custom must be radically altered in the very near future if we are to break out of the impasse of the three-year cycle for cattle production and the problem of the traditional movement of store cattle from the west over to grazing country for a leisurely process of conversion into beef over three years or more.  In modern competitive conditions that will not do any more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham asked if the product we are selling is the product which consumers in Britain and Europe really want.  This product is undeniably good, and we can do a great deal to make it better and more to the liking of consumers in export markets.  It has been the custom for many years for British family butchers to market good quality beef, wherever it comes from, under the general name of Scottish beef or Devon beef.  There is a need for the Irish meat industry to establish its own identity, and I hope that will be the business of the new board.</P>
    <P>The problems of winter feeding and the making of more silage are simply contributory factors to the general question of our need to improve cattle husbandry.  At our present stage of development there is a great deal of progress to be made in this regard, but the conditions for making that progress have, on the whole, never been better.  It is true that the difficulties of the beef producer as distinct from the keeper of store cattle are particularly bad in a short supply position such as obtains at present and the profitability of an operation is obviously correspondingly low. The reason is that the beef producer who traditionally bought stores has had to pay prices that were so high that they <Col N="1667" /> precluded any reasonable degree of profit in the expensive business of fattening of the beef stage.  It is true that within the cattle industry the problems of beef production and beef finishing are acute. It must be the business of the Government, the Department of Agriculture and the industry generally to apply themselves to corrective measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I had in mind the introduction of an improved calf rearing scheme and had the expressed goodwill of Commissioner Gundelach towards the recommending of this to the Council of Ministers.  In the event of the decision of the Council of Ministers at their price-fixing meeting to raise the price of the coresponsibility levy, which circumstances we welcomed, the Commissioner said he was not in funds to provide any assistance for the scheme the Irish Government had put up, of which he approved and was willing to recommend to the Council.  He went on to say that the scheme was by no means abandoned, and that when the funds become available he will recommend it to the Council for reconsideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the current difficulty in the beef production area of cattle rearing.  Deputy Bruton entered the <i>caveat</i> about the spending of public money and pushing beef in the home market.  The provisions of the Bill make this technically possible, but I do not believe this will be seen as the main or even an important purpose of the Bill. Obviously the main purpose is to perfect our methods of marketing beef for export. I share Deputy Bermingham's opinion that the more we process our own meat the more the country as a whole will earn from it, including the producers.  Some very important steps have been taken towards this end, and I will deal with that later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> Deputy Bruton mentioned GATT imports from the APC countries and from New Zealand, Australia and possibly Canada.  He did not believe it was in our overall interest to make too big a fuss about these importations, and that there were other importations to the Community such as young beef from Yugoslavia into Italy.  There are also importations into Germany of Polish and Hungarian store cattle on the basis of its being a trade of long standing which has become traditional.  It is also a source of the tightening of competition for Irish beef.  I do not thing we should seek the solution to our marketing problems in the pointing out of the difficulties there are in a competitive market.  Our biggest problem is to become competitive ourselves, and we should devote more of our energies in that direction.  I am confident that the CBF will be a great help towards that end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned AFT as an example of the difficulties encountered in presenting annual reports, said that there is general slowness and used the comparison with private companies.  I do not think AFT or indeed CBF&mdash;such widespread operations as one or other of them controls&mdash;would be physically capable of rounding up the necessary data for an annual report within any closely confined time.  In this regard I would have no anxiety about the words used in the Bill&mdash;that the report be presented as soon as may be&mdash;nor would I seek to constrict the quality of the report by the imposition of unreasonable statutory limits.  We must be prepared to accept that the board that will be established will approach the job in a serious way.  Indeed several other boards have the same provision and, in practice, encounter no difficulty in having to report within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned a matter which we could probably better deal with on section 4 on Committee Stage, a matter which really arises out of the provision in the Bill for the export of beef by the board itself.  Obviously this necessitates their buying as well.  It is the Minister who has the power to direct CBF to export and to direct to what country that export takes place.</P>
    <P>A couple of Deputies, including <Col N="1669" /> Deputy Bruton, expressed some reservations about the proposal that a certain number of board members shall retire in rotation and terminate their three-year membership of the board.  It is not at all necessary&mdash;as Deputies seem to think&mdash;that they depart to limbo for ever; of course, they will be eligible for re-election.  It is desirable that there be a mechanism of renewal in respect of a board such as this one.  I would not be attracted at all to the possibilities of collegialities&mdash;such as those about which Deputy Bruton spoke&mdash;being established on too long a basis because, in our time in this country, we have seen a very strong collegiality being established in many small co-operative creamery societies, when the collegiality did not apply itself to the solution of those societies' problems and became ossified in more ways than one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton enquired about the classification scheme and its likely coming into being.  The position is that this scheme is at present with the parliamentary draftsmen.  We would hope to have it experimentally in operation in August and fully operational by 1 December next.  The difficulties that have been encountered by certain parts of the meat processing industry, particularly the boning and canning sectors&mdash;mentioned by Deputy Bruton and others; I think Deputy Bermingham mentioned this also&mdash;as I briefly interjected while Deputy Bruton was speaking have been effectively solved at present through the making available to Irish canners of intervention beef at specially low rates. This will certainly put Irish canners in a competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their counterparts in the United Kingdom, which is where most of the competition exists.  The imposition of an MCA on those products would not be universally beneficial to the Irish canning industry, especially if exporting to hard currency countries.  The arrangement we have got <Col N="1670" /> after a great deal of trying, and a great deal of goodwill also on the part of Commissioner Gundelach and his staff, was accepted by the Council at the price-fixing meeting, as was the proposal to alter the co-efficients for working out the MCAs and boned-out cuts which had created an imbalance in favour of the export of bone-in carcass, or indeed live animals and, therefore, constituted a deterrent to boning-out for the market rather than for intervention.  It is worth saying that fairly well all of the boning-out that has been done by the Irish meat industry since our entry into the EEC has been done for intervention.  While it is a very necessary safeguard for producers and for the industry, the industry ought not to be looking over its shoulder always for the protection of intervention. I would hope that in the future the board of CBF would be somewhat more adventurous and would look for their salvation in the market place itself rather than in the lifeboat of intervention.  After very exhaustive consultations by the Department of Agriculture and indeed by myself our particular 7 by 7, as it were the letters against the number seven for the grading scale, suits our country and products just as well as the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;6 by 6 scale of the French.  I think it will achieve the general result of lifting the quality, by producing a premium for the production of cattle of a particular quality as near to I 1 as we can get on the Ireland scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to markets for boned-out meat this is where the industry must now stop saying that there are difficulties with the MCA co-efficients because they no longer exist.  Indeed the marketing conditions, with the devaluation of the British Green £ and the differential between their MCA and ours which is in the region of 7 per cent at present, are a far cry from the days three years ago when it was 30 per cent.  The difficulties in marketing that were unthinkable in those days are very manageable now even with the old co-efficients.  With the new <Col N="1671" /> co-efficients there is no excuse at all for not looking for markets for boned-out meat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton hesitated to let me off with what was on the whole a very constructive and informed speech, without the traditional reference to the battered confidence of farmers.  It is not as easy to batter the confidence of farmers as Deputy Bruton and his colleagues seem to think from time to time.  I am a farmer and know exactly when I feel battered. There were occasions in the past when difficulties of an acute nature, for instance when the cattle crisis in 1974/75 arose which led to far greater difficulties than those envisaged by the introduction of the levies we dealt with yesterday and previously.  That was in the nature of a parting shot from Deputy Bruton. Deputy Bruton's last words referred to the particular difficulties of the beef men, to which I referred already.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the likelihood of the live trade challenging in the European Court the imposition of the levy which I understood and still understand to be agreed by all the interests concerned in the meat trade.  The live trade are not opposed to the imposition of the levy, so it is unlikely that they will seek the course that Deputy Bruton suggests. They had a feeling that the levy should be charged on blue cards.  That was purely the mechanical business of collecting the levy.  The blue card system of collecting the levy would be quite unworkable. In relation to the objection to the levy as it is, from the Community point of view we took the precaution of asking the Commission before we introduced this measure, and they had no objection whatever to the collection of the levy provided that the operations of the board are not in marketing within the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken account of the Court decision in the Pigs and Bacon Commission case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is no parallel. The anticipated activities of the CBF will not be comparable to the imposition of the levy by the Pigs and Bacon Commission. <Col N="1672" /> Pilot marketing operations are envisaged, possibly in North Africa or in some other Third Countries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Griffin did not have anything very constructive to say&mdash;he rarely has&mdash;but he lamented the size of the board because he envisaged a board of 20 or 25.  Anybody with any experience of boards would know that a board of that size would be quite helpless.  The Deputy did not advert to the fact that the board can appoint advisory committees who need not be members of the board.  That might get over that difficulty of Deputy Griffin's.  The rest of Deputy Griffin's contribution was something in the nature of a dirge and was of no noticeable value.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bermingham was anxious about the general difficulty of the quality of the Irish product.  Irish meat does not always fetch a smaller price than competitors', and where it does it is undoubtedly a reflection of the quality.  In this regard the quality classification scheme should be of decided help.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised a question as to the declaration of interest by the members of the board.  Under section 20 a member must make a disclosure of interest if he is involved in any contract which the board proposes and under section 21 he may not disclose the nature of the business of the board to anybody else.  It would not be possible to provide that somebody could not use knowledge he got now to help him in some future contract.  There is only his disclosure of interest and his sense of honour.  No constraint or handcuff ought to be put on to members and they are not necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a problem where someone on a board is in the business and can get information in advance of everybody else.  There is a potential problem there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who would consciously use his position on the board for the accumulation of knowledge for the purpose of his own business as against that of anybody else, would be acting in a dishonourable way <Col N="1673" /> and surely he would be unwise not to make a declaration of interest under the Bill, if he has an interest of that kind.</P>
      <P>If the board are to depart from the Government's apron strings it is necessary that they have reasonable freedom in relation to borrowing.  They must have reasonable operational freedom in order to operate commercially on the market. Such borrowing powers should not give rise to any difficulty in this case just as they have not given rise to any difficulty in the case of many similar boards. However, that is a matter that we might discuss in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On the question of Yugoslav and other Eastern European imports of store cattle into the Community, we have always resisted the annual licensing of those imports by the Italians and by others on the basis that they militate against Community producers of cattle. Deputy Clinton, too, followed this line as Minister.  However, the possibility of the elimination of those licences is unlikely but the repetition of our opposition to them is useful in that it helps to keep the situation within manageable bounds and averts the possibility of the creation of another beef mountain such as that experienced in 1973 but which had been accumulating perhaps during 1972.</P>
      <P>Some of the contributions to the debate have been very helpful and constructive but there were some that cannot be so described.  However, I thank all those Deputies who contributed.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four trustee savings banks operating in the State&mdash;in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  A fifth bank&mdash;the Monaghan Savings Bank&mdash;operated until 1976 when it amalgamated with Dublin.  All the banks were founded between 1816 and 1820 <Col N="1674" /> and although they are private bodies the Trustee Savings Banks Acts provide for their supervision by the State and set out how they should conduct their business.</P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1863, which was a consolidating Act, is with certain amending Acts the governing statute.  Amending Acts passed in 1958 and 1965 brought the legislation up to date in such respects as then seemed necessary.  The question of consolidating the legislation is being examined.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1965 provides that:</P>
    <P>The trustees of a trustee savings bank may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, undertake any business which is, in the opinion of that Minister calculated to encourage thrift and within the financial capacity of the bank.</P>
    <P>Under this section the trustee savings banks were authorised to grant short-term personal loans&mdash;for periods up to five years&mdash;and bridging loans to depositors.</P>
    <P>In connection with a proposal to extend the personal loans service to include long-term housing loans the law officers advised that there was no objection in law to the use of section 3 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1965 for that purpose. As announced in this year's budget the trustee savings banks have been authorised to grant house mortgage loans.</P>
    <P>One of the savings banks was advised by counsel that in his view the 1965 Act did not empower the Minister for Finance to sanction loan schemes and that new legislation was required.  The matter was referred to the Attorney General who now advises amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends section 3 of the 1965 Act by providing that any business sanctioned by the Minister for Finance under that section may include the making of loans, including house mortgage loans, and the using of depositors' funds for that purpose.  For the protection of the savings banks it is necessary that the amendment should have retrospective <Col N="1675" /> effect to cover loan schemes sanctioned to date.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill, but I was surprised to find that it was necessary in view of what the Minister had said.  We understand that one of the banks concerned got advice that was contrary to the general interpretation of section 3 of the 1965 Act.  In these circumstances the best course to adopt was to have sought the advice of the Attorney General and, as the Minister has said, it is on his advice that this amending legislation is before us.</P>
      <P>During the budget debate the Minister for Finance told us that the banks would be confined within their deposit limits regarding the amount of money they can lend.  However, there is going through the House a Housing Bill which provides that the Minister for the Environment may prohibit lending institutions from providing mortgages if CRVs are not forthcoming in the case of the houses for which loans are sought.  I presume that the savings banks will come within the terms of that scheme also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good step to provide that the savings banks may lend money.  Perhaps at another time we could consider going further and restructuring completely the savings banks, considering perhaps all the legislation governing them.  It has always been a bone of contention with the savings banks in the Cork area for instance, which is the area with which I am familiar, that they were not free to use in the Cork area the money that was deposited there but had to return it to the Treasury for use in the general pool of finance available to the Government.  I expect that when the savings banks were set up more than 100 years ago there was a need for that stipulation having regard to the explosion then in the number of banks being opened but many of which had a very short life.  However, that was not the case in Ireland other than in respect of one or two notable exceptions. The collapse of the savings <Col N="1676" /> banks in many areas caused much hardship so perhaps that was the reason for the imposition of restraints regarding the use of money.  I expect that originally these were philanthropic organisations and if one has regard to the composition of the boards of these banks down through the years one would agree, I think, with my assessment of the situation.</P>
      <P>However, the more finance that is made available for housing the better. Regrettably though, what will probably be harmful to the housing industry in the next 12 months is not that sufficient money will not be available&mdash;I think there will be sufficient money&mdash;but that the cost of borrowing the money will have an adverse effect on the building of houses in that time.  It has been estimated that if mortgage rates increase in line with lending rates generally, a £15,000 mortgage would cost as much as £190 a month to service, which is almost £50 a week.  The Minister should bring to the attention of the Ministers for Finance and of the Environment the necessity to provide, at least temporarily, a subsidy on mortgages. The £1,000 grant was obviously of some help when houses were costing £11,000 or £12,000.  Now that the price of houses has increased and mortgage interest rates are so high, many young couples have no hope of buying homes.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Bill because it widens the availability of funds for people who build their own homes.</P>

      <P>, <i>Dublin South-Central</i>): I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the permanent closure of the navigation spans on the Brian Boru and Clontarf bridges in Cork city and for the transfer of ownership of the bridges from CIE to Cork Corporation.  Certain provisions are also included in the Bill in relation to the members of the board and the general manager of CIE.</P>
      <P>The Brian Boru and Clontarf bridges, which span the north and south channels of the river Lee in Cork city, were constructed under the provisions of the Cork City Railways Act, 1906.  The bridges were so constructed as to be able to carry road as well as railway traffic and, in addition, the Act provided that the bridges were to have opening spans to allow for the passage of vessels along the river.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement made in 1948 between CIE, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Commissioners under the provisions of section 134 of the Transport Act, 1944, it was provided that the cost of working, control, management and maintenance of the bridges would be shared equally between the three parties, subject to the contribution by Cork Harbour Commissioners being payable only so long as any portion of the bridges continued to be moveable.</P>
      <P>The navigation spans on the bridges have not been opened for vessels since 1961 in the case of Clontarf bridge and since 1963 in the case of Brian Boru bridge.  Any craft now using the portions of quay upstream from the bridges would be small and would not require the opening of the navigation spans. Cork Harbour Commissioners agree that the opening spans are no longer needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, with increasing road traffic in Cork city, it became apparent that to improve the traffic flow over the route, and to alleviate the severe traffic problems caused by the necessity of frequent <Col N="1678" /> repairs to the existing bridge surfaces, the provision of a stronger and more durable type of decking on the bridges was necessary.  The introduction of one-way traffic over the route aggravated the problem because road vehicles which might otherwise choose not to follow the route were compelled to do so in the one-way flow.  The operation of trains over the bridges on the line between Albert Quay station and Glanmire station, which had been used by CIE for the transfer of certain freight traffic, became increasingly difficult, and the line has not been used by CIE since 1976.  The freight traffic is now transported by road vehicles direct to Glanmire station for onward distribution on the rail network.</P>
    <P>Following consultations between CIE, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Commissioners, CIE prepared proposals to have the bridges converted to fixed bridges and to have the railway lines removed completely.  The three parties have concluded an agreement dated 12 July 1977 to give effect to these proposals and to provide for transfer of ownership of the bridges to Cork Corporation. The implementation of the agreement is subject to the enactment of this Bill.  As Deputies will note from the provisions of the agreement, which is attached as a schedule to the Bill, CIE will convert the bridges to fixed bridges within six months and will remove the railway tracks and other equipment from the bridges within twelve months of the passing of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of these works, CIE and Cork Corporation will bear equally the cost of maintaining the bridges.  Cork Harbour Commissioners will be relieved of any obligation to contribute to the maintenance of the bridges from the date of enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On completion of the works to be undertaken by CIE, and on payment by the board to Cork Corporation of a sum not exceeding £12,000 towards the cost of providing a more durable road surface on the bridges, ownership of the bridges will be transferred from CIE to Cork Corporation, who will then become exclusively responsible for their maintenance.  Cork Corporation will indemnify CIE and Cork Harbour Commissioners <Col N="1679" /> against any possible claims for compensation for loss of private rights arising from conversion of the bridges to fixed bridges.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provisions concerning the Cork bridges, the Bill makes certain provisions in relation to the general manager and members of the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill arises from the general policy of taking control of the remuneration of the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies as and when the opportunity arises.  The intention is to allow the CIE board freedom to fix the total remuneration of the chief executive&mdash;i.e. the general manager &mdash;within the range approved by me with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  The present ranges of remuneration for chief executives of State-sponsored bodies are those set by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in their report of 11 July 1972, updated by the addition of increases in pay agreed under the various successive national pay agreements.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 (2) of the Transport Act, 1950, it is provided that every member of the board of CIE shall hold office upon such terms and conditions as shall be fixed by the Government &ldquo;at the time of his appointment&rdquo;.  I have been advised that until this section is amended it is not open to the Government to alter the terms and conditions of a member of the board as fixed by the Government when appointing him, without his resignation and reappointment.  Hence, to apply the normal approved increases in remuneration it has been necessary for the chairman or other members of the board to resign and be reappointed by the Government at the higher rate. To overcome this legal technicality it is proposed in section 8 of the present Bill to amend the existing legislation by the deletion of the words &ldquo;at the time of his appointment&rdquo;; in addition, provision is being made for the fixing of the terms and conditions by the Minister for Tourism and Transport with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service rather than by the Government.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing contentious in this Bill and we support it.  It is apparent that the two bridges in question have not been open for a number of years and are unlikely to be used again by shipping.  It makes good sense that they should be permanent structures, that the opening spans should be sealed and that the surfaces should be made more durable.  Any of us who drive through Cork city will realise that it would not be a practical proposition to open the spans in question because of the traffic congestion, if not chaos, in the areas concerned.</P>
      <P>It often strikes me as being strange that such a hardy race of people and such an astute race of businessmen as Cork people have allowed their traffic problems to multiply to such an extent as at present.  The whole commerce of the city seems to be strangled at times by the lack of adequate traffic arrangements and the areas in the vicinity of these two bridges are often the major points of congestion.  I would hate to see what would happen if we allowed a situation where these bridges had to be opened for shipping periodically.  It would merely lead to a more intense snarl-up than we are having at present.  I do not know if the Minister has any comments or suggestions to make on what is going to be the long-term solution to Cork's traffic problems, which are far worse than Dublin for the size of the city, but we certainly will agree with any proposal which will alleviate the chaos which exists at present.</P>
      <P>The other section of the Bill, section 7, which deals with the remuneration of the chief executive of a State-sponsored body, is a section which we fully support. There should be far more freedom when it comes to fixing the remuneration of a chief executive.  I do not see anything contentious in the Bill and am only too glad to support it.</P>

      <P>We support the Bill also. We do not see anything unreasonable in it.  It merely gives legislative approval to an agreement that has already been entered into by CIE, the Cork Corporation and the Cork Harbour Commissioners. It is said that this will alleviate the traffic in Cork to some extent.  I must <Col N="1681" /> confess that while I know Cork reasonably well I would not have the same detailed knowledge as the Minister and Deputy Barry.  Even if it alleviates traffic to only a small extent, it is welcome.  I know the Minister of State is not responsible for traffic all over the country and we have this problem in all our towns and cities, but that is another day's work and work for another Minister.</P>
      <P>We also subscribe to the proposal under section 7 in regard to the remuneration of the chief executive and members of the board of a State-sponsored body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Perhaps of all the Members of the House here at the moment I recognise most actuely the necessity for it.  It is something that obviously should have been done years ago, but these things are easier to talk about and the theory of doing them proves far simpler than the practice of getting the parties together and getting agreement among them on what should be done.  I will have certain regrets, of course, and indeed many of the schoolboys in Cork will too, because it was a favourite excuse if one were late for school to say that the bridge was up.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the most astute businessmen in Cork will do about the traffic situation because unfortunately Cork is a divided city&mdash;the Lee divides just at the entrance to the city, providing an island in the centre, which is the cause of all the traffic problems in Cork. The land use and transportation study was commissioned by the three bodies mentioned here plus Cork County Council to study the problem, and it points a way in the future to relieving this problem, but it needs money.  One of the proposals in that is that there should be at least one other bridge built at the eastern side of these two bridges nearest the mouth of Cork harbour.  There is no bridge between those two bridges and Roches Point at the mouth of Cork Harbour, and one of the proposals in the land use and transportation study is that there should be two bridges immediately to the east of these two bridges to set up a ring road to divert traffic around Cork to the south and to the west and the other way to the north and to the east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> The Minister for the Environment, Mr. Barrett, was present at the launching of the land use and transportation study about 12 months ago, and he said at that time that he could not see that the amount of money involved would present any insuperable problem in having the plan accepted by the Government and implemented by them.  That is very important, and everybody was very grateful to the Minister on that occasion when he so quickly put his shoulder behind the plan.  Naturally he could not give any firm commitment about the money but he indicated that he did not see that the money was such a huge amount that it would prevent the implementation of this plan.</P>
    <P>These two bridges are quite graceful and good looking bridges, made of either iron or steel and decked in wood with railway tracks running over them.  Virtually every weekend for the last five years one half of these bridges was closed while the deck was being repaired.  The Bill says that within 12 months the tracks will be removed and the bridge will be fit for the normal flow of traffic, and I am sure that will be adhered to.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I agree with Deputy Deasy about section 7 in relation to the salary of a chief executive of a State-sponsored body being fixed by the Minister.  I know that when I was in this Department it was one of the first to adopt this decision by the Government at the time to accept the Devlin Report and fix the salaries of the chief executive as legislation came through the House including the section, as has been done in this, to fix their salaries.  Having thought more about it since I think it has created more anomalies than it has cured.  I am not sure if we did the right thing at that time and if we are right in continuing it.  It needs more thinking about.</P>
    <P>I notice that the review body that was set up last year to look at the two sections of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the telecommunications section and the postal section, recommended the hiving off of these two sections of that Department into the semi-State sector even though there was some <Col N="1683" /> doubt as to what the Government meant.  But the proposal was to take them out of the direct control of the Minister and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  One of the recommendations was that the chief executive of either or both of these semi-State bodies would be paid a salary comparable with the salary he would get if working in private enterprise and that a chief executive officer should be a man of that calibre.  Even though I am possibly one fifteenth responsible for the acceptance of the Devlin Report five or six years ago I do not think it was the right thing to do and we should look at that again.  I can see the reason for it; I understand the theory behind it and I understand the thinking behind the old Devlin Committee that these people were not strictly in the private sector and they were not strictly subject to the same whims of boards to fire them if they failed to perform even though in theory they could be fired, so the same criteria could not be applied.  They could not be measured by the same criteria as the chief executive of a private body, nor were they full-time civil servants.  It has not become apparent if this is so because I can only remember one chief executive officer who retired in the last five years and that company were very fortunate to get a very good man.  His term of appointment will be up in a couple of years and I do not know if he will seek reappointment or if the man who will replace him will be of the same calibre.</P>
    <P>All parties might look at this again.  It is only right to amend section 7 (2) which created unnecessary annoyance in the Department over a number of years every time there was a question of the resignation or reappointment of or higher salaries for the chairman and members of the board.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and hope all stages will be passed today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> I am grateful to Deputies for their interest in this Bill.  Any step we can take that will relieve urban congestion is a welcome move.  This may be a small contribution <Col N="1684" /> towards relieving congestion in Cork and, from my knowledge, the traffic situation in that city is chaotic and some positive steps will have to be taken in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>We asked the Transport Consultative Committee to pay particular attention to urban districts.  It is very important that we do something positive about this if traffic is to move freely through our larger cities.  Hopefully this Bill will relieve some of the congestion caused in the past.  As Deputy Barry said let us hope there will be proper, permanent bridges there and that the congestion mentioned will be relieved.  This Bill removes the anomaly as regards the resignation and reappointment of the chairman and board of CIE.  This caused a certain amount of embarrassment because of the words &ldquo;at the time of his appointment&rdquo;.  These words are being deleted now and it will be possible for their remuneration to be increased.  This Bill brings the chief executive under the review body's recommendation and under the Minister.  This has taken place over a number of years.  The majority of the chief executive officers of semi-State bodies come within the scope of the review body which was set up in 1973.</P>
      <P>Only the best brains are good enough for the post of chief executive in any semi-State body.  They have a very important role to play in the economic development of our country.  There is nothing controversial in this Bill and I hope we get all Stages today.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages to-day.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment and passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dublin South-Central</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill raise the statutory limit on capital expenditure by Bord Fáilte on projects of both an accommodation and non-accommodation <Col N="1685" /> nature.  Thus the Bill proposes to raise the limit on accommodation expenditure from £16 million to £25 million and on non-accommodation expenditure from £4.75 million to £10 million.  The increase for accommodation I am proposing in the Bill represents a very considerable stepping up of the scope for expenditure as against previous similar measures.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce to the House in this context that I propose to introduce a new cash incentive scheme for new hotel bedrooms and an extension to the country at large of the existing supplementary holiday accommodation scheme which up to now has been confined to the special development area which embraces, roughly, the 13 westernmost counties from Donegal to Kerry.</P>
    <P>Tourism to Ireland has staged a strong recovery and we have had an increase of nearly 480,000 visitors, equivalent to 27 per cent, in the 1977 to 1978 period.  All successful tourist destinations are founded on a satisfactory range of access transport facilities and an adequate supply of accommodation. The Government's Green Paper of last year recognised that an accommodation shortfall could act as a constraint on growth.  One of the options in the Green Paper was to anticipate such a shortfall by bringing forward plans for future investment and concentrating on securing accelerated development for the 1980 season and immediately thereafter. We are now, in effect, taking up that option.  Despite the problems which tourism has faced this year I have every confidence in the future of tourism and in its ability to overcome the present temporary adversity, and to continue to expand and develop.  The decision to reintroduce accommodation grants expresses that vote of confidence in practical terms.</P>
    <P>The provision of extra hotel space&mdash;from drawing board to fully developed accommodation&mdash;takes well over a year to achieve and we need to plan now to meet our minimum requirements for the next few years.  In 1977 and 1978 certain areas were already beginning to experience pressure on accommodation at certain times.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> Tourist projections prepared by Bord Fáilte showed that tourist numbers would continue to rise to 2.7 million by 1981.  A very important feature of the growth is that the ethnic content has more or less stabilised so that a considerable bulk of the projected growth represents non-ethnic visitors who will give rise to demand for commercial accommodation. In planning the type of incentive scheme which would produce the best results, I have had regard to past experience, the financial state of the industry and the level of incentive which would provide the proper level of stimulus.  I have accordingly designed a programme which aims to secure optimum increases in the accommodation stock at national and local levels.  The main features of the new scheme are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it is framed on a selective basis so that it will represent a correct response to our needs;</P>
    <P>(b)  it is related solely to the cost of providing additional bedrooms;</P>
    <P>(c)  there will be different levels of grant related roughly to estimated need with grants from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of room cost subject to fixed cash maxima;</P>
    <P>(d)  priority will be given to the extension of existing hotels over the construction of new hotels, and new hotel construction in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Shannon, Killarney and other major conurbations with a substantial tourism/business base will not qualify for grants.</P>
    <P>I have instructed Bord Fáilte to prepare a detailed scheme embodying these principles so that on passage of the measure now before the House they will be able to consider applications and undertake the financial commitments for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>The other major change which I am introducing is the extension of the supplementary holiday accommodation scheme which was established in 1967 and which at present applies only to the non-urban areas within the special development area.  The scheme, as its title implies, was designed to encourage <Col N="1687" /> the provision of tourism capacity of a supplementary nature through the addition of bedrooms to existing private houses.  Over the past number of years farmhouse accommodation has developed into a very distinctive tourist product in its own right.  The high rates of occupancy enjoyed suggest that there is considerable scope for development of this product.  I have, therefore, authorised the countrywide extension of the scheme, a doubling of the size of the fund and a raising of grant levels from £700 to £1,000 per house in a single year subject to a maximum of £3,000 overall.  The scheme will also be used to upgrade many existing approved farmhouses, town and countryhouses in all areas of the country through the provision of extra facilities such as hot water, hand-basins in bedrooms and so on.  These improvement works will enable small rural areas to be promoted more vigorously and through a longer season, especially in those areas where it will be possible to build on activities such as fishing and shooting.  The preference of the special development area will be retained by provisions designed for topping up grants to premises located there.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for hotels and supplementary accommodation will be introduced strictly in accordance with the main features I have outlined and will operate on that basis for some time. I will, however, see to it that all details of the scheme will be carefully monitored to ensure that we get the optimum response.  Bord Fáilte will, of course, continue their existing programme of ongoing capital accommodation expenditure on such items as camping/ caravan sites, An Oige type developments and their accommodation improvements scheme, except that in the last case and in tune with the drive to concentrate on providing extra accommodation, the scheme, as is now generally known, is now being focussed on improvement and upgrading of bedrooms.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a new fund was established with a limit of £4.75 million for development works of a capital nature other than accommodation which in the <Col N="1688" /> opinion of Bord Fáilte would promote the development of tourist traffic.  The board's plan set out proposals for capital spending, which included joint development with bodies such as the Office of Public Works and the forestry and wildlife service, on conservation, recreational and educational projects as well as expenditure to encourage the improvement of facilities by those directly involved with sailing and water sports, horse riding, horsedrawn caravans, sea angling, swimming pools, recreational projects and similar activities and facilities.  Works have been undertaken in close co-operation with the regional tourism organisations, local authorities and other interested parties.  These activities form part of the ongoing process of meeting the present and future needs of tourists by providing amenities and services of the right quality and quantity in the most appropriate locations.</P>
    <P>I do not think the country can rely solely on its scenery and particular attraction as a nation to sustain its tourism drive.  Future tourism growth will depend on continuing to attract an increasingly sophisticated ethnic tourist and the non-ethnic visitor who expects a range of facilities which would be normal elsewhere.  All of the visitor products created by Bord Fáilte spending contribute to the stock of facilities available for visitors and residents alike and are a positive aid in generating new business and attracting repeat business.  Many are not directly revenue producing, while others have a highly commercial content but, because of seasonality and other risk factors, the long developmental period and high capital cost involved, would have developed more slowly without the incentives Bord Fáilte are enabled to give.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the present statutory limit from £4.75 million to £10 million guarantees the contribution by Bord Fáilte to the process of providing facilities of the right quality and quantity in the right place for holidaymakers. Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism organisations, the local authorities and other State agencies such as the OPW and forestry and wildlife service are all doing an excellent job of work in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> Tourism is a major earner of foreign currency, it contributes largely to our balance of payments, the import content is lower than for other sectors and, since it is a labour intensive industry, the job creation potential is greater.  Most important of all, its benefits are widely dispersed throughout the country so that it is an excellent aid to regional development. The Government decisions which I have just announced denote a strong vote of confidence in the future of the tourist industry as well as a clear acknowledgement of the part tourism plays in the economy of the country.  As a further statement of the Government's confidence I am introducing another Bill this week to provide money to enable B &amp; I to finance an additional passenger car ferry for delivery for the 1981 season to augment capacity on the cross-channel routes.</P>
    <P>The extra funds which we have been making available for tourism promotion over the past two years have been paying dividends and have enabled Bord Fáilte to campaign more vigorously in existing markets and also to begin to explore new market areas.  By the end of last year we had again built up to the levels of our previous highest tourism year, 1969, and were set out to share in continued tourism growth.  Tourism in Ireland has, however, experienced special difficulties this year&mdash;indeed some of the problems are world-wide. The effects of the postal dispute were seriously compounded by the oil shortfall which existed for a period, but it is difficult to get a sound assessment of the overall position.  The results of the air and sea carriers vary between themselves and the different markets, but the picture that emerges is that, while carryings were up earlier in the year, bookings (or in the absence of bookings, expectations of carryings) were down on the target for 1979.  The carriers, particularly the sea carriers, were planning for substantial increases of the order of 20-30 per cent in capacity offered, so that when one reads of curtailment of sailing schedules and so forth, it certainly represents a failure to realise our earlier expectations, but, nevertheless, leaves us with the same level of services to Ireland as we had in <Col N="1690" /> our record-breaking year of 1978.  Bord Fáilte projections for the year are being reviewed.  The exercise is a difficult one, particularly since the bulk of the season is yet to come and conditions are now improving.  The Board's present hope is that we may at best equal the 1978 performance, which was an all-time record. My personal belief is that after a pause this year we will be ready to move forward again at or near growth rates previously forecast.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, tackled vigorously the petroleum oil problem in the tourist interest.  The first pressures on tourism were on the use of diesel oil used for coaches and cooking/heating in hotels.  Very early on the Government declared tourism one of the priority areas and the difficulties with diesel largely faded for tourism.  Following the onset of the petrol difficulties Board Fáilte and my Department were very active in seeking to ensure that the quota of fuel used by tourists, on which part of our 1979 allocations are being based, would in fact be available for tourists. The result was the voucher scheme, to ensure minimum supplies for visitors, which I believe to be unique.  The scheme is an assurance for visitors that their needs will be catered for in Ireland.  The scheme must be seen in perspective. Tourism is an essential industry on which over 100,000 jobs depend, not to mention the other very tangible benefits. It is also a service industry dealing in a very perishable commodity which cannot be stored or left on a shelf until the customer is ready to collect it.  The motoring holiday has grown so enormously in popularity and is such an important means of spreading the benefits of tourism around the country that the Government were happy to make this positive response to the needs of the industry. I have also arranged with Bord Fáilte to implement a scheme to assure Northern Ireland motoring tourists a minimum supply of petrol while they are on holiday here.  Details of these arrangements are being worked out at present and will be announced as quickly as possible.  I think all will agree that the steps we have taken on the petrol front to protect the tourist industry have been <Col N="1691" /> a great reassurance to tourists and were both necessary and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The general fuel position continues to stabilise and if everybody uses energy sensibly and sparingly there will be sufficient for all sectors of industry including, of course, the very important home holiday market.  As Deputies are aware, a major energy conservation campaign has been launched throughout the country, and I am pleased to mention that Bord Fáilte and the tourist industry are complementing this through the establishment of an energy conservation committee within the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>All in all, therefore, the position is that overall Bord Fáilte hope that it may yet be possible to approach or match the all-time record achieved last year.  Despite the temporary setbacks which we are experiencing this year and which I hope will resolve themselves fairly quickly, the underlying trend in tourism is inexorably upwards and the mood is one of confidence in the long-term growth prospects.  I hope the industry will recognise the emphatic declaration of the Government's confidence represented by this measure which involves making available an incentive scheme for new rooms for the first time in ten years.  The scheme will not do the job by itself.  We have to plan and work for growth and above all ensure that we have the necessary basic infrastructural requirements.</P>
    <P>This is what we are aiming to do with this Bill, which I now commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Some of the provisions are very much in line with my own thinking, particularly the section dealing with the extension of grants to all aspects of the hotel business.  The inhibiting factor of the existing system was that it limited grants to the improvement of bedrooms, and this was regarded by hoteliers as something that could not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> The Minister of State, unlike the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, accepts that the tourist industry has problems this year.  His colleague was reported in the newspapers as saying that in the first five months of this year there were more visitors than in the same period last year.  That kind of statement is infuriating hoteliers who have empty bedrooms.  Those to whom I have spoken say that this has been a disastrous year so far.  In my own area there are some country home type hotels with extensive grounds and very expensive amenities.  In one case the owner told me that it will take five years to recover losses.  We must tackle the immediate problem of the disaster which has been caused by the fuel shortages and the telephone and postal problems.</P>
    <P>Our spending priorities are wrong with regard to tourism.  We are only scratching the surface of this wonderful source of revenue.  Millions are being spent on oil and gas exploration off Kinsale and off the west coast.  This is very necessary and we all hope that the search will be successful.  Expenditure of £650 million is proposed to build motorways in Dublin and we talk in terms of £400 million for a rapid transport system.  The Minister for Posts Telegraphs has announced that £650 million will be spent to improve our communications system.  It is only in the context of these figures that we realise how far this Bill is from reality.  The amount involved is peanuts and represents only one-tenth of 1 per cent of the amount which will be spent on these other projects.  There is no comparison between the revenue which would accrue from motorways in Dublin and that which would accrue from tourism. Tourism needs an expenditure of hundreds of millions if we are to do a proper job.</P>
    <P>Because of the oil shortage there will be a need to develop facilities in tourist centres which will reduce the need of the tourist to travel.  Unless we can provide amenities to compensate for lack of mobility the tourist will seek a market elsewhere.  Bearing in mind the substantial income potential of tourism, the time <Col N="1693" /> is right to take action.  We have had a serious setback but there is no reason to lose heart.  We must restore the confidence of people in the business.  It should be possible to increase substantially tourist numbers from all markets, especially from the UK.  We must woo every tourist.  Tourism is highly commercialised and Bord Fáilte with small resources are doing their best.  State agencies, local authorities and those who participate in the national effort to keep our towns, our countryside, rivers and estuaries clean and free from pollution are playing their part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the increase in oil prices, Departments and State bodies have been urged by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to reduce energy consumption by eliminating waste and encouraging conservation and are taking appropriate measures to this end.  In general, therefore, it is not expected that there will be any significant overall budgetary excess on departmental expenditure provisions as a result of the oil price increases.  There are, however, a small number of areas, for example, CIE where, because of the high volume of oil consumption, some additional costs may be unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Insofar as revenue is concerned, it is expected that there will be a gain in VAT receipts, given the price increases which have taken place to-date.  This is, however, expected to be more than offset by a shortfall in excise duties at specific rates because oil supplies are unlikely to show the growth over last year which was expected at budget time.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy heard I dealt with the question from the point of view of the cost of oil to Departments, <Col N="1696" /> State bodies and so on.  I also dealt with the question of revenue.  I have indicated that while we cannot be sure at this stage, there is likely to be some shortfall as between the gain in VAT receipts and the reduction in excise duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked about the change in the budget figures for 1979.  Do I gather from the Minister's reply that he does not see any great change?  There may be slight variations from one to the other but there will not be any great change in the budget figures by the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I have indicated, on the side of the equation relating to the cost of purchasing oil for Government Departments and so forth we do not see any great change there.  On the other side, we expect some shortfall on the lines I have indicated.  It is impossible at this stage to estimate the extent of that but it would not, at this stage at any rate, be expected to be very substantial.</P>

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that nobody can say at this stage what the price of oil is likely to be next December, for instance.  In so far as it can be taken into account this has been done.  The whole area is, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates, one of considerable uncertainty for consumer and producer countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if the British pound had gone into the EMS the same time as we did the 6 per cent band between the British and us would now be broken?

      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that it is unlikely if sterling had entered into the EMS at the same time as us that the same amount of appreciating in sterling would have taken place as has taken place since.  It is not impossible but it is unlikely.  I must again point out to the Deputy that the question of the appreciation of sterling as against all the EMS currencies cannot indicate a weakness in the Irish economy.  If there is a weakness in the Irish economy because of that then the Deputy is saying that there is also a weakness in that of each of the other economies of the seven countries concerned in the EMS with us.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in my Budget Statement this year, the first results of the reviews have been reflected in the 1979 Estimates.  I also said that the work would continue so that over a short period of years the entire field of Government expenditure will have been subjected to a systematic re-appraisal. The public expenditure review will continue, therefore, for some years yet and there is no set date for its completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reviews themselves are carried out by officials of my Department in consultation with officials from other Departments directly concerned with the subject matter of the reviews.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of a fall-off in investment confidence, or of any significant adverse effects on industrial and business interests, as a result of the present divergence in value between the Irish and British currencies.  In fact, available information indicates that so <Col N="1703" /> far this year investment has been very buoyant, indicating a continuing high level of confidence in the economy. While the appreciation of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish £ may lead to an increase in the cost of some imports, it should in general be beneficial for firms that export to Britain or Northern Ireland or whose products are competing with British goods on the home market.  I have not received any request from organisations representing Irish business interests for consultations on this matter. The implications of exchange rate changes are, of course, kept under review by my Department and by the other Departments concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that as so many of our exports to the UK and other markets are composed of raw materials originally imported from the UK there is quite an appreciable addition to domestic inflation as a result of the growing divergence between the Irish £ and the British £? Further, will the Minister agree that in the event of the divergence becoming even more marked, that is, the Irish £ being valued at 90p in relation to the British £, the effects here will be very extreme indeed and must lead in time to great difficulties with regard to the competitiveness of Irish products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In what he has said the Deputy is assuming that the divergence between the two currencies will necessarily contribute to inflation here.  That is not necessarily so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily but very likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be, but it is not necessarily so.  As I have indicated, the competitiveness of Irish industrial goods in the UK and on the home market should be improved as a result of the divergence.  The non-appreciation of the Irish £ in line with sterling has helped to safeguard our competitiveness in third country markets, giving us some advantage over the UK in those markets.  The degree to which these advantages will be offset by increases in the cost of imports <Col N="1704" /> from the UK will depend on the extent to which British producers are able to maintain the expected price denominated in sterling.  As I have told the Deputy, it would be a mistake to assume that the divergence which has taken place to date will necessarily lead to increased inflation here.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that, because of the exchange controls introduced last December and the divergence between the Irish £ and sterling, more money is being borrowed on the Irish market than was the case previously because sterling is more expensive for Irish borrowers?  Does this not have the effect of reducing the amount available for investment here? Does it not also have the effect of pushing up interest rates with a subsequent effect on investment in the second half of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The movement of interest rates is worldwide.  As the Deputy is aware, interest rates had increased in each of the EEC countries within the past few months because they were reflecting world interest rates.  It is true that certain borrowings have taken place here which prior to the break with sterling had taken place in London.  On the other hand, the matter is not quite as straightforward as that because there are facilities in certain circumstances in countries that are trading with Britain enabling them to borrow in Britain despite exchange controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also other developments in relation to the market which counteract the effect the Deputy indicated.  I cannot say at this stage whether the net effect of these various factors is to have reduced the amount of money available for borrowing&mdash;I forget what phrase the Deputy used but I think he means the private sector generally, and I cannot <Col N="1705" /> say if that is correct.  As the Deputy will also appreciate, especially from certain announcements by the Central Bank, the matter is further complicated by growth in credit beyond the lines laid down by the Central Bank.  But I have no reason to believe that there is any serious liquidity problem arising as a result of the break in the link with sterling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that it is directly as a result of the break in the link with sterling.  It is because interest rates have gone to such an extent here that there is lack of confidence on the part of investors about the future, and they are reluctant to invest.  The Minister says that interest rates are going up world wide&mdash;that is correct&mdash;but they are going up from a very much lower rate.  We are, I think, 2 per cent above the English lending rate in this regard. Therefore, money which previously could have been borrowed at cheaper rates in London&mdash;even though it is not prohibited to borrow in London&mdash;because of the difference in the value of the pounds, costs more to repay, and that differential is wiped out because of the revaluation of the currencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation governing the regional fund allows member states <Col N="1706" /> the option of using contributions from the fund either (i) to supplement the national aid granted to the project in question; or (ii) as a partial repayment of national aid, on the basis that fund assistance is used to supplement the overall regional development efforts of member states.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is the second of these methods which has been used in Ireland, receipts from the fund being applied to the financing of increases in the Public Capital Programme.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that arrangements for the administration of the fund should be such as to demonstrate clearly that moneys received are used to finance additional investment, especially in the areas of greatest need.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of the new fund regulation last February, my Department has completed its review of the existing arrangement and possible alternatives.  Arising out of this review I have given instructions that certain changes be made in the way receipts from the fund are accounted for in the Public Capital Programme: the summary of the programme will in future identify receipts from the regional fund as a separate source of finance alongside the other Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources.  The tables giving details of the outturn and estimates of expenditure on the individual services included in the programme will identify that portion of expenditure financed by fund receipts. The introductory notes on the programme will also explain in greater detail the EEC provisions governing the use of fund receipts by national authorities and the way these provisions are applied in Ireland.  As a result of these changes it will be possible to identify more clearly the way in which fund receipts are used to supplement national efforts directed towards regional development.</P>

      <P>The Minister, replying to a similar question some time ago, indicated that he would be in favour of the first method to which he has just referred in his answer.

      <P>The Deputy may not be quite accurate in what he said at the beginning of his question.  I think I have indicated on a number of occasions that what I was anxious to ensure was that the accounts demonstrated as clearly as possible what money was received from the regional fund, the purpose for which it was used and also demonstrated that it was in addition to the money being made available internally by the Government. The changes I have just indicated should go a long way to achieving that objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any evidence that the method of accounting we used has operated to prevent us getting more money from the fund; I have no evidence of that.  My concern in this regard was primarily with demonstrating to our people what was happening with the regional fund and that, to be quite blunt about it, it was not being used by this or the previous Government, as a cover up for Government failure to supply adequate funds for capital investment of one kind or another.  I think the changes I have indicated will help to demonstrate this clearly.  But I must repeat that I have no evidence whatever to suggest that the method of presentation has prevented us from getting money from the fund.</P>

The fact is that what I have announced is a method of demonstrating clearly what is being done by the regional fund and what is being done by the Government. I want to make it absolutely clear that my predecessor and his colleagues, including Deputy Begley, refused consistently to do that; they used the regional fund to cover up their deficiencies. Now, because I am curing that, Deputy Begley need not try to make a virtue of it.  If there is any virtue in it the virtue lies on this side of the House, not over there.</P>

The last assertion he made is so ridiculous and without any evidence whatever I am hardly called on to reply, except to point out that receipts from the regional fund have jumped enormously since this Government came into office, so that the basis on which Deputy Ryan made this allegation is clearly unfounded even by the results attained.</P>
      <P>As far as the presentation of the accounts are concerned I cannot have any knowledge of what Deputy Ryan alleges was said to him by any member of the Commission.  I regarded the method of accounting for the regional fund which was adopted by Deputy Ryan and his colleagues as a form of sleight of hand.

Even if one took the thing at its face value, the incident to which he refers occurred before the increase that I referred to occurred, and Deputy FitzGerald appreciates that as well as anybody else.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Donnellan</b> asked the Minister for Finance the extent to which the staff of the Office of Public Works has been augmented to cope with the extra arterial drainage activity arising from EEC aid, pursuant to the assessment referred to in his reply to Question No. 28 of 27 June 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in the number of engineering posts in the Office of Public Works at various grades was authorised in July 1978 to cope with additional marine work projects and extra schemes under the arterial drainage programme including schemes being assisted <Col N="1716" /> by financial contributions from the EEC.</P>
      <P>Recruitment of the staff to fill these posts and the normal vacancies arising from resignations and retirements has, however, proved to be slow.  This has arisen mainly from the rather low level of salary of engineers in the civil service. In addition the prolonged postal strike interfered with the clearance of candidates from the most recent civil service competition and delayed the holding of a further competition which was planned. Recent indications are, however, encouraging. Staff negotiations with the Department of the Public Service in regard to revision of salaries are at a fairly advanced stage and the current year's final engineering students have responded well to an invitation to be considered for temporary posts in the Office of Public Works pending the holding of a Civil Service Commission competition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> For this reason I have approved a comprehensive scheme of developments which over the next few years will provide an additional 1,510 residential places and 800 day care places for children and adults at various locations throughout the country.  Details of these various projects were set out in the lists circulated with my reply to a question on 28 February last.</P>
    <P>The general policy in relation to the mentally handicapped in psychiatric hospitals has been to end further admission of such persons to psychiatric hospitals as soon as sufficient alternative accommodation has been provided in special residential centres.</P>
    <P>For those who have been admitted to psychiatric hospitals it is the policy to separate them from other groups of patients and to provide them with a programme of care suitable to their particular needs.  The extent to which this policy has been implemented varies from one hospital to another and has been influenced by accommodation and staffing difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to place psycho-geriatric patients in this unit was reached in an emergency-type situation. As the Deputy is aware there is a very difficult situation at St. Ita's, a problem that has existed for some time, and this problem has been aggravated recently by the fact that certain repair, renovation and improvement works are in progress there and also by reason of the fact that some of the substandard accommodation there has been closed.  In that situation and because no progress could be made in sorting out the staffing problems relating to this 72-bed unit, I decided as an emergency measure to relieve some of the overcrowding by transferring these patients to the new unit.  It seemed a shame that this good, up-to-date modern equipment and accommodation would be left idle indefinitely. However, I assure the Deputies concerned that this is not the end of the matter and that I have established a group who are investigating the situation and supervising it as a matter of urgency in order to decide what can be done to improve the position, particularly the position of the mentally handicapped patients there.  We have in mind a proposal which we are exploring urgently and which if it can be put into effect should bring very considerable relief quickly to the whole situation.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the work of the Health Education Bureau to date in trying to reduce excessive drinking.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the full impact of the bureau's work in changing people's behaviour in relation to alcohol consumption cannot be measured in the short-term.  However, the bureau arrange to have the effectiveness of their campaigns evaluated regularly.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out in January 1979 among a sample representative of all adults in the country showed that 89 per cent of the respondents were aware of the bureau's campaigns in relation to the dangers of alcohol.  Furthermore, nearly all of these respondents thought that the advertising was effective in making people think about the dangers of alcohol.</P>
      <P>Approximately 8 per cent of the total sample said they had reduced their consumption of alcoholic drink in the six months July to December, 1978.  This would represent about 150,000 people in the whole country.</P>

The committee examined the situation and had wide-ranging consultations inside and outside this country. They submitted a report to the Department in October 1978 and that report recommended the pilot study.  They recommended that the deaths of all infants under two years of age from Dublin city and county be looked into with a special in-depth study of every death for which no obvious causes had been established.  We are doing exactly what the Medico-Social Research Board want done in this regard.</P>

However, health boards are being asked for the information and I will communicate the outcome to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Accommodation for such persons has traditionally been provided in association with arrangements for long-term shelter and maintenance of the elderly.

      <P>It is not possible to give a precise figure of the number of children under the age of 18 years who have no permanent accommodation. However, I am aware that there is a problem with regard to a small number of children living rough, usually in large urban centres.</P>
      <P>Many of these young people, because of difficult family circumstances, do not live at home.  Health boards endeavour to provide facilities for children who do not live at home and who are in need of care.  The number of places available for such children is kept under continual review.</P>
      <P>There are 45 residential homes for the care of children.  In addition, health boards, together with the Departments of Education and Justice, support a number of hostels run by voluntary groups which provide accommodation for homeless and other young people in need of special care.</P>

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1979: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the improvement grant allocation, I take it that we are still confining the grant to bedrooms and thus continuing to do as we were doing.  I admit that we have a new situation in that we are making provision for additional bedrooms but if the grants relate to bedrooms only it is a pity because it would mean that improvements to other areas in hotels and guesthouses will slow down.  Also any improvements which take place in other areas would be without the benefit of Bord Fáilte's advice and guidance and that would apply of course to lay-out, quality, operational, planning and architectural consultancy and this will result in developments which have been termed here as insular in their conception. The finish could well be substandard and without adequate regard for the needs of tourists particularly in relation to market standards.  The Minister for Health has brought in a hygiene campaign and that could very well be adversely affected if we do not give the necessary financial incentives towards better food preparation and the service areas of hotels.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about energy conservation.  Quite a substantial number of our hotels are old buildings and if we are to talk about energy conservation then very large sums of money will have to be found for insulation purposes such as double glazing and so on in these hotels.  It is vitally important that grant aid from Bord Fáilte should be provided here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying before Question <Col N="1749" /> Time, quite a lot of what we have to offer to tourists is based on personal appeal, on what visitors perceive and interpret as what I would call the natural friendliness of the Irish.  In my own constituency where we have seaside ports one often sees groups of visitors sitting on the quayside or in the public houses and they are really enthralled with the local Eamon Kelly telling them some local story, which is usually a pack of lies but a good story, and they are really fascinated with this aspect of Irish life, and join spontaneously in the sing-songs in the pubs.  This is something that does not have to be paid for.  It is something we cannot buy and when we contrast that with what we have all experienced in our limited travels abroad where we have this stilted type of approach, regimental almost, where everything is the same even to the parrot-like approach of the tourist guides who rattle off the same thing every day to 20 different tourist groups and give the impression that they are just doing a job and that they are disgusted with it, we really have something to offer.  We have to compare that with our own tourist guides who are so natural and create such a good impression.  This is certainly something that we have and that we should cultivate.</P>
    <P>In addition we have quite substantial natural resources.  We have beautiful beaches, beautiful harbours and a wonderful countryside.  We have mountains, rivers and lakes and we have the quiet country roads.  This is something that is new to many of our visitors.  It is something that they delight in and it is something that we have a great responsibility to preserve.  This is why I was making the point that we should work more in harmony with the Department of the Environment.  We might be dealing here with a utilitarian department that has to provide water and sewerage facilities and that sort of thing but they sometimes make mistakes.  The fact that we pour raw sewage from our towns into our beautiful harbours is something that I should stop and it is something that I would appeal to the Minister to take up with his counterparts.  It will cost money of course for treatment plants and so on but in this day and age we should not be <Col N="1750" /> proposing to continue the old bad habits into the future.  We have to look at this and ensure that it does not happen because, like our Irish characters, like our countryside, these are things that money cannot buy; they are assets.  It is not just like some of the European holiday resorts with the bleak, flat uninteresting countryside, the equally uninteresting hotels and their often mediocre beaches.  We have all these things and it is my view that they should be developed further.  What would America give for Blarney Castle or for some of our dolmens and cromlechs and all the wonderful history attached to Dublin?  What would the Americans give for something like Wood Quay and what would they give for the old historical places here?  After all, they can only go back as far as the Alamo.  This is what they appreciate.  Almost every one of them can trace some relationship to somebody in Ireland.  They all have a 31st cousin somewhere.  They have a love of Ireland.  When they come here they are often a little disappointed at our treatment of these historic places and the neglect of our national monuments.</P>
    <P>Here again we are hampered by a shortage of funds.  Many wonderful castles are badly in need of money to make them safe.  In some cases these castles could be fully restored which would be an asset from aesthetic and commercial points of view.  We must do all these things if we are serious about tourism.  As I said, we are talking about substantial sums of money.  In the short term we must have a crash programme but in the long term we will need substantial investment in this area if we are to reap the benefit.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, we have to fight for every tourist.  We are in competition with sophisticated marketing people on the mainland of Europe.  We must go after the tourists and win them back.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted many hotels are having problems this year.  The hotel industry is in a very bad state.  Many hotels are facing grave financial problems because of the inability to fulfil their financial commitments to the banks and lending institutions.  Last year was a good year and generated improvements in the expectation of a continuation into <Col N="1751" /> 1979 and onwards.  They were projecting very substantial figures into 1981.  They could still be attained but in the interim period we have a problem which this House must face.</P>
    <P>People borrowed heavily from their banks and lending institutions on the basis of previous years' figures which were adequate to convince those institutions that they were worthy of credit.  These people are very worried about how they are going to pay their bills.  Borrowings for improvements and refurbishing were estimated at £9 million.  This money was borrowed because the hotels had not built up their capital reserves.  Hotels will have to begin renegotiating their repayment terms.  Some already had to do this as the cash flow expected from deposits earlier this year did not materialise due to the postal strike.</P>
    <P>For example, one hotel which budgeted to receive £10,000 in deposits between January and March received a little over £700.  This financial performance will have long-term repercussions.  Hoteliers will not be willing to reinvest and, even if they are they will have difficulty in raising the necessary finance.  Investment organisations and public companies will tend to find, and rightly so, other areas outside tourism where security and returns are more readily available.  This is where we can help by moving in and, where necessary assisting anybody experiencing financial trouble, either by offering to help with the payments or by subsidising interest rates, which was a feature of Bord Fáilte's activities in the past.  That was an excellent idea and it would be a big help if it were restored.</P>
    <P>Hitherto our tourism was dependent on mobile tourists.  Any restrictions on mobility can only have a detrimental effect.  It is vital that tourists' needs are protected against petrol and diesel shortages.  The Government have taken steps by providing a voucher scheme.  It was only by trial and error that we discovered the snags, and there were many.  Vouchers were available only in certain areas.  Every large town and city should have a tourist office which would distribute these vouchers to tourists.  We <Col N="1752" /> must look to the future and double the amount of fuel being provided.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we see many UK tourists driving very large cars.  They may have to change because of the petrol shortage all over the world.  The 40 gallons allocated to each tourist is not very much use because he will probably be able to drive only about 1,200 miles. Therefore, I am in favour of doubling that amount forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>British Railways have been a bit unfair to us in their overseas offices in making the point that our vouchers are worth hardly anything and once used up the tourists will find themselves without petrol.  I have had visitors and I have no difficulty at all in obtaining additional petrol for them.  It is unfair of British Rail to make these comments at a time like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is to amend the Tourist Traffic Acts to allow the Minister to increase the contribution to Bord Fáilte from £16 million to £25 million and to increase the grant aid to the Bord for their development work from £4.75 million to £10 million.  Increased aid to Bord Fáilte is to be welcomed because out of the limited funds that the board have at their disposal they have done trojan work in promoting tourism abroad and helping industry here at home.  In the past when we had problems in the tourist trade we could rely always on Bord Fáilte to pick up the pieces.  They have done this in the escalation of the troubles in the North and on any other occasion when, because of European depressions or for various other reasons, we had a shortfall in tourism.  We could rely on the <Col N="1753" /> courageous personnel of Bord Fáilte to forge ahead.  I appeal to the Minister to go back again to his colleagues in Government because of the seriousness of the present situation.  While the proposed increase is very welcome, it is not nearly adequate to meet the requirements of the board and the hotel industry. A short-term grant should be made at once so that we can get everybody moving again, because move we must.</P>
    <P>The board have always been very helpful to young people starting off in the hotel business.  They have been helpful in the case of farm guest-houses and in the case of people planning caravan sites and so forth and they have cooperated with practically everybody. Their work abroad, not so well known here at home, is equally effective and efficient.  I saw examples of it in America where we have Bord Fáilte people who are well known and appreciated for the work they are doing.  I hope that the Minister in his reply will give us a reassurance that he will be prepared to extend the present grants not merely to new bedrooms&mdash;though these are to be welcomed&mdash;but to such things as improved hygiene, staff accommodation, which is very important, better kitchens and so forth.  For a few years no grants have been available for bedrooms in places like Dublin and Cork.  If a European visitor or tour organiser cannot obtain a bed in Dublin, then very often the tour has to be cancelled in its entirety.</P>
    <P>We are having problems.  The industry is at an all-time low.  The disastrous effects of the postal and telecommunications strike and the petrol problems are evident from the up-to-date figures from the industry.  In the current review of the business we find that as compared with 1978 the bookings to date are down in some areas by as much as 60 per cent and the advance bookings by up to 80 per cent.  I understand that the west and the south-west are the worst hit. Needless to mention, this will have repercussions right across the board. The effect will be felt by the farmers, the market gardeners, the shopkeepers, the supermarkets and everybody supplying the industry.  It is a serious situation, and those of us who live in areas where <Col N="1754" /> tourism is a big thing in summertime know that nothing can compare with a good clatter of tourists to spread money around in the pubs, restaurants and so on.</P>
    <P>Because of the current problems the job loss to industry is very substantial.  It would be much worse were it not for the fact that hoteliers, especially those who can afford to do so, are avoiding the consideration of redundancies in the hope of improvement.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte would do well to emphasise in their overseas operation the availability of vouchers for fuel and to correct the impression given abroad by British Railways that our fuel vouchers are no help and that once they have been used the tourist is left high and dry.  I appeal to the Minister to double the number of vouchers issued and, in conjunction with his colleague, to make every effort to end all these petrol queues.  He should also ensure that petrol stations assigned the responsibility of providing voucher petrol have the petrol to give.  He should ensure that the vouchers are made available at convenient centres around the country, especially in the west.  On that point, in every town, especially in our tourist areas, we should have at least a little tourist office even if it were to be manned for only the summer months, where all this business could be done and the tourist would know exactly where to go.</P>
    <P>One complaint that I have heard from tourists generally is in regard to sign-posting. In the major Continental cities the various exits have been sign-posted properly, and this is something that we should consider for the benefit of our tourists.</P>
    <P>Some of our hoteliers believe that we cannot redeem the current season, that it is irredeemable.  If that is so the Minister must move in quickly to help to ensure that people catering for the tourist industry will not be forced out of business by empty bedrooms and by the exorbitant interest rates that they have to pay at the moment.  We should restore the grants to cover interest payments on the loans which are so useful.  We should reconsider applications for grants to be used for works other than bedrooms in <Col N="1755" /> the light of this additional money.  This would restore much confidence which has been lost due to the depressed season.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a potentially rich area which requires careful consideration and cultivation.  Massive investment and proper management will certainly result in good returns.  Preparation for next year must be thorough.  We must mean what we say in telling tourists that adequate supplies of fuel will be available.  If we say that a certain carrier will operate to and from a certain place on a certain date we must ensure that this will be the case.  Some of the operations of Sealink leave a lot to be desired in this respect.</P>
    <P>Fuel shortages will abviously be worldwide, and I would envisage a change in tourist patterns.  In the future some tourists will be prepared to stay in one hotel for a week or a fortnight but only if they are provided with the amenities they require.  Money must be spent on the provision of swimming pools and facilities for tennis, golf and pony trekking, and slipway facilities must be provided on our beaches.  On the subject of pony trekking, which has become so popular in the south, I would ask for special consideration.  People involved in this aspect of the tourist industry operate separately from the hotels, and difficulties this year may force them out of business.  Bord Fáilte should examine this matter.</P>
    <P>It has often been said in this House that the UK is one of our best tourist markets, and I would agree.  The journey across the narrow band of water dividing us from the UK must be one of the most expensive in the world.  An Irish Laker is badly needed to bring people here cheaply.  Through Bord Fáilte we must promote more package holidays in Ireland and compete with Spain, even if it means massive State investment.  How is it that an Irish family can spend two weeks in a reasonably good hotel in Spain for the same price as a two-week holiday at home?  Only 40 per cent of our own people take holidays of more than four days away from home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister whether he has received a submission from the Irish Tourist Council or Bord Fáilte pointing out the need for an in depth examination of the whole question of the relation between the cost of access transport and the volume of tourist traffic. Bord Fáilte should help our exiles to holiday at home.  The Minister is aware that exiles are not catered for by package tours because they generally stay with friends and relatives.  They are our own kith and kin and should be enabled to benefit from these tours.</P>
      <P>Coach tours from the US have also shown a decline this year.  This is to be understood and is a fact of which we should not lose sight.  I envisage that CIE coach tours will be expanded as a result of the fuel shortage.  People will be inclined to visit this country without their cars and we must offer them a sophisticated type of coach tour operation. At present we are doing a good job in this area and private enterprise is helping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of farm guesthouses in this Bill.  Those who provide this type of accommodation have made a tremendous contribution. No two of these guesthouses are alike but their standards are excellent and the preparation of food leaves nothing to be desired.  Money spent on this area will be well spent.  Many young people living in areas where there is a certain amount of tourist traffic would love to go into this business but very often substantial expenditure is involved.  Their houses might be adequate only for family requirements, and such people would be <Col N="1757" /> greatly encouraged by grants.</P>
    <P>Farm guesthouses are peculiar to this country and are not found elsewhere. The Welsh and Scottish tourist boards have a lot to say about tasting Wales and tasting Scotland.  Farm guesthouses, guesthouses generally and places like the Yeats school do a lot to give tourists a taste of Ireland, Irish food at its best. Our Irish chefs have won competitions all over the world.  I welcome the statement by the Minister about the increased financial aid to this area.  The Minister stated today:</P>
    <P>The board's plan set out proposals for capital spending which included joint development with bodies such as the Office of Public Works and the Forest and Wildlife Service on conservation, recreational and educational projects ....</P>
    <P>This is a very welcome suggestion.  Board Fáilte have always worked hand in hand with the Forestry Department and the Wildlife Service.  More money will have to be provided in this area.  There are some wonderful forests, which are not available to us, which could very easily be developed and would prove to be a wonderful amenity.  There were some worries in the past about the danger of fire but tourists nowadays are well versed in fire hazards.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated:</P>
    <P>... expenditure to encourage the improvement of facilities by those directly involved with sailing and water sports, horse riding, horsedrawn caravans, sea angling, swimming pools, recreational projects and similar activities and facilities.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a lot will be done in relation to those matters.  I do not believe that sufficient money is being provided because the costs are very great in relation to water sports and sea angling.  A few years ago my country approached Bord Fáilte for a grant towards the provision of a wharf in Youghal.  Even though the board's contribution at that time was very small it was in the region of £60,000.  Therefore, we are talking about very substantial amounts of money.  Many of our harbour facilities in the tourist area are inadequate to cater <Col N="1758" /> for boats and facilities for tourists. Ballycotton is a fishing village but it is also a tourist village.  We cannot intrude on the fishermen by allowing all the tourist boats to be provided for that area. I believe with some expenditure a lot could be done to make slipways available at suitable points and proper haulage facilities so that the boats could be taken up and down to the slipways. Most of those boats are small.  Tourists always want to know if they can hire boats or where they can get hold of boats.  They all seem to think they can get boats very easily but that is not the case.  They prefer to take boats out themselves rather than be taken out by boat owners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill. Anything I may have said was not criticism of the Minister or of the board but I make no apology for saying that we need a crash fund at the moment to help the industry where possible, especially where there are severe difficulties. I am glad that we are extending the bedroom facilities for hotels in certain areas.  It is a pity that we are not extending those grants to cover all aspects of the hotel business.  I am satisfied that the Minister is doing a worth-while job in relation to guesthouses.  I am prepared to co-operate with him in helping to get the tourist industry going again.  The postal dispute is now behind us.  We still have a fuel problem.  We should help our industry now as it is going through a tough period.  I do not believe we will be able to rectify the situation for 1979 but we should take steps to put the industry right and I believe that when 1980 comes we will be on target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Hegarty on his comprehensive review of the tourist industry. I do not intend to speak at any great length because the Bill has just two specific proposals.  I welcome the proposals which provide for increases in the allocations for accomodation and for development.  I am sure that everybody will agree that this has been a year of near disaster unless it picks up later on in the season.  I am glad the Minister is taking his courage in his hands and, despite those setbacks, is <Col N="1759" /> prepared to provide for the future.</P>
      <P>We must provide for the future not alone for the tourist industry but for all the people working in that industry, who have been affected by the recent disputes and the shortage of petrol.  We cannot ignore the fact that there are 100,000 people working in the industry and as well as that there is the interest of the hotels, the guesthouses, the farmhouses, shops, licensed premises and those who supply the food.  We are not talking about something imaginary.  We are talking about real things such as jobs and all the other facets of the industry I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I hope I will be proved wrong in stating that this has been a near disaster year.  It has been such for workers who usually got employment in the industry during the year and who have been denied that because of the slump.  This has particularly affected young people at school who depended on jobs in hotels or in transport in order to get the money to put them through college.  We cannot deny that there is a recession and I shall mention briefly the reasons for it.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree with me when I say that there have never been fewer foreign registered cars on the roads which both of us travel practically every week.  There is a reduction in the vacancies for jobs in the transport system and there is also a reduction in vacancies for jobs in hotels and restaurants.</P>
      <P>The increase last year of 480,000 visitors, which the Minister said was equivalent to a 27 per cent increase, was an indication that the industry was thriving after certain setbacks which we had four or five years ago.  That increase also suggested something else to the Minister and to those in the industry, namely, a shortage of accommodation.  The Minister is doing something about that now.  I am not in a position to know if it is enough but at least it is an indication that the Minister and Bord Fáilte are preparing for an anticipated increase in tourism in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot ignore entirely the causes of the recession.  I know we cannot take precautions against some of the causes <Col N="1760" /> in the coming years but one of the main causes for the recession in tourism was the postal and telecommunications dispute which commenced on 18 February 1979 and continued up to ten days ago. It came at a bad time when people from abroad, particularly from Britain, would normally be making bookings or trying to have them confirmed.  Naturally they were very loath to come here when they knew they could have no contact with their homes by letter or by telephone. We all agree that the telephone system has been the responsibility of many governments and that it has been bad at the best of times but having no telephones at all was the last straw so far as tourism was concerned.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that when the recommendations of the review group, possibly in an amended form, are accepted and acted upon they will improve the service which is so vital for the tourist industry and the economy in general.  The Minister in his dual capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could do something in the immediate future to improve telecommunications.  Recently we gave him permission to raise a few hundred million pounds to improve the telephone system.  This may not be the right time to ask but possibly he may be able to tell us what progress has been made towards improvement of the system now that he has extra capital money.  As far as I know, a fair amount of money has been voted for this area but there do not seem to have been any beneficial results.</P>
    <P>Another major problem that confronted the tourist industry, and which is still confronting it, was the petrol shortage. Even now visitors have no real guarantee of supply.  The voucher system which was referred to by Deputy Hegarty was introduced at a very late stage in the oil and petrol crisis.  I wonder if we were the most affected country in the EEC so far as the petrol shortage was concerned or did the international coverage we got deter people from coming here?  Did it exaggerate the situation so far as availability of petrol was concerned?  I do not believe it was as bad as it was painted by the media&mdash;I am not talking about the Irish media but the media overseas.  There is no <Col N="1761" /> guarantee that there will not be a repetition of the May and June situation.  The shortage of fuel oils will continue and I trust the Minister will be able to make appropriate arrangements to ensure petrol supplies for visitors.</P>
    <P>In any case, we should prepare now for the 1980 season.  In consultation with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, I am sure a much better voucher system could be worked out. Some consideration should be given to Irish people who holiday here.  It is all very well for those who are confined to their own area and who have a guaranteed supply from their usual petrol supplier but if Irish citizens wish to travel from Cork or Wexford to Donegal they should be guaranteed by way of some other voucher system that they will get back to their base.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for an increase in the amount available for accommodation from £16 million to £25 million.  I am sure all of us agree there is great need for such an injection of money into the provision of extra accommodation. Last year extra accommodation was badly needed.  The Minister outlined the features of the new scheme.  I support Deputy Hegarty who suggested that the scheme should be extended to staff accommodation and to kitchens.  This is as important as bedroom accommodation. Perhaps the Minister would indicate if it would be possible to include a grant for these items.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>There will be different levels of grant related roughly to estimated need with grants from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of room cost subject to fixed cash maxima;</P>
    <P>It is fair enough that there would be a maximum amount paid.  Does that mean that the recipient of the grant will receive 75 per cent of the cost within the limit and that 25 per cent or 35 per cent, as the case might be, would be paid by Board Fáilte?  I read an article recently in a newspaper in which there was what appeared to be a quotation from Mr. Joe Malone, Director of Bord Fáilte to the effect that the scheme would mean that the board would put up a £ for every £ <Col N="1762" /> put up by, say, a hotel.  I wonder whether Mr. Malone was quoted incorrectly or whether it was the original intention of the Minister to introduce a scheme providing for a contribution on a pound for pound basis for hoteliers and others who would qualify for such a grant.</P>
    <P>I should be only repeating what Deputy Hegarty said if I were to pay my compliments to those who provide farmhouse holiday accommodation.  I have had experience of these holidays in recent years and I was more than pleased with the courtesy extended to us and also with the excellence of the food provided and so on.  That was in West Cork but I am confident that the farmhouse accommodation is equally as good in every other part of the country.</P>
    <P>A big attraction so far as this type of holiday is concerned is that for somebody of modest means and with a fair-sized family the accommodation is very reasonable compared with the cost of hotel accommodation.  The people involved in farmhouse accommodation deserve every help that we can give them.  Not only are these holidays availed of by Irish people but increasing numbers of visitors from abroad are availing of them too.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether I heard the Minister correctly but I gather that grants in respect of farmhouse accommodation were confined to 13 counties which are more or less on the western seaboard but that the intention now is to extend those grants to all those who provide similar accommodation in other parts of the country.  I think the Minister is nodding his head but perhaps he would confirm whether I am right.  I would welcome this change.</P>
    <P>I, too, welcome the increase in the amount available for development works.  As the Minister has said, we cannot rely totally on our scenery or even on our way of life to attract tourists to the country.  We still have reasonably traffic-jam free main roads outside the big towns and cities.  There appears to be no problem in this regard when one compares our situation with the long queues of traffic shown on television at bank holiday and other holiday times in such places as Britain, France and Germany. However, we must provide <Col N="1763" /> facilities such as those mentioned by the Minister as qualifying for development grants.  He listed among these facilities water sports, horse riding and so on.  It is important that such facilities are made available.  There would seem to be a lack of entertainment facilities for visitors in the evenings with the result that there is no place for them to go but to the pubs, where of course they are welcome because they are a big source of revenue, but we should make every effort to encourage the provision of other forms of entertainment for them.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is much Bord Fáilte can do to help in this situation because it is a matter for local communities but perhaps an effort would be made by the board to contact local authorities or various local organisations with a view to having them provide or encourage the provision of other forms of entertainment for visitors in the evenings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty spoke at length on our ancient monuments.  I agree that we take our ancient monuments for granted but visitors show much interest in them. In my home town during the months of May through September groups of visitors are conducted around the town by voluntary organisations and given a history of the area.  This is a valuable exercise not only from the point of view of the visitors but from the point of view of the town.</P>
    <P>A question that has not been referred to so far in the debate is the question of litter.  While the Minister cannot be held responsible for the situation in this regard he would be doing a good day's work if he consulted with the Minister for the Environment regarding a solution to our awful litter problem.  I cannot say that I have travelled abroad extensively but I have travelled to some extent and from the experience I have had in that regard I would say that we are the most littered country in western Europe.  This situation both amazes and disgusts people who come here from such places as Britain, France, Germany and the US. While for many decades references have been made to this problem, little seems to be done about solving it.  The right <Col N="1764" /> place to start is in the schools, to educate children in this respect.  Perhaps there are schools where lectures are given on this aspect of our environment but generally speaking I do not think that much emphasis is placed in the schools on the problem.  But there is a need, too, to educate some of our older citizens in regard to the problem of litter.  Today practically everything we buy is wrapped so that as soon as we remove what we buy from its package there is a need to dispose of that package and it amazes me that so many people simply throw this rubbish on to the street.  Visitors are amazed at this practice.  Is it any wonder, then, that we are referred to sometimes as the dirty Irish?</P>
    <P>This party are prepared to co-operate with the Minister to the utmost in promoting this very valuable industry, an industry for which there is yet a great future and in respect of which we have not reached saturation point.  The investment we are making in the industry now will provide a massive return for the State in terms of revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the problems facing the tourist industry in Ireland are concerned this Bill, to quote a well-known American politician, is not worth a bucket of spit.  I say this because the problems are not next year's problems. They are this year's problems but the Bill relates to next year's problems.  Even allowing for what is in the Bill, the Minister's approach is wrong.  If the Minister were serious about tourism and about supporting Bord Fáilte in their efforts to boost the industry he would be here to-day with a Supplementary Estimate to give the board an extra grant to go to where the principal fall-off is occurring and that, according to the newspapers, is the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that, but presumably he will spend 24 hours there during which time he will address groups of travel agents and prominent Irish citizens living in the UK, have a good lunch and come back straight away.  Instead, he should be here seeking <Col N="1765" /> extra money for Bord Fáilte to enable them to put from, say, six to 20 people from every tourist area in Ireland into the UK, people who would tell the truth about Ireland, who would let potential visitors know about the petrol situation, about the accommodation, about the telephone service and so on and encourage people to come here between now and the end of the year.  We know that there will be a fall-off in the industry this year.  We have confidence in the future of the tourist industry and know that it is a growth industry.  However, the Minister should concern himself with the lack of growth at present in the industry instead of concerning himself with accommodation for 1980 and 1981.</P>
      <P>An article in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Tuesday 26 June gives an account of a press conference held by Bord Fáilte. The article is headed &ldquo;Ireland: `Skip it.' part of the article reads:</P>
      <P>But in Brussels, clerks at the booking office of British Rail tell potential Ireland-bound travellers to think twice before embarking on one of the car ferries linking Britain with Ireland.</P>
      <P>The warning is illustrated with stories of distressed tourists who during their stay were stuck several times without a drop of petrol.</P>
      <P>British Rail agents also volunteer the information that Bord Fáilte vouchers for guaranteed petrol supplies are hardly any help at all. They add that once the coupons are used up a tourist has no access to petrol stations.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the last sentence means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Minister's duty to inform the Irish manager of British Rail that if his employees on the Continent are advising tourists to skip Ireland then they can damn well skip bringing their boats to Ireland.  Since the State was established, British Rail have been trading into two areas, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare. They pulled out of Waterford because it suited them to do so.  If that is how they would like to promote tourism from Ireland to Great Britain the Minister should deal with them.  We have <Col N="1766" /> exceptional assets and our best asset is our people.  Despite harsh propaganda from a small section of the community, the people have always welcomed British tourists and will continue to do so.  The Minister should recruit an army of commercial travellers and send them to the UK to inform the people concerned that the postal and telecommunications strike is over; that the inept petrol voucher scheme introduced by his colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, is now working more satisfactorily; that their currency is now worth more than it was last year. Tourism is an export trade.  One of the benefits of our currency is that it makes our exports more attractive.  The Minister should act now in order to attract tourists during the months of August, September and October.  I believe that the American market is holding well, despite articles such as the one that appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on Thursday, 28 June.  Part of the article reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have met other Americans in the same trouble,&rdquo; added Mrs. O'Connor.  &ldquo;They have had to beg for petrol to get them to the office where they can get vouchers and a lot of garages only sell to regulars.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, as Deputies Corish and Hegarty said, that the petrol voucher scheme was not a success.  I know it was introduced in a hurry and that it was not an easy scheme to introduce.  The Minister said that he was having discussions with the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy to devise a better scheme.  One of the problems is that garages who supply petrol to tourists have no guarantee that they will be given replacement supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): I understand that they have a guarantee the fuel will be replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. A simple scheme would be to issue to tourists vouchers which could be cashed as a priority in any garage.  Garages accepting the vouchers should be guaranteed replacement supplies.  One of the objections to such a scheme was <Col N="1767" /> that it could be abused, but I think that all schemes are open to abuse.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister does not appreciate the urgency to attract tourists to the west and south-west.  Many hoteliers who have built extensions are now faced with the cost of the extensions plus the cost of financing them at current interest rates.  Last night I was told that there were only six customers at dinner in a well-known restaurant in Kerry one night last week.  Another hotel in the south-east, not a hundred miles from Deputy Corish, can now be booked on a forthnight's notice instead of the usual six months in advance.  The biggest hotel on the Ring of Kerry had only ten guests the week before last. These facts can be verified through Bord Fáilte.  The confidence of those who have devoted their time to tourism should be maintained.  They should be told that the Government and Bord Fáilte appreciate their problems and are doing something about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should seek permission from the Department of Finance to introduce a supplementary estimate which would allow Bord Fáilte to promote our tourist industry.  We were given very bad publicity on a BBC programme a fortnight ago.  The following week an effort was made to correct it but by then the damage had been done.  I did not see the first programme but people who have seen it have told me about it, and there is no doubt that it presented a most bleak picture of Irish vehicular communication and telephonic communication and virtually said the same as another English state body, British Rail, said about Ireland without using the same words.  I do not know who managed to get the correction on to the BBC programme but full marks to whoever did it.  I would suggest that the Minister should now get on to the tail of British Rail and get that corrected and he should follow that up by getting tourists in here from all over Europe.  I have not got any first-hand knowledge but I have seen told that the greatest damage has been done in the United Kingdom.  The present situation is not a turn down for <Col N="1768" /> tourism here.  It is a pick-up, something that can be overcome but will not be overcome by looking at problems that will face the hotel industry in 1980 and 1981.  It must be tackled now.  It is that urgent.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself will not put a penny into Bord Fáilte pockets.  If it is passed here before 5 o'clock today that does not mean that Bord Fáilte will have any extra money at lunchtime tomorrow or tomorrow week or in November or in November 12 months unless the Minister lets them have it.  It is purely an enabling Bill.  I presume the reason this Bill has been introduced is because we are approaching the £16 million ceiling and the ceiling has to be lifted now to allow the Minister to give more but Bord Fáilte have no right to any money because this Bill is passed here.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say that he will be following through by giving extra money to Bord Fáilte to increase and improve the accommodation in the country.  I say that because it seems to me by the way the Minister's speech is drafted that things are being put on the long finger.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>In planning the type of incentive scheme which would produce the best results, I have had regard to past experience, the financial state of the industry and the level of incentive which would provide the proper level of stimulus.  I have accordingly designed a programme which aims to secure optimum increases in the accommodation stock at national and local levels.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to list the four main features of the scheme.  After that he says:</P>
    <P>I have instructed Bord Fáilte to prepare a detailed scheme embodying these principles so that on the passage of the measure now before the House they will be able to consider applications and undertake the financial commitments, for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister take it on himself to do this?  What competence has the Minister to design a programme which aims to secure optimum increases in the accommodation stock at national and <Col N="1769" /> local level?  If the Minister is going to undertake that type of work why have any Bord Fáilte?  What functions are performed by Bord Fáilte?  It is a promotional body but traditionally it has always distributed the grants out of money made available by the Minister. Of course the Minister and his Department and Accounting Officer will be responsible for the spending of that money and of course the Minister's Department and the Minister in his corporate state will have the overseeing of the scheme to see that it is in line with normal national ideas and the normal direction of the national economy.  But what competence has the Minister to design a scheme when he has a body of experts in Bord Fáilte whose duty it should be and whose job it is and who are competent and indeed, I suspect, are probably recruited to Bord Fáilte to design such a scheme?  How can the Minister design such a scheme?  Did the Holy Ghost descend on him?  Has he recruited, since I left that Department, people with that knowledge?  Has the tourism section been expanded?  Perhaps it has.  Perhaps the people who are in that section of Bord Fáilte have been taken out of Bord Fáilte and seconded to the Department.  Did this scheme come out of the Department in its present state? Deputy Hegarty said that the Irish Hotels Federation submitted such a scheme to the Department or to Bord Fáilte.  Did Bord Fáilte rubber stamp, amend, pass through or perhaps not see at all, the scheme of the Irish Hotels Federation?  Did Bord Fáilte put forward another scheme themselves?  If so, do they differ from the Minister?  The <Col N="1770" /> fourth point in the Minister's scheme is as follows:</P>
    <P>Priority will be given to the extension of existing hotels over the construction of new hotels, and new hotel construction in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Shannon, Killarney and other major conurbations with a substantial tourism/business base will not qualify for grants.</P>
    <P>Anybody who tries to book a bed in a hotel in Dublin knows there are not enough beds there.  Anybody&mdash;and I have frequently got complaints about it&mdash;who tries to book a bed in a hotel in Cork at any time of the year mid-week will know that people sometimes have to travel 12 to 15 miles outside the city to be accommodated.  Yet the Minister's scheme&mdash;and it is his own scheme and not Bord Fáilte's&mdash;proposes that centres with a substantial tourism/business base will not qualify for grants.  There must be some <i>rationale</i> behind that.  Somebody must have a reason for putting in that paragraph.  I read in the papers that there are three very big new hotel blocks contemplated for the city of Dublin, one near the airport, one in Earlsfort Terrace and one in Clarendon Street.  Perhaps there is a good reason why none of these should be grant aided.  Perhaps the Minister knows something about the companies or the financial structures of these three major hotel proposals.  That I do not know.</P>

      <P>I have allocated grants totalling £2.75 million under the local improvements scheme in the current year, representing an increase of 57 per cent over the corresponding allocations in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this scheme is to aid agricultural production by assisting landholders to carry out improvements on accommodation and bog roads and minor drains.  While funds under the <Col N="1745" /> scheme are not specifically assigned for the improvement of bog roads, the county councils who administer the scheme, have full discretion in determining the selection and execution of eligible works.  I have no proposals to increase further the provision made for this scheme in the current year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Bangor Erris, Mulranny and Achill Sewerage Schemes</i>
      </P>
      <P>The local authority's proposals for these schemes must be considered in the context of the amount of capital available for water and sewerage schemes and the number of such projects in progress or getting to construction at the present time.  I cannot yet say when I will be in a position to convey approval to the local authority to advertise these schemes for tender.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Shrule Sewerage Scheme</i>
      </P>
      <P>My Department asked the local authority on 12 June 1979 to re-examine their proposals for this scheme and to submit a revised report and drawings.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Cong Sewerage Scheme</i>
      </P>
      <P>The local authority's preliminary proposals for this scheme have been approved. The further planning of the scheme is a matter for the local authority having regard to its local priority.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Castlebar Sewerage Scheme</i>
      </P>
      <P>I provided a loan of £1,055 million in August 1978 to finance the construction of this scheme and on 26 June 1979 sanctioned the acceptance of a tender for the sewer-laying contract.  Proposals for the acceptance of a tender for the treatment works contract are at present under examination in my Department.</P>
