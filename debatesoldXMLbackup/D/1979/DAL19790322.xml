      <P>The Minister for Justice will be bringing a memorandum before the Government shortly on this subject.  I would hope to be in a position to make a more comprehensive statement on the matter in a few weeks.  I could notify the Deputy in the meantime when that could be made.  I might say in passing that it may not be necessary to have legislation.  A scheme to implement the idea could be introduced without legislation.  However, as I said, I hope to be in a position to make a fuller statement in a few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is in the House today.  I gather he was not well and I am glad he is fully restored to health.  I should like to outline the thinking behind this amendment.  Before doing so I should like to outline the history of developments in this field.  The previous Minister for Agriculture had before him reports which dated back for about ten years urging the reorganisation of the <Col N="250" /> advisory, educational and research services of the State to streamline them and make them better servants of agricultural development.  There were successive proposals for different forms of the reorganisation.  It was felt that, while the existing system was working reasonably well, it was not the best possible system and that something should be done to co-ordinate research, advice and education into a more positive developmental role for agriculture.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Clinton, took decisions on this issue.  His decision was that the three areas of activity, the research service which was under the Agricultural Institute and some research which was also being carried out by the Department of Agriculture, the educational services which were being carried out by the Department of Agriculture directly or by private schools grant-aided by them, and the advisory services which were being carried out by the county committees of agriculture, should be brought together under one body which would give them a unified direction and a clear and unified management.</P>
      <P>Objections were made in the course of the discussions that the autonomy of the Agricultural Institute should be preserved and that the Minister's proposals would create problems in this regard.  The Minister went some considerable way in amending the proposals in the Bill to guarantee the operational freedom of the institute within the overall structure of the national agricultural authority, at least, to guarantee freedom of research within that overall authority.  The institute would not continue to exist.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons was then spokesman on agriculture for the Opposition and he declared himself completely opposed to the proposals being put forward by his predecessor.  He said that if returned to office he would reverse them and take the Agricultural Institute out from under the aegis of the national agricultural authority.  Effectively that is what this Bill is doing.  The name of the national agricultural authority is being changed to AnCOT but it is essentially the same body minus the Agricultural Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> This major change is the whole justification for the Bill.  There are some other things in it but primarily we are discussing this Bill today because of the Minister's belief that the Agricultural Institute should be separated from any centralised body with responsibility for the overall development of research, education and advice on agriculture.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had not taken this view we would not have had to have this Bill. We would have had the former Minister's Bill in operation now and development would be taking place under that Bill.  We have lost about two years because of the present Minister's view that he had to undo the work of his predecessor in this respect.  Time is money and we have lost time in the process.  It behoves the Minister to have a good reason for what he is doing to justify the loss of two years in which developments could have been taking place and in which long-term planning could have been made.  At present this is impossible because the bodies, in so far as advice and education are concerned, which would be carrying out such long-term planning do not now exist.  Planning, which could have been taking place for the past two years if the previous Minister's programme had been allowed to continue, is not now taking place and probably will not take place for some time yet because there will be various delays in constituting a new Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  In the meantime the precise situation of the Agricultural Institute is unclear because there are changes in this Bill in regard to their independence also which we will be discussing later.</P>
    <P>We have had an unnecessary delay, although this view is not shared by the Minister.  We have this Bill, we have to accept it as a reality that a delay has taken place and what is done cannot be undone.  The purpose of the amendment we are advocating is to make the best of the Bill as it stands and to try to improve it, because we believe that there is an intimate connection between research on the one hand and advice and education on the other.  Research in agriculture if it is to be relevant must be based on problems which farmers are actually facing <Col N="252" /> in the field.  There must be adequate means of getting the results of that research back to farmers in the field. Therefore there must be some unified strategy in regard to research and advisory activity and the channels of communication between advice in the field and research in the institutes of research must be guaranteed.  Likewise it is vital that the education being imparted should reflect the latest research in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Therefore I contend very strongly that there must be a close institutional connection between research on the one hand and advice and education on the other.  The Minister for Agriculture says the only institutional connection necessary is for one or two members of each board to be members of the other board, that that is enough, that they are all reasonable men and they will share experiences and so on.  They may be all reasonable men but they are all at the moment going to be working according to policies being laid down by different boards.  They will be in separate institutions. There is no requirement for them to co-operate and in the absence of such a requirement it is the natural proclivity of all human beings to follow their own immediate interests, to respond to the immediate pressures on them and these are the pressures of their own institution.</P>
    <P>Research people will be interested in the needs of research and follow that line.  Likewise the people in the advisory services will be following their line. There is every danger of a divergence of strategy between the two institutions. The Minister will say he is responsible for both, he is providing the money for both and he can make sure that they do not follow divergent paths.  That is not realistic because we all know that the Minister and his officials have many more pressing issues to be involved in than administrative problems, maybe at a fairly low level, in the Agricultural Institute on the one hand and in the comhairle on the other, as to whether co-operation is taking place on certain specific projects about development in relation to crop varieties or something like that.  The Minister may be aware of one or two matters which come up in his own constituency but he cannot keep in <Col N="253" /> continuing contact with these problems of liaison which could be occurring between the institute and the comhairle. He will not be able to do it.  In practical terms we all know the pressures that Ministers are under and the pressures that higher civil servants are under.  To suggest that they are going to be able to co-ordinate these two bodies, whose purposes are so intimately connected, and that that is enough is pie in the sky.  We all agree that such co-ordination must take place.  I contend that by separating the institute from the advice and education authority and having two separate institutions without any real means of making sure they follow a unified strategy the Minister is doing a bad day's work.</P>
    <P>What we are putting forward is a compromise, and it is explicity stated to be a compromise, between the present Minister's position and the previous Minister's position.  Perhaps the previous Minister, if he is in the House, will not agree with the compromise, but in the context of the Bill we have before us to advocate the position of the previous Minister would be to directly negative the position of the present Minister and that would not be an amendment and it would not be admitted as an amendment. Therefore, to have the matter discussed in an objective sense at all we have to put forward a compromise.  In any event I think the compromise we are putting forward is a very reasonable one which was drafted after considerable thought.  I believe the Minister for Agriculture would, if he were to accept it, be doing good for himself as well as for the country and for agriculture.</P>
    <P>The compromise is that the Agricultural Institute will still continue to exist as a legal entity with its own staff, its own internal disciplines and management and its own director.  An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta will also continue to exist as a legal entity with its own staff and its own director. Both agencies, in so far as their executive functions are concerned, will continue to exist independently and legally as in the present Bill.  The only difference will be that there will be one board which will be responsible for both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> All of the people who are on either of the existing boards will be represented on this new joint board, which will meet one day as the board of the institute and another day as the board of the comhairle. The board will have a full-time chairman who will obviously be chairman of both boards.  Therefore at policy level, but not at executive level, there would be one body responsible for making policies centrally.  The execution of policy will be carried out by separate agencies which will continue to have a separate identity.</P>
    <P>In my view that is basically what the previous Minister wanted to achieve and it is probably what the present Minister would like to achieve.  I believe that this amendment achieves a degree of common ground in this controversy.  The main objection to the amalgamation of the Agricultural Institute in the larger authority which was proposed previously was from the staff, who feared difficulties in relation to their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> independence, salary and so on. The staff of both bodies objected, as most staff would do.  One can argue whether they were right or wrong, but staff in any institution tend to look at things from their own point of view, and why should they not?  We all do that in our lives.</P>
    <P>The amendment will meet the case of the staff because the institute will continue to exist and in so far as staff matters are concerned and so far as independence&mdash;independence from day to day interference&mdash;and the execution of policies are concerned, the institute will be independent.  However, in regard to the setting of policies there will be one body for both advice and education and in this way we will have achieved a compromise which is realistic, valid and sensible between strongly-held points of view on both sides in this debate, a compromise which gives something to everyone concerned and which is the best possible compromise.</P>
    <P>I would outline quickly precisely who would be on this joint board, which would be slightly larger than the board proposed in the Bill because it must encompass those who are already on the <Col N="255" /> board of the Agricultural Institute and who are not on the comhairle board as proposed.  The board we envisage would consist of 22 members and a chairman who would be full time.  Of these members, seven would be nominated by the agricultural rural organisations and one would be nominated by each of the following: the Governing Body of UCD, the Governing Body of UCC, the Governing Body of UCG and the Board of Trinity College.  There would also be one member nominated by the Minister for Education, one by the Minister for Agriculture, one by the staff of the comhairle, one by the staff of the institute and one by the Irish Veterinary Association. The latter is a new proposal because we are proposing in our other amendments to give this body responsibility in the area of preventive medicine, and if they are to have that responsibility we suggest representation from the Irish Veterinary Association who have the experience and the competence in the veterinary area that nobody else has.  We propose that two members would be nominated by the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  This is an improvement so far as the county committees are concerned. We propose that the remaining members would be representative of the bodies concerned in providing education in the sphere of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The board would have the same rules of procedure as those which apply to the present Agricultural Institute and as set out in the Schedule to the 1958 Act. Detailed provision is made in the amendment for staff representatives from both the institute and the comhairle.  The final provision is that the chairman shall act as chairman both of the council of the institute and of the board and shall hold office on such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions proposed in this amendment could work provided there is the will to make them work.  It is perfectly feasible for policy to be unified in one body and for execution to be separated into two bodies, namely, the institute and the comhairle.  The Minister <Col N="256" /> has gone a little way towards recognising our position because he is proposing that some members from the board of the institute be on the board of the comhairle and that some members from the board of the comhairle be on the board of the institute.  Therefore, he is accepting that co-ordination at board level is the appropriate place to have co-ordination, because it is at board level that policy is determined.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not saying that the boards must be entirely different and separate.  This amendment is merely going a step further and proposing that the people of both boards meet in one room with one chairman to discuss advice and educational research but that the execution of the recommendations and decisions be left to separate institutions.  In that way we should have the best of both worlds.  We should have the independence in respect of research that the Minister requires so much&mdash;I have not attacked him for his convictions in this regard&mdash;and we would have also co-ordination at policy level.  This is important in the national interest.  I trust that the Minister will consider the amendment sympathetically in the light of the arguments I have put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether we should take them separately.  Basically, No. 23 concerns a different principle.  It may relate to the board but it involves an entirely different issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Bruton for having said towards the end of his rather long address on this amendment that he did not wish to rehash the pros and cons of the argument about the <Col N="257" /> different functions of research on the one hand and training on the other.  We have gone through that argument <i>ad naseum</i> not only during the Second Stage debate but during discussion of the predecessor of this Bill.  The amendment seeks to resurrect the controversy enshrined in that other Act in proposing to create an almost absurd situation.  Can one imagine a board, in conformity with this amendment, going on a Monday morning to An Foras Talúntais wearing a Foras Talúntais hat and discussing the business of An Foras Talúntais from, presumably, the foras point of view and then trooping in on the afternoon of the same day or perhaps the following day to the AnCOT headquarters, wearing a different hat and discussing matters from the point of view of training and advice?  This proposition is so grotesque that I do not think anybody else would entertain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what Deputy Bruton has just said, the amendment contains the basic thinking that was enshrined in section 10 of the last Bill, that was, that An Foras Talúntais be abolished.  It enshrines the idea of the abolition of the concept of research. That is something I would not be prepared to agree to and, consequently, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene again on this Bill.  In making the case for his amendment, Deputy Bruton said that perhaps this amendment might not be acceptable to me, that it might not be going far enough.  The Deputy is right in that assumption. Nothing short of the full amalgamation and full integration we have provided for in the last legislation would satisfy me. However, I accept the amendment as a very sincere attempt to undo some of the damage being done by the Minister in relation to the segregation of the services concerned.  He isolated the Agricultural Institute from the areas of advice and education.  In that way he has gone in the opposite direction to what every other enlightened country is doing.  As <Col N="258" /> evidence of this I suggest that the Minister have regard to what has been done in the USA since the National Agricultural Authority Act was passed here.  I would ask the Minister to look at what has been done in Scotland.  Since our Act went through this House I came across references to this in two magazines.  One was the June-July issue of the American magazine <i>Crops and Soil</i> which contained the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>A new set of initials face you for the first time in our pages in this issue. Those letters are SEA which stand for the Science and Education Administration, created earlier this year within the US Department of Agriculture.  The new agency is made up of the old National Agricultural Library (NAL), and three agencies, the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the Co-operative State Research Service (CSRS), and the Extension Service (ES).  The merger of the three agencies and the library became official on January 24, 1978.</P>
      <P>That is what the Americans think should be done.</P>
      <P>I was glad to see that the Minister visited Scotland since taking office and I am sure he was as impressed by the set-up there as I was when I paid a similar visit.  The Arkleton Trust made the following statement in 1978:</P>
      <P>One of the most favourable features of agricultural training in Scotland lies in the characteristics of our three Colleges of Agriculture.  Their peculiar strength, not now found very often elsewhere, is that they combine research, teaching and advisory roles. Thus the college lecturer is kept in touch with current farming realities, the farmer has a better opportunity to be told of the most recent trends and innovations, and the student benefits from both these aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment Deputy Bruton is trying to get as close as possible to this but the Minister is not prepared to admit that he was wrong.  The previous legislation was an attempt to provide a fully comprehensive service in order to get the best value for money spent and to use <Col N="259" /> the various centres throughout the country to do a better job for farmers. This amendment seeks to undo some of the damage which has been done by having a single board who will be responsible and will administer the affairs of the three organisations.  If they are not to be together, it is important that one section should know what the other is doing.  It is an attempt to break down barriers which have been reerected. Those barriers have existed for far too long.  In the previous Act, not only were we bringing together education, research and advisory work but we were providing for their development.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that two years later we find ourselves arguing in this House about legislation which should never have been introduced.  Deputy Bruton is a far more patient and tolerant man than I could be and I admire him for this.  Of course, he was not involved to the same extent as I was because I put a lot of thought and work into the attempt to provide a fully integrated service which could provide all that any farm would need.  There has been disruption during the past two years and nothing has been done.  I support the amendment because it is an attempt to get closer to the position we felt we had reached with the National Agricultural Authority.  Such a position is badly needed and anything which inhibits the coming together of these three agencies is doing a serious disservice to agriculture.  It would be an improvement if we had one board responsible for all the services.  The Minister speaks about the work of An Foras Talúntais and then speaks about education and advisory services as if these things were unrelated. It is important that they should be closely related and working together.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a salvage attempt and even at this late stage I hope the Minister will go this far in trying to get these services to work together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the plea of compromise this amendment puts before the Minister.  We must be rather disappointed at the Minister's attitude during his short reply.  This amendment is carefully thought out and <Col N="260" /> is a definite attempt to reach a compromise with the Minister's ideas, while attempting to integrate the research and advisory services.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the cost to the taxpayer and the Minister did not see fit to mention that in his reply.  According to the latest report of An Foras Talúntais, expenditure was in the region of £8 million and the Minister must justify this to the taxpayer.  The cost of the advisory service of the county committees of agriculture is in the region of £6.8 million.  The Minister did not think it worth while to say how he justifies separating these two boards while justifying the cost to the taxpayer, nor did he say how to achieve the greatest growth in agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that the research work of the Agricultural Institute should be carried out in the country and this cannot be done without the co-operation of the agricultural advisers.  Is it the Minister's intention that the Agricultural Institute should continue to carry out research entirely within their own premises?  I would bring to the attention of the Minister the amount of research already being done behind locked doors. We dealt with that on Second Stage.  I do not accept the Minister's argument and believe that the two people he intends to have on each board will not help to integrate the services.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not take the opportunity of replying to the contributions of Deputies Clinton and D'Arcy.  One point he made in the course of his argument against my amendment was that he thought it would be silly to have people meeting on Monday as the board of the institute and to have them meeting on Tuesday as the board of the comhairle.  As Deputy Clinton said, agricultural advice, research and education are allied subjects and there is nothing silly about the same people being involved in the policy-making of both boards.  In response to questions in this House the Minister might be dealing with advice one day and with research the next day.  If there is nothing absurd about the Minister doing that, why should it be absurd for a board to have responsibility for a variety of subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He suggested that they might have to go home after one meeting and return the following day for a different meeting. The Minister is suggesting that the members of these boards would be lacking in ingenuity.  It would be possible for them to hold a meeting on the same day in the same place, the first part of which could be devoted to the business of the institute and the second part to the business of the comhairle.  If there was any jealousy, they could alternate the venue.  The Minister seemed to suggest that there was a practical objection to the amendment.  I think we should dispense with that non-argument.  The real issue is that the Minister is not prepared to listen to any argument.  He will brook no argument other than the holy tablets of stone which he is handing down in regard to this matter.  That is bad politics.  This amendment is a serious attempt to reach a compromise on an issue which is dividing agriculture.  That sort of division only leads to controversy and <Col N="262" /> lobbying and is not good for agriculture. This amendment seeks to put an end to the controversy and to satisfy everyone. I am surprised that the Minister cannot do better as he is known for his ingenuity in these matters.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 is a more controversial amendment.  It reads:</P>
    <P>In page 6, before section 14, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>The annual estimate of expenses of An Chomhairle and the Institute referred to in section 44 of the 1976 Act and section 12 of the 1958 Act, shall not be submitted to the Minister without the approval of the members of the Board and of the Council of the Institute referred to in section 11 (3) (a).</P>
    <P>The members of the board referred to in section 11 (3) (a) are seven persons nominated by such agricultural and rural organisations in such manner as shall be determined by the Government. The effect of this amendment, which was inserted since the budget, was to give the farming representatives a veto on the expenses of the comhairle and the institute. This amendment was put in because the Government proposed a levy to finance agricultural advice, education and research on farm products.  If the farmers were going to pay the cost, it is our view that they and they alone should determine what is to be done.  The purpose of this amendment is to give them control over the finances of the institute and of the comhairle.  We would not be proposing it if there was no levy.  Such a veto would not be justified if the money was provided by the State.  As the present position in regard to the levy is uncertain, we do not know whether this amendment is appropriate.  We have been told that the levy is not being introduced immediately and that negotiations are taking place on farmers' taxation. We have been told that there will be no levy if agreement is reached.  If agreement is not reached before 1 May there will be no levy.  I am not going to become involved in the issues concerned in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Chair has already ruled.  I have allowed the Deputy to mention it, but we are not <Col N="263" /> going to debate taxation and the methods of raising it on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling, but the Government have said that if the levy is introduced it will be used to finance agricultural advice, research and education.  The reason given for the introduction of this levy was to save the State the money that it is now spending on these and transfer them to the farmers.  If the farmers are going to pay, the farmers should have the say as to what money is to be paid and where it goes.  If they are not going to have to pay, this amendment is not relevant.  We are hoping that the Minister will give some indication of the position so that we will know whether the amendment is relevant.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the House is otherwise put in a very difficult position. We are being asked to discuss a Bill in order to provide for services without knowing how and by whom these services are to be financed.  We are discussing the Bill because the House has responsibility for the financial resources of any State-sponsored body.  The reason primarily that the Bill has come before the House&mdash;apart from detailed arrangements about who is on boards and so forth&mdash;is that authority will be created by the Bill for the issues of moneys.  How one can discuss this Bill without knowing whether these matters are to be paid for by a levy on farmers or by general taxation is difficult to understand, yet we are being asked to decide on this Bill and on this amendment without knowing what is going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced we reviewed the position at that stage. There was no talk of a levy then.  We passed Second Stage of the Bill as a measure that was going to be financed primarily&mdash;not exclusively&mdash;by the Exchequer. However, when this Bill reached Committee Stage there was a radical change in the position and by then the proposal was that it would be paid for entirely by the farmers through a 2 per cent levy on their sale of products.  This rendered the Second Stage debate irrelevant because it had <Col N="264" /> been carried out on different premises. That was when Committee Stage started.  Now we are half-way through Committee Stage and we have not yet got as far as that in the Bill.  Even when Committee Stage started there had been another change in the position and the whole matter was thrown into the cauldron again.  We are told maybe it will be paid by a levy and may be it will not.  I am sure the Chair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  One cannot decide on the amendment without knowing how these institutes, the research, advice and education service, are to be paid for.  I have said that the amendment would not be relevant and would not be moved if we had a firm assurance that there would be no levy from farmers to be used for paying for these services.  We would not be interested in the amendment if that were the case.  There is a strong possibility that there may be a levy.  There is no guarantee that there will not be a levy, because the Government have said that this is part of their policy, it is a contingency they are prepared to use, and they are prepared to impose it straight away without consultation with anybody, and their minds were subsequently changed by&mdash;the Minister will tell us what their minds were changed by.  It is not for me to speculate how the Minister's mind works on this issue, but work it did, belatedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may well have another change before Committee Stage is over, another change before Report Stage is reached, and yet another change before we get the <Col N="265" /> Bill into the Seanad, and maybe the debate we are having now will be rendered completely irrelevant by something that will happen next week, the week after or in May or June, perhaps on 9 June or some other appropriate day when we have safely run for cover.</P>

If they are coming from the Exchequer the amendment does not arise, and I would not press it if we knew that for sure, but we do not.  On the other hand, if the position is to be as it was when Committee Stage commenced, that the expenses are to be paid for by the levy, then the amendment is essential. If the farmers are going to pay they must have the final say.  I hope the Minister will clarify that and that we will know whether this amendment is necessary. If we have a firm statement from the Minister that there will be no levy, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will tell you, Sir, what I am interested in.  I am interested in ensuring that if the farmers will have to pay for this service they will have control over how the money is spent.  One can only know whether or not they need to have control over how the money is spent if one knows whether or not they are going to have to pay for it; that is simple logic.  I shall outline the position here as I see the amendment.  The way the amendment would work in the event of the farmers having to pay for the services would be that the board as a whole would prepare the estimate and they would do so in consultation with their staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Estimates in so far as the expenses of the comhairle and the institute are concerned. The initial expense estimates for their expenditure are prepared&mdash;if I am not mistaken&mdash;by those bodies, by the institute and the comhairle.  They are then submitted to the Department sometime earlier in the previous year. Then they are submitted to the Department of Finance and the Government as part of the Department's Estimates.  But the original estimates of the bodies themselves would be and are prepared initially by themselves.  That is a fact and if the Minister does not know that he should not intervene to try to contradict me.  Of course the position is that, for instance, if the board were to agree to double the expenditure of the comhairle in a given year, if those expenses were being met by some form of charge on farmers obviously that would have the effect of doubling the charges the farmers would have to bear.  That would be grossly unfair, without giving the final say in the <Col N="269" /> matter to the farmers who are going to pay.</P>
      <P>What we are proposing is that if the board does propose to double the amount of money to be allocated to advice, education and research&mdash;and thereby double the levy that would have to be raised&mdash;the people who will be using these services and who will have to pay for them, namely, the farmers, should have a veto on any such proposal.  The amendment here would mean that the whole board would draw up the estimates.  If in the view of the farming representatives those estimates were too high they could veto them, they could come back and say: no, you must go back and prepare lower estimates because we do not want to have an increased levy resulting from your decision in this matter.  If there is to be a levy that is a very reasonable amendment.  I hope to God there is no levy.  It would be a very bad policy for the country if there were.  But, if there is, that is why the amendment is necessary and I should like the Minister to deal with the points I have raised.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some explanation from the Minister about the way this section will work.  Does he consider that a full-time chairman is appropriate for a board of this sort?  How much time does he expect the chairman to spend on the job?  It is appropriate in an agency of this sort that the chairman be full time.  As far as I know, the ESB are the only semi-State body where the chairman is full time.  I feel there is a strong case for appointing a full-time chairman who will be responsible to the board in relation to policy.  There is a danger that boards become so absorbed in the execution of policy that the overall public interest will not be given the time it should get.  The people directly involved, whose head is the managing director, are full-time people committed to the institutional existence of the body and have not the wider responsibilities which the chairman and the members of the board have.  They spend much more time on the job and have far more information about what is going on.  They are in a position to blind the chairman of the board with science and can get him and the members to agree to anything. Members of the board may be coming to meetings once or twice a month and they get documents which they read at home at night after their day's work, documents which they cannot absorb very fully.  The chairman may spend a few extra days in the office but it is usually only to sign documents.  No member of the board is in a position to grasp fully all the issues involved because he is not spending enough time in the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case for having a full-time chairman on a body such as this.  I do not mean some person seconded from the public service to be a full-time <Col N="273" /> chairman.  I mean somebody coming in from outside who will become a full-time chairman and who will have responsibility to the board in his capacity as chairman.  I know that the ESB are a different body from this and possibly there is a better case for having a full-time chairman there than there is in relation to this board.  The Minister should at least consider this matter.  He may have good arguments against this.</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (b) there is a new provision that in the case of the board of the comhairle two of the members shall be members of the council of the institute.  There is a similar provision that two of the members of the institute board shall be members of the board of the comhairle.  How will those people be selected?  Will two people be members of both boards or will there be four people involved?</P>
    <P>In relation to paragraph (c), the Minister is deleting all representation of the universities from the board of the comhairle.  I do not know if that is wise. The universities are responsible for the training of the officers of practically all the advisory services.  The people universities usually put on boards have a very good general view of what is needed in the particular field.  They are useful additions to any board.  The board, in relation to their responsibilities for education, will want to know what is going on in the universities.  If they are setting up a course in some aspect of agricultural education it would be very useful for them to have information as to whether or not a similar course was being run in one of the universities or what has been their experience in relation to running such a course for graduates, farmers or farmers' sons.  The experience of the universities in the educational field would be of great value to a body like the comhairle, which will be responsible for agricultural education.</P>
    <P>I know the comhairle will be able to get this information by sending memos to the universities, but they will only get back a memo which will probably not answer all their questions.  If the comhairle had a member who was full time involved in the university he would have the information and this would save a lot of bother writing to the university seeking <Col N="274" /> advice.  Such a person would be able to tell them what was going on in the universities. There is a strong case for retaining the universities on the board of the comhairle.</P>
    <P>There is another point in this section which I find objectionable, that is, that the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture will only get &ldquo;at least one member&rdquo;.  When a Bill says &ldquo;at least one member&rdquo; that is all such a board get.  I believe there is a case for giving a larger representation to the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  The Minister knows that there are men on those county committees who have good practical experience in agriculture and they have been elected by the public.  If one is elected by the public one has to acquire a knowledge of what the public are interested in.  One needs to have on a board of this sort somebody who represents the public and has had to have his representation of the public validated by having stood for election and been successful.  Having only one representative of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture is a bad day's work.  There should be two or three at least, particularly in view of the fact that this legislation will diminish the functions of the county committees so far as advice is concerned.  It would have been sensible to have given a <i>quid pro quo</i> in this regard by giving larger representation to the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister will provide by order the means whereby the staff of the comhairle and the institute providing courses for study shall be elected to the board. What has the Minister in mind in this order?  I know it is not ready yet and that the Minister could tell us to wait and see, but if the Minister is asking us to give him power to make the order he should give us some idea how he will go about the staff representation problem. Will it be by an election of all the staff under a proportional representation system, as in general elections, where everybody's voice would be equal, will a system of electoral colleges be used, or will the unions have some determining say as to how the election should take place?</P>
    <P>I note also that representation will be <Col N="275" /> provided for by order in relation to insituations providing courses of study in agriculture, as in section 12 (1) (d) of the original Bill.  What institutions are involved? Could the Minister give us a list of the institutions that will have a vote and say how they will vote?  Will it be a vote of all the staff involved or just a vote of the headmasters, or is there some representative organ in agricultural colleges which will do this election?  If so, what is the name of this body?  We are entitled to this information before we agree to the order.  I know the Minister will not be able to give precise details, but he should be able to give a general outline of the principles on which he will approach this system of election.</P>
    <P>In relation to the procedure of filling casual vacancies, how are casual vacancies filled on the Agricultural Institute board at the moment and does the Minister intend to follow the same procedure?  If the Minister intends to do that, there is no dispute; but if he does not know what he intends to do, we will have to insist in getting some information. So far as the institute are concerned the procedures for filling casual vacancies are set out in the Schedule of the 1958 Act in paragraph 5, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P> 5.  (1)  A casual vacancy occurring among the ordinary members of the Council shall be filled by appointment by the Government and, where the vacancy occurs among the members nominated under subsection (8) or subsection (9) of section 5 of this Act, the appointment shall be of a person nominated by the organisation or body which nominated the member occasioning the vacancy.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person appointed under this paragraph shall hold office for the remainder of his predecessor's term. </P>
    <P>In the 1958 Act precise details are given as to the way in which casual vacancies will be filled.  Those details could have been discussed openly in the House.  The House had something definite before it. In this, the lazy way out is being taken by saying that they will be filled by order.  We are not being told how it will be done by order and we are being <Col N="276" /> denied an opportunity to discuss it.  It is not an issue likely to cause a great deal of controversy, but at the same time I am puzzled that the Minister, with this model from the Schedule of the 1958 Act available to him, failed to include that in this legislation.  The Minister could have put that in instead of going about it in this mysterious way of doing it by order.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I know this was not done by my predecessor either, but it should have been done as it was done in the 1958 Act.  I am sure Deputy Clinton does not mind criticism.  He can take and answer criticism in a reasonable fashion, unlike his successor who seems to run for cover whenever criticism is voiced and satisfies himself with silence.  I do not wish to provoke the Minister into further silence and I hope he will answer the points I made on the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This section says that there will be at least one representative from the county committees of agriculture.  That is farcical, having regard to the various types of farming carried on.  There should be representation on this board from the different sectors of farming.  Representatives should come from the committees of agriculture.  As I see it, it is more than likely that there will be only one representative from the general council. Their representative could be a person with an interest in grain growing who would have no knowledge of or interest in beef.  More than one representative is necessary.  I know that there is provision for more than one representative if deemed necessary, but because one is specifically mentioned I imagine that it will only be one.  There should be at least four representatives from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. Because of the variety of interests, the variety of areas and the different types <Col N="277" /> of farming, it is vital to have more than one.  The political reality is that the one appointed has a political ideology.  That would be a pity.  We might not be able to define it exactly in areas, but there could be one from the grain-growing sector, and one from the beef sector, that kind of representation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Practical men who would know what they were doing, and would be able to talk about the various aspects of agriculture better than one person from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  I know there can be more than one under the Bill, because it provides for at least one.  The general experience is that if a Bill provides for at least one we will have one.  The Bill is not clear on what kind of representation the staff will have on this board.  Maybe it is clear but it is not clear to me.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is included in a conglomeration of other things.  We are setting up a State body.  The Minister says the worker participation Act did not cover this kind of organisation.  That may well be, but we should consider it as a basis for the representation.  That would mean one-third of the board would be composed of people from the workforce.  In this instance, they would be the advisory people who would have a lot of knowledge and would be capable people to have on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to spell out what representation we will have from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  It is necessary to spell out what representation the employees of the board will have.  It is necessary to know exactly from what areas the representation will come.  Various agricultural interests are mentioned.  That is very indefinite. We want to know what kind of rural organisations we are talking about and who will decide who will have the representation.  Will the Minister pick out certain organisations?  Will they rotate?  I do not know.  The manner in <Col N="278" /> which the board will operate seems very inconclusive to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any necessity to introduce this into the Bill any more than Deputy Clinton did a couple of years ago.  I see a difficulty in having a person as chairman of this very important and practical board who by accepting a full-time post as chairman of the comhairle would <i>ipso facto</i> cease to come from the farming world.  He would be a <i>functionnaire</i>, as they say in the European Community, and not a person from the farming world.  In the divorce of his mind from the practical men about whom Deputy Bermingham and Deputy Bruton spoke so approvingly, he would begin the process of ceasing to be, if he ever had been, a practical producer.  It is important that he should be a practical producer and that he should not be selected for any reason other than his excellence as a suitable person to chair this important board.  I accept Deputy Bermingham's contention that he should not be picked for his political allegiance.  I fully subscribe to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to ensure that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to ascertain what the man's political allegiance is.  Nor do I wish to deny any political allegiance he may have.  If you introduce a merely party political basis into the formulation of a board as important as this board, you begin to destroy it.  There will be certain fields in which the political allegiance of the people is a self-confessed fact and, being self-confessed, it has a certain honesty of its own.  To take exception to that is to take exception to the people involved having a political allegiance and declaring it openly.  I see nothing wrong with that, but it is important <Col N="279" /> that selections made are not made for the advantage of the Government party or any other party.  Governments change, as we have seen in recent years, and may well change again after the lapse of a long period, such as 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not take from the validity of the whole argument. I am not attracted to the idea of a permanent chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I see no reason for departing from the present concept of what the chairman's duties ought to be and the manner of their performance. I regret that in the past we have not seen a selection made on purely objective grounds.  I would be very anxious that the person selected would have a high degree of competence and that, if at all possible, he would come from the producer sector of farming.  In that I include farming itself, farm processing, farm manufacture, and so on.  There should be representation on the board from what is now our enormous food-processing industry to ensure that the proper evolution of our advisory and training services will take full cognisance of that interest within the industry itself.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a rather small board.  The former board consisted of 23 people and the chairman.  This board will consist of 15 people and the chairman. There is a reduction in numbers proportionate to the reduction in the number of functions being performed.  The research council will be removed from the concept of the NAAERA Bill.  If you begin to talk, as Deputy Bruton does, about increased representation for the general council or for the universities&mdash;and his amendment envisages the appointment to the board of four people from the universities, one from each of the constituent colleges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="280" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not propose that. That was in the context of my other amendment which has been defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the requirement of a university presence on the board would be met by the presence on the ground on the AFT board of university representation.  I would prefer to see the comhairle keeping to its adjusted purpose and that is becoming a work-a-day businesslike organisation since there is no academic content in their activities. Certainly the young men coming in as advisers are the product of our universities but within their own work I do not see any reason for the inclusion of universities on the board of the comhairle and I would not like to see a competitive spirit developing as to who should be represented and at whose expense.  There are a given number of seats to fill and the task of any Minister formulating this Bill is to ensure that we get the optimum kind of board which will carry out its job in the best possible manner.  This cannot be done by staffing it with one kind of organisation rather than another.  Obviously the organisations must be connected with the production and processing of food, because that is what the industry itself is concerned with.  The inclusion of staff which Deputy Bermingham recommends again must be made to the exclusion of some of the producer interests and I am not aware of any strong belief that the presence of that representation would in any way enhance the board itself.  It might create a situation which would be less than satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, and having regard to the reductions in the number of tasks which are to be undertaken by the comhairle, the differences between this Bill and the 1976 Bill are minimal.  There will be some changes in that I would possibly include the intention to give the processing industry&mdash;the co-operative interest&mdash;representation on the board. This is of the greatest importance because there is wide acceptance of the fact that agricultural efforts in the future, including advisory work and training work, will have to be related more to a particular production objective as it has not been in the past.  In that regard I <Col N="281" /> would like to see the inclusion of the General Council on the board and this has been mentioned.  I would like to see this happen in the way that the Waterford Committee of Agriculture worked out a highly satisfactory collaboration with the Waterford County Co-operative in the provision of a specialist advisory staff to Waterford Co-operative through the committee of agriculture.  That seems to me to be an eminently sensible arrangement which might well be copied in arrangements to be made in the future under the tutelage of the comhairle.  In that way totally unnecessary frictions will be avoided.  I consider that the presence of a co-operative interest on the board would be a constructive and progressive development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton inquired about the filling of casual vacancies.  As the AFT Act outlines the Government makes the appointment after consultation with the group who suffered the casualty.  The usual practice is for the Government to go to the body who has suffered the casualty and to ask for the names of one or two possible candidates for the vacancy.  That is the accepted procedure. In the case of An Foras Talúntais I am not sure whether this procedure has had to be followed or not but it is well to recognise a certain procedure if this situation does arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will probably follow it in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason why it should not be followed.  The information I have given is as precise as the directions given in the preceding Act and to give any more details at this stage of the precise formulation of the board would be to inhibit to some degree the freedom of the organisations.  It is up to them to put up the people they consider best and most suitable for membership of the board.  I think that for the industry itself the shedding of this idiotic party allegiance would be a good thing.  It behoves political parties with enough gumption and confidence in themselves to eschew this kind of attitude.  It is not of any assistance at all either to the parties <Col N="282" /> themselves or to the organisations that they are providing for.  Most political credit will accrue to the people who do the best thing and it falls to me as Minister, within the limits set out in this section, to procure the best board possible for the industry itself and that is my intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section of the Bill concerning the constitution of the boards themselves.  The Minister, in answer to Deputy Bruton on the question of the chairman, stated that a decision is based on the excellence of the individual.  I accept that but I wonder about the advisability of having a whole-time chairman.  There is a whole-time chairman on the Dublin District Milk Board and he is chairman of two boards, Dublin and Cork; he has another function which he carries out on behalf of the Department as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very highly specialised position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree there.  I served on this board for some time.  They have a chief executive and a full staff. The position of chairman is not highly specialised and it could not be described as such.  Is the Minister prepared to consider at this stage the concept of one chairman for both boards who could be a whole-time chairman.  This has not been mentioned yet but I think it would have terrific advantages.</P>
      <P>I wish to move to an area which Deputy Bruton mentioned and which the Minister did not reply to.  Are there two members of each board who are members of the other board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two members involved.  Two members of the comhairle serve on the AFT Board and two members of the AFT Board serve on the other board.  It does not have to be the same two people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore it need not necessarily be just two.  I would ask the Minister to consider the question of the chairman.  The Minister may say that the fact that the chairman is full time means that he will lose touch with reality; but if <Col N="283" /> his function were to be that he would serve as chairman of both boards he would be at a tremendous advantage in that he would know what was happening both in the areas of research and of advice. Consequently, he would be able to co-ordinate the efforts from both sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is academic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that. What we are attempting to do is to bring about a co-ordination of the efforts of both boards.  To that end we have explored every avenue possible but we have been turned down by the Minister in each instance.  At least he might give this proposition some consideration.  I am sure that the Department have evidence of people who have served in dual capacities on two boards to the advantage of the boards concerned and also to the advantage of the chairman concerned.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed, as I was disappointed also at the time of the last Bill, with the representation proposed for county committees of agriculture.  The Minister has stated that this representation shall not be less than one but it is not possible to have less than one.  I disagreed with the previous Minister, Deputy Clinton, in regard to the representation he provided for in respect of these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the House then but I disagreed privately with the then Minister on this issue.  There are 27 county committees of agriculture but the representation proposed for them is a scant recognition of the services provided by them on a voluntary basis down through the years.  What is the reason for removing from these people the small bit of democratic process exercised by them, by their going first to the county councils, then to these committees and then to this board?</P>

Is not the development and growth in <Col N="285" /> agriculture due mainly to the work of these committees so far as most counties are concerned?  I am prepared to accept that in some counties the committees have not the slightest interest in agriculture, but by and large the greater number of the county committees of agriculture have done an excellent job in promoting growth in agriculture and in the expansion of the services generally. There are education centres in almost every county.  I am not familiar with the level of activity of some of these committees in the west but they have never got any encouragement.  Neither have the farmers nor the public representatives got any encouragement in those areas. In addition, they have the problem of bad land.</P>

      <P>Having served with me for such a long time in that county, the Chair will understand what I am talking about.  Another point is that there are numerous farmer organisations throughout the country and, while the previous legislation did not specify exactly who was to have representation on the board, perhaps the Minister can give us some indication of the organisations he has in mind in this regard and of the representation he intends giving to each. There is bound to be much jealousy in respect of who is represented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he is not inclined to increase the representation of members of the county committees of agriculture.  This is not exactly the point of view he took when the other legislation was going through the House. On 23 March 1977 the Minister, who was then spokesman on agriculture for his party, said, as reported at column 207 of the Official Report for that day:</P>
      <P>I may have misunderstood my informant when he said that the Minister, when he met a deputation from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, said that this section was capable of amendment and that he would not object to an amendment if one were put down.  If the Minister is of such an opinion I suggest that he make an amendment himself or, at any rate, if this party make such an amendment that he would look favourably on it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, at that time he was considering an amendment to increase the representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That was fairly mild stuff.  I am capable of being more trenchant than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Minister is still of the opinion that this representation should be increased.  His remarks on the date I have referred to were followed by remarks from Deputy Callanan, Deputy Noonan, Deputy Hussey and others who made eloquent pleas for increases in representation for the county committees of agriculture.  I do not know what has happened in the Minister's mind since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find that I have been fairly consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was being very cute.  He referred to the possibility of the then Minister introducing an amendment and suggested that if Fianna Fáil were to introduce one the Minister would look on it favourably.  That suggests that Deputy Gibbons wished to increase the representation but did not actually <Col N="287" /> propose an amendment to this effect. He seemed then to be in favour of increasing the representation of public representatives, which he does not now favour.</P>
      <P>In regard to nominations by the staff, I asked what electoral system would be in use and who would be entitled to vote. I also asked about the representation of institutions providing courses of study in agriculture.  I asked what institutions would be represented and how their representatives would be elected.  I think the Minister is reproducing parts of a section which existed in the 1978 Act but it is not clear exactly how these institutions are to be selected and I would ask the Minister to give us that precise information.</P>
      <P>The Minister criticised my suggestion that the universities should be represented.  I suggested four such representatives in relation to the earlier amendment to constitute a board which would be responsible for research, advice and education.  We are now talking about a much narrower board and in that context I would be satisfied with one university representative.  There is a case for such a representative and the Minister has not answered it.  The board and the universities are dealing with agricultural education, one in relation to students and the other in relation to student farmers.  A university representative would provide a practical means of liaison between the two bodies concerned in education.  This would mean enlarging the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those referred to in the Bill, which I take it the Minister has read.</P>
      <P>The table to section 11 states:</P>
      <P>...The remaining members, who shall be representative of agricultural and rural organisations, the staff of An Chomhairle, institutions providing courses of study in agriculture mentioned in section 12 (1) (d) and such other agricultural interests as may be prescribed, shall be selected for nomination in accordance with the provisions of an order made for that purpose by the Minister and any such order shall indicate the procedure for filling casual vacancies in the membership of the board.</P>
      <P>How are the representatives of the staff of An Chomhairle to be selected?  What method of election is to be used?  The Minister is to make provision for that in an order.  What educational institutions are to be included and how will they be entitled to vote?  I am not referring to the farmers' organisations but to the staff and the agricultural colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner of selection will be set out in the order bringing this section into operation and until then it is unnecessary for me to inhibit myself in any way in the preparation of that order.  I do not wish to accept any confines except the one I have spoken of&mdash;the anxiety I feel to use all available means to get the best possible board to carry out this important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest.  The Minister should at least answer reasonable questions on this issue.  The Minister is making a nonsense of this House if he will not answer.  He is saying that the staff are to have representation and he will make an order providing for that.  They will be selected for nomination in accordance with the provisions of an order made for that purpose.  Why <Col N="289" /> will the Minister not tell us his intentions? I am not asking that he should insert provisions in the Bill which would tie him up in regard to the exact procedures for nomination.</P>
      <P>He is asking us to give him power to make an order to provide for the representation of staff and the representation of institutions providing courses of study in agriculture.  In the case of the staff, he will not tell us how they are to elect representatives.  Will this be done by a vote of all staff or will there be a selection by their union?  Will people involved in a clerical capacity have a vote or will it be confined to the advisers?  In my opinion every member of staff should be involved and there should not be discrimination between those who have degrees and those who have not. Everybody who is employed, whether typists or cleaners, should be entitled to vote in the election.  The Minister will not tell how this election will be carried out.</P>
      <P>When we said that the order should come before this House the Minister said it was ridiculous to suggest that such an order should need the approval of the House.  Now we see that the Minister is not prepared to tell the House what arrangement he will make in relation to one of the matters to be provided for in the order.  He does not want us to discuss this later and he will not let us discuss it now.  We are to be denied an opportunity of discussing this matter unless we are prepared to reject the order outright and put down a motion to annul it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see what number the Government can muster later on. The Minister should give us the information we are seeking.  It is intended to provide representation for institutions providing courses of study in agriculture.  What institutions has the Minister in mind?  Does it include all the agricultural colleges or other institutions as well?  How will they be selected?  How many votes will be given to each one?  If, for instance, Ballyhaise Agricultural College has twice as many students as <Col N="290" /> some other agricultural college, will more votes be given to Ballyhaise?  We should know the answer to that question. We should also have some idea of the institutions that will be included.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to tie himself up by putting all the answers to my questions into the Bill.  I realise that there is a process of consultation and that the Minister wants to keep a reasonably free hand in the matter, but he should at least give this House information as to his present general intentions in this matter.  I suspect that he has not given the matter any thought.  To come in here without having given the matter any thought is making an ass of the House.  I hope the Minister will prove me wrong by answering my question.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton, as is his custom, is talking about a situation that does not exist.  He is talking about a staff that does not exist.  He goes on to suggest that we should determine the means by which they would select representation.  The Deputy went on and on about this matter and a great deal of what he said appeared to be moonshine. When there is a need, as there will be, for staff representation it would not be my intention to intrude into their manner of selection any more than it would be my intention to intrude in the manner of selection used by the farm organisations for their representation, except to exhort them to consider the constitution of the board and to select a member who would be more suitable for that job.</P>

The reality of the situation is that there will be five categories of staff represented by different unions.  How will the Minister decide their representation?

      <P>We seem to be entering into the realm of hypothesis again. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to repeat everything again with the obvious objective of wasting the time of the House.  There is no staff because there is no comhairle.  One of the reasons for that is that Deputies D'Arcy and Bruton persist in wasting the time of the House in silly objections of this kind.  They have asked me how staff representation on the board will be determined.  I have already said that it is not my intention to in-therfere in their selection any more than I would interfere in the selection of farm organisations.  I hope that the representatives elected to the board will be suitable people from the producer <Col N="292" /> organisations and suitable people for the comhairle who are a producer-oriented body.  Deputy Clinton mentioned some people who would be unlikely to be suitable for membership of the board because they are not from a producer organisation or even remotely connected with it.

      <P>I should like to know generally the position in relation to the influence which the Department of the Public Service have on staff numbers and remuneration in bodies such as this. Is it true that they exercise informal control? They may not have formal control under the provisions of the Bill as now amended, but I understand that they exercise continuing supervision of remuneration in bodies such as this.  I would be grateful if the Minister would let us know how this operates and whether the amendment makes much difference, given that the Minister controls the finances anyway and therefore has a very strong say in what the bodies do.  Does the amendment we have just agreed to make much difference in practice?</P>

      <P>I think it does.  The board themselves will assume this function which formerly would have fallen to the Ministers named in the section, the Ministers for Agriculture and the Public Service.  I would have thought that the practical benefits of agreeing with this amendment would be self-evident.  To tie the comhairle as the unamended form would have done would be unnecessary, would limit their function and would concentrate unnecessarily obligations in <Col N="295" /> the hands of the Ministers for Agriculture and the Public Service.  The control of the overall expenditure of both of these bodies, An Foras Talúntais and An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, naturally is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance, but within those contexts the more freedom of operation that the governing boards of the comhairle and the foras have, the better and more freely they will be able to exercise the control over the operation of the staff.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 50 and 51, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(j)  other activities provided for in subparagraph (i) of this section may include the carrying out of research on specific topics as requested by the Minister, cooperating with the Institute in the carrying out of such research jointly and making such enquiries as are necessary to enable it to provide advice to the Minister in accordance with section 10 of the Agriculture (An <Col N="296" /> Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Act, 1979' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This more or less amplifies the power of the comhairle to carry out other activities at the request of the Minister.  The other activities may include the carrying out of research on specific topics as requested by the Minister.  The comhairle are not going to be the research body, but the situation can arise where joint research might be carried out between them and the county committee of agriculture.  In many cases there will be a situation in which research is being carried out on farms where individual farmers are trying out particular methods in consultation with the research agency and reporting on what is being done.  Obviously the person who acts as a link between the private farm where the research is being carried out and the Agricultural Institute is the local adviser.  He is the man who passes the information from the one to the other and keeps an eye on what is happening on the farm.  This would be what I would describe in the amendment as carrying out research jointly&mdash;that the comhairle, represented by the adviser, is involved in some way in the carrying out of the research.  That should be provided for.</P>
    <P>The possibility should exist for the Minister, if he wants, to ask the comhairle to carry out research on some specific subject which he feels they have the expertise to do and which perhaps the institute do not have&mdash;for example, perhaps research in the area of educational methods or extension methods&mdash;when he might want some matter investigated in relation thereto. The institute would not be suitable for that purpose because they do not have people concerned directly with extension or education.  The comhairle would have a substantial staff, all of whom would be concerned with education or extension. If the Minister wanted research carried out on a particular subject relating to education and extension, unless he were to go to the universities the appropriate people to ask would be the comhairle.  It is in that narrow area that the functions of the comhairle should be extended, allowing them in certain circumstances, as and when requested and only when requested <Col N="297" /> by the Minister, to carry out research.</P>
    <P>The amendment is a non-contentious one and might be agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the final analysis this amendment is related to the by now worn-out attempts on the part of the Opposition to resurrect and marry into the new comhairle the research function by all or any means, none of which will succeed any more than they have done in the past.  If this amendment or anything remotely resembling it were to be adopted, then as well as hopelessly confusing and complicating the functions of the different services in regard to research, advice and so on&mdash;as, indeed, did the old Bill: that was what was wrong with it&mdash;it would also hopelessly misunderstand the functions that I would hope An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta would assume in the future: a somewhat improved approach to the general question of research and advice.</P>
      <P>I have referred already under another amendment to the business of having advisory and training work of the staff of the comhairle related to some production objective.  Already we are having working examples in the case of the dairy industry in Avonmore in County Waterford and elsewhere.  These specialist advisory efforts are being quite dramatically successful and would seem to be the way that advisory work in the future ought to go.  The willingness of farmers to participate in an advisory service of this kind by contributions, in some cases per cow in a herd, is a very eloquent testimony of the satisfaction of the participants in this method of specialist advisory work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine to have reference to what is loosely called &ldquo;research&rdquo;.  This is a very loose and inaccurate use of the word &ldquo;research&rdquo;.  I think I know the type of thing the Deputies have in mind: trial cereal plots, the trial fertiliser application in plots and pastures on crops.  This relates more to the opening up of the propagation of certain basic information and may still have an application in that case.  But on the whole the farmer demand for an advisory service now is far <Col N="298" /> more sophisticated than is the provision of what must necessarily be, except in some exceptional cases, a rather primitive little exercise carried on by a man who does not in any way specialise. In the Bill as it stands, without amendment, there is no intention to inhibit in any way this type of what is inaccurately termed in the amendment &ldquo;research&rdquo;, because these things have been done always by advisory officers, by individual farmers, sometimes on a county basis.  Sometimes they are very useful. But to bracket that under the general aegis of the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; is a misnomer and creates unnecessary confusion.</P>
    <P>The business of research itself is a matter for specialists, just as is the matter of increasing pig production, or the matter of augmenting the profitability of pig keeping.  It will become, under AnCOT, a specialist service.  It is not necessarily research, but simply the application of known facts, facts known to modern practice on a general basis.  This is the business of the advisory service&mdash;the propagation of the ideas determined by research.  I would hope that would be done more speedily and accurately by the operation of a growing degree of specialisation.  As it happens the primary movers, as it were, in this type of advisory work are the staffs of committees working in various fields. There are now in the committee structure individual advisers specialising in calf and beef production, in fat lamb production and in nutrition.  They are specialising in various fields.  This is the way it must be.  The concept that seemed to be enshrined at the back of this, the old misconception of the parish agent, the little general practitioner, is essentially an irrelevance here, a nonsense and should be abandoned.  It should be recognised for its shortcomings now, as it needed to be 20 years ago, because it was a basic mistake.  Therefore, the amendment seems to enshrine an understandably historic attitude.  The amendment, in my opinion, is unconstructive and unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say on this amendment and I should like to take issue <Col N="299" /> with him on his views on specialists. Has he taken into consideration the number of farmers who specialise and the number engaged in mixed farming? Is the Minister's view that a farmer involved in three enterprises should have a specialist for each enterprise?  A lot of work remains to be done before we reach the stage the Minister is providing for.  In my view not more than 11 per cent of our farmers specialise.  The Minister dismisses lightly the research work being carried out by agricultural instructors on small plots in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>But it also has an element of research in it.  The greatest benefit that can be got from research is by example, where people can see what is possible within a short distance of their farm.  It is in this area that agricultural research is falling down.  It is all locked up in offices miles from the farms.</P>

      <P>A good research project carried out on a farm will influence farmers within a wide radius of that holding.  Instructors can explain the work involved to local farmers and show the results.  The value of such small trials, which can be described as research, is great.  The Minister should accept the amendment because it will not affect the Bill but it will give advisers a little authority as far as research is concerned.  The Minister has told the House that he will retain this for the Agricultural Institute but will he lose the benefits of the research I have spoken of?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section because it sets out what the comhairle may spend money on.  I would be obliged if the Minister would give us some information about how he envisages the comhairle going about their work in this area and if he intends to amplify in any sense the criteria under which the comhairle must give out the money above and beyond what is contained in the Bill.  The comhairle will have power to give grants to educational institutions but at present such grants are given by the Department.  If a Member feels that not enough is being given to one college while another institution gets too much, such a Member may question that action in a parliamentary question to which the Minister must reply.  If this will in future be a matter for the comhairle will it still be possible for Members to get information from the Minister in relation to such queries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comhairle will now be responsible for local advisory and training programmes, the amount of money to be given to different counties for advisory work.  If the comhairle decides to make a dramatic increase in the allocation to Meath, for example, and a small increase to County Leitrim, will it be possible for a member to ask the reason for such a decision and, if so, will the Minister answer such a question or will he state that this is a matter for the comhairle and decline to answer?  Presuming that public funds will be involved, Members should be in a position to ask questions about such an issue and get replies from the Minister.  While the making and execution of policy may be delegated to the comhairle, Members should be permitted to ask questions about the spending of the public money involved and expect an answer from the Minister.  What is the <Col N="301" /> Minister's interpretation of the likely position in that regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the conditions of section 13 were fairly manifest.  Arising from the Deputy's general remarks, I should like to state that I was astonished at the dichotomy of his approach to this whole affair.  The NAAERA and AnCOT were introduced for the same purpose: to assign to a special body rather than the Department of Agriculture the direction of our research and training programme and to make them responsible to a great degree for the implementation of that programme.  That was sought for decades by farm organisations.  Deputy Bruton seems to be harping back, with some nostalgia, to the days when a Deputy from County Leitrim could ask a question about that county.</P>
      <P>I do not foresee any rule of the House precluding any Member asking any questions he wishes.  One of the hardy annuals here for most Deputies is the tabling of questions in relation to Land Commission matters.  We all know that matters of land division concern the Land Commission which is, or at least used to be, a non-political body.  They carry out their functions totally independently of this House, but that does not preclude any Member seeking information about the operation of the Land Commission and it is customary for representations made through the medium of questions in the House to be conveyed to the Land Commission.  I do not see why that pattern and that conveyance of representations by the appropriate Department to AnCOT should be abandoned or dropped.  It is worth saying that a great many of the questions asked in this House are unnecessary. They are not put down on the Order Paper for the information they ellicit but for the effect they have if they get some mention in the newspapers.  I hope that the time of this House will never be wasted in that way in relation to questions on AnCOT.  If Deputies are so disposed and so willing to waste the time of the House, there is nothing in the rules that I know of to stop them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that the demarcations of <Col N="302" /> section 13 are set out fairly carefully and alphabetically up to the letter (i).  I do not see why there should be any persistence in the view of the Opposition.  There is a dichotomy of approach if Deputy Bruton persists in the idea that eventually Dáil Éireann, through the Minister for Agriculture, will control every little tittle tattle in County Leitrim and every where else.  We are trying to get away from that and get a large measure of independence for this service to give it more freedom to work and to deploy its advisory and specialist staff in the way it best sees fit. There will, of course, be local representation and county representation available to individuals who have problems with the advisory service.  That can be made through their committees of agriculture.  I know of no reason why there is any need to expand on the subject. To do that is to assume the functions which AnCOT will be taking up later on and to pre-designate the course they will take.  I would not want to do that because if we are giving them the independence they wish to have and so tie them up in courses that have been set already, then they do not have any real function at all.</P>
    <P>I believe Deputy Bruton is on very uncertain ground in saying there is some encroachment on the rights of Deputies to ask questions.  I do not believe there is any such encroachment.  If the policy of AnCOT should be determined to any degree in the House, then the functions of the comhairle are frustrated and put at nought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that I was not proposing that there should be any encroachment on the policy-making functions of AnCOT. I was concerned that the traditional rights of Deputies to get information about what was happening from the Minister, who would come in here to the House and answer questions, should not in any way be impaired.  I hope the Minister has said that there will not be any such encroachment because I do not want to see a situation arising whereby in three years' time, if somebody puts down a question about the amount of money being provided for agricultural <Col N="303" /> education in a particular area and whether it is enough or fair, the Minister will come into the House saying he has no function in the matter, that this is a matter for AnCOT.  That is not an answer to the question.  I want to make quite sure that we will not arrive at that type of situation.  Will the Minister assure us that he will be able to give replies to questions of that sort?  Will the Minister answer that question?</P>

The Minister has not answered the question. He understands it perfectly well and is distorting it into saying that I am proposing that the House should control detailed administration, which I am not. I am merely asking if the Minister will give answers to questions or will he refuse to give such information on the grounds that it is the function of AnCOT.  He is not answering the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to convey this suggestion to AnCOT.  In granting scholarships consideration should be given to granting scholarships tenable outside the State.  The French Minister for Agriculture is initiating a programme whereby 100 scholarships for young French farmers are tenable outside France to enable those young farmers to obtain experience abroad.  That matter should be considered by AnCOT.  I also <Col N="304" /> feel that, in the granting of scholarships and making arrangements for agricultural education, consideration should be given to arranging for the joint holding of courses and for scholarships being tenable in Northern Ireland.  I would like to see a situation where a number of places in Northern Ireland colleges would be filled by people from the South and a number of places for students from Northern Ireland would be available in the South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section the entire control of the distribution of the moneys for almost all agricultural purposes will be taken over by AnCOT. Where do the county committees of agriculture stand in relation to this issue? They have always had a fair amount of freedom in relation to small amounts of expenditure.  They did not have freedom to take on extra staff or issues of that nature.  We brought down a Department official who went through the Estimates with us once a year.  We put forward different schemes and he gave us the Department's views on all the schemes, but we had the authority each year to put certain schemes into the estimates.  This is a new board with a completely different system from that of the Department of Agriculture.  Where exactly do the county committees stand in this matter in relation to money as far as those schemes are concerned or have all these schemes to be passed by the comhairle before the county committees can operate?</P>

      <P>Deputy D'Arcy would have been discontented with Deputy Clinton's provisions in this regard just as he appears to be unhappy about mine. The old committee functions are retained in the new Bill.  I hope that committee proposals in the future will be the subject of consideration by the comhairle and that they will take up various matters with the individual committees, and that committees will accept that the old county, &ldquo;home rule&rdquo; as it were, was an unsatisfactory arrangement.  There was a certain imbalance inherent in the situation which was bad for the service as a whole.  There were difficulties in the past, such as the uneven distribution of <Col N="305" /> staff and the limited availability of specialist staff.  That will be overcome by the new national organisation.  No encroachment on the older functions of committees is enshrined in this Bill any more than there was in the NAAERA Act.</P>

      <P>Can the county committees still draw up their programme of expenses? The Minister said he hoped that the comhairle would consider what the county committees put forward.  That is a different situation to that which obtains now, where they have the authority to draw up their programmes of expenses which have seldom been interfered with at the end of each financial year.  The Minister may say that conditions were unsatisfactory in certain counties because of uneven distribution of staff and so on, but the comhairle will bring in major changes.  Will the county committees of agriculture end up as a rubber stamp?  If they do they will be diluted and that will be the end of them.  I accept that the Minister must give power to the comhairle but I am worried about this. At present where a county is progressive the Department of Agriculture did not interfere to any great degree with the progress made.  How will this sort of thing operate in a new set-up with a new set of conditions?  Will the county committees be allowed to draw up any programmes at all, or will the comhairle draw up the programmes and send them on to the county committees to be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity for Deputy D'Arcy to be so worried.  I exhort him to put these worries behind him.  There is nothing enshrined in the Bill that was not enacted by his predecessor, nor is there any intention to damage the service in any way.  It is the intention that the council of AnCOT, which is not a political organisation or a puppet organisation of the Department of Agriculture, will make a more meaningful approach to the business of agricultural advice on behalf of the agricultural community.  If county committees, for the sake of their own interests or the interests of a particular county, put the well-being of farmers in <Col N="306" /> that county or in other counties at stake, the comhairle should not allow this and I am sure they will not allow it.  The comhairle will, in the end, have control over the advisory services and this highly laudable end is what was aimed at in the NAAERA Bill and what is aimed at here.  I supported this approach when I was spokesman for Fianna Fáil in Opposition, when the NAAERA Bill was before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy has an ambiguous and ambivalent approach to this question. Deputy D'Arcy champions the hardy individuality and strong independence of Wexford farmers on the one hand but champions the autonomy of An Chomhairle Oiliúna on the other. There has to be a compromise there. AnCOT does not exist for the sole benefit of any particular county, and neither does any committee of agriculture operating in a certain county.  There is a bigger object in mind, the advancement of the whole of Irish agriculture.  There is nothing sinister here.  The Deputy is standing, trembling and looking at section 13 in which he sees all kinds of will o' the wisps that did not exist in the NAAERA Bill.  To a large extent, it is a transfer of one section from the old Act into the new Bill.</P>

The fact of the matter is that the only power this House really has over a body such as this is the power to receive reports.  I will illustrate that by referring to the Agricultural Institute which is analagous to this body we are talking about.  Recently I asked the Minister the extent to which he is answerable to the Oireachtas for the activities of An Foras Talúntais.  The Minister said the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais) Act, 1958, requires the Minister to present the audited annual accounts and annual reports of An Foras Talúntais to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only guarantee we have of Oireachtas supervision of An Foras Talúntais is that their reports are presented to us.  Since this House votes them money each year, we must give considerable thought to the promptitude with which their reports are submitted to this House.  I have discovered that the reports of An Foras Talúntais have been submitted deplorably late, in my view, to <Col N="308" /> this House over a period of years.  The situation is getting worse.</P>
    <P>In 1967, the report was not submitted until ten months after the end of the year.  In 1968, the report was submitted eight months after the end of the year to which it applied; the 1969 report after 12 months; the 1970 report after nine months; the 1971 report after eight months; the 1972 report after ten months; and the 1973 report after nine months.  The 1974 report was not submitted until 13 months after the end of the year to which it applied.  The April-December 1974 report was not submitted until 16 months after the end of the year to which it applied.  The 1975 report was not submitted until ten-and-a-half months after the end of the year and the 1976 and 1977 reports were not submitted until 13 months after the end of the years to which they applied.</P>
    <P>A body of this sort should present their reports promptly to this House.  The information is all available at the end of the year and there should be no excuse for a delay of 13 months in An Foras Talúntais presenting their reports to this House.  Such a delay is not acceptable.  I know we are not discussing An Foras Talúntais on this section.  As they are the nearest similar body to the one we are setting up, the experience with An Foras Talúntais and the delays in submitting their reports are relevant.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes that the report must be submitted within three months of the end of the year.  Perhaps three months is going too far.  Perhaps it would be too severe.  I would be prepared to argue about that, but if the Minister is prepared to agree to six months, I will accept that.  There should be a clear time limit on the delay in presenting the reports of a body of this sort to the Oireachtas.  They are receiving public money and the only guaranteed control we have over their activities is a requirement on them to submit their reports.</P>
    <P>It is no use to this House or to the public to say we have any control over a semi-State body if their reports are not submitted until 16 months after the end of the year to which the reports applied. That is not taking responsibility to the Oireachtas seriously.  I believe AnCOT <Col N="309" /> should be a lot better than An Foras Talúntais in the matter of presenting their reports in time to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this amendment is acceptable in any way.  It is quite impracticable.  Deputy Bruton spoke with great disapproval about what he considered to be the tardiness of An Foras Talúntais in presenting their accounts. They have many organs and research centres throughout the country. In the case of An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta there will be 27 separate county areas and four large colleges.  To say that their accounts should be not only prepared for presentation to the Comptroller and Auditor General, but accepted and processed by him and sent to the House within three months, is not practicable.</P>
      <P>Why should the accounts of AnCOT be singled out as against the accounts of any other semi-State body functioning under the general aegis of the Irish Government?  I do not know of any case where the delay is intolerably great. There may be cases where there could be a bit of expedition.  In some of the figures Deputy Bruton gave, the Coalition years were the worse years.  It would be easy to score a cheap debating point about that, but I would prefer not to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being difficult today.  I do not think it could be done, and Deputy Bruton knows that too.  Nor am I persuaded that there is any culpable tardiness in the presentation of accounts by existing boards, including An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are analogous private companies, for example, Cement-Roadstone Holdings, with subsidiary holdings at home and abroad. Their shareholders would not accept that the accounts for 1977 should not be presented until half way through 1979.  If a private company would not be allowed to present their report to their <Col N="310" /> shareholders 13 or 16 months after the end of the year to which they related, why should public representatives in this House be asked to accept delays of that length in the presentation of reports?</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly that bodies of this sort who are in receipt of public money need to be supervised more closely in general by the Oireachtas in the public interest.  One way in which that supervision can take place is by their annual reports being examined by the Oireachtas or by a special committee of the Oireachtas.  If these annual reports are to be presented 16 months late, when the information they contain will be almost entirely out of date and useless, that guarantee of accountability is set at nought.  It is worth nothing.  There should be a definite time limit on the date on which reports for a particular year should be submitted.</P>
      <P>As I said, I would not necessarily insist on three months.  That may be a bit short.  I would be happy with six months. I would even be happy with a guarantee of nine months because that would be better than the record of An Foras Talúntais so far in the presentation of its reports; in most cases it has been ten or 11 months before its reports were presented.  I would be happy with some definite limit because there is no time limit at the moment within which reports must be presented.</P>

      <P>I am aware, however, that overdrafts have been incurred by some schools. This comes to light when the school accounts are audited but, as it is not possible to audit all school accounts each year, the number of schools with overdrafts at any particular time is not known.</P>
      <P>When the incurring of an overdraft comes to light the attention of the board of management is directed to the irregularity and they are asked to ensure that the position is corrected.

The relevant provisions in my Department's Estimates are contained in subheads A 1 and A 2 of Vote Primary Education.

In view of the increase in the population of students, especially in primary schools, which is indicated within the next five or ten years, is the Minister aware that reducing the attractiveness of teacher training colleges is a very negative way of approaching the problem of providing a proper supply of teachers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in deference to the pin-pricking which has been taking place that I referred to this and I have answered the question assuming that was what Deputy Keating had in mind.</P>
      <P>All relevant considerations relating to the location of the proposed NIHE, Dublin, were fully examined by my Department before a final decision was taken that the Ballymun site was the most suitable and appropriate site available for the particular purpose within the city environs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what the Deputy has in mind in respect of social studies in Ballymun.  I think he is aware that the City of Dublin VEC, who first mooted the location of such an institute, were the first to suggest Ballymun as being a suitable location. Subsequently, when I enjoyed membership of that committee, and now, as Minister of State, I would be happy to endorse the Ballymun site as being the most suitable site available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has good reasons for that.  Is it possible that any other site could be considered at this stage?  I ask that question because the proposed site is a relatively small one and may be encroached upon soon by other bodies who want a piece of that site.  Was a specific study made in relation to the decision on the site and is it available to anyone who is interested <Col N="327" /> in it?  By that I mean a reasonably detailed document which relates to the educational implications of the location of the site because of its relationship to other third-level colleges in the city.  The social implications of the siting of it could be numerous and I can enumerate them for the Minister if he wants me to.</P>

      <P>The making of the copy of the stone in question was in accordance with the general policy of the National Museum that copies of stones should, where possible, be placed where the originals had stood.</P>
      <P>It is normal practice for the National Museum to make copies of the objects for private individuals who present objects to the museum.  The cost involved on this occasion was insignificant and, in the circumstances, the question of direct reimbursement to public funds did not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the forecast prepared by the National Prices Commission predicting a return to double-digit inflation which was based on the estimated year-on-year increase at mid-February. The consumer price index for mid-February has now been published and represents a rise of 4¼ per cent in the November-February quarter.  As pointed out by the commission this sharp rise is <Col N="333" /> due in part to a number of non-recurring factors and the quarterly increase for February-May should be lower.</P>
      <P>If the preconditions set out in the White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo; are met, the Government are confident that further reductions in the quarterly rate of increase will be achieved in the subsequent quarters of this year.</P>

      <P>I am not a prophet and neither is the Deputy.  All of these forecasts are based on certain assumptions about likely trends and behaviour.  There were a number of uncertain factors in the outside world as well as a number of indeterminate trends within our own economy.  Therefore, I can only repeat what I said in my reply, that if the pre-conditions set out in the White Paper are met, then the Government are confident that further reductions in the quarterly rate of increase will be achieved in the subsequent quarters of this year and that we can, therefore, approach our target of a 5 per cent rate of inflation by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what are defined as budgetary increases, but there is still some proportion of the indirect tax increase which does not appear to be reflected fully in the February figure and will, therefore, appear in the May figure.  However, as I have said already, we would expect the February-May figure to be lower than the figure for November-February.  Tax increases were not the only non-recurring factor that accounted for the sharp rise up to mid-February.  There were other seasonal or exceptional factors, such as the various sharp increase in the price of potatoes for example, which added something over .5 per cent, accounting for .5 per cent of the 4.25 per cent total. That is a sequence unlikely to be repeated in later quarters.  Therefore, I do not see the point of trying to read too much into the results of any one quarter.</P>

      <P>For one quarter only.  We can also move very sharply downwards in later quarters.  We have been at pains to emphasise all <Col N="335" /> along that we expected an upturn in the rate of inflation for a short period only and that there should not be too great an emphasis placed on that purely temporary phenomenon.  The important thing to emphasise is that the rate of inflation on average over the last 18 months or so has been significantly lower than in earlier years and that if we behave sensibly over the coming months and produce the sort of arrangements on cost increases, pay matters and so forth which are appropriate to our circumstances now as members of the EMS, then it will be possible to have a very good return to these lower rates of inflation and to drive down the rate of inflation even lower than that which we enjoyed in the latter part of 1977 and first half of 1978.</P>

Again on the basis of the information available to us there is no reason why there should not be a very marked slowing down in the rate of increase in food prices in the remaining quarters of the year.  It is feasible that the total increase for the remaining three-quarters of this year would be less than the increases that occurred in the November-February <Col N="337" /> quarter.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number on the live register at the Waterford Employment Exchange at 9 February 1979, the latest available date, was 2,278.  This represents an increase of 16.5 per cent on the figure of 1,955 at 10 February, the corresponding date in 1978.</P>
      <P>The Government's plan for dealing with unemployment are outlined in the White Paper <i>Programme for National Development 1978-1981.</i>  Moreover, in this year's budget, a special provision of £20 million was made for further measures to support employment creation and maintenance, including a programme of residual employment activity along the lines described in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The IDA plans, which are under review at present, have a job target of 1,300 for the Waterford and New Ross town group and AnCO have increased their training plans for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the numbers on the live register in Waterford are, firstly, unacceptably high and, secondly, are increasing rather than decreasing as one would have expected under their so-called manifesto?  Is the Minister further aware that the number <Col N="338" /> of factories that have closed in the Waterford area is causing severe social unrest in that city?  Would the Minister indicate to the House what precise activities the Government intend undertaking to establish a number of substantial factories in the Waterford area to take up this exceedingly high unemployment content?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the experience in Waterford has been contrary to the national experience, namely, that unemployment has risen there recently, whereas over that comparable period there had been a siginificant fall in unemployment in the country as a whole.  That increased unemployment is associated with specific problems in a number of firms in that area.  Arrangements are being made to ascertain if some replacement firms or activities can be brought in rapidly to substitute those firms which experience difficulties.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Industrial Development Authority have been active in promoting Waterford as a centre for new industry.  There are at least six projects currently under construction or starting production which will provide an aggregate of approximately 700 jobs. That is quite independent of the Waterford Glass expansion which is planned to provide something in the region of 1,100 extra jobs, making a total of 1,800 jobs in the pipeline.  Perhaps I might summarise that by saying that, for the county as a whole last year, there were 37 projects approved with a job potential of something in excess of 2,000. Therefore there is an awareness of the need to provide improved employment opportunities in that area.  Action is being taken and the first fruits of that accelerated programme of job provision will be seen in the course of the current year.</P>

That will be done when the studies being made of the various regional characteristics have been completed.</P>

      <P>Studies on the production by agriculture of renewable energy sources are being carried out in various international organisations including in particular the EEC, and the OECD through its subsidiary body, the International Energy Agency.</P>
      <P>These studies have in turn led to specific research and development projects and indeed to actual demonstration projects.  In the European Community the Council of Ministers is shortly expected to confirm their approval in principle of December last for Community support for demonstration projects in the field of energy-saving and the exploitation of new energy sources.  These include projects in the area of biomass conversion, the biomass in this context being derived from short rotation forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with our own studies, following the 1973 energy crisis, on the identification of alternative energy sources of greatest relevance to the Irish <Col N="340" /> situation, we have pursued a deliberate policy of interaction with international co-operative research studies and programmes.  This involves, in the area of renewable energy sources, participation by Irish researchers in:</P>
    <P>biomass production projects of the EEC Indirect Action Programme;</P>
    <P>the carrying out of an inter-institutional pilot scale Forestry Biomass Energy Demonstration Project which will be funded as to 40 per cent by EEC funds under the Community programme mentioned above and</P>
    <P>two co-operative agreements under the International Energy Agency on a programme of Research Development and Demonstration on Forestry Energy.</P>
    <P>Other energy-relevant uses of agricultural waste are currently proposed to be studied under the proposed European Community programme on secondary raw materials and also the demonstration projects programme in the field of energy-saving.</P>
    <P>The particular studies and research and demonstration projects I have mentioned above are those which have thus far been selected as being of greatest relevance to Irish requirements and capabilities.  We will of course continue to monitor the activities of the various international bodies concerned with a view to assessing the potential for further beneficial participation by Irish organisations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the consumer price index <Col N="342" /> rose by 4¼ per cent in the three months to mid-February 1979.  The National Prices Commission attribute this sharp increase in part to certain non-recurring factors and predict that the quarterly increase for February/May should be lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the known annual rate of inflation to mid-February of some 10.8 per cent and the Minister's acceptance here this afternoon that the annual rate to mid-May 1979 is likely to be in excess of that figure, would he agree that the annual rate of inflation at the end of the year would be in the region of 12 per cent, taking into account anticipated oil price increases, wage cost increases and other factors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that it would be in the region of 12 per cent on an annual basis at the end of the year.  While it is clear that the rate of increase for the 12 months as a whole will be greater than in 1978, I would not wish to try to predict a precise figure at this juncture.  I must go back to the point I made earlier, that while in part some of the price development this year is outside our control and may or may not develop in a particular manner&mdash;we are not in a position to influence oil prices&mdash;there is a significant area of price increase which is within our own control.  The more we think in terms of the worst happening, the more likely it is that the worst will happen.  Whereas, if we tackle the problem positively, seek to identify the maximum improvement which can be made in this area and adopt the action appropriate to bring about that improvement, we will not have the type of inflation rate to which the Deputy refers.  In those circumstances it would also be possible to get the rate of inflation down to a rate of 5 per cent or thereabouts by the end of this year, that is an increase in the last quarter of this year of somewhere in the <Col N="343" /> region of 1¼ per cent.  That is feasible and it is appropriate that we should seek to direct our actions along those lines.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Section 51 of the Act of 1977 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (2):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2)  Accounts kept in pursuance of this section shall be submitted annually by the Authority to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and immediately after the audit, a copy of the income and expenditure account, the balance sheet and any other accounts kept pursuant to a direction of the Minister, together with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts shall be presented to the Minister who shall cause copies thereof to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than three months after the end of the year to which the accounts apply.&rsquo;&rdquo;.   </P>

      <P>The annual reports and accounts of semi-State bodies are basically the only way they are directly and statutorily responsible to the House. If they are not presented within a reasonable period of time after the end of the year to which they apply the information contained in them is substantially out of date.  Reports of the Agricultural Institute have been as much as 16 months late and I believe there should be a requirement, as proposed in the amendment, that the reports and accounts be submitted within a definite period after the end of the year to which they apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of factors must be considered in relation to this.  The first is the extreme and technical difficulty of rounding-up necessary data from the areas of 27 committees of agriculture <Col N="356" /> and from four big State agricultural schools.  The second is the capacity of the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with the AnCOT figures as well as figures from other bodies.  It would be tying both of them down unnecessarily if I adopted the suggestion in the amendment. There was no such draconian provision enshrined in the 1977 Act nor did anybody deem it necessary at that time.  Therefore, such a provision was not included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be prepared, notwithstanding the fact that he does not wish to incorporate this in the Bill, to indicate to the semi-State bodies under his responsibility his concern that the reports be presented within six or nine months of the end of the year to which they apply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the only example available to the Department of a provision of this kind is the University Act, 1908.  It is provided in that Act that there be a time limit of three months preparation and three months audit of accounts.  That provision was found to be impracticable and was repealed later.  The inclusion of things known to be almost impossible to comply with is plainly unnecessary and undesirable.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that commercial companies are able to produce their accounts for their shareholders within a shorter space of time.  There are commercial companies which are as big, if not bigger, than AnCOT. For instance, a concern like Cement-Roadstone Holdings has interests all over the world and they are able to produce their report promptly.  In this instance we are concerned about those who must report to the people of Ireland and one would have thought that a higher rather than a lower standard would be applied.  To be honest about this, I appreciate the Minister's difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can appreciate the point made by the Minister about the insertion of such a requirement in the Bill, but I should like to know if he would be prepared to indicate to semi-State bodies that he believed they should aim to submit their reports and accounts within six to nine months of the year in question?</P>

      <P>I would have no hesitation in indicating a general desire that there should not be any delay in the presentation of these important figures but there is no question of any such desire on my part.  I am surprised that the Deputy requires an assurance on that point.  With regard to the Deputy's point about companies I should like to state that it sounds more like an assertion than a fact because it would depend on the size of companies.  I doubt if it would be feasible for a company of any great size to do as the Deputy has suggested but in the case of a small company this would not present any difficulty like we have to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 14, to insert a new section as follow:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 52 of the Act of 1977 is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) the substitution of the following paragraph (a)&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(a) within two months after the end of each financial year, prepare and submit to the Minister a report of the work of the Authority in that financial year and a copy of every such report shall be laid forthwith <Col N="358" /> before each House of the Oireachtas, and&rsquo;,  </P>
    <P>(b) the insertion of new subsections as follows:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2)  The Minister shall&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) have power to lay down, after consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, information which must be provided in the annual report and the format in which such information is to be provided, and</P>
    <P>(b) in the exercise of the powers conferred on him by subsection (2) (a) of this section, the Minister shall endeavour to ensure that the nature and format of information provided in the annual report may be easily understood by members of the public and be easily compared with similar information contained in the annual reports of other semi-State bodies.  </P>
    <P>(3) The annual report for a given year of An Chomhairle shall contain the agreed annual agricultural, advisory and education programme for each county and the agreed estimate of expenses and receipts of An Chomhairle for the following year.&rsquo;&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This is fairly similar in its intent.  It requires that a report on activities be submitted to the Minister within two months of the end of the year.  It also states that the Minister would have power to lay down the information which would have to be provided in the annual report and the format on which such information is arrived at.  It asks that the Minister, in laying down the type of information which will have to be provided, will have power to ensure that the nature and format of the information is easily understood by members of the public and easily compared with similar information obtained in the annual reports of other semi-State bodies.  It also provides that the annual report should contain information in relation to what is planned in the following year in individual counties and an estimate of receipts for the following <Col N="359" /> year.  As an instrument of making the House aware of what policy a body are following, a report, which is solely concerned with what they did in a particular year without any reference to what they plan in the future, is not very useful.  I ask that not only should the annual report contain information about the past but that it should contain information about the future so that when it is presented it will be a comprehensive statement of the board's activities and planned activities in any year.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the report be comparable from one body to another, particularly as far as financial affairs are concerned.  I know that there is a joint committee which are concerned with the activities of the various semi-State companies and with the type of information they are providing in their reports.  The comhairle are not within the ambit of that committee because they are not a trading company.  At the same time that body are concerned in general with reports and accounts of the kind of bodies which are responsible to the Government.  I ask that their expertise be sought in relation to the type of material which should be inserted in reports.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision in the Bill is concerned it is quite possible for an annual report to be submitted which gives little or no information about what the comhairle are doing.  So long as it is called an annual report it can be submitted. It is another question whether the accounts are accepted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The confidence we have in him is a guarantee that the accounts will be adequate.  There is no provision anywhere, as far as I can see, to ensure that a body like this submit a report which is reasonable and gives reasonably full and comparable information.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to give the Minister power to see that certain information, which he believes should be given, is given in the annual report.  That is a reasonable power for the Minister to have.  It might not be necessary to use it if bodies were behaving reasonably in the view of all parties, but I believe it is a power which should be there.  It will not interfere with what they do.  It is merely <Col N="360" /> saying that they must report about what they do.  I believe this is a good principle and would increase parliamentary scrutiny of a body like this.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  The matters referred to in it could easily be carried out by the comhairle.  The matters the report should contain need not be detailed.  They need to state only the broad outline of their work throughout the year as well as their projections and programmes for the following year.  It would be very useful to have this.  This board are rather removed from the general public and from the parliamentary system, unlike the Department of Agriculture, who are under scrutiny every day the Dáil sits.  It could be extremely useful to the Minister for Agriculture if he could get stated in the report the programmes which the comhairle carried out in the preceding year and their projected programmes for the following year.  The two months question could be altered but if the Minister obtains this information, which we are seeking in the amendment, it could be a very useful exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>My objections to this amendment are similar to my objections to the previous one.  It is worth the Deputy's while to refer to the Coalition Act, section 52, which states:</P>
      <P>The board shall as soon as conveniently may be after the end of each financial year, prepare and submit to the Minister a report of the work of the Authority in that financial year and a copy of every such report shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>...supply to the Minister such information regarding the performance of the functions of the Authority as he may from time to time require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great perceptibility in the amendments of the Fine Gael Deputies, not just this one but several others, their inability to cope with the certain parting of political ways, that one would hope would ensue after the enactment of the comhairle Bill.  For many years there has <Col N="361" /> been a farrago of insistence from farming organisations, farmers and their elected representatives within the committees of agriculture for such an undertaking to be made, similar to the lines of the successful establishment of An Foras Talúntais.  Amendments such as this appear to me to be unnecessarily restrictive in that freedom of movement, especially in regard to what I can only call prognostications for the future, before their programmes are even contemplated, much less implemented.  It is well that the political provisions in paragraph (b) of section 52 of the 1976 Act should be continued on this basis.  It was on that basis that they were accepted without any ado by the then Opposition Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The revision of a report within two months of the conclusion of the financial year is not possible.  I can perceive through the restrictive nature of the amendment, as proposed by the Deputies, a general good intention that I am in accord with, the furnishing of information that will be useful not only to Members of the Oireachtas but to people in the food production business.  Such publications, as the House will know, are readily available within their own limitations from An Foras Talúntais.  Some of them are quite celebrated and have constituted a part of the liveliness of certain producers.  This is a good thing.  In any advisory service, the production of publications is necessary.  It will not be secured by this amendment or by anything approximating it.  It will be secured by the conveyance of a very important trust.  That is the function of the comhairle and it will be of great importance to our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>That is why we should not quibble about who gets what representation on the board.  That is not important, it is important to get the best board.  That is not a guiding principle that was always followed by our predecessors in Government in many semi-State undertakings to the detriment of many of them.  I will not go further than that.  The amendment has a certain praiseworthy content and it is a measure about which I can foresee discussions taking place between the comhairle and the Minister at a future <Col N="362" /> time.  That is really irrelevant to what we are doing here which is setting up an organisation.  That it should be restricted in any way or that this legislation should seek to carry with it an implicit lack of trust, would be to condemn it from the beginning, and that is not my intention. For that reason I reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no restriction of the operations of the comhairle in this amendment.  The Minister is completely misrepresenting the amendment in suggesting that.  They are entirely free to do what they like so far as this amendment is concerned.  The amendment is only asking them to tell the House and the public in time, what they are doing.  It is not unreasonable to ask people to tell the public what they were doing during the year within two months of the end of the year.  The comhairle must know what they did during the year; they will have accumulated information throughout the year.  Why can they not just submit the information that is there on file in an annual report at the end of the year?  The fact that they must submit an annual report would not constrain them.  All they have to do is to report within two months of the year ending.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that it would also be impossible for them to incorporate in this report a statement as to what they intended to do in the following year.  The Minister said that at that stage it would be impossible to prognosticate about things that might not be contemplated at that stage.  We are talking about some document that would be presented in the first two months of a year.  It would be a queer body that could not tell the public what they intended to do during the remaining ten months of the year.  That is not asking them to look into the dim and distant future but only as far as ten months ahead, or 12, at the most.  That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they only say what they did in the past and do not say what their plans are, there is nothing against which performance can be measured.  It is all looking back, and that sort of report is not really useful.  If there was a report which said &ldquo;this is what we did last year and this is what we will do next year&rdquo; and then the following year we had a report saying <Col N="363" /> what they did, we could compare what they hoped to do with what they did and we would have some way of seeing whether they were living up to their expectations. At the moment that is not possible.  In any assessment by this House of whether value for money is being obtained in relation to money spent on any semi-State body, the information is not being given in a form which enables the House to make a sensible judgement about what is happening. This amendment is necessary and should be pursued as strongly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister complained about forward publicity in relation to what might happen.  The greater area of functioning, as far as the board will be concerned, will be through the county committees of agriculture.  The comhairle will have got the programmes from the various county committees of agriculture at least three months before the end of the year.  At the moment the Department require the programmes from the different committees at least two to three months in advance of the end of the year, so the reports will be in the files.  The Minister claims that the comhairle might not have contemplated this, that or the other, but they will have to have contemplated it.  They will have the information we are asking for available three months in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputies wish to pursue this for their own reasons.  We all remember the volume of criticism, real and implied, about civil service control and political control over the new body.  The Deputies are trying to perpetuate this political control.  I acknowledge, without any apology, that political control in a democracy is necessary. Political control derives from the functions of the Minister, whoever he may be.  The process of reporting to the House and thereafter presumably to the country through that mechanism seems to me to be adequate.  To strengthen it further would be to impose obligations on AnCOT which would be inconvenient and prejudicial generally to the good running of the comhairle.  One could envisage the dropping of other activities <Col N="364" /> in order to prepare the report within the deadline of two months.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy seemed to be saying he wanted to be privy to what passed between the Minister, who might well be from his own party, and the comhairle. That is a matter for the discretion solely of the Minister of the day.  It is not possible for me to see how the imposition of these strictures or requirements on the comhairle would in any way improve their performance.  I can readily see how their performance might be impeded by the imposition of obligations which would seem to me to be unreasonable.</P>

There is nothing in the amendment about political control, or control in any form, over what the body may do.  I have to repeat that because the Minister has repeated the accusation.  All the amendment is concerned with is a report on what they did, not that we should direct them on what to do, but that they should tell us what they did and what they plan to do.  We are not concerned with controlling their activities.</P>

I notice that some members of the board will be appointed for three years, some <Col N="365" /> for four years, and some for five years.  I cannot figure out why this unequal term of membership should exist, which seems to suggest some members are more equal than others, and that there are three different categories of members.  It seems to suggest that if you get a five-year term you are a better type of member than the person who is given a three-year term.  It seems to make fish of one and flesh of another, and I wonder why.  I know it was in the previous Bill and the question could have been asked of the Minister's predecessor.  I do not know whether it was.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me why there is this staggered membership.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) by the substitution in section 39 (7) for &lsquo;in section 1 (1) of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1974,&rsquo; of &lsquo;in section 2 of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1958, as amended.&rsquo;;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This and the other amendments to section 17 are merely to provide for necessary clarification or correction in regard to some provisions in the 1977 Act which in practice could prove difficult to implement.</P>
      <P>Here a change of reference is being made following consultation with the Parliamentary Draftsman's office.  The 1974 Act, referred to at present in section 39 (7) of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977 merely inserted an amending subsection into section 2 of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1958. The present change is being made so that the reference in section 39 (7) is to the 1958 Act, as amended, rather than to the amending 1974 Act.  It is a rather technical amendment and that is the reason why Deputies will understand that it is more convenient and advisable to read the note that has been given.

      <P>&ldquo;( )  by the substitution in section 56 for &lsquo;or, as the case may be, the Minister' of &lsquo;or the Minister,';</P>
      <P>( )  by the deletion in section 58 (a)  of &lsquo;and other assets&rsquo; in both places where those words occur;</P>

      <P>( )  by the insertion in section 59 (1)  after &lsquo;section 53&rsquo; of &lsquo;(in this section referred to as the net value of the transferred assets)&rsquo;;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The first of these paragraphs related to section 56 of the 1977 Act which as it stands at present would transfer all the liabilities of committees of agriculture to the new body.  It would be unfair to pass to the new body liabilities in respect of functions which will continue to be the responsibility of county committees.  The effect of the amendment is to confine the transfer to liabilities in relation to functions and property transferred.</P>
      <P>The reason for the deletion of &ldquo;and other assets&rdquo; in section 58 (a) of the 1977 Act is that it is tautological, as the term property covers all the assets transferred and we are advised by the Parliamentary Draftsman's office that inclusion of the phrase could cause interpretation problems in relation to section 59 (3) (a) (i) which refers to property only and has a cross reference to section 58 (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the reference to interest in section 58 (c) of the 1977 Act were allowed to remain the result would be that any interest paid on a loan which was outstanding at the time of the transfer of property would be included in the &ldquo;net <Col N="368" /> value of transferred assets&rdquo; as defined in section 59 (3) (a) of that Act.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware interest paid on a loan is not an asset, hence the reference to interest is being deleted.  The insertion in section 59 (1) is necessary because there is a slight difference in the wording between the phrase at present used in this subsection and the definition in subsection 3 (a).  It is necessary to clarify the intention that both phrases should have the same meaning.  Again it is a matter of drafting amendments for the sake of precision and clarity.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to liabilities which would be transferred from the county committees of agriculture to the comhairle and he said that the liabilities which would be transferred would, as a result of this amendment, not be all the liabilities of the county committees but only liabilities arising from those functions which were being transferred to the comhairle. Could I ask the Minister what functions in respect of which liabilities exist would remain with the county committees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a variety of rather small matters, for example, the amount outstanding in relation to county committee scholarships and things of that kind.  To import these and the liabilities that accrue from them on to the new comhairle would be unreasonable and that is the only intention of the amendment.  I think it will be perceived by all concerned, including the committees of agriculture, as being merely for that purpose.  I would anticipate the conducting of schemes such as the small livestock schemes as coming under the aegis of the comhairle in the future.  This would be in accordance with the general policy of the comhairle which they themselves would determine. That they should become liable for debts, however small, incurred in ways like this would be to start the comhairle off at a serious disadvantage.</P>

The Minister, in the third of his three amendments which are being affected by this omnibus amendment <Col N="369" /> changes &ldquo;principal and interest&rdquo; to &ldquo;principal&rdquo; only in section 58 (c) of the 1977 Act.

      <P>In page 8, between lines 25 and 26, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Section 4 (2) of the Act of 1958 is hereby amended by the addition of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1)  arrange for the exchange of staff on a temporary basis with An Comhairle (established under section 8 of the Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Act, 1979) and for the undertaking of joint projects with An Comhairle.&rsquo;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to allow for the temporary exchange of staff between the comhairle and the Agricultural Institute. Obviously, there will be staff working in the comhairle, particularly specialist agricultural advisers, who will have the competence in work that is similar to work being carried on by the Agricultural Institute in their research role.  It seems sensible that there should be the possibility for an exchange of staff, that a man could move, say, for a year or two from the comhairle to work in the institute and <i>vice versa.</i>  But if this can take place on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and if there is no need to amend the legislation, I shall be happy; but first I should like a firm assurance that such exchanges can take place.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am mistaken but this seems to be an attempt on the part of the Deputies to give statutory confirmation to something that is perfectly feasible, to the free-and-easy rapport that exists and which I hope will continue to exist between the advisory people and the foras.  I can see Deputy Bruton's point, and it is valid, that with the development of increasing numbers of people in the specialist areas, more of these people will be going to Moore Park to do certain work, first, for a basic briefing and possibly for a more extended period subsequently.  I have no <Col N="371" /> wish to see the arrangement enshrined with its intended limitations in this legislation.  The arrangements that exist can be expanded easily as expediency and good sense require.  It would be unnecessary to batten the matter down further.  Deputy Bruton has indicated that this assurance would meet his requirement. He may have the assurance that there is no intention of building a stone wall between the foras and the comhairle because the free flow of information that exists between the two is necessary and can be procured easily in the present circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very academic question.  Part of it was envisaged in the diagnostic work on a herd or flock basis. We discussed that matter recently but applied research is by definition rather specialised and basic research in that sense connotes the same thing.  The history up to now has been of rather scattered efforts on the veterinary side, efforts scattered between the foras and the Department.  It is envisaged that in future this dividing of effort be rationalised and concentrated where it as well as other research belongs with the foras.  There is no intention on the part either of the foras or of the Government to intrude into the realms of private practice but in the case of general research into vital matters such as infectious diseases, animal parasitology and so on, the need for basic research and determination of the practices calculated to deal with them must be plain for all to see.  Any division that would occur in the efforts made to determine from a research point of view the overall approach to these national difficulties is not to be desired.  That is what we are providing for here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain odds and ends that were left loose in the 1976 Act and this <Col N="372" /> is one of them.  I have never been able to understand why cereal research was not taken over in 1968.  I am afraid that consequently our cereal research has not had the same concentration of effort or the same effectiveness as it might otherwise have had.  The same could apply&mdash;but I am not aware that it applies&mdash;in the matter of basic research applied to specific problems which they, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, are best fitted to determine.</P>
    <P>As an individual, I should like to see research into the infectious cattle diseases which are a serious national problem and also certain animal parasite diseases.  By the implementation of this section I want to ensure that the proper organ of the State will be legislatively permitted to go about this most important business and will be able to use in their pursuits the best research means available.  They have it already and they need the concentration of effort that will be given and the application of specialised means to the determination of cures for these difficulties and thereafter their implementation with the co-operation of the comhairle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Certain research work has always been undertaken by the Department of Agriculture.  There is an unsatisfactory and untidy situation in regard to cereals and veterinary research and this concentration under the foras is a tidying up.  It is necessary that the products of the research work should be applied immediately to the problems in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given any thought to the relative responsibility which will now exist between the veterinary faculties of the universities and the foras?  Up to now the foras have been responsible in general for research but this is the first time they have been given responsibility for what has been described as &ldquo;basic research.&rdquo;  I do not see among the functions of the institute <Col N="373" /> the term &ldquo;basic research.&rdquo;  In giving the institute responsibility for basic research in respect of any matter it would seem that one is <i>prima facie</i> cutting across the traditional functions of the universities. In the past an institute like the Agricultural Institute or the IIRS carried out applied research, but basic research was considered to be primarily a matter for the universities.  Under this section basic research is being given for the first time to an institution which is not a university and this seems to be an unusual departure.  Has the Minister had consultation with the universities in relation to this matter?  Have they agreed that basic veterinary research will be carried out by the Agricultural Institute and do they see in this any incursion on their traditional function in relation to basic research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Tiger Poincaré is reported to have said in relation to generals that war is too serious a matter to leave to generals.  Animal disease is too serious a matter for any particular class of people, such as university faculties, however responsible and however great our debt to them may be. It is quite considerable.  There is not an intention or inclination to encroach on their role but there is an acceptance of the responsibility that eventuates on the desk of the Minister for Agriculture in facing up to the very real problems in this field.  They are of necessity political. I do not in any way disparage the generals of the universities.  This is a matter on which Deputy Bruton and his colleagues will rightly question me in the future.  It has been obvious for some time that there should not be any avoidable scattering of research efforts in this regard.  It will be limited by the implementation of this section to such a point that it will make no practical difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very familiar with the practice of the veterinary faculties of the universities but I would imagine it would contain a certain research element of its own, possibly to the same extent as the small demonstration plots of individual committees of agriculture.  The basic research into major veterinary matters <Col N="374" /> will now be concentrated in An Foras where it belongs.  I would be at some pains to recognise the part that the universities have played in this matter of research in the past with their, of necessity, limited resources.  It is in no way to disparage them that I do this, but merely in recognition of the reality that we have some very serious problems to deal with. Some of these problems I have named but a veterinary surgeon or, I would hope, An Foras Talúntais, would be able to tell me of others.  This is a very necessary and beneficial part of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Not much because I would hope that the research effort of the foras would be almost by definition very much more substantial, nor do I see any need for competition or duplication. A little bit of intelligence and note-comparing would be all that would be necessary.  I do not see any reason why a university man doing some work on his own might not avail of the information of An Foras Talúntais.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be over-hopeful when he says that a little bit of note-comparing should do the trick.  The National Science Council thought there was a need for science research to be co-ordinated and for that reason they issued the report which led to the National Board for Science and Technology Bill being passed in this House.  The subject of scientific research occupied the time of this House.  The Minister cannot dismiss the possibility of duplication as lightly as he is doing.  I do not propose amending the section but I think the Minister should keep the possibility in mind.  So long as I am satisfied that this section will not be used as an excuse by the Higher Education Authority or whatever body is responsible for the funding of the universities to reduce the amount of money being made available to the universities for veterinary research I would not object to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 20, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20. &mdash;Section 7 of the Act of 1958 is hereby amended by the substitution for subsections (4) and (5) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(4)  Subsequently, the Director shall be appointed by the Council and shall hold office for such term and on such terms and conditions (including terms of remuneration) as may be determined by the Council.  A determination under this subsection, in so far as it relates to remuneration, shall not be made without the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service.&rsquo;&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>This amendment may be taken in conjunction with the amendments in section 25 because all relate to the superannuation of the present director of An Foras Talúntais.  The need for these amendments arises from the special position of the present director of An Foras Talúntais who was the first director appointed by the Government when An Foras Talúntais was established in 1958 but who was subsequently appointed director by the Council of An Foras Talúntais. Accordingly, as it is not clear whether he is in law the first director or a subsequent director, or both, it is necessary to clarify the position by providing that all directors, including the first, will come under the general provisions relating to superannuation in section 18 of the 1958 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from what is in the amendment, the new element in the section is that a determination under this section, in so far as it relates to the remuneration of the director, cannot be made without the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service.  This is a new development.  We all know that problems can arise when there is control over the director's salary by the Minister for the Public Service but no control over the salaries of his subordinates.  It has been suggested to me that in an individual semi-State body a situation arose whereby the deputy director whose salary was not controlled by the Minister for the Public Service&mdash;and there was nothing in the Act establishing the institution in question about control of his salary&mdash;was able to earn more than his boss, the director. This agency was the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I am nearly certain that my information about that is correct, and anyhow it is a situation that can arise where a director's salary is controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need the best people we can get in these institutions, and particularly we need the best of the best as directors.  Is the existence of this sort of control going to give people the incentive to seek promotion within the institution or to apply for the position of director if it becomes vacant?  If a person is the deputy director and by virtue of this sort of control it is not possible for him to get very much increase in his salary by accepting the additional responsibilities and accompanying difficulties entailed in becoming director, because the salary of <Col N="378" /> the director is controlled whereas his salary in his existing position is not controlled, this will discourage people from competing for promotion and therefore will affect morale and output generally in the institution.</P>
    <P>I wonder how this control came to be introduced.  Is the Minister happy that the Minister for the Public Service should be involved in this?  I would have thought that it would have been necessary only for the Minister himself to have control.  Why must the Minister for the Public Service also have control?  Is it possible that the Minister for the Public Service does not trust the Minister for Agriculture to deal adequately with this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the anomalous situation described by the Deputy will occur.  Section 24 of this Bill provides for the control of AFT remuneration and therefore this should not arise.  I do not think that when we deal with section 24 further elaboration will be necessary on this point and on the point that the Deputy has raised now.  In recent legislation such control is reposing in the hands of the Minister.</P>

If the Minister for Agriculture has control of a salary presumably he will effect that control in conjunction with his colleagues on the basis of an agreed policy. It seems odd, and it is almost a suggestion that the Minister is not to be trusted, if another Minister has to be put in as well who is going to have the job statutorily measured.</P>

We have been listening to the Minister for Agriculture all day here telling us that this, that or the other amendment was not necessary because in practice there would be no problem, it could all be worked out, there were no obstacles and so forth.  If that is the Minister's attitude why is he insisting on saying that he will not be free to determine the director's salary without first consulting with the Minister for the Public Service and insisting that that be written into the Act?  Why is he insisting that he be not allowed himself to make a determination about the director's salary without the Minister for the Public Service also agreeing?  Surely he will consult anyway with his colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, one way or the other.  Is there some suggestion that otherwise the Minister might not listen to the Minister for the Public Service?</P>

    <P>(4)  The Minister shall lay before Dáil Éireann within one week of the borrowing having been undertaken a statement concerning each such borrowing including the amount borrowed, the currency in which it is borrowed, the rate of interest, the purpose of the borrowing and the conditions, if any, imposed by the Minister&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This is in relation to borrowings.  Money should be borrowed by the Government or by any other body only to finance projects of a capital nature which will yield a rate of return sufficient to enable at least the interest on the debt to be paid and, of course we hope, more to be earned than that interest.  If that is not achieved it is hardly worth while borrowing the money in the first place. Where a body responsible to a Minister are undertaking a borrowing they should give information to the House about such borrowing.  When a body who are guaranteed by the State are undertaking a borrowing they are saying to the taxpayer &ldquo;If we cannot meet this debt you will have to meet it when it becomes due&rdquo;.  The House is the representative of the taxpayer and the guarantor of the loan and should be given information promptly about such borrowings being undertaken.</P>
    <P>I also have some doubt about whether it is right that a body who are not a commercial body, namely the Agricultural Institute, should have the power to borrow. To the best of my knowledge only one or two other non-commercial semi-State bodies in the entire public service have the right to borrow.  CERT and AnCO have the right to borrow money; otherwise the bodies having such right are only those who are themselves commercial and who are, supposedly at least, making a profit.  There is no doubt <Col N="381" /> that the Agricultural Institute in the direct sense are not making a profit. They are concerned with the expenditure of public money.  Somebody else may make profits out of the results of their work but they themselves do not make a profit.  Therefore they do not earn anything with which the debt can be repaid.  This unusual character in giving the body like the institute the right to borrow makes it all the more necessary that the controls that I am suggesting here be inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary has received permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the payment of public servants this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter.  The only manner in which I could raise this matter was to seek this time on the Adjournment.  The matter that concerned me was the position that I understand has arisen in which public servants normally in receipt of their payments on a weekly basis, normally in receipt of these payments today, have not been paid today.  I am anxious to know when they will be paid, why they have not received their normal cheques today, the reason for the delay and whether the non-receipt of cheques today is based on the involvement of some in the demonstration of last Tuesday, the half-day march through this city.  I was informed of this rather confused position only in the course of the afternoon. Therefore I want to thank the Chair for permitting me to raise it because it is a <Col N="382" /> matter of some concern to those affected.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that, as I understand the position, the cheques made out to those on weekly rates&mdash;and I understand the grades concerned are those from clerical officer to cleaner; this would be the range of people concerned in this delay of payment in Government Departments throughout the city&mdash;have not come to hand.  The cheques they normally receive on a Thursday are dated for the Friday.  In other words, they would receive their payments today with tomorrow's date.  The practical problem posed in the present situation is that there is no clarification of the position at this point in the afternoon for many of these families who depend on rather accurate information, whose family budgets are based on receipt of their cheque on a Thursday and cashing them early on Friday morning.  The predicament facing many of them at this point in the afternoon is that, for example, the cleaners leaving Government Buildings on the early shift tomorrow morning are not certain this afternoon that their cheques dated for tomorrow will be received tomorrow.</P>
      <P>There is at this point no clarification of that position.  It does not leave much to the imagination to appreciate the difficulties encountered in family budgets, of payments falling due on instalment, of payments falling due on food bills, shopping expeditions arranged for a particular time on Friday with no certainty of payment of the cheque on which that family budget depends.  Certainly it could be visualised that in the present rather difficult public transport situation in the city it could be a vital matter that a cheque normally paid on a Thursday should be paid out on that day.  If there is some difficulty or confusion relating to receipt of the cheque the people concerned should know this afternoon that at least they will be in receipt of that cheque before leaving their employment at whatever hour tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the reason.  Perhaps there is an adequate explanation.  If there is, certainly the fears of those concerned have not been appeased by any comprehensive explanation from official quarters.  Of course, people on one income <Col N="383" /> bracket may find it difficult to understand the plight of those on a lower one.  Perhaps the problems of a cleaner, or other lowly grade conventionally understood in the public service, is not a matter with which senior people should be too concerned.  But under the normal agreement in relation to the payment of a cleaner's wages it should be understood that that person's wages are as important to her family budget as may be any higher wage packet to any executive, at whatever level on the seniority ladder.  There may be a failure to understand the problems of low budget families at present, shown by the rather strange behaviour in relation to payments this week.</P>
    <P>We do not know whether this has to do with participation in the recent stoppage. We do know that the Civil and Public Services Staff Association wrote to the Minister for Finance on Tuesday informing him that their members would be taking industrial action for half that day.  I do not know what way the Minister received that news but there is no ambiguity about that association's attitude. They participated in the one-day stoppage.  They made no bones of the fact that they were willing to sacrifice half a day's pay for participation in a demonstration they supported fully. Therefore they were in industrial dispute with the Department for half that day.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister confirm or explain the appearance of an inquiry note in different Government Departments seeking the names of those who participated in Tuesday's demonstration?  Is it a fact that such a circular was issued?  Is it in the form of a circular?  If not in the form of a circular has any inquiry been started in various Departments seeking the names of those who participated in Tuesday's demonstration?  What is the purpose of any inquiry seeking the names of those who participated in Tuesday's demonstration?  Does participation in Tuesday's demonstration put a black mark against an individual who participated, against his or her promotion prospects in the future?</P>

      <P>The question deals with one specific matter&mdash;the <Col N="384" /> payment of cheques this week&mdash;and we cannot discuss other matters.  That has always been the rule of the House on Questions on the Adjournment&mdash;that Deputies must adhere to the matter raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>My predicament is that I was apprised only late this afternoon of the apparent difficulty of non-receipt of cheques by individuals in the Government service.  I have indicated the grade concerned.  One does not know the reason for this non-payment.  I surmise it has something to do with participation in the one-day dispute on Tuesday last. As I understand it, no official explanation has been given for withholding the presentation of cheques this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I have indicated some of the difficulties arising for those who have not received their cheques today, difficulties in the way of household budgetary problems and so on. For example, what is the position of a servant of this House, an usher, a group whose union did not participate in Tuesday's march, as they indicated to their members that a condition of their service was that they should not take part in that march?  They did not take part in the march; yet they did not receive their cheques today as usual. What happens to the man leaving his employment on the early shift tomorrow morning?  As I understand it, the latest word from the Department is that there is no guarantee that they will be receiving their cheques before 1 o'clock tomorrow. The banks close at 3 o'clock.  Again one can visualise the difficulties facing a family budgeting with such a mystery surrounding the weekly payment of one's cheque on a particular day of the week.</P>
      <P>Very relevant to this is the question of the approach of the Department of the Public Service to those who participated in Tuesday's march.  Have inquiries been instituted to discover the names of the public servants who participated?</P>

      <P>We do not know now whether employees in the grades concerned will receive their cheques from the Department.  Whatever the explanation, that is not conducive to the best relations between employees and management.  Throughout the public service there is a bad industrial relations situation at present.

      <P>What the Chair thinks does not arise.  We are only concerned with the payment of cheques <Col N="386" /> to public servants this week.  There is but one simple question before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions before the House in relation to this issue.  There is the question of human relations in the Department and an insensitive handling of a basic problem for many of the employees.  If management in outside industry withheld payment of pay on the customary day great difficulties would ensue; it would not improve relations between management and employees.  It will have a like adverse effect in the areas concerned on this occasion.  If there is not early payment to the grades affected tomorrow morning what are those involved to do?  Must they return later in the day for payment?  It must be remembered that they will have to contend with the bad transport system operating at present.  The people concerned have no clarification of the situation relating to the payment of their weekly cheques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many of those concerned the entire pay packet is earmarked for particular purchases weekly.  They must pay bills, instalments and purchase food items and the confusion in relation to payment is obviously a serious matter for them.  A curious insight into the way the Minister or his advisers think is the fact that no satisfactory explanation has been given to the employees concerned. The Minister will readily appreciate that a family person who is unsure of the time of the payment of his or her cheque has a legitimate complaint.  The legacy of this kind of behaviour in other employment would be to worsen relations between management and staff.  I have no doubt that this will add its own small quota of distrust in an already difficult situation in the public service.  It would have been better for all concerned had an adequate explanation been given for this unilateral change in the customary time for payment of cheques to those concerned.  Over many years cheques have been given to those on weekly pay rates on a Thursday.  They are dated for cashing on Friday but the fact that they are distributed on Thursday means that the families of those concerned can cash <Col N="387" /> the cheques early on Friday morning. That position was changed unilaterally this week, some days after a large demonstration in which many public servants took part, as they were entitled to do.  If inquiries have been set afoot seeking the identity of those who took part we should be given an explanation for them.  We all know that the public service is run on lines of great vigilance about the character and outside activities of those employed in the service. I suggest to the Minister that such inquiries should be abandoned as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had a satisfactory explanation for the departure from customary practice in the payment of cheques to those on weekly rates in the grades from clerical officer to cleaner.  A great deal of unease has been caused as a consequence and the sequel is that there will be further distrust in the Departments and areas concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, the facts of the situation are that the Accounts Branch of the Department of Finance pay the salaries of all the weekly paid staff of the central Departments and a number of other offices such as Leinster House, the Central Statistics Office, the Civil Service Commission and so on.  The number of persons involved is about 1,500 and the payments are processed by minicomputers. In this week there was a bank holiday on Monday and this reduced the time available for the preparation of weekly pay orders.  In the normal course of events this would not have affected the issue of payments because overtime working would have made good the time lost.  However, this week a large part of Tuesday last was also lost in addition to the overtime that might have been worked because the staff who were engaged on these duties absented themselves from duty from about noon onwards on that day.  I do not know at the moment whether it was entirely due to those participating in the <Col N="388" /> march on Tuesday or, to some extent, was contributed to, perhaps, by the fact that there was no heating in the offices. In any event, the staff concerned absented themselves from noon on Tuesday. The result was that it was not physically possible, even with working extended overtime on Wednesday, to have the payable orders ready to issue at the normal time on Thursday afternoon. Further overtime is being worked tonight.  Every effort has been and is being made to get those payable orders out.  They are, as Deputy O'Leary said, dated in the normal way for Friday although they are given out on the Thursday.</P>
      <P>Up to now about half of the orders have been completed and they are being distributed.  It is hoped to have the remainder issued by 10.30 tomorrow. Deputy O'Leary mentioned cleaners.  I understand that cleaners in Government Buildings have in fact received their cheques. Deputy O'Leary also referred to a circular.  I have no knowledge at this stage of the circular but, as you stated, the matter does not arise in regard to this question.  If it had I would have had some knowledge of it.</P>

He tells us about cleaners and the lowly paid and in a snide way suggests executives and, by implication, Ministers might not know what it meant to such people not to receive a cheque at the normal time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy did although he said executives.  I got the message all right.  I would like Deputy <Col N="389" /> O'Leary to know that I understand very well the problems of such people.  If he understands them what does he mean by encouraging and marching with people whose participation in the march caused this difficulty for cleaners and the lowly paid?  He then comes in here and tries to get another bite of the cherry by complaining about the results, which are the direct consequence of what he participated in, when every possible effort is being made to ensure that cleaners and lowly paid people in the civil service would not suffer?  Additional overtime has been worked and every possible effort has been made to meet this problem. It has been impossible.  I am not in the least bit impressed with the hypocritical performance of Deputy O'Leary who, having tried to get publicity on one side of the coin by marching on Tuesday, comes in here to shed those crocodile tears about the consequences of what he did on Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary can take it now.  I did not interrupt him for 20 minutes of waffle.  Let the Deputy not interrupt me because he is now beginning to get the message.  He cannot have it both ways.  Perhaps Deputy Barry Desmond had it right when he spoke and perhaps Deputy O'Leary should have listened to him.  The Deputy certainly cannot participate in a march and then, with any degree of credibility whatever, come into the House and complain about consequences which are a direct result of that march.  That is what Deputy O'Leary is trying to do, and he knows the truth of this.  I hope that his hypocrisy in this matter will be fully exposed. Every possible effort, physical effort <Col N="390" /> and every other effort which could be made, has been made and is being made to ensure that those people who are, as Deputy O'Leary says&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;among the lowly paid are not inconvenienced.  It has been impossible to avoid that inconvenience and hardship in some cases for those people because of the kind of thing that happened last Tuesday and in which Deputy O'Leary participated.</P>
      <P>Did he know that cleaners and other lowly paid would suffer or did he care? He tried to suggest that I do not know what they suffer.  I know.  Did he know? If he did, why did he not try to ensure that they did not suffer?  If he did not know, it means that he just went on regardless of the consequences.  I want to tell Deputy O'Leary one thing.  The people being talked about here are not the only people who have suffered as a result of what happened last Tuesday. People can say it is justifiable in the circumstances. It is not open to me at this stage to argue on that.  I can say that it ill behoves Deputy O'Leary to pose as one who is aiding and abetting what happened on Tuesday and then to come in here and complain about those who have suffered as a direct consequence of what happened last Tuesday.  Deputy O'Leary should now explain to the public how he justifies or attempts to justify his carryon when he now comes in to complain about the direct consequences of his activities last Tuesday.  As far as I am concerned, his performance on this is a clear illustration of the total lack of sincerity in his mad scramble to overcome Deputy John O'Connell in their race for the European Parliament.  It does not impress me and I hope it will not impress many other people.</P>

      <P>The site is a monastic enclosure comprising a portion of the boundary rampart, the foundations of a structure which was possibly a church, and a stone cross.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, it is a matter for each sanitary authority to determine the provision to be made to enable them to discharge their fire-fighting responsibilities. A comprehensive examination of the strength and adequacy of the fire services has been initiated by my Department and reviews of the service in each area are currently being conducted by the sanitary authorities concerned along lines indicated by the Department. These reviews include an assessment of the standards of fire cover provided in respect of special risks which would include industrial installations of the type referred to in the Deputy's question and this assessment would embrace the question of the adequacy of fire brigade staffing and equipment.</P>

      <P>The only rating concessions which are specifically designed for industrial premises and which would seem applicable to certain urban areas are those provided by section 9 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, as amended, and section 3 of the Industrial Development Act, 1972.  These allow local authorities, at their discretion, to grant a two-thirds remission of rates for ten years to new industrial premises provided in designated areas&mdash;within the meaning of the Industrial Development Acts&mdash;by, or by means of a grant from, the Industrial Development Authority.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation recently submitted a proposal to my Department requesting approval to depart from the terms of the 1978 national tenant purchase scheme in calculating the sale price of the house in question.  The proposal was fully considered in my Department and I understand that the nett sale price, calculated in accordance with the terms of the tenant purchase scheme, is appreciably less than the current market value of the house.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that a revision in the terms of sale would not be warranted.</P>
