      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the County Borough of Waterford (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1979, which was made by me on 8 November last.  The Order provides for the extension of the boundary of the City of Waterford to take in an area of County Waterford comprising some 7,544 acres approximately.</P>
      <P>The procedure for altering the boundary of Waterford city is governed by section 36 of the Waterford City Management Act, 1939.  A petition by Waterford Corporation under this Act was made to me on 22 May this year. On 4 July I approved the holding of a local inquiry which was held on 4 September last.  Waterford County Council and Corporation were both represented at the inquiry and all other interested parties were afforded an opportunity to express their views.  There were no objections to the proposed extension at the public hearing.  The proposed extension had already been agreed to by both the corporation and the county council.  The inspector in his report on the inquiry recommended that the proposed extension should go ahead without modification. I have considered this report and in view of the inspector's recommendation and the agreement between the local authorities concerned, have approved the extension as proposed without modification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> The hope is to have the present legislation enacted before the Christmas Recess so that the extension will come into force as from 1 January 1980; this, being the beginning of the financial year, is the date most suitable for both the local authorities and the one which will cause least inconvenience for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The main case made by Waterford Corporation in support of their petition was that the existing area of the city&mdash;2,613 acres&mdash;was totally inadequate to meet development needs.  Of this area only 84 acres is capable of further development.  In addition, the built-up area of the city has already spilled over its present boundary.  A form of ribbon development has arisen on the arterial routes including not only residential development but also commercial and industrial development.  At present, in the immediate environs of the city there are planning permissions for residential development in excess of 1,300 acres. Since 1973 the corporation have been obliged to purchase over 600 acres outside the city in order to satisfy their house building programme.  In recent years the designation of Waterford as a regional growth centre and the realisation of this with expanding industrial development has also emphasised the need for the expansion of the city.</P>
    <P>The area to be added to the city under the provisional order is contiguous to the existing city boundary and includes the electoral divisions of Ballynakill, Kilotteran, Kilbarry and Waterford Rural. They all form a coherent unit and can be related to a convenient boundary.  Apart from an extension in 1966 which added some 520 acres to the city and minor extensions in 1944 and 1955, the boundary of Waterford City has remained unchanged since 1896.</P>
    <P>As I already mentioned, Waterford County Council have accepted the need for the proposed extension and agreement has been reached between the city and county authorities on all aspects of the matter including a financial settlement. The order also contains a number <Col N="1036" /> of provisions which are consequential on the extension.  These are along the usual lines and provide for the preparation of official maps of the extended city area, the continuation in effect of resolutions and orders, as appropriate, arrangements in regard to the register of electors, employment and hours of trading orders and development plans.  I understand that the corporation are busy preparing a new development plan for the added area which will be put on display as soon as the extension is effective.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I ask for the co-operation of Deputies in ensuring that it will have a speedy passage so that the boundary extension can become effective on 1 January next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and thank the Minister and his officials who have efficiently and expeditiously brought this Bill before both Houses. This Bill confirms the order to be made in respect of the extension of the Waterford city boundary into the country on 1 January 1980.  The efficiency with which this matter has been dealt is something we could wish to see more of in government, especially in local government. The petition which was lodged only this year is now being acceded to.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the extension are well known.  The area of the existing city is 2,613 acres.  The increase is substantial, involving 7,544 acres.  The city will now be four times its present size and will cover an area of 10,157 acres.  That is needed if the administration of the city as it develops in the coming decades is to be monitored correctly.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need that one planning body&mdash;in this case the Waterford Corporation&mdash;be given responsibility for the overall development of the city. From the point of view of planning permission it is essential that one local authority have this responsibility.  At present a draft plan is in train and hopefully it will be confirmed by the corporation early next year.  It is important to know the direction we are going when planning industrial and housing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other problems I would like <Col N="1037" /> to mention, including the provision of a high level bridge.  This has been clearly set down as a priority by Waterford Corporation.  Allied to the high bridge is a series of ring and service roads throughout the city.  These are essential if the city is to progress in the coming decades in a rational and sensible way.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed to note from the recent White Paper on roads that the high level bridge cannot be expected until the end of 1980.  That is most unfortunate and is a retrograde step as far as the future development of Waterford city and its environs is concerned.  The Minister knows the necessity of a high level bridge.  He received a deputation and I asked a number of questions about it.  I am not very happy about the progress made to date.  There is slight disagreement on the procedure between the corporation and the Minister.  We hoped the final design of the bridge would be sanctioned by the Minister, and he considers that proper acquisition should be first implemented.  For some peculiar reason we have not resolved the proper procedure in relation to this high level bridge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a high level bridge does not come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely referring to the reasons for the further extension.  I will not delay the House further.  There is a need for an extension to ensure that the planning of the ring roads to service that bridge can be fully understood by those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standing of Waterford city was referred to by the Minister.  He said Waterford is a regional growth centre. That is correct, but we do not seem to be benefiting from that decision.  Since this Government came into office the unemployment situation in that city has not changed to any extent.  There are only 100 fewer unemployed since 1977.  That is not what one would expect of a regional growth centre.  The Minister referred to this for some peculiar reason and said&mdash;<Col N="1038" /> In recent years the designation of Waterford as a regional growth centre and the realisation of this with expanding industrial development has also emphasised the need for the expansion of the city. </P>
    <P>While we are certainly planning in that direction, we do not seem to be getting the backing of central government in ensuring the continued growth as a regional growth centre.  One of the best contributions the Minister could make in this respect would be to ensure a proper decentralisation of government services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not cover all aspects in relation to Waterford.  The Bill deals with the extension of the boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to Waterford as a regional growth centre and I am briefly replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave reasons for the extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into detail.  I will refer to this in passing.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to back up the decision to make Waterford a regional growth centre by ensuring that there is a proper decentralisation within the government services, State and semi-State bodies, to ensure that Waterford get their fair share of any jobs that are going.</P>
      <P>In March 1978 the corporation petitioned the Minister for two extensions. The first was to Waterford County Council for 7,544 acres&mdash;this is the one we are dealing with today and which has been acceded to&mdash;and the second was to Kilkenny County Council in respect of 3,688 acres.  This was objected to by the Kilkenny County Council in no uncertain terms.  They took a very negative and irrational decision to object to the proposed extension in the direction of Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The natural environs of Waterford go into Kilkenny.  If one asked where Clover Meats or the National Board and Paper Mills were situated one would <Col N="1039" /> probably be told they are in Waterford. The Waterford golf club is also in County Kilkenny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This has nothing to do with the extension of the boundaries of Waterford.  This is a Private Bill dealing with a specific matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely referring to the original petition lodged with the Minister.  It is unfortunate that the Kilkenny acres have not been agreed, because we would have a greater Waterford area under one planning authority, and serviced and administered by one authority.  At present Waterford are selling services to parts of County Kilkenny.  It is unfortunate that the global extension was not dealt with at the same time and so remove the necessity of having to come back to the House at a later stage with another petition.</P>
      <P>There is at present a petition lying in his Department in respect of County Kilkenny.  The Minister will have to consider it and make a decision to hold an inquiry.  I ask him to do this sooner rather than later, because there is an importance attaching to the matter and it relates primarily to the proper rational administration of the whole developing area of Waterford city.  Hopefully, members of Kilkenny County Council will accede to our request in the light of reason.  I will not say any more than that lest I incur the wrath of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the boundary within County Waterford is to take place on I January 1980.  It is at the beginning of the financial and rating year and that is sensible.  The financial adjustments between the county council and the corporation have been agreed to.  The compensation agreed to be paid for loss of revenue to Waterford County Council is £975,000 to be paid in ten annual instalments of £97,500.  I wonder if the principle of compensation is reasonable.  I understand that in some States in America where an extension is necessary it is <Col N="1040" /> made and there is no compensation. Neither the county council nor Waterford Corporation is in the business of making profit.  The net result of the extension of the Waterford Corporation area is that huge development expenditure will have to be entered into by the corporation.  The concept of compensation is open to question and perhaps at some later stage some Minister might be enlightened enough to introduce a concept that compensation is not necessary when county boundaries are extended.</P>
    <P>The problems which arise for ratepayers affected in the county council within the extended area is dealt with in the Bill.  The corporation rate is 71p more than the county council rate.  Three years are being allowed to bring the rate up in the county to the level of the city. In 1980 the new area will pay 92.7 per cent of the city rate, in 1981 it will be 95.1 per cent and in 1982 it will be 97.6 per cent.  In the fourth year there will be parity with the city and the extended area.  This does not affect private dwellings. Householders are exempted from paying rates and have no liability in respect of them.  At present under the county council system householders pay water rates of £17 per year to Waterford County Council.  This rate will be done away with and there will be a saving for many people in that area.  In Drogheda the difference in the rates was so large that a 15-year period was decided on to effect the change because of the extension of the boundary.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of electoral areas resulting from the order which the Minister is making consequent on this Bill.  The wards or electoral areas as they are properly called are lobsided. Electoral area No. 1 has approximately 5,700 voters, electoral area No. 2 has approximately 6,700 voters and electoral area No. 3 has approximately 8,500 voters.  The system which the Minister has used is perpetuating this lobsidedness and that is most unfortunate. The line going out the old Portlaw Road does not add any votes to electoral area No. 1.  That is an extension of the present line going up the Yellow Road, to use a <Col N="1041" /> local name.  The other line is along the Old Tramore Road, east of Ballindud. That settles the existing boundary line used to a large extent out the Old Tramore Road which means that electoral area No. 3 will not get many new voters.  The bulk of the new population, approximately 4,650 people, affected by the extension will now be resident in the present electoral area No. 3.  Something will have to be done by way of ministerial order to balance the population between the three electoral areas for local election purposes.  There is a complete imbalance and the Minister has a duty to redress this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The other question I should like to raise relates to property.  As a layman I am somewhat puzzled by this.  Section 6 (1) of the schedule states:</P>
    <P>The County Council and the Corporation may from time to time as occasion requires, make an equitable adjustment (in this article referred to as an agreed adjustment) in regard to any matter or thing requiring to be adjusted between the County Council and the Corporation in consequence of the inclusion of the added area in the City and not otherwise provided for by this Order and in particular may make such agreed adjustment in regard to property whether real or personal (including choses-in-action), vested in or belonging to or held in trust for the County Council.... </P>
    <P>Would the Minister explain what is covered in this area?  What happens to county council property situated in city areas?  Will there be a further financial deal between the county council and the corporation?  What is the position of St. Otteran's Cemetery which is on the border of the city but within the county council area at present?  Who will be the administrator of it?</P>
    <P>This is an example I take because it is something in which I have a particular interest.  Who will now be responsible for the management of St. Otteran's cemetery?  I know this is a specific problem with which probably the <Col N="1042" /> Minister is not <i>au fait;</i> he has more on his mind now than cemeteries.  I should like to know the purpose of article 6 in the Provisional Order because there are problems relating to property, real, personal or choses in action such as rights of way and so on.  It is an area which I should like the Minister to explain further.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister and his officials for their expeditious examination and treatment of this matter.  I can assure the Minister that the extension is necessary for the proper development of the greater Waterford city area.  The city will now become, if you like, a city with a legal population of 37,250.  If the extension had been allowed on the Kilkenny side it would have brought the population up to 40,000.  This is a reflection of the correct size of Waterford as a city.  I hope the Government will realise that we are a major city but we are not getting the support we feel is necessary from the central government.  I say that in a general sense, not a party political sense.  Waterford is potentially a very prosperous city.  The confidence needed in it certainly has not been expressed in money and resource terms by the central government to date, and we look for some more positive commitment on the part of the central government in regard to the future of Waterford city.</P>
    <P>Finally, I assure the Minister that in consequence of this boundary extension a proper draft plan will be laid down and accepted by the corporation and that the infrastructure development required of any major developing city will be established in a very professional and rational way.  I pay tribute here to Waterford city manager, Mr. Michael Doody, the city engineer, Mr. Pat Flood and the city planner, Mr. Michael Gough, who have done trojan work together with other members of the corporation staff.  In initiating this extension and generally in the management of Waterford city they have given firstclass service.  They are now fully involved in the draft development plan for the added area, and I am prepared to say that their competence will not be <Col N="1043" /> equalled by any other person in the local services.  I am fully confident that the new draft plan will give an added dimension to the future development of Waterford city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill and thank the Minister and his staff for the expeditious manner in which it has been handled.  He will not take exception to it if I say that the co-operation between the two local authorities concerned was a big factor in getting this Bill so quickly to the House.  It proves that both authorities are very anxious to ensure that the growth and development going on in Waterford will be greatly facilitated by the extension of the borough boundary.</P>
      <P>I know that the Chair ruled out reference to Kilkenny County Council by Deputy Collins, but in passing I must say that I am disappointed with the members of Kilkenny County Council. Let us hope the passing of this Bill will show them what co-operation and liaison between local authorities could do in the future to help.  Like Deputy Collins I feel sure that nobody here will want to delay the passage of this Bill through the House as quickly as possible. Again, I thank the Minister and compliment him and his staff on their handling of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in welcoming this Bill.  It is nice to know that the matter was settled by agreement, without hassle or argument, and that the local authorities involved acted in a mature way and as a result eliminated the type of delay which we had with previous boundary extensions.  I understand, for instance, that the Drogheda boundary extension which was passed in 1976 took some 15 years to finalise.  In the case of Waterford this extension has been spoken about for the past two years and I think it has proceeded as rapidly as was possible&mdash;not that it has been entirely satisfactory but under the type of local government machinery we have it went ahead as quickly as one could expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> Waterford city is a centre which in many ways has been stagnant if not decadent&mdash;in the physical sense&mdash;for far too many years.  I hope the boundary extension will revitalise the city which was, and should be one of the primary centres in the State as regards population and industry. But somehow it has fallen behind in the tremendous national progress made over the past 20 years and particularly in the past 15 years.  Whereas other centres have gone ahead by leaps and bounds Waterford and its people have been left behind.  I hope this boundary extension will lead to the type of development that has been lacking and which is needed, the type of development that has brought Cork to the forefront as a very strong second to Dublin as regards industrial development and as a growth centre.  I hope Waterford will attain its rightful position in comparison with areas like Limerick, another area that has made tremendous progress in the past 15 years, as indeed Galway has also.</P>
    <P>When I was going to school not so many years ago the population in Waterford city was 28,000 people, whereas Galway city had a population of something like 8,000.  From our point of view in Waterford it is sad to relate that the present population is slightly over 30,000 whereas the population in Galway city has jumped to about 35,000 or 36,000.  The Minister will excuse me if I am somewhat envious of the progress that Galway has made in the intervening years, but Waterford has not had the same breaks in terms of industries, national institutes or Government Departments being directed towards it as other centres here have.  I hope this situation is reversed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Waterford County Council, of which I have been a member for some years, have been most accommodating in agreeing to this extension.  But, of course, the corporation in return have had to agree to pay a certain amount of compensation. That is not an easy thing for them to do.  In these days of financial restraint on local authorities due to the change in the rating system, it is not easy <Col N="1045" /> for a relatively small city like Waterford to meet the type of financial demand in terms of compensation which is being demanded, and justly so, because the council are losing a valuable strip of territory and, like anybody in such a situation, they want to be financially compensated.  I would have preferred if the Minister could have borne the brunt of the compensation in this case because there are a number of major capital projects listed for Waterford city which must be affected by the large compensation that has to be paid in this case. Among the huge undertakings are the building of a new bridge and a new water supply system which is presently in the course of construction and is near completion. These projects are costing millions of pounds.  In addition to that, the corporation have committed themselves to a heavy financial commitment with regard to a new airport and, again, the capital expenditure involved is tremendous.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for such a limited local authority to provide millions of pounds for a number of different projects.  It is time the Minister and the officials in his Department went about devising means by which such heavy expenditure could be largely covered by a contribution from the central funds.  The rating system, as restructured recently, is an inhibiting factor to the growth and development of large provincial towns and certain cities.  I would hope that we could have some revision of the present financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Kilkenny County Council did not agree to the extension requested in their case.  It is not as great as that on the Waterford side, but nevertheless it is considerable. Waterford is badly hemmed in at the moment and it needs to develop, not just on one side of the river but on both sides. It is a mistake on the part of the representatives in Kilkenny who have opposed the move.  It would be for the betterment of the people in the area concerned if they were included in Waterford city because that area is a natural hinterland of Waterford city.  I can understand <Col N="1046" /> the fears of politicians whether local or national that they are going to lose votes.  Perhaps the authorities in Kilkenny County Council may feel they would lose an undue amount of rate revenue.  But, as I have said, in Waterford county they will be compensated by the city and I presume Kilkenny would be compensated likewise.</P>
    <P>I feel that the fears of politicians have, more than anything else, affected the proposal and it is unfair to the people in the area concerned.  I do not know what is the best way to arrive at a decision in such a case.  Over the years there have been squabbles of the same nature in Cork city and county, because the city was looking for a sizeable extension into the county.  The same thing has happened in Limerick where the city was looking for an extension which would embrace part of County Clare.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this and can appreciate the resistance which Waterford Corporation are experiencing from the authorities and the elected representatives in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I wish there was some mechanism devised whereby that resistance could be broken down, the people of the area more easily satisfied and the whole thing worked out for the betterment of everybody involved.  Perhaps a referendum could be held in such an area to decide whether they should stay as they are or move into the city.  It would be worth thinking about.  Surely we should be concerned about the people living in the area and not about the handful of people thinking of their vested interests. We should be concerned about the common good of the area at large, and by that I mean the adjacent county area together with the city.  That should be of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>This extension is badly needed.  I said that it had gone through as quickly as possible under existing legislation, but it has still been quite slow because of the complicated process involved.  Due to that holdup people in County Waterford who are now being transferred to Waterford city have suffered to quite a degree in that the county council, knowing that <Col N="1047" /> the transfer was about to take place, did not provide necessary and essential services on the scale required.  I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind in future cases and improve or increase the speed with which a transfer takes place even if there is all round agreement.  In the area concerned, in which there are some 4,650 people, there are a number of mainly new housing estates&mdash;Viewmount, Avondale, Grange Heights, Ballybeg, Glenville and the general area around Ardkeen Hospital.  Most of these are new housing estates, some built by private enterprise and others, particularly Ballybeg, built by the local authority.  Strangely enough the local authority in this case is Waterford city, whereas Ballybeg is in the county.</P>
    <P>The city has had its spillover problem for a number of years and the corporation have been building their local authority houses in another local authority's area.  That is not satisfactory. Services which should have been provided on a proper scale have been neglected.  I regret to say that, as a member of Waterford County Council, I am probably one of those people who are partly to blame because obviously the county council knew that this area was going into the city and they sat back and said &ldquo;We will not do this, we will not do that, we will wait until it is transferred to the city and leave them to look after it&rdquo;. The Minister will appreciate that a delay, even as short as it has been in this area, although I should not call a two-year delay short, can have detrimental effects. It is not fair that the people concerned should have to suffer.</P>
    <P>For instance, we will take the usual type of services provided by a local authority which have not been provided on a scale which the public could expect. I am referring to simple things like refuse collection and the provision of footpaths and street lighting which have been neglected badly in these areas.  A proper water supply should be provided.  The water supply generally is giving rise to problems in the city and in the areas bordering on the county which have suffered <Col N="1048" /> unduly because of their situation for the past two years.  They can only be described as &ldquo;no man's land&rdquo;.  They are going from one place and they have not yet been accepted by the other local authority and, therefore, they have an inferior service.  Green spaces, playing pitches and so on have not been provided on a rational basis.  If the Minister cannot improve the speed of the legislation, surely he should set up some mechanism to ensure that no area such as this no man's land is left, as it has been for several years, in a state of disorganisation without essential services.  I hope that from 1 January next this situation will improve dramatically, as I think it will.  I have great confidence in Waterford Corporation.  I am convinced that they will see to it that these people will get the same level of service as does everybody else within the city boundaries. Generally speaking, the people concerned were originally from the city area but because of urban decay and necessary rehousing they have to go into that county area.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to electoral areas.  He said that obviously there will have to be some redrawing of boundaries. There will be a tremendous imbalance because all the extension is taking place on the one side of the city and so areas will have to be arranged in order to have a logical pattern.  If the city is to be left as a three-ward electoral division, there will have to be major changes in the boundary lines of those three wards.  While 4,650 people will be moving from the county into the city, 2,884 electors will be going from the county to the city.  That means in layman's or politician's language 2,884 voters will be going from the county into the city.  I serve notice here today that I intend to go in and stay with them.  I am from the county and I am not going to leave those people to the city politicians.  I am going to stay with them for as long as is physically possible.</P>
    <P>This is a sizeable number, and here a very interesting point arises on which I would appreciate a sympathetic hearing from the Minister.  The point is that, as <Col N="1049" /> they stand, Waterford Corporation have 15 members, five for each of the three wards.  One of those wards all of a sudden is going to have a vastly increased population although it has still only five elected representatives.  On the other hand, the area going into the city comes entirely from the Tramore electoral area which has seven seats on Waterford County Council.  Is it fair that the elected representatives for the Tramore area should lose virtually 3,000 voters or 3,000 of their constituents and not be in a position to represent them after six months following their election to the county council?  Those 3,000 people voted certain individuals to the county councils but from now on they will find that those whom they voted may not be able to represent them further.  Deputy Kenneally and Deputy Collins are in the happy position that they are on both the corporation and the county council, so their dual-purpose role&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>So they will be well looked after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I might take care of them even better.  Their dual-purpose role does not create any problem, but what about the other five county councillors involved? Some of them see their political base taken from underneath their feet and for the next five years they will be in a state of limbo politically speaking. That is not fair.  The Minister should make some reciprocal arrangement with the corporation to see that the elected representatives for the area which is now going into the city will be allowed a place, a seat&mdash;whatever is the appropriate word&mdash;on Waterford Corporation. It will not affect all of the remaining five, it will affect some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to hold out some hope that those elected representatives will be given an opportunity to represent from now on all the people who elected them.  One of those <Col N="1050" /> councillors is living in the very centre of the area which is being transferred from the county to the city.  I am sure not one Deputy in this House would tolerate that position or let it pass without getting up and speaking at length most vehemently to defend his position.  I would like the Minister in this instance to do the same for the people who have not got a voice in this Dáil Chamber.  While we today are chopping off a considerable number of people who have elected them, they themselves have no say as to how those people are to be looked after for the next four-and-a-half years at least.  Extensions of boundaries create problems and anomalies and this is one such case.  I trust that the Minister can hold out some hope in the future for an improvement or the elimination of these anomalies.  We will all be delighted if he can do something to improve the two very unsatisfactory situations to which I have referred at some length.  First, there is the question of the period between the time of the request for a transfer up to the time of the actual transfer and, secondly, the question of the local representative who, despite having been elected, will not have the opportunity of representing the people who elected him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is almost like intruding in a family dispute.  However, I wish to compliment the Minister for having dealt so quickly with this request. The House should recognise this.  In a question yesterday I asked the Minister if he would consider speeding up the procedures for boundary extensions generally for cities such as Waterford which are forced to expand into adjoining areas.  The Minister indicated that he would try to meet that request.  We in the Labour Party welcome this recognition of the growth of Waterford city and the fact that the extension of the boundaries will enable the corporation to co-ordinate all the services needed instead of having the anomalous situation that Deputy Deasy referred to whereby people are living in local authority housing belonging to one authority but being residents of another authority.  The same sort of situation occurs in other parts of <Col N="1051" /> the country but hopefully the extension provided for here will meet the expanding needs of Waterford city at least up to the end of the century.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their co-operation and also for the compliments they paid to officials of my Department.  Deputy Collins referred to the proposed extension to County Kilkenny.  Since agreement has been reached so quickly between Waterford Corporation and the county council but not with Kilkenny regarding the extension there, it was decided to treat the matters separately and to allow the Waterford extension into the county to go ahead.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of financial compensation, agreement has been reached between the two local authorities in this instance, but the question of a re-examination in this regard in the future has been raised with a view to relieving the local authorities of that burden. The matter will be examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether the present arrangement can be improved on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins asked for a further explanation in respect of the property of the county council in the added area. There is provision in Article 6 for agreement on any matters relating to property between the two local authorities concerned. The same Deputy referred to electoral areas.  These can be re-arranged easily before the next elections which are due to take place in 1984.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy complimented the local authorities on their <Col N="1052" /> handling of the extension.  I, too, would like to compliment them in this regard. The Deputy suggested also that to some extent the county council had neglected the services of this added area in the intervening period.  I do not know whether that is correct but the Deputies would be more familiar with the situation. However, the present petition for an extension could hardly have been dealt with more speedily than has been the case so that the intervening period was very short.

Surely by way of ministerial order the Minister could arrange to accommodate the people in question.  Such a solution might solve the problem in this regard in other areas that would be affected similarly.  In this specific proposed extension, south Kilkenny comes into consideration.  I am of the very definite view that that extension was not agreed to because of a fear on the part of local politicians that they would lose a large number of their votes. Surely some mechanism can be devised whereby people who were elected six months ago to represent thousands of people in their own local areas should be allowed to continue that representation.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the second ACP-EEC Convention, signed on 31st October, 1979, together with the related internal agreement on the measures and procedures for implementation of the Convention and the internal agreement on the financing and administration of Community aid, signed on 20th November, 1979, copies of which have been laid before the Dáil. </P>
      <P>Before proceeding to outline some of the outstanding features of the new convention, first, I should like briefly to take the opportunity to place it in its overall political and Community context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unique scope and impetus attach to the Community's policy of special relationships with developing countries. <Col N="1055" /> Following on the two Yaounde Conventions which were in effect before enlargement, the ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé was signed in 1975.  This was a very major step forward in Community development co-operation policy in all respects and established a new phase in relations between developed and developing countries.  It was hailed at the time as a model for such relations.</P>
    <P>The first Lomé Convention between the Community and 46 African, Caribbean and Pacific States, granted free, non-reciprocal access to Community markets in respect of virtually all ACP products, made available very considerable financial and technical assistance, embodied a scheme for stabilising ACP countries' export earnings from a range of important basic products and contained many other provisions covering all aspects of Community-ACP relations.</P>
    <P>The first Lomé convention that was signed took effect in a spirit of euphoria. However, over the past four-and-a-half years of its operation the steadily deteriorating international economic climate has badly dented our confidence and buoyancy.  The Lomé Convention has not proved to be a panacean remedy for all development problems being experienced by all ACP States.  When we began last year to negotiate the second convention, the Community's approach was to a great extent determined by the fact that the economic foundations of the industrialised world had shifted, resulting in a greatly narrowed margin for manoeuvre in all countries' economic policies and programmes.</P>
    <P>The Community's development co-operation policies as a whole which we are trying with great care to build up and expand so that they can be of meaningful assistance to developing countries in their efforts towards growth and well-being can be frustrated&mdash;and could even be swept aside&mdash;by the international recession whose breath we feel about us. Therefore, in this climate we began with the ACP states last year to evaluate the model experiment that had been the first Lomé Convention to see what should <Col N="1056" /> succeed it.  Our joint examination was conducted in a hard-headed, pragmatic way in the knowledge that whatever resources could be committed to the new convention should be put to the best possible use to the maximum benefit of the ACP countries.</P>
    <P>We were agreed that the Lomé framework should be at least the basis of the new convention and we negotiated it in the light of our experience, our overall aspirations and within the limitations imposed by the overall restraints I mentioned earlier.  The negotiations were protracted and difficult.  Whereas the Community's overall objective was to consolidate the provisions of the existing convention and, where possible and in the light of experience, to adjust and extend them, in many areas ACP expectations far exceeded our ability to respond or greatly differed from what we considered to be wise or practicable.  These gaps in approach and perspective proved in many cases to be very difficult to bridge.  However, the vigorous and often heated exchanges by their nature and because of the very frank and open atmosphere that guaranteed that no new idea went untested, ensured that consolidations and new elements we have agreed on reflect the best solutions that both sides could agree on.</P>
    <P>The Community and the ACP states as partners assessed the prevailing international factors, and those within the Community and ACP states, and taking them into account we built the new convention. With regard to its substance, Deputies have been provided with a detailed summary of its contents.  I would like to express the trust the Community has in it, and our desire that it be implemented in a dynamic manner, for the greatest benefit of all those who are party to it.</P>
    <P>In the trade sector, we invite the full exploitation by the ACP states of the Community's markets which are virtually open on a non-reciprocal basis. The trade promotion provisions are there to be used fully so that access to the world's greatest market-place can benefit the ACP states' balances of trade and payments, their employment situation <Col N="1057" /> and, ultimately, their overall well-being.</P>
    <P>STABEX was an interesting experiment, and one which in its operation proved most valuable and durable.  The Lomé I provisions have been added to and improved.  In addition, the new systems for mineral products, which represents one of the major innovations of Lomé II, could certainly afford considerable benefits to ACP states which as yet have not benefited from the STABEX system.</P>
    <P>Industrial co-operation under Lomé I could have yielded greater results.  However, I have confidence that modernisation of the instruments of co-operation, together with our common desire to succeed, will result in major advances in this sector under Lomé II.</P>
    <P>It was, I believe, a judicious decision on the part of the ACP states to use 40 per cent of the Fourth European Development Fund to improve agricultural structures. The Community is particularly pleased with the new chapter on agricultural co-operation.  We hope that the joint ACP-EEC sub-Committee on Agricultural Co-operation will prove to be the focal point of agricultural development and will constitute a powerful instrument of progress in this sector.</P>
    <P>With regard to the volume of aid, we have sought to maintain in real terms and even improve the value of the convention, despite the difficulty we had in doing so.  Also, the modernisation of the financial instrument, which ensures that there is an ever-increasing ACP involvement in the management of those resources, is a welcome and significant step.  It is the community's hope that the new ACP-EEC Committee on Financial Co-operation, provided for in Article 108, will be set up as quickly as possible and that it will successfully fulfil its purpose.</P>
    <P>The details of Community financial assistance to the ACP states under the new Convention are as follows.  The overall amount available to the ACP countries will be 5,227 million European Units of Account&mdash;approximately IR£3,504 million.  This amount will come from 4,542m EUA for a new European Development Fund (EDF) to <Col N="1058" /> be set up under the new convention and 685 mEUA to be loaned by the European Investment Bank (EIB) from its own resources.  Outside the convention provision is also being made within the new EDF, as in the present fund, for financial assistance to the overseas countries and territories in the sum of 109 mEUA&mdash;IR£73 million&mdash;94 mEUA from the new fund and 15 mEUA in loans from the EIB.</P>
    <P>It is provided that member states should stand surety for loans granted by the EIB.  This surety is restricted to 75 per cent of the total amount of the credit lines opened by the bank through loan contracts and will be the subject of contracts between each member state and the bank.  Repayments to be made by the ACP states and the OCTs in respect of special loans and risk capital transactions will in principle be made to the member states.  The Council will, however, be able to decide unanimously to place such sums in reserve or to allocate them to other operations.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to the new European Development Fund will be 27,816 mEUA.  This is equivalent to IR£18.6 million or approximately 0.6 per cent of the total.  It is expected that the EDF will be disbursed over a period of about eight years.  Ireland's contribution to the Community Budget in respect of expenses of Commission Delegates in the ACP states will be IR£1 million spread over five years.</P>
    <P>In the new convention we also have joint bodies on institutional matters in order to ensure that the provisions of the convention are satisfactorily implemented. The ACP-EEC Council of Ministers is a permanent meeting place for the representatives of all the Governments concerned.  The Consultative Assembly and Joint Committee provide invaluable contributions to the Council's work.</P>
    <P>Looked at from the national point of view, participation in the Community-ACP relationship represents a very great broadening of our relations with developing countries.  Ireland has recent experience of the problems&mdash;and potential&mdash;of developing countries and we like to think that our national contribution <Col N="1059" /> has some particular importance in deepening our mutual understanding. The ACP states perceive Ireland within the Community group in a special way and it is a symbol of considerable significance that both conventions were signed under the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Through the Convention nearly 60 ACP states have come to learn a great deal about Ireland and our present and potential role in international relations in the field of development co-operation. Similarly Ireland has through the convention the means of becoming much more familiar with all the ACP states and with their development problems as a whole and individually.  The new familiarity has material significance also in that it is a positive contribution towards much greater direct Irish participation in the actual work of the new convention.  Our own development process has resulted in a considerable national resource in expertise over the whole spectrum of national development.</P>
    <P>In many areas this expertise is directly applicable to the development problems of developing countries although, of course, the precise nature of those problems may in many cases be different. This resource, together with the goodwill prevailing in the developing countries toward Ireland, can be utilised on a wide scale in a framework such as the ACP-EEC relationship to the mutual benefit of both Ireland and the ACP countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to the Lomé Convention should not, therefore, be seen as confined to our involvement in its negotiation, important as that was, or to our financial contribution to its implementation. The convention is a vital living arrangement designed to consolidate and develop a unique relationship between the European Community and the African, Caribbean and Pacific States.  It is a major opportunity for Ireland, as a member state of the community, to involve itself actively in the practical implementation of the convention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> Perhaps the most obvious way in which Ireland can make a positive contribution to the success of the new convention is through full participation in the development projects funded by the 5th European Development Fund (EDF), established as part of the convention. Under the 4th EDF, which is the first in which they have been eligible to participate, Irish firms and organisations, both in the private and public sector, have made, and are continuing to make, valuable contributions to the convention's technical assistance programme in areas such as the training, management, architectural and engineering consultancy areas.  Their involvement, which has been in a previously rather unfamiliar and often quite difficult and highly competitive working environment, is highly commendable.</P>
    <P>They have, I think, found their experience generally a rewarding one, both from the work satisfaction and, let it be said also, from the financial point of view.  Furthermore, through their participation they have created a favourable impression of Irish capability among those concerned which should be conducive to greater involvement on the part of Irish concerns in the future.  Certainly, the experience gained under Lomé I means that we are now better placed to participate in this aspect of the new convention then we were at the equivalent stage of the previous one.</P>
    <P>Under the current fund, Irish firms and organisations had, up to the end of June last, won contracts under its technical assistance programme to the value of 2.566 million units of account, or approximately £1.72 million.  This was the equivalent of some 2.2 per cent of all such contracts awarded to Community firms, at a time when 70 per cent of that element of the fund had been committed.  I would expect that, by the time the total allocation has been made, business of the order of 3.25 million units of account or £2.18 million will have been obtained by Irish concerns.</P>
    <P>In addition, therefore, to the developmental aspects of the fund, it must also be acknowledged that it represents a not <Col N="1061" /> inconsiderable potential source of foreign earnings to the economy.  I am particularly conscious of this fact and my Department have been assisting and promoting Irish participation in EDF projects in liaison with the appropriate semi-State and representative bodies as well as directly with interested Irish concerns.</P>
    <P>The new fund, which in total will be worth 5.607 million units of account&mdash;£3.756 million approximately&mdash;an increase of 62 per cent over its predecessor, is a potential source of further business for Irish firms and organisations.  I would urge that those in a position to do so give serious consideration to seeking to participate in projects under the fund, not only in the technical assistance area, where nationally we are best placed to make a contribution, but also in the more difficult works and supply end, where Irish firms have not as yet made any impact. My Department are both ready and keen to assist those firms and organisations interested in any way appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have indicated in the course of my remarks that the final negotiations were protracted and difficult.  On behalf of the Presidency, I should like to pay special tribute to my co-President on the ACP side, Deputy Prime Minister St. John from Barbados with whom I was in very regular contact over the past weeks and months leading to the final negotiations. As I said, the Irish involvement is a matter of considerable significance.  It opens up new avenues with our partners on the ACP side.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware that two days ago I announced the names of the newly constituted Development Advisory Council within whose terms of reference this will also be a very important development.  We are at a very significant stage of this continuing development in our development policies.  The fact that we are one of the first countries to bring this before our Parliament for ratification will be evidence that we have fulfilled our responsibilities to the best of our ability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me initially acknowledge the part played by our Minister for Foreign Affairs in the completion of the Lomé II negotiations.  I should like to put on the record of the House a tribute to him and his staff for the work done in completing the very difficult and protracted negotiations.  He came in at a late stage and grasped the problems very quickly and succeeded in achieving a compromise at a stage when it seemed that was not possible.</P>
      <P>In 1975 Lomé I was signed.  It was a remarkable coincidence that the first convention was signed during the first Irish Presidency.  Lomé I was a milestone in that it was a major step on the road towards achieving a real consensus between the developing and the developed countries.  It established a new relationship.  In the years to come it will be regarded as a major breakthrough. Having said that, it is quite clear that the convention did not achieve all that the ACP countries hoped to achieve.  The limitations showed up as the years went on.  There was a considerable degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the ACP countries as the convention ran out.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the first convention did not contribute as much as it was expected to contribute from the point of view of providing security for the developing countries and from the point of view of enabling them to develop their economies.  We must accept that the second convention is a further milestone but we have to look at it in the overall context of the obligations of the richer nations of the world to the poorer nations of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant to look at the concept of development aid in the context of a world which spends $400 billion a year on arms, a world that has 36 million men under arms, a further 25 million men in reserve forces and a further 30 million people in military-related occupations. Each year there is an expenditure of $30 billion on arms and military research, a figure that is greater that the entire amount spent in research on health, food, education and energy.  We have to <Col N="1063" /> look at this backlog when we consider the amount of money being put into aid by the developed world.  Then we have to look at the contrast in the poorer parts of the world where there are one billion people living in utterly inhuman and degrading conditions.  In the year 1979 alone, 50 million people will die from starvation.  Associated with the starvation and death there are the problems of malnutrition, infant mortality, illiteracy and all the ills that human flesh is heir to.</P>
    <P>It is against that backdrop that we have to consider our efforts in regard to development aid.  If we are not convinced by those figures that there should be development aid, we should consider others reasons for it.  First, the Christian concept &ldquo;Love thy neighbour&rdquo;, will provide a sufficient basis for many as to why there should be development aid. There has been an acceptance of the tradition that rich and powerful nations should help the poor and weak ones in the same way that rich and powerful people should help the poor and weak. There is no doubt that that concept has not been put into practice.  I believe there is a moral obligation on the rich and powerful to help the poor and the weak. If that does not sufficiently satisfy people, we have to look for other reasons.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that it is in the self-interest of the wealthier nations to help the weaker nations.  If the imbalance continues, the stability and peace of the world will be threatened.  What is somewhat alarming is that in many areas the gap has widened.  There is a vested interest on the part of everybody in the richer nations to ensure that there is peace and stability in the world.</P>
    <P>The third reason&mdash;and this is brought forceably to mind by the recent developments in regard to oil&mdash;the poorer weaker nations do have substantial reserves of raw materials.  We can see what has happened in recent years when a particular commodity has been in short supply.  We have seen the power which can be exercised by what were previously very weak nations when such a basic commodity became scarce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> There is no reason why it might not occur in regard to other basic raw materials.  The ACP countries have considerable reserves and deposits of tin, rubber, manganese, cobalt and so on. Any one of these materials could ultimately provide them with a major economic weapon.  If the case is being argued from the point of view of self-interest, surely the richer nations should be establishing better relationships with the weaker nations and should be helping them in their time of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is the fact that all nations rely to a large extent on exports from the point of view of their balance of payments.  The development of the economies of the poorer nations would open up possibilities for exports from the richer nations.</P>
    <P>From all points of view it is clear that, apart from the moral obligation on the richer countries, it is evident that it is in their own interests to assist in the development of the weaker nations.  The question then arises whether enough has been done.  If one looks at the situation between the EEC countries and the ACP countries, even for 1978, the figures indicate that trade between the two blocs came to approximately $15 billion each way.  If one excludes oil from ACP exports we find there was a considerable imbalance.  Oil accounted for approximately a quarter of the exports from those countries.  That figure proves the point of the self-interest as far as the EEC is concerned and also proves the point&mdash;in this regard I believe I am pushing an open door so far as the Minister is concerned&mdash;that we are not doing enough in this area.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the world situation and our own.  Looking at the world situation, we know of the UN Resolution of 1970, which suggested a figure of .7 per cent of GNP as being the target which each country should aim for.  I do not intend introducing any politics into this business, but it is clear that prior to 1970 there was not any great concentration from the country on development aid and establishing contacts in the Third World.  Since 1970 there has been some <Col N="1065" /> improvement from our point of view, but we must examine our conscience and ask ourselves if that improvement has been sufficient.  If one looks at the world situation the figures do not seem to have improved. In the United States in the late forties and early fifties&mdash;largely as a result of the Marshall Aid Plan&mdash;aid constituted about 2½ per cent of GNP, but that figure has now fallen to about one-tenth of that 2½ per cent.  Some of the other wealthy nations, the Germans and Japanese, are similarly behind in making any progress towards reaching the UN target.  The situation here is that this year our figure should be around .2 per cent.  I hope the Minister will announce a target for the next three years and gradually increase that percentage.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that the increase should be a minimum of .05 per cent per annum.  That would seem to be attainable as far as we are concerned despite the economic difficulties in the country.  It is a target increase which we are capable of achieving and to which we should commit ourselves.  A further aspect about the Lomé Convention which the Minister should deal with concerns the question of whether the EEC will be able to pay for a lot of the extra money agreed on the basis of its budgetary situation unless radical measures are taken in the near future.  I understand that no provision has been made for the additional moneys payable under Lomé II.  That is a side issue.</P>
    <P>The document produced in connection with this matter is a complex one and I do not propose to go into it in detail, but it is clear from reading that that it amounts to an improvement on Lomé 1. It has remedied some of the problems that arose in regard to that.  The real point I wish to make is that I believe we are not doing enough in this area.  The criticisms of the ACP countries are, to a large extent, justified.  There was very ready agreement on the part of the EEC to demands which cost us virtually nothing, but in areas of difficulty there was considerable resistance.  The future outlook of the EEC can be affected by a fairly strong approach from us.  We are <Col N="1066" /> only contributing .6 per cent and yet, as one of the Nine, we can present a strong voice in this area.  We should do so.  We are in an exceptional situation.  Despite the fact that our percentage contribution to Lomé is small, we have some special relationships with many of the developing countries and are in a virtually unique situation in relation to other EEC countries in that we do not have a past that involves to any extent colonial exploitation. On the contrary, as a country we were exploited.  We have suffered the experiences in the past that are now being suffered by many of the ACP countries. From that point of view we have a strong moral voice.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the improvement in Lomé and wish it every success, I urge the Minister to continue his efforts to loosen the purse strings of the EEC and to be more generous in the future.  We should be aiming to meet the legitimate demands and criticisms of the ACP countries in a more generous manner. Apart from our contribution to Lomé we should be setting a lead in the matter of development aid.  If we do that we can make a significant contribution towards peace and stability in the world and towards giving leadership to the world in this vital area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy O'Keeffe in recognising and paying tribute to the constructive role the Minister played in concluding the negotiations at the start of his Presidency of the Council of Ministers. The tribute should be generous and unqualified, and from me it is.  The record shows that the Presidency started with such a contribution.  The Minister dwelt on the significant symbolism of the fact that Lomé I and Lomé II were signed by Irish Ministers of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the conclusion of Lomé II.  In proposing to agree to the ratification of the Agreement in the full recognition that it has fallen short of the terms of Lomé II, that it has fallen short of the hopes and aspirations of both sides of the House, we recognise nevertheless <Col N="1067" /> that it is an important step along the difficult road towards bringing about the new international economic order which was called for in the United Nations by the late President Boumedienne.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said that, from the point of view of the self interest of the wealthy nations, such a new international economic order should be brought about.  That is so; but self interest has also a moral dimension, to which he referred.  It is proper that such a new order should be brought about, and this convention is an instrumental step&mdash;in fact, the only international agreement of its kind.  It is a difficult process for some of the member states of the EEC effectively to &ldquo;decolonise&rdquo; their mentalities with regard to their former colonies. Lomé II is a step along the road to ridding from the minds of the English and the French especially the colonial attitude which permeated Yaounde I and to a lesser extent Yaounde II.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech recognised that the signing of Lomé II was significant for us because of our special position when he said:</P>
    <P>The ACP states perceive Ireland within the Community group in a special way and it is a symbol of considerable significance that both conventions were signed under the Irish Presidency.  Through the convention nearly 60 ACP states have come to learn a great deal about Ireland and our present and potential role in international relations in the field of development co-operation. </P>
    <P>I heartily agree with that sentence.  In pursuit of development in relation to how our role might grow in the future, I would suggest that one way in which we could consolidate that position is to give a new dimension to our neutral position in international relations.  Our position with regard to ACP countries is enhanced by the fact that we have no colonial past and that we are also politically neutral in terms of any power blocs. Many of the countries with whom we <Col N="1068" /> would have direct relations within the ACP group, and particularly those with whom we have very close bilateral relations&mdash;Tanzania for instance&mdash;are members of the non-aligned group. There is undoubted benefit to be had for us in consolidating the political side of our relationships with this group of countries&mdash;as a group as distinct from the positive bilateral relations that we have with some of them&mdash;by looking again at the whole question of our involvement with a non-aligned group.  I will not repeat the points that I made on this during Question Time recently.</P>
    <P>The necessity to bring about the new international economic order is not something of vague relevance to this country and its impact will not be difficult to measure.  For example, the Minister could find that article 48, which covers the Sugar Agreement and the proposals from Commissioner Gundelach in relation to the whole question of sugar in the Community, could directly affect many of the people in Thurles. Similarly, many of the tannery workers in Gorey were equally affected.  Many workers were made redundant because of the decision by the Mauritanian Republic to increase the price of phosphates, thus putting out of operation the Goulding fertiliser factory in Dublin.  These incidents demonstrate the point that, as long as the world market continues to be unregulated, we will have this kind of casualty.</P>
    <P>The major contribution that Lomé I made was the introduction of STABEX. There are a lot of qualifications about its effectiveness and the business brief in <i>The Economist</i> of 27 October lists them. Notwithstanding those qualifications STABEX is an attempt to take the laws of the jungle out of the international market system and replace them with some degree of stability.  A welcome addition to Lomé II is MINEX, which is a similar market mechanism adjuster for primary minerals.</P>
    <P>These are positive things and we should welcome them.  In recognising them we should recognise that, as history advances, it is the unregulated <Col N="1069" /> market that is being progressively dismantled, controlled and disciplined to an extent that we are moving quickly at a time when the unplanned open market for labour and materials will be replaced by a planned economy.  Lomé II attempts to give some hope of this type of economy, where people will be able to match their needs with the resources, when we will not have the ridiculous and scandalous situation that Deputy O'Keeffe referred to in relation to armaments spending.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that on a number of occasions I raised the question of the interaction of human rights with the Lomé Agreement and the Minister raised the difficult question of interference in the sovereignty of member states.  I recognise that there is not a simple solution to this, but nevertheless we have a role to play.  From my reading of the agreement I gather that there is no explicit statement, but would I be right in assuming, under article 119 which deals with the review process for the Council of Ministers, with specific regard to the fifth EDF, that the whole question of human rights, if it arises, can be reviewed under that heading?  If the ACP countries argue for the replacement of the law of the jungle in relation to the commodity market, then there is a corresponding demand to have the law of the market changed in relation to human rights, the rights of workers, the conditions of workers and the right of trade unions to form in some of the least developed countries.</P>
    <P>I do not know what mechanism the Council envisages, but we could find ourselves in the situation that in a year or two years' time the Minister or his predecessor might be answering questions in this House in relation to an Irish contribution to the EDF going to a recipient country where there was some flagrant breach of human rights.  For example, if the Philippines were part of the ACP countries&mdash;indeed if it were not for its connection with the United States it might well be&mdash;genuine questions could be raised about such a matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be able to indicate <Col N="1070" /> what he envisages would be the manoeuvrability of an Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs in that context.  I qualify that by recognising that this is a complex area.  The ACP countries, like Barbados, have been insistent about their capacity to manage their own houses and, with a certain degree of accuracy, pointed to the situation in Europe and have been able to comment on our own history.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the direct contributions through EDF itself, which is administered by the Community, and the possibility of participating in projects and contracts as the Minister outlined. The Minister's role in this area has been very positive.  His Department have played a constructive role in opening up for a section of the Irish business community a new market which is an extremely difficult one to enter.  So far as it is possible for the Department and related semi-State agencies to help, that help has been forthcoming and the people who attempted to participate in the complex system of tendering for controls and projects recognise this.  It is only right that the House should know the assessment of the people working professionally in the field.  While there is no criticism of the help provided by the Department, anyone who studied the details of the Fourth European Development Fund will recognise that it is unnecessarily cumbersome and bureaucratic.  To the extent that Lomé II hopes to speed up under article 108 the administration of the EDF, it is an improvement.</P>
    <P>I note with regret that four years into the first Lomé Convention we have still only managed to spend two-thirds of the aid allocated.  The Minister might tell us how he sees the new administration of the Fifth EDF being brought about.  The Labour Party recognise that the enlargement of the ACP countries from what was previously France's African colonies to a much more complex and varied set of countries created many difficulties in trying to get programmes put together; and the sheer physical task of missions going to 50-odd countries made it a difficult task.  Nevertheless, this <Col N="1071" /> raised in many minds the legitimate objection that much of the finance given for aid appears to have been swallowed up, delayed or held back for administrative purposes.</P>
    <P>One of the appeals put forward by the Irish Aid Agency, Goal, is the fact that they do not spend any money on administration. This is an attraction because whatever they are given goes directly to the people who need it and X-percentage will not be put aside for overheads.  The same cannot readily be said about the development fund because it is not aid in the sense of a hand-out.  It is development and co-operation in a real sense.  Therefore, there must be an evaluation of projects and a process whereby money is handed over, research is carried out and so on.  All this takes time, but the time could be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to give some assurance that the delays which happened in the past will not occur again.  He might also put on the record as a precedence, because there is a degree of tripartite co-operation here in relation to developing aid, the practice established in relation to the shortfall and the take-up of money from the EEC being transferred to our bilateral aid programme.  I welcomed that positive step.  It should be seen as a precedent to which all sides of the House will agree.  It secures this Minister and future Ministers from a back-door raid by somebody in Finance coming up to Christmas taking up funds.</P>
    <P>On development co-operation, I noticed, from reading the convention, that in areas, such as the restructuring of rural agriculture and research and development, there is a great deal of provision for studies, for research institutes, central industrial developments and so on.  I hope the Minister, through the Council for Development Co-operation and through membership of that council, will make sure there will be a very vigorous campaign of advertisements and information so that people with the willingness, the research and intellectual <Col N="1072" /> capacity will get directly involved in this research work.</P>
    <P>The common experience of the people trying to operate the Fourth EDF was the total lack of knowledge of Ireland. DEVCO, the semi-State bodies and the private consultancy firms have rolled back that frontier considerably, but there is still a lot of work to be done, and there will be for many years, because of our non-imperialist past.  For that reason there should be a recognition of the need for an allocation of the overall development co-operation budget to be made for development co-operation and education in Ireland on general and specific levels. Since the Minister referred to the appointment of the various personnel to this council, he might tell us how he sees that being taken up.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the fact that we have been able to participate in a market that now produces something in the region of £2 to £2½ million sterling in foreign earnings, the Minister will agree that the contracting side of that market has not yet been adequately tapped. While the semi-State sector and some private consultancy firms have been successful in getting consultancy work, contracting firms in construction and supply of materials do not appear to have been so successful.  There are a number of problems in this area&mdash;insurance for bonds, insurance generally, exchange control risks and so on.</P>
    <P>The CII are not as happy as they would like about having enough competence generated by Irish manufacturers, contractors and suppliers of materials to enter into what is a complex process of tendering.  Having got more than our percentage share of what we would otherwise have been entitled to on the consultancy side, I hope the Fifth EDF would be seen by the Department and the Minister as one in which we would aim at trying to get more of the contracting side of that business.  This is a complex area.  It may mean the semi-State sector taking the initiative and inviting a number of private firms to come together and make a joint application for tenders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> The Labour Party welcome the signing of this agreement, recognise the personal and constructive role played by the Minister on behalf of this country and suggest that the question of our formal status as a neutral nation in the international community should be looked at in a new light because of the relevance of our relationships with other countries. The Labour Party are in favour of this country joining the non-aligned group.  It could be said that we will be in very varied company.</P>
    <P>The correct policy that the Minister has pursued in developing our relations with Africa has a positive and major role to play.  Perhaps we can look at that again in the context of its potential contribution to our development co-operation programme generally.  We also recognise that difficulties will arise from this for certain sectors of industry.  There is a necessity to have a proper programme at home educating us to the inter-dependency north and south of the international community on the development of such agreements like Lomé which is to all our benefit in the final analysis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the generous tributes they paid to me in connection with the negotiation of the second Lomé convention.  I also thank them for the tribute they paid to my staff and I would like to be associated with those tributes.  There is an old saying that there is no memory of pain.  As it happens the staff who are present here this morning were also involved with me through many late nights not of carousing but of negotiating, reassuring and so on right through the last night and morning in Lomé.  I am sure they felt the same towards me as I felt towards them&mdash;that they did not want to see me again because it would recall this painful, but finally satisfying experience.  This is the first time I have been involved with them since the conclusion of the negotiations. I thank Deputies for their tributes to them.  It meant major commitments on their part and, as in public life and the administration of this and I am sure <Col N="1074" /> other Departments, considerable interference in their normal domestic arrangements.  I am sure they appreciate the tributes paid to them in bringing about the conclusion of this negotiation.</P>
      <P>The two Deputies took a very broad tolerant approach towards our involvement and were understandably critical on the broad question.  They spoke of the difficulties and general dissatisfaction.  I would not be the one to cloak over the reality that I referred to in my opening speech that Lomé I did not achieve what we expected it to do.  Lomé II was conducted in a hard-headed, pragmatic and realistic manner.  To give a clear illustration of how that arises it must, in the first instance, be agreed between nine member states of the EEC and between 58 in this instance, as distinct from 46 originally, of the ACP.  I know how difficult it was to get agreement among the nine on a whole range of issues.  I have great appreciation for those who managed to get agreement among the 58.  I would like to think I was able to help to reassure them in reaching that agreement towards the end.  It was difficult, particularly on matters relating to the size of the fund where there must be an agreed key contribution.</P>
      <P>Where one has to have an EEC key in relation to the European Development Fund one cannot do that on the basis that one country can give a lot and another country give a little.  It has to be done through Community established procedures.  In view of the economic conditions that we were conscious of in various member states and the attitudes of one or two member states&mdash;I will not name them as we all have our problems&mdash;and their determination that they could not budge beyond this point because of disciplines in their monetary policies, we had a difficult time in getting the fund to the figure it is at.  Allowing for inflation and so on it is a real increase on the original Lomé.  That points out one of the limitations we have. Where some countries say their national programmes will not allow them to contribute more than £x we are constrained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties on the ACP side would be <Col N="1075" /> more considerable.  The gap is widening as we say in the EEC ourselves and this is as far as you can achieve for us.  That said we reached the conclusion which I touched on and which both Deputies have recognised: a continuing and practical commitment in a proper spirit of understanding between the EEC countries and the ACP countries.</P>
    <P>In relation to the armaments question as far as the EEC are concerned, our approach has been to recognise our obligations in co-operation in development. There are some other large blocks&mdash;I have mentioned this more than once here&mdash;who concentrate not on development co-operation in Africa, the Caribbean or the Pacific but on providing the armaments about which Deputy O'Keeffe was concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal.  There is wasteful expenditure on armaments being provided to different elements in developing countries as they come to the painful experience of their own independence, by comparison with the manner in which it could be done and as is being done through an instrument of this nature.  To that extent the Community are giving very good example to other blocks.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EDF which Deputy Quinn dealt with, we all acknowledge that that was one of the problems of the last convention.  For that reason, as I said in my opening speech, we have provided special funds for the secretariat of ACP countries.  There are new elements in the convention to ensure that the preparation of the projects will be expedited in view of the obviously unsatisfactory experiences of the last convention where moneys were not taken up because the projects could not be prepared, and to ensure that they will be effectively implemented.  That was one of the elements I became aware of in the course of my visits to Africa.  It is one that we dealt with in the course of our negotiations.  The framework is there and the funds are there.  One can never say that there will not be problems.  The matter which Deputy Quinn referred to is one which, from the experience we have <Col N="1076" /> had and the provisions we made, we will be able to deal with more effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn also spoke about the question of the shortfall on our votes and the precedent that has been established.  I would like to think that what I have got the agreement of the Government to do over the last two years would be a precedent. If it is done once perhaps it is initiative but if it is done twice it could be regarded as a precedent.  As far as I am concerned, with whatever influence I may have, I will try to maintain it that way.  I would be glad if members of the other parties take that view.  This year it is very much an academic problem because we have now moved to a new stage.  For the first time there will be no shortfall anywhere.  We have exhausted the lot which, in a sense, is to be welcomed.  On the other hand it means that the needs are great.  We have exhausted every single element in our vote.</P>
    <P>As regards research and information I shall send Deputies Quinn and O'Keeffe a copy of the statement I made recently in relation to the announcement of the development and advisory council which, because of the activity of recent days, does not figure largely in newspapers.  I agree with what Deputy Quinn said.  I cannot give the precise figure but we are in the hundreds of thousands of pounds figure in terms of provision for education and research through the non-governmental organisations in the first instance.  As regards the development advisory council, they will have their own independent secretariat, their own business to conduct, their researches through the various bodies that are engaged in such work.  Research and information will be a major element in all of this.  I think the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and Trócaire set a headline for all of us some years ago when from their annual collection they allocated about 25 per cent towards education.  We followed that&mdash;we were not the pioneers&mdash;and we have made very considerable allocations now which I believe will have a major impact.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of one of the areas on which Deputy Quinn touched, the impact <Col N="1077" /> of the sugar agreement and many other elements within our own country. We cannot ignore certain realities; we cannot blow hot and cold at the same time.  For that reason in the new development advisory council for the first time, it is not just those who are concerned with the development areas that are involved; the trade unions, the farmers' organisations, the confederation of industries and other are represented, all in the one council where they themselves can see that there must come from this a broad recognition of what our overall policy should be and attempts made to prompt and urge the appropriate Minister and the Government to take the necessary steps, because it does involve, as can be seen from the programmes of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, through the IDA, industrial restructuring in the new era.</P>
    <P>There are things we can do that they cannot do in the development countries. We must get into those areas; otherwise we shall not be able to compete with them in areas where they can produce at lower cost than we can.  I do not think we could contemplate preventing them from developing their natural, climatic and soil advantages just because it would pose problems for us.  This is the argument that Deputy Quinn rightly touched on in regard to the whole question of the more balanced and secure new economic world order.  Where we are capable of adjusting and introducing new technological developments in our industrial programme, that is what we must do.  It is not just coincidence that that has been a major feature of the Government's industrial promotional activity in recent times.  We do recognise these realities and at the same time we want to ensure our own people's employment and development while not cutting across opportunities for others in what might be called traditional areas.</P>
    <P>As regards our own commitment in development co-operation funds, Deputies will be aware&mdash;this is in reply to Deputy O'Keeffe; my last point was obviously meant to refer to this question of the balance of trade both ways; this is <Col N="1078" /> how I think one has to approach the 15 billion dollars&mdash;that in our own Vote this year we reached a figure of .2 per cent.  It is now at about £14.5 million.  It has doubled in two years.  It is evident that the target that Deputy O'Keeffe referred to is not just a target now but will be a continuing target; it is an achievement, a standard, I hope that what we have actually achieved will continue to be the foundation for what we will do.</P>
    <P>Appropriately, Deputy O'Keeffe asked if the budget problems in the Community at present will have any impact on this matter&mdash;that is how I understood his question.  Fortunately, whatever happens about the budget in the Community it will not.  Strangely, there were many who wanted to have budgetisation of the EDF for possibly good reasons.  However, we do not have it but what we have is this key that I have referred to and for that reason the fund is financed by contributions from member states of the Community.  The new convention will not actually come into operation until ratified by each member state which is why it was very important to get the negotiations on it under way so that we could start this process as we are doing here.  The convention must be ratified in each of the Nine, or Ten as I suppose it will be, and the 58.  We could probably look for a commencement of the operation of the fund in late 1980.  For our own contribution, the appropriate provision will be of the order of about £900,000 in that year. While perhaps there are good arguments that the EDF should be budgetised as a permanent instrument, fortunately at this stage whatever problems we have with the European Parliament or otherwise will not affect it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn touched on the human rights matter.  He is quite right when he refers to the possibilities for review but we must proceed here very carefully.  It is not a contractual condition of the convention because in the final analysis we all take the view&mdash;though some of my partners originally did not&mdash;that it is a political decision and even if you had a <Col N="1079" /> contractual stipulation, you would still have to take a political decision as to whether you would implement it.  It is really a political decision.  In the second case, as we have already done in the last convention, we in fact held up and suspended aid to Uganda.  We took a political decision to do so and aid was suspended during the activities of Amin. That is a position that will remain. Equally, the House will understand that the relevant countries are understandably sensitive about the notion that we, the developed countries with our pure consciences and so on, can set down guidelines for them in this area.  I appreciate their sensitivity, so what we did instead is that in my speech at Lomé&mdash;a recorded statement on behalf of the Community&mdash;I deliberately referred to the principles of the United Nations Charter in which we are both partners and the Monrovia declaration of the Organisation of African Unity and the Lusaka declaration of the Commonwealth. These are the declarations, if you like, from that side which I adopted as being declarations to which we would subscribe as the very foundation of this convention and thus there is no implication that we are the people with the high standards imposing them on others.  I can assure Deputy Quinn that while it is not something one shouts about in advance, we have the right and responsibility in line with an internal Community decision we have taken since, to act, where necessary, appropriately where we see grave abuses beyond the limit of tolerance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn is right&mdash;there has been an improvement regarding contracts and consultancy.  We have been involved in consultancy up to now and the next move is contracts and contractual involvement.  I touched on that in my opening speech but I want to tell the House that the evidence so far is very encouraging that Irish firms are becoming more and more involved both in consultancy, which is the first step towards contractual involvement.</P>
    <P>Indications are that in the course of <Col N="1080" /> this new Lomé Convention there will be a significant increase.  I have these indications from member states of ACP because they make the final decisions. From the Commission and from the renewed interest in our own private sector we will see a considerable increase in the level of contractual activity undertaken by Irish firms in these countries to our mutual advantage.  Perhaps that is the most appropriate note for me to conclude on.  I thank the House for the welcome expeditious and positive approach to the Bill.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage we expressed our concern that so many ships using our waters do not have the same trained personnel and manning standards demanded in this Bill for seamen travelling on Irish registered ships.  I asked the Minister to make approaches to the international shipping body which regulates and controls such matters to see that there was a standard of uniformity throughout the world with regard to the amount of trained personnel and the standard of that personnel on all ships using the high seas, and our coastal waters in particular.  Does the Minister intend to bring this point to the notice of the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultant Organisation?  Are all the countries in the world which have ocean going ships affiliated to this body?  If not, how many are not?  Has the Minister any suggestions as to how sanctions should be taken against those countries which are in shipping to a major degree but which are not following international shipping conventions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that when I concluded Second Stage I mentioned that the Bill would, <i>inter alia,</i> cover all ships registered in Ireland, that is, owned by Irish citizens or by Irish bodies corporate.  The Bill also covers foreign ships, but only those carrying passengers from one Irish port to another Irish port.  For a number of reasons it would be impracticable to try to extend the application of this Bill to enable us to set down manning and competency requirements for foreign vessels coming into our ports from abroad.  We, in common with our Community partners, operate an &ldquo;open ports&rdquo; policy under which ships of every nation are free to trade to and from our ports.  The Deputy will accept that this is a long established and accepted policy based on the sound economic premise that the balance of national advantage lies in securing the lowest possible freight rates because of our open economy and the size of our import and export trade.  Our basic thinking on this whole matter is the same as that in the Community generally, that is, that the manning level and the certification standards on foreign vessels are, in the first instance, a matter for the foreign maritime authorities concerned.  Our best option is to seek to complement the action of national authorities by concerted international action at a multilateral level with a view to improving and harmonising standards for ships' officers and crews on a worldwide basis.  The 1978 IMCO Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers is a concrete step in this direction.  The convention is a relatively recent one, about 18 months old, but the progressive adherence of countries to it should encourage the development of a harmonised international regime of standards for the training and certification of seafarers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill and the regulations to be made under it shortly will enable Ireland to implement the terms of the convention. As I mentioned previously, we are not entirely dependent on international law in cases where we have doubts about <Col N="1082" /> foreign vessels entering our ports.  The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, gives us very wide-ranging powers to inspect and, if necessary, to detain foreign vessels within our jurisdiction in various circumstances such as doubts about seaworthiness, manning, safety and so on.  These are provisions which give us a wide degree of discretion and control. The Deputy will agree that adherence by the countries throughout the world to the 1978 IMCO Convention is the best way of overcoming the problems mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the really important section in the Bill.  This requires ships to carry such numbers and such categories of personnel and so on and to ensure that the crew is a competent crew.  How is the matter of increased personnel on certain passenger boats affected by this Bill?  As the Minister is aware, ships which ply between Cork and Great Britain, Rosslare and Great Britain, Dún Laoghaire and Great Britain and so on consist of passenger ships with a very inflated crew during the summer period.  I trust that when the regulations are made with regard to personnel that aspect will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>On the general question I would like the Minister to say whether there has been consultation with the shipping companies. It would be appropriate also if there had been consultation with the trade unions.  I took it upon myself to consult with one trade union, the National Union of Seamen, and they were concerned to get an assurance from the Minister that certificates issued by certain overseas administrations would be accepted by the Irish authorities.</P>
      <P>Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may make regulations requiring ships to which this Act applies to carry such numbers and such categories of personnel as he may specify in the regulations... </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> This section also empowers the Minister to make regulations with regard to the standards of competence and the conduct of examinations, and under section 9 (2) the Minister may make regulations governing the conduct of an inquiry. Will the Minister say whether these regulations would be placed on the table of the House and be revoked within a certain period, say 21 sitting days, or would they be absolute and come into effect once the Minister makes them?  I do not know whether he can be specific on this.  How will he decide the numbers and the categories?  What guidelines will he have?  Also I would like to know whether there is an international convention with regard to the procedure proposed in this measure.  What sort of examination boards will there be and what will the personnel be like?  Would shipowners, trade unions, mercantile engineers and so on be included?</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the important section. Deputy Quinn has asked me to raise the question of the status of the jet-foil which goes into service in the spring of 1980.  I would be concerned with levels of manning and technical competence because I am informed that the engine size is very large compared to the tonnage. I presume that that would get special and urgent attention in view of the fact that engineers are going on a training programme starting 2 January in the coming year with Boeing in the USA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>This section refers to standards of competence and certificates of competency.  Section 3 (2) (b) provides for the conduct of examinations and, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, the appointment and remuneration of examiners for such examinations. The Minister has said that there is a shortage of such examiners. Have we no facilities in this country for the training of such people?  Has everything concerned with these certificates of competency and with the training of these examiners to be done abroad, namely in Britain?  Is any other maritime nation in the world so lacking in facilities and institutes for the training and qualification of shipping personnel? From my experience anybody who wants to get any advanced training in this regard has to go abroad.  We will take our own Irish Naval Service, for instance, to draw a parallel.  The officers of that service have to go to Britain, namely to Dartmouth in Devon and to Greenwich College in London, to get their certificates of competency.  Can the Minister hold out any hope that we will set up a maritime faculty in one of our universities or at least a major faculty in one of our regional colleges whereby people can get their certificates to which I refer here in our own country?</P>

      <P>As the Minister's amendment meets largely the proposal in my amendment, I do not intend pressing the amendment in my name, but I would just make the point that in most cases wages and salaries are calculated by means of computer and, presumably, it would be relatively easy to include on a payslip a breakdown of deductions. However, I am sure that is something that can be arranged locally.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding this or any other enactment but subject to subsection (2) of this section</P>
      <P> (A)  a term or condition of an, agreement, between an employer (or group of employers) and an employee (or his trade union), providing that wages or salaries will not be paid, or sought, in cash shall be valid whether or not the agreement was in force before the coming into effect of this section,</P>
      <P>(B)  employers may, if they so wish, require employees first employed after the coming into effect of this section, to agree to a term or condition of employment providing for the payment of wages or salaries in a non-cash mode as defined by this Act.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> (2)  Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section no term or condition of an agreement shall be valid:</P>
    <P> (a)  during a cessation of normal banking services (or other relevant cashing service as the case may be) in proximity of the employment, for any reason whatsoever and</P>
    <P>(b)  unless there is adequate banking, or other cashing service within convenient proximity of the normal place of employment, as defined by regulations made under subsection (3) of this section.  </P>
    <P> (3) (a)  The Minister may, for the purposes of subsection (2) (b) of this section, make regulations specifying the proximity and level of a banking or other cashing service (as the case may be) required so that employees have no reasonable grounds for complaint.</P>
    <P>(b)  Regulations made under this subsection may be of general or localised or special application as the Minister deems fit in each case. </P>
    <P>(4)  Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed be either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P> (5) (a) The Minister shall within one year of the enactment of this Act make an order bringing into effect the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where an order under this section is proposed to be made, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> This amendment involves the deletion of the present section 7.  The main purpose of the amendment is to make absolutely clear that if there is any doubt about legality with regard to practices already in existence whereby workers are paid by cheque or standing order, that doubt is now removed and they are now validated legally.  That would be covered by subsection (1) (A) which states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this or any other enactment but subject to subsection (2) of this section</P>
    <P>a term or condition of an agreement, between an employer (or group of employers) and an employee (or his trade union), providing that wages or salaries will not be paid, or sought, in cash shall be valid whether or not the agreement was in force before the coming into effect of this section, </P>
    <P>That clears up any doubt regarding agreements already made and about whether they were in breach of existing legislation, particularly the Truck Acts. It also makes legal provision for future agreements between employers and trade unions.  Paragraph (B) is wider in scope because it gives employers the power after the passing of this measure to require of new employees that they accept as a condition of employment cash remuneration in a non-cash mode, by cheque, standing order and so on. This will be subject to the provisions of subsection (2) (a) which states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section no term or condition of an agreement shall be valid:</P>
    <P>during a cessation of normal banking services (or other relevant cashing service as the case may be) in proximity of the employment, for any reason whatsoever and </P>
    <P>This is very topical.  The amendment provides for a situation that is not provided for to date, namely, when there is a bank strike or a bank closure for any reason.  This happened last week and much inconvenience was caused.  Indeed, <Col N="1094" /> if the strike had continued for another day or two there would have been a major problem and employers throughout the country would have experienced very considerable difficulty.  Paragraph (a) will provide in general that where banking services cease for any reason employers will be obliged to pay by cash.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the same subsection states:</P>
    <P>unless there is adequate banking, or other cashing service within convenient proximity of the normal place of employment, as defined by regulations made under subsection (3) of this section. </P>
    <P>This allows me an opportunity to make this point again.  Obviously the Minister did not take the point I made last night, as was obvious from a remark he made later when he said that he and Deputy Ryan, both of whom are from rural constituencies, understand the problems faced by people trying to cash cheques in country areas.  I had already made that point myself.  Here we are making specific provisions to cover people who might not be near a bank or other cashing services.  We are proposing to give the Minister power to make regulations to cover this matter.  At the moment the people to whom I refer are not covered by any legislation and the Minister's proposals do not make any attempt to include them.  Although they may not be many in number, there are some people who are paid by cheque or standing order and who live in the country in areas distant from banking services. The amendment I propose would cover people in that situation but it need not necessarily be confined to remote areas.  It could also apply in city areas where payment may be made at a time when the banks are closed.  There are many families in this city who cannot wait until the following day to cash their cheques because they need the money that day.  I know that only too well from my own constituency.  My amendment would cater for people in that situation also.  It covers not only the question of the proximity of the service but also the level of banking or other cashing services. <Col N="1095" /> An employer might have a cash office, or a local postoffice could do the job.  That is why I made provision for other cashing services because there are areas where there is a post office but no bank.</P>
    <P>Here is a case where Fine Gael are showing concern for the rights of workers.  We are trying to do something about the inconvenience to which workers are put.  I ask the Minister to consider what I have said.  I hope that subsections (1), (2) and (3) will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, for the purposes of subsection (2) (b) of this section, make regulations specifying the proximity and level of a banking or other cashing service (as the case may be) required so that employees have no reasonable grounds for complaint. </P>
    <P>This proposes to give the Minister powers to make regulations to minimise inconvenience to employees.  It is important that the tension and the annoyance felt by workers in not getting their wages in cash should be minimised as much as possible.  What I propose is one way to reduce that sense of annoyance.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (b) states.</P>
    <P>Regulations made under this subsection may be of general or localised or special application as the Minister deems fit in each case. </P>
    <P>I am putting forward this provision because there may be special factors operating in different localities or in different work situations.  Subsections (4) and (5) are put forward because we are following as a matter of policy the practice of inserting sections of this kind with regard to regulations and orders.  In too many pieces of legislation there is a provision for orders which may be tabled and if they are not annulled within 21 days they become law.</P>
    <P>We had the experience yesterday of being refused time to debate an order. That completely negatives the rights of <Col N="1096" /> Members of this House.  This is the second time it has happened.  Earlier this year time to debate an annulling order was not allowed by the Government. That is a serious encroachment on the rights and responsibilities of Members of the Oireachtas.  That is why subsection (4) is included in the amendment although, on reflection, I would have preferred to put in a separate amendment. Governments generally tend to go for convenient measures.  That is understandable, but it is not necessarily best for the people or the Government.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of the amendment deals with regulations.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder. </P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of the amendment relates to orders.  Paragraph (b) says, &ldquo;...and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;  The Minister would be obliged to put down a motion seeking an affirmative decision rather than placing it on the Order Paper.  On reflection I would have preferred to put subsections (4) and (5) in separate amendments.  I hope the Minister will accept subsections (1), (2) and (3) at least of my proposed section 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsections (2) and (3) of Deputy Mitchell's amendment can be met by the flexibility of the Bill in that there is a right to opt out from cheque payments.  When difficulties arise, such as banking disputes, we all know how awkard and embarrassing it can be if you have a cheque and cannot get cash for it.  The worker is intelligent enough to decide, through his union or in agreement with his employer, in the <Col N="1097" /> knowledge of what he has suffered in bank disputes, to opt for a system which will suit him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make an important general remark about the consequences of Deputy Mitchell's proposed section 7.  Acceptance of his amendment would involve the deletion of the existing section 7 of the Bill.  Such a deletion would not be permissible since it would amount to an implied repeal of the Truck Acts.  This is not the intention behind the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Truck Act, 1831, entitled employees engaged in manual labour to be paid in cash.  This entitlement is not altered in any way in this Bill.  There is no authorisation from the Government to repeal the Truck Acts.  I did not seek Government authorisation to repeal them, for various reasons which I outlined in my Second Stage speech.  The central purpose of the Payment of Wages Bill is to effect an amendment to the Truck Acts in order to restore the payment of manual workers' wages by cheque or other non-cash method of payment to the position which obtained prior to the enactment of the Currency Act, 1927, which created an anomaly.  The effect of what the Deputy is proposing would be totally unacceptable. That is not to say I have not considered the content of the amendment with a view to deciding whether or not account might be taken of it in a different way.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of discussing the amendment I can leave aside subsections (4) and (5) because they are technical provisions.  Subsections (2) and (3) of the amendment are inter-related and can be dealt with together.  I want to deal with subsection (1) specifically.  Paragraph (A), as drafted, will not get us anywhere. Basically it says that the agreement provides for wages not to be paid or sought in cash.  It says nothing about the agreement having to specify some non-cash method of payment.  In fact, it could pave the way for a return to payments in kind or in goods as it is open to that interpretation in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> We must also remember that manual workers have a statutory right under the Truck Act, 1831, to be paid in cash.  The fact that they might sign away that right does not deprive them of it.  On paragraph (B), I must point out to the Deputy that its terms are against the whole philosophy of the Bill.  Running right through the Bill is the fact that compulsion cannot be exerted.  The employer or the employee or the trade union must agree freely to the use of a particular non-cash method of payment. The question of employer-trade union agreement has been adequately covered in the amendment I moved in section 3 (1), the terms of which were worked out in consultation with both sides of industry, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that subsections (2) and (3) of the amendment are interrelated. On subsection (3), the Minister for Labour has absolutely no functions in this matter.  The banks decide where to set up their offices, with the Central Bank as their supervising authority.  In some rural areas perhaps there are some difficulties about the non-cash method of payment but they are not widespread any more.  They are much better served than they were in the past.  We appear to be over-banked in comparison with other countries per head of population.  For the most part the non-cash method of payment does not create difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the flexibility to which Deputy Ryan referred is important. Obviously, if there is some area of difficulty, there will be no agreement.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for the subsections suggested by the Deputy.  The amendment to section 3 adequately covers the situation.  The satisfactory discussions held with both sides of industry have ensured that the Bill adequately covers the situation.  I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister will not accept the amendment because I think it is important.  Subsections <Col N="1099" /> (1), (2) and (3) are important.  Subsection (1) is very important because it validates agreements already made which may be in breach of the Truck Acts.</P>
      <P>Subsection (B) seeks to give employers the power to make it a condition of employment for new employees that they accept payment of wages by cheque or standing order provided that normal banking services are available.</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendment is to protect life.  Life is endangered by the handling of cash.  If my amendment were accepted it would help to reduce the number of payroll robberies.  The unnecessary movement of money from place to place leads to crime.  The Minister's proposal removes any doubt as to the validity of agreements between employers and employees.  It also gives individuals the right to withdraw from agreements.  The main reason for my amendment is that the Bill increases the likelihood of danger to life.  I hope that my predictions are not correct and that the Bill diminishes the danger to life. Having discussed this matter with many people, I am convinced that the provisions will only endanger workers' lives and lead to more robberies.  As I said last night, the money taken in payroll raids is often used to create further violence.  I am concerned with the workers who have to handle money.  I have had to handle money and I know the fears of the workers and their families.  They never know when a gun will be pointed at them.</P>
      <P>I submit that my amendment is reasonable and is calling out for enactment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter last night.  This area is mainly a security area and is not related to my portfolio.  Last night I said that the Bill was a major step forward and that it would encourage more and more employers and trade unions to reach agreement on non-cash modes of payment. The Deputy has been trying to introduce constraints which would only create <Col N="1100" /> more difficulties for all of us.  The Deputy expressed doubt about the legality of existing agreements.  I want to assure the Deputy that he need have no fears for the legality of existing agreements.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, I cannot accept his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Bill is a major step backwards and that it will endanger life.  What does the Bill relate to if it does not relate to the danger to life, limb and money?  The Bill is a bank robbers' charter; it is an invitation to subversives and criminals.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that I was trying to introduce constraints.  My amendment would protect the interests of workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of its flexibility the Bill is more encouraging than compelling. Unfortunately, there will always be a need for the movement of cash. Unfortunately, there will always be a need to move cash and until such time as another Department are able to apprehend robbers there will always be a threat to cash in transit.  I appreciate the concern of Deputy Mitchell for the lives and families of those involved in security and I appreciate the intelligence of workers who, because of the flexibility and other encouraging aspects of the Bill, will decide what they want.  They know their difficulties.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d)  an employee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by his employer for such bank or similar charges which otherwise would not have been incurred.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to insert an additional clause and is in keeping with the case I put forward in relation to amendment No. 19.  I am anxious to illustrate my concern for the rights of workers and facilitate, as far as possible, the paying of wages in a non-cash mode.  I want to ensure that where an employee accepts payment into his bank account by standing order he will be compensated for the charges that may arise as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of reasons I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  Section 6 ensures that any charges incurred by the employer in paying the wages of the employee by way of some agreed non-cash method of payment shall not be deducted from the employee's wages.  The additional provision sought by Deputy Mitchell seems to be <Col N="1102" /> unreasonable and unworkable.  It is unreasonable in the sense that bank charges may apply to any customer of the bank.  Employees covered by the Truck Acts who freely agree to be paid by cheque or credit transfer should not be treated any differently.  The suggestion is unworkable in the sense that it would be very difficult for the employer to gauge what amount of the employee's bank charges were incurred solely by reason of the payment of his wages by cheque, credit transfer or other non-cash method.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with the possibility of charges being incurred by an employee.  My information is that as far as the Associated Banks are concerned there is at present no charge for the lodgment of a cheque to a current or deposit account at any branch of the banks at the time of the lodgment. However, there is a half-yearly charge of about £1 but that is to cover all the transactions of the customer.  It would cover much more than the charge, if any, that might be imposed for handling cheques or other modes of payment.  If a credit transfer involves a transfer from one bank to another there is the optional charge, which is at the discretion of the bank official.  The charge amounts to about 3p per lodgment but, apparently, that option is not taken up too often since the computer transaction to process it would cost about 20p.  The Deputy need not worry on this score. The position is adequately covered and I have confidence in the trade unions, employers and employees being able to sort this matter out.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sad that this Bill is being passed because I firmly believe it constitutes a backward step.  It would have been infinitely preferable had a simple one section Bill been brought before the House, as was suggested by the Federated Union of Employers, not that everything suggested by them or indeed by Congress should be accepted by this or any other Minister.  However, I happen to believe that such a measure would have improved the situation somewhat.  Indeed I would have gone much further, as I sought to do in the amendments I proposed, because I firmly believe that this Bill constitutes a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not accepted that, in this case, there is a security dimension and that he has a role to play in that respect.  I am sorry also that he has not accepted that there is a need for regulations as to the level of a banking or cashing service and their proximity, and that he has a role to play in implementing those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly sorry that this Bill will continue to expose workers, their lives and limbs to danger.  It will in no way ease the fears of workers who pay cash, who work in the vicinity of cash or who carry cash&mdash;not merely security workers, because there are many places where cash has to be transmitted from one office of a firm to another or from one department to another.  There is real fear being felt.  I know because I have had personal experience of it: one expects to be pounced on every moment as one goes along that route; one expects a gun to be pointed in the window every time there is money in the office, and <Col N="1106" /> that is not at all to exaggerate.  This Bill does nothing to minimise those people's fears or to protect them.  I am deeply sorry that not alone is there no provision being made to protect life, limb or money but that the Bill constitutes a major retrograde step.  All I can hope is that wiser counsel will prevail before too long and that a further amending Bill will be brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accepting the passage of this Bill, I want to make the point that no Bill can be perfect or can ever cover every aspect we would like to see covered.  While there are people in this country prepared to rob money, no enactment of this House will prevent them from so doing, because that is the mentality of those people.  Regardless of whatever legislation is enacted, there will also still be movement of cash.  I feel it is a Bill which will encourage workers to opt for a system that may prevent 85 to 90 per cent of robberies and injury to people.  In that way it is a step in the right direction and will be helpful in encouraging workers to opt for whatever system they feel is most appropriate to their circumstances.  In that way I accept the passage of the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>First, may I thank Deputies for their interest, concern and co-operation on this Bill, for participating in the debate and for putting down amendments, at least some of which will form part of the Bill as passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Mitchell is adopting the approach he is; I do not believe it is the function of the Minister for Labour to introduce compulsory legislation which in itself might create more difficulties and problems at the workplace rather than leading to their alleviation.  Surely in presentday society one's essential duty is to alleviate problems in the workplace rather than create them, and I fear that the measures proposed by Deputy Mitchell would have that effect.  Furthermore, in the House last evening we all condemned those people who commit these heinous <Col N="1107" /> crimes, bank robberies and so on. Deputy J. Ryan is completely correct when he says that there will always be movement of cash and that all of us have a duty to society, in our own different spheres, to encourage the elimination of some of the causes.  As Minister for Labour I believe I would be fulfilling a far better role in Irish society, particularly to workers and employers, by introducing a Bill encouraging, making it easy, facilitating, but by agreement&mdash;that is the important thing&mdash; by agreement.  This Bill enables both parties, whether individually or through their various organisations, to come together, reach that agreement and make that arrangement.  It legalises that procedure and also affords them the necessary encouragement.  I believe that is the correct approach and is the approach I would always support.  I believe that in this Bill we have taken a major step forward in urging our society to undertake more and more non-cash methods of payment, by agreement between both sides.  If we achieve that I believe we will have achieved something positive in an encouraging and agreeable fashion rather than the laying down of an ultimatum: you will do this, you will not do this; or you must do that.  As a nation I do not believe that type of approach has ever been proved to be helpful.  However, I do believe this Bill can contribute to the elimination of some of these heinous crimes.</P>

      <P>First of all, let me say that the headlines and the newspaper notices I saw in regard to the earlier debate on this Bill, or some of them, tended to suggest that Fine Gael were out to legalise the pirates.  That is absolutely a misrepresentation of this party's position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attributing that misrepresentation to the Minister of State present.  There is no question of our being anxious to legalise the position of people who have broken the law, bad though the existing law is.  What we are anxious to do is to produce a change in the law which will make it possible for private individuals, within the law, to have access to the airwaves.  The idea that we have any special soft spot for a pirate is completely wrong.  I can tell the Minister of State present&mdash;if it is of any interest to him&mdash;that I received several invitations during the period this matter was last being debated, when it was last a matter of public debate&mdash;to appear on these pirate stations, to give my views on the air over those stations.  I uniformly refused those invitations because I do not approve of pirates in any shape or form on the air or off the air.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not.  The Minister has not understood him.  The law ought not to be such that a person who might otherwise be honest is driven to piracy in order to make use of a medium which it should be his free right to avail himself of.  I was going to say in the few minutes before Question Time not so much what I think about the case which can be made about private local broadcasting. Other colleagues of mine have made that case very adequately and I do not want to go back over it.  I believe there is scope here for privately owned broadcasting <Col N="1109" /> stations.  I have no doubt, as Senator Murphy said the last time public controversy about this was going on, that the cultural level of those stations will leave a lot to be desired.  I have no doubt that is true, but are we going to hold a kind of cultural hurdle over which any one must jump if he is to have access to the airways?  One is embarked on a downward, slippery slope if one starts dictating to other people what cultural level they must transcend in order that they can exercise their right of expression.</P>
      <P>We do not apply standards of that kind in newspapers.  If we did, I can think of a couple of newspapers that would have to be suppressed quickly enough, that is, if we were to employ the idea that anything that is not valuable and serious has no right to be printed.  I do not hold that opinion.  I do not read those newspapers, they do not interest me, but I do not hold the opinion that they are not entitled to be printed.</P>
      <P>In the same way I do not hold the opinion that merely because the stations put out a mixture of unbearable pop that I would not listen to for ten seconds, that is a good reason for keeping it off the air. That is not a good reason for keeping it off the air, and a State like this is in duty bound to sustain people even though their message may not be as high minded or as culturally uplifting as we might have hoped it would be.</P>
      <P>I would like, apart from questions of policy, to give the House, not for the first time, my opinion as a lawyer&mdash;any other lawyer's opinion is no doubt just as good, if not better&mdash;the view that the State is not entitled under our Constitution or under the European Convention on Human Rights to maintain a monopoly of broadcasting.  Article 40.6.1º has a special provision about freedom of expression and states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including <Col N="1110" /> criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State. </P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that radio, press and cinema are mentioned in one breath in the Constitution.  There is no kind of distinction or discrimination between them. We do not attempt to dictate to filmmakers how many of them shall make films.  We do not attempt to assert a State monopoly in film making.  In fact the State does not make films in any shape or form.  It is an entirely free enterprise matter.</P>
    <P>The same goes for the press.  If you leave out <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the publications of the Department of Foreign Affairs and of any other Departments, the entire press here is in the hands of private enterprise.  We do not see any great sin in that.  In fact, we fall over ourselves going through the ritual of praising the press for the choice of opinions it gives us.  Why should the radio be in a different position?  I know there is a technical distinction between the radio and the press in that we cannot have a free for all on the airwaves.  I know that and I am not so childish as to pretend otherwise.  I know that the number of frequencies is limited, but I would like to hear from the Minister how many frequencies would be disposable here&mdash;I am speaking about the technicality of it, not the politics of it&mdash;for stations with a radius of 50 radio miles, 100 miles and 300 miles?  If there are available frequences within that kind of limited radius which will not interfere with large international stations, aviation, emergency calls, police calls and all the other interests which I frequently admit are absolutely entitled to protection, a private operator is as much entitled to access to them as the State.</P>
    <P>The State has shown a peculiar bigheadedness in this matter down through the years.  I remember it being mentioned while we were in office.  The answer put into the hands of the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, which he read out to the House or <Col N="1111" /> published in some shape or form, was the usual thing about the frequencies being limited, although we were never told how limited, the necessity to keep clear airways for police, ambulances, rescue and all the rest of it which everybody admits. The statement wound up with &ldquo;because the financial position of RTE has to be protected&rdquo;.  That is all bosh. There is no possibility in a free country like this, under the kind of Constitution we have, of keeping people off the airways so that RTE will be able to have a monopoly of advertising.  That cannot be done in a free country like this.  If the State wants to pay for its radio stations and television stations it will have to pay for it itself without having it at the expense of other people's liberties.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for radio operators.  I do not know any of them and I have never appeared on a private station.  I have no interest in them good or bad.  I freely believe and accept what I hear about the very low cultural quality of their output.  They are as much entitled to put out mush on the airwaves as they are to deliver a lecture on prehistoric India. If we do not believe that we are on the first of a very slippery path.</P>
    <P>That is the dimension of the freedom of expression in Article 40.6.  Article 43 deals with property and entitles the State to regulate private property for certain objects, which have never been squarely identified or authoritatively and finally delineated.  I believe that, even looked at as a dimension of property, and leaving the expression thing out of it altogether, it is not open to the State to say in this particular business of selling advertising time on the air: &ldquo;We will move in and keep a monopoly and nobody else will get a smell of it.&rdquo;  I am not as sure about this as the freedom of expression angle.  I may easily be wrong about Article 43 but that is a serious point.  It may not be open to the State to say &ldquo;Whatever advertising is going on the air we will get it and give it to our own creature in the shape of Radio Telefis Eireann.</P>
    <P>Not only is this monopoly, which has <Col N="1112" /> been pig headedly defended by the State since 1926, constitutionally questionable, but it appears to me to be also in conflict with the obligations which the State took on itself in signing the European Human Rights Convention. Article 10 of that convention clearly describes the State as having a right to licence broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises, but the ordinary legal principle on which Irish lawyers, French lawyers, German lawyers and every other lawyer works is that the expression of one idea implies the exclusion of another.  When this Article speaks about the State being entitled to licence broadcasts that implicitly excludes any entitlement on the part of the State to monopolise it.</P>
    <P>I want to be realistic, and I accept that RTE is a major achievement of the State although we have faults to find with it at times.  It fulfils a very necessary function. I am in no way against a national broadcasting station, or two or ten national broadcasting stations, the more the merrier.  We would be very much poorer without it.  I would be in favour of giving the station tasks and allowing it to do things which it has never done so far.  I do not want to destroy it or make it a financial burden.  I believe the State ought to free RTE 1, at least so far as television is concerned completely from the burden of advertising.  Our first television channel ought to be advertising free.  If that means that it will cost the State more so be it.  The aesthetically destructive effect of the intrusion of advertising needs no emphasis from me.  It imposes constraints on programme planning and it is aesthetically destructive.  A decent national television station ought not to have it.  I believe that function should be shelved and the State should then pay for it.  I would not be adverse, if this suggestion is any use to the Minister, to having the State recoup some of that loss by placing an extremely heavy tax on the issuing of licences to independent operators.</P>

I am advised that this, in itself, is not unusual.  What is significant about this incident is that, during the attempt to remove the lagging and insulation from the leaking valve, the gas ignited.  Procedures established in the undertaking to deal with fire worked satisfactorily and there was no injury.

As the Deputy is aware, there are many new industries here.  As I said in my reply, there does not appear to be any particular anxiety as regards the health and conditions of the workers. Having said that, in the whole field of health welfare and, in particular, with the development of new technology such as this, I see the need for observation and continued investigation.  To date, the inspectors have reported that the conditions in the factories are good and that any accidents which have occurred in those factories to date were of a minor nature.  The monitoring of the air is very important.  For that reason, the Department have arranged, in order to monitor the work-place environment, for their laboratory facilities and equipment to be extended and updated.</P>

The question asked is whether or not the companies who are presently setting up here have had an examination, by your inspectors or someone responsible in your Department, of their track record in relation not just to industrial accidents, but to blindness brought about by some of the very close type of work such as the work involved in micro-processing, where there is clear evidence, in some cases, that a different approach may be necessary here as, for example, with young girls working for long hours at very fine work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied with the present <Col N="1117" /> situation in relation to the availability of electronic technicians and their training in view of the shortages of such personnel, and if it is proposed to introduce any new conditions in relation to an insistence on such training as a condition of grants for companies being set up here particularly in the electronics area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee, of which I am chairman, identified areas of occupational skill shortages and initiated measures to eliminate such shortages.</P>
      <P>Electronic technicians were among the occupational categories identified as being in short supply.  As a result of enquiries made by the National Manpower Service of my Department, an estimate of shortages in this occupational category was determined as being in the region of 100.</P>
      <P>To meet the immediate and short-term needs, a recruitment campaign was conducted in Britain in the summer, in an effort to attract skilled workers there, including electronic technicians, and as a special encouragement to people to transfer to jobs here I increased the grants payable under the Resettlement Assistance Scheme very substantially. The results of this campaign are currently being assessed.</P>
      <P>To meet the longer term situation, extra places for the training of electronic technicians have been made available in colleges under the control of vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>With regard to grant assistance available to companies establishing in this country, a condition of such grants is that acceptable training programmes to meet projected manpower requirements be agreed between AnCO and the company in question.  I am satisfied that companies in the electronic sector have displayed a responsible attitude in providing for their training needs to date, and I am confident that this approach, coupled with the initiatives now being taken, will ensure an adequate supply of trained electronic technicians to meet the requirements of the industry.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister <Col N="1118" /> two questions?  Firstly, when he talks about a shortage of people, how many people is he talking about?  Secondly, could I ask the Minister if he would agree that one of the best ways of ensuring that there would not be shortages in future would be to insist, not on what I think he referred to as agreed or accepted training programmes&mdash;which, presumably, means that the company coming in must accept what the Minister asks,&mdash;but on a guarantee, by your Department, that there would be imparted to the local domestic labour force the skills necessary to carry on the technology if and when some of these warehouse type companies decide to evacuate, if the economic winds blow the other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I do not have the projected figures but we have estimated the needs.  In reply to the second part of the Deputy's question I said that it is a condition of such grants that there should be a training programme or programmes acceptable to AnCO.  If AnCO are not happy with the training programme the grant will not be paid out.  I must compliment a number of the companies who have good training programmes.  I have met with some of the people who were trained and they are <Col N="1119" /> particularly good in their field.  I agree with the Deputy's reasons for asking the question.  I agree that industry must help to train people particularly in the areas where there are shortages.  The reason for the Resettlement Assistance Scheme was to try to alleviate the immediate shortage as quickly as possible.  Some training programmes have been introduced in the third level institutions as well to provide for a greater output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the proposals, if any, to amend legislation on the employment of handicapped workers; if he is aware of legislation in six of the nine EEC countries obliging employers to take on such handicapped workers and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In my area of responsibility there is no legislation in force in regard to the employment of handicapped workers, and accordingly the question of reform of legislation does not arise.  However, the Government have established a non-statutory scheme for the employment of a quota of disabled persons in the public sector.  The target set is a quota of 3 per cent to be achieved over a period of five years.  The introduction of this scheme followed consideration over a number of years of proposals for legislation to require all employers, both public and private, to employ a quota of disabled persons. However there was general opposition, especially from the voluntary organisations working in this field, to the idea of a compulsory scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that a number of EEC countries have legislation requiring employers to take on a proportion of certain categories of disabled persons.  It is not clear, however, that there is general satisfaction with these compulsory schemes.  For example, I am informed <Col N="1121" /> that the British authorities are not satisfied with the operation of their present quota scheme and that a complete review is at present in progress including an investigation of possible alternatives to a quota system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May we then anticipate that the Department will vigorously pursue the employment of people who have suffered this kind of handicap, at least to the degree of 3 per cent?  When will this be commenced and what sort of plans has the Minister in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The Deputy will remember that the target was set for a 3 per cent quota by 1983.  I have no reason to believe that the target will not be met. I share the Deputy's concern, and I am looking at possible ways to encourage private industry to help out rather than to force them by legislation.</P>

      <P>From its introduction in January 1968 to date, a total of 17,462 persons have been assisted under the resettlement assistance scheme.  Of these 14,657 received interview grants while 2,805 persons were actually resettled. The total expenditure under the scheme to date is £679,343.</P>

      <P>All bodies carrying out operations for which social fund assistance is approved by the European Commission are entitled to receive payments for approved operations carried out by them.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a provision in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2396/71 of 8 November 1971, as amended by Regulation (EEC) No. 2893/77, which requires each member state to provide the Commission with a list, to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, of public authorities empowered by it to provide financial assistance for operations by private bodies and to guarantee the completion of such operations.  Inclusion on the list of a particular body means that the grants given by that body from public funds to private firms, voluntary bodies, and so on, will be accepted as satisfying the requirement of the fund regulations that programmes undertaken by private agencies must receive a contribution from public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> The list of Irish public authorities which has been furnished to the Commission is as follows:</P>

    <P>AnCO (the Industrial Training Authority);</P>
    <P>IDA (the Industrial Development Authority);</P>
    <P>SFADCo Limited (Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd.);</P>
    <P>Gaeltarra Éireann;</P>
    <P>National Rehabilitation Board; and Regional Health Board. </P>
    <P>The regulations governing the social fund lay down various procedures for submission of applications for fund assistance.  A basic provision is that applications must be submitted to the European Commission by the member states.  In Ireland, the Department of Labour have been designated by the Government as the agency responsible for the formulation and transmission to the Commission of all such applications. The regulations also stipulate requirements relating to such matters as deadlines by which applications must be submitted, detailed information which applications must contain, and the manner in which applications must be presented.  It is the responsibility of the Department to ensure that these requirements are complied with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 25 together.  When I met the Commission at their first meeting on 30 May 1978, I said that I envisaged a report being made inside two years.  I understand that, as of now, the Commission hope to meet this target.</P>
      <P>With regard to an interim report, the position is that on the establishment of the Commission, I suggested that they might prepare an interim report on the institutions for settling disputes.  I understand however that, following discussion, the Commission came to the conclusion that it would not be realistic to report on the institutions in advance of their recommendations on industrial relations generally.</P>
      <P>Since the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in July last suspended their representation, the Commission have met eight times.  It is my hope that congress will reconsider their decision and fulfil their commitment under the National Understanding to continue to work within the Commission.  In the meantime the work of the Commission is proceeding.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to attempt to indicate action to be taken on the report when it is received.  Such action will be decided in the light of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is no area in which the Government have failed so conspicuously as they have in industrial relations? Would he agree that he has deferred any action in this area pending the report of the Commission and the interim report which he expected before Christmas last <Col N="1133" /> year?  Would he further agree that from the beginning his handling of the Commission on Industrial Relations was a disaster, starting with the appointment of the chairman, which he had to withdraw?  Would he accept that the country is not prepared to wait any longer for a Commission now flying on one wing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, express my concern with the unhappy state of industrial relations in some areas.  As far as the Commission is concerned it had a major contribution to make.  The Deputy is not right in saying that I did not make moves or could not make them while the Commission was still sitting.  What I said was I would prefer to see advance in that area by developing progress by consensus and then implementing it.  The Deputy referred to the Commission as flying on one wing.  As I said in my reply I am disappointed here too.  I am entitled to express that disappointment.  The withdrawal by Congress is because of the 1906 Act.  That has been the bone of contention for a long time and has been a problem for all my predecessors.  There was pressure on them to amend that Act in some way.  The request is now being made to me.  I have some sympathy with the request, but it would be unfair to the community to amend that single issue on its own.  In other words, I would expect a <i>quid pro quo</i> situation where Congress could deliver in an area of greatest concern to the public, unofficial strikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's final statement.  Would he not agree that there is little sense in proceeding with the Commission with just one side represented?  Does this not of necessity suggest that when the report is finally published it will not be accepted by the non-participating side?  Would it be better to face up to reality and suspend the Commission until such time as the other party returns, or take action to get them to return?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The second course is what I would prefer and will be trying to do.  It is what I had in mind when I <Col N="1134" /> said I had some sympathy with the request but in the interest of the community there would have to be some <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that dismissed employees are having difficulties in complying with the six months &ldquo;start of claims rule&rdquo; in section 8 of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, as a result of the interruption in the postal services during the past year, including the loss of mail in transit due to robberies and so on and that difficulties arise where the notice has not been delivered in the post to all parties; and if it is proposed to amend the law to extend the period of six months for making claims or to give the Employment Appeals Tribunal discretion to accept claims within a year of dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G Fitzgerald Mr. G Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 (2) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 provides that a claim for redress under the Act shall be made to a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal within six months of the date of dismissal and that a copy should be served on the employer within the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six months period was decided upon so as to give time to claim to a dismissed employee who was not immediately aware of his rights under the Act and also to ensure that the case <Col N="1136" /> would be dealt with when the relevant facts were reasonably fresh in all minds. Six months should also allow sufficient time to enable the voluntary grievance procedures within a firm where such procedures are in operation to be used before an employee would avail of the Act.</P>
    <P>One of the forms of redress under the Unfair Dismissals Act is reinstatement. If this is to be effected successfully it is essential that the shortest possible time should elapse between dismissal and reinstatement.  Otherwise the job could be filled by another person who in turn might have a claim under the Act or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Because of the postal dispute a number of claims were received late by the the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I am informed that all but two of these cases have been resolved by the tribunal to the satisfaction of both sides and that discussions are taking place on the two outstanding cases.</P>
    <P>No complaint has been made to me or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal about difficulties in complying with the six months period because of loss of mail in transit.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not consider that a change in the law is necessary to deal with the situation indicated in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

      <P>Could the Minister give us an indication of the kind of recognised European bodies that will be regarded as funding channels for this kind of operation? Could he give us any indication whether any of this money could be used for the exchange of young workers between the north and south of Ireland in order to improve relations between the two parts of the island?</P>

      <P>I shall certainly let the Deputy have information on the bodies to be recognised.  As regards the second part of the question, if this idea can be pursued within that scheme and if there are recognised bodies that can be aided on both sides I would be very anxious to have the possibilities examined.  That would be very desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of appointments <Col N="1138" /> made by him to boards, agencies and so on under the aegis of his Department in the past 12 months, and the number of these who were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past 12 months I have made 32 appointments to various boards, agencies and so on operating under the aegis of my Department. Of these, seven were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans for the future to increase the number of women appointed to boards or agencies under his jurisdiction?  Will he use his influence in the interests of equality to have such appointments made in other Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases I am appointing nominees of both sides of industry. The greater portion of the 32 are not direct nominees of mine.  Although I appoint them, they are nominated to me by both sides of industry.  I have no control in that area over the nominations submitted to me.  In areas where I have control, since my appointment I have always ensured that there were women representatives if suitable and acceptable candidates were available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me dispel a little of the mist that Deputy Mitchell and a few letter writers in certain papers are creating.  I made one appointment to the Labour Court recently, the Deputy Chairman.  Of the other two, one was nominated by the Congress of Trade Unions and one by the FUE.  I think my predecessor in office expressed this view and I repeat it here, that we want a very suitable and acceptable person and I want the most acceptable, the best qualified and most experienced and suitable person for appointment of those available, irrespective of sex.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that while, as he correctly says, nominating bodies put forward nominees in many of the cases in which he has <Col N="1139" /> power of appointment, it might assist in securing a better balance of male-female representation in such bodies if he were to intimate to nominated bodies that he would look favourably on the nomination of women?  That would not interfere with the right to nominate but it might assist in getting more representation for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>From his own experience the Deputy will realise that both bodies would like to have their independence in regard to nominations.  I believe both sides would be anxious, if they had suitable and qualified persons available, to nominate women, as they have done in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I said in reply to an earlier question that the Minister for Labour will always be considering various ways of effecting improvements in the state of industrial relations.  The unhappy position in industrial relations did not occur today or yesterday or last year; it has been with us far too long and shows no sign of improvement.  Certain consideration will always be given to the introduction, perhaps, of legislation.  If a decision were to be taken on such legislation it would be preferable to have discussions with both sides of industry in an effort to ensure that it would be legislation of an encouraging and helpful nature, not related to the myth so many people entertain that you can legislate away your problems straight away.  That is not a possibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister's policy is to do nothing, fair enough, but would he not agree that it is not even helpful for his colleagues in Government to bellyache at what they consider politically appropriate times about threatened legislation?  Would he not agree that it is not good enough to threaten legislation because it might be popular when by-elections are pending <Col N="1141" /> when no consideration is being given to that kind of legislation?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The items discussed at the Council of EEC Ministers for Labour and Social Ministers on 22 November 1979 were:</P>
      <P> 1.  Draft resolution on work-sharing.</P>
      <P>2.  Commission Communication and draft Council resolution on linking work and training for young people in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> 3.  Proposal for a Council regulation concerning the adaptation of Regulation No. 1408/71 and of the annexes thereto in respect of social security for self-employed migrant workers.</P>
    <P>4.  Commission Communication to the Council concerning consultation on migration policies <i>vis-à-vis</i> third countries.</P>
    <P>5.  Commission report to the Council on the activities of the European Social Fund in 1978.</P>
    <P>6.  Commission memorandum on employee participation in asset formation. </P>
    <P>A detailed discussion took place in the Council on the draft resolution on work sharing and, despite differences of opinion on various aspects of the proposal, agreement was finally reached on the terms of a resolution.  The provisional text of the resolution will, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, be circulated with the Official Report.  While a resolution is not binding on the member states the resolution adopted should encourage the Commission and the Social Partners to continue their consultations and contacts with a view to the formulation of a Community approach to work sharing which, in the words of the resolution, &ldquo;will achieve overall coherence and foster consensus, at Community level&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The resolution contains a section dealing with overtime indicating that the Council considers that limits should be applied to the systematic use of overtime and invites the Commission to present its conclusions on possibilities of developing a Community approach as regards limiting systematic overtime working.</P>
    <P>Following is the provisional text of the Council resolution:</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="OA" LHead="Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions. Oral Answers. - Council" RHead="Resolution on Re-Organisation of Working Time">
    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Council Resolution on Re-Organisation of Working Time.</Title>
    <P>&ldquo;The Council of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,</P>
    <P>Having regard to the draft Resolution submitted by the Commission, Whereas <Col N="1147" /> demographic trends, the probability that economic growth will be moderate, the problems of adjustment resulting in particular from the rise in oil prices, the structural problems of the labour market and the progressive introduction of new technologies will exacerbate employment problems in the 1980's;</P>
    <P>Whereas the overall strategy aimed at increasing growth potential, competitiveness and innovation, improving the employment situation and responding to the emergence of new social needs in non-inflationary conditions must be continued and whereas measures to re-organise working time might be integrated in this overall strategy as ancillary measures in support of policies which might help to improve the employment situation;</P>
    <P>Whereas the measures to re-organise working time must be conceived with a view to improving living and working conditions and whereas they must contribute to improved protection of work and encourage worker participation in social and economic progress;</P>
    <P>Whereas the costs, if any, of these measures must be controlled; whereas adequate consideration must be given to the manner of covering these costs and whereas, in the context of negotiations between the social partners, regard should be had to the possibility of distributing the overall increase in productivity between re-organisation of working time and wage increases;</P>
    <P>Whereas this policy must be combined with measures aimed at encouraging worker mobility and training and at facilitating the investment or changes required, notably in undertakings, in order to encourage new recruitment or avoid redundancies;</P>
    <P>Whereas measures of this kind call for participation by workers and their representatives;</P>
    <P>Whereas these measures are a matter for collective agreements or for national legislation, but whereas their overall coherence, particularly as regards compatibility between the attitudes of the <Col N="1148" /> social partners, should be sought by all parties concerned also within the framework of dialogue and consultation at Community level;</P>
    <P>In view of the Commission's oral report on the contacts made between and with the social partners on the re-organisation of working time following the meetings of the Council on 15 May 1979 and of the Standing Committee on Employment on 22 May and 9 October 1979;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic Policy Committee of 26 October 1979.</P>
    <P>Stresses that any measures to reorganise working time should be assessed in the light of numerous factors and primarily of its effects on the production capacity of undertakings, productivity changes and wage compensation, and that the possibilities of decentralisation, differentiation for sectors and areas of activity and phased implementation should be taken into account in search for the measures to be taken and that there should be scope for the review of the measures taken;</P>
    <P>Requests the Commission to carry further the contacts it has made which are essential for the implementation of the measures referred to in this resolution.</P>
    <P>In the light of the exchanges of views which have taken place in recent months and the preliminary work carried out by the Commission, the Council, on the basis of its conclusions of 15 May 1979, approves the following guidelines:</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="OA" LHead="Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions. Oral" RHead="Answers. - Fields of Action">
    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Fields of Action</Title>
    <P>
      <i>Training work experience schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council has adopted a position in a separate resolution.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Overtime</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council considers that:</P>
    <P> (i)  limits should be applied to the systematic use of overtime; these limits should take account of the necessary flexibility of the production process of the undertaking and of the situation on the labour market; <Col N="1149" /> (ii)  given the different situations in the member states of the Community, provision should be made for the gradual implementation of this principle, taking into account the problems which could arise in this context for low paid workers in some member states;</P>
    <P>(iii)  implementation should take place in accordance with the usual procedures in force in each member state of the Community, while respecting the autonomy of the social partners;</P>
    <P>(iv)  one appropriate method of achieving such limits would be, for example, to introduce the principle of compensatory time-off for systematic overtime without such a form of compensation covering necessarily all the hours of overtime worked;</P>
    <P>(v)  supervision should be organised in accordance with the procedures in force in each member state.  </P>
    <P>
      <i>Flexible retirement</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council points out that it considers it very important that the Commission continue its work on flexible retirement.</P>
    <P>The Council considers that flexible retirement&mdash;which should be voluntary&mdash;should be developed in liaison with other measures to facilitate a gradual withdrawal from working life at the end of the worker's career, such as part-time work and longer holidays for older workers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Part-time work</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council notes that part-time work is now a reality on the labour market, but considers that the conditions applying thereto should be clarified.</P>
    <P>The Council believes that a Community approach should be based on the following principles:</P>
    <P> (i)  part-time work must be voluntary and open to both men and women.  It would not be imposed on persons who wish to work full-time. <Col N="1150" /> Furthermore, particular care must be taken to ensure that part-time work is not limited to work by women or to work of low skill and responsibility;</P>
    <P>(ii)  it would be desirable to examine the extent to which part-time work could be made more readily available to certain groups of workers, particularly parents with young children and older workers;</P>
    <P>(iii)  part-time workers should in principle have the same social rights and obligations as full-time workers, bearing in mind the specific character of the work performed;</P>
    <P>(iv)  part-time work should not be limited to half-time work, but could be based on a daily, weekly or monthly cycle adapted to the needs of different groups of workers and undertakings.  </P>
    <P>
      <i>Temporary work</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council notes that in the majority of member states temporary work has developed considerably over the last few years.</P>
    <P>The Council considers that Community action to support action by member states should be undertaken to ensure that temporary employment is controlled and that temporary employees receive social security protection.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Shift work</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council considers that shift work should be viewed in the context of the aspects relating to working and health conditions.</P>
    <P>The Council considers that the economic aspects of the problem must also be taken into consideration, particularly with regard to the competitiveness of undertakings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Annual hours of work</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council invites the Commission to examine, with the social partners, the conditions under which a Community approach on the subject of a reduction in annual working time could be established; <Col N="1151" /> this approach could, where appropriate, be taken into account in agreements at national, inter-trade or sectoral level.</P>
    <P>The Council asks that in such action account should be taken of the need to improve working conditions and the importance of preventing dismissals and favouring new recruitment.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the need to preserve conditions of competition should be taken into consideration, as should the effects on labour costs of reducing annual working time.</P>
    <P>Account should also be taken in such action of the series of new measures that might be adopted on the re-organisation of working time in the light of the guidelines advocated above.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Final provisions</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the light of the progress achieved in regard to the different aspects of the reorganization of working time referred to in this Resolution, the Council, recalling the conclusions reached by the European Council in Paris on 12 and 13 March 1979, asks the Commission to present:</P>
    <P>&mdash;its conclusions on possibilities of developing a Community approach as regards limiting systematic overtime working and reducing actual annual hours of work in the Community;</P>
    <P>&mdash;specific communications on flexible retirement, part-time work and temporary work.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Council invites:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Commission to continue wide-ranging consultations on the subject of re-organisation of working-time with the social partners;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the social partners to continue and strengthen their contacts at Community level, and to assist the efforts of the Council and the Commission and to continue their action, in the member states within the framework of their own responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>These consultations and contacts <Col N="1152" /> should lead to the formulation of a Community approach making for overall coherence and fostering consensus at Community level.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  After the House has had time to study the Official Report would the Minister consider allowing the House time to debate the document because it is a very important subject related to our employment prospects?</P>

      <P>I have no objection at all.  It depends on how the Order of Business of the House is arranged.  The Deputy will have a copy of the resolution. I agree that it is a subect of some importance.  I must confess I was pleased with the outcome of the meeting.  As I said in my reply, the resolution is not binding.  We started that morning from a position where some of the member states were very far apart and finished up with a resolution that evening.  That was very satisfactory progress.  That the Commission, with the Social Partners, can now continue from there and are in fact instructed or asked to continue from there is a major step forward.  I will certainly give consideration to what the Deputy has asked.</P>

      <P>I am aware that one major oil company have drawn the attention of their customers to the fact that diesel oil can cease flowing in the normal way at very low temperatures such as those experienced last year and have advised them to take reasonable protective measures.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable that consumers should be informed about the characteristics of any product which they purchase.</P>
      <P>I have obtained a report on the investigation carried out into the difficulties which occurred last winter arising from the waxing of gas/diesel oil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this notice which is attached to the order form is unreasonable in that the consumer has no alternative?  Secondly, the Minister is condoning the production of a substandard commodity in that he is not making minimum specific regulations concerning the standard of oil to be used.  How does he propose to suggest that people using, for example, tractors and motor cars can take evasive action to ensure that there will not be solidification?  In the case of domestic oil systems there is some hope of lagging and so on but with tractors, lorries and cars it is much more difficult. Could the Minister comment on the lack of specific standards applying to this commodity?</P>

      <P>I have informed the House that I propose to publish this report very shortly and I will take into account the views that no doubt will be expressed on it and on the recommendations which it contains.  It would be wrong for me to make any orders or establish particular specifications until I have had the benefit of the various views. These would include the views of consumers and various organisations of consumers such as farming and motoring organisations and others and, of course of the oil companies.  The matter is not as straightforward as the Deputy might imply and it is important that these views would be considered and whatever representations those people want to make taken into account.  When that has been done it is likely that I would then be in a position to make an order specifying certain standards.  It is perfectly reasonable and commendable on the part of the oil companies to give the warning which they do, and it is not in the terms which the Deputy might imply. It simply states: &ldquo;Please note that diesel oil can cease flowing in the normal way at very low temperatures such as those experienced last year.  We would advise you to take reasonable protective measures&rdquo;.  That is a reasonable thing for them to say and I am glad that they <Col N="1156" /> draw attention to the possibility of this problem.

      <P>Could I ask the Minister two brief questions?  He has read the notice which is incorporated in the order form by the oil companies.  How, in his opinion, does it affect the legal obligations of the companies?  Secondly, he has made the point that he is considering a report at the moment.  This report was commissioned by the IIRS as a result of last winter's freeze-up which caused solidification and many problems for consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the Members of this House and of consumers I am trying to elicit whether this lets the oil companies off the hook in so far as their legal obligations are concerned. If a mishap occurs due to a freeze-up is the consumer liable, despite the fact that he knows from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; that he is using a product which is substandard in these circumstances and has no alternative but to buy it where he is now buying it?  Let me come back to the second question.  The Minister has the IIRS report for some time.  We are in mid-winter again.  Why has the report not been published?</P>

      <P>The matter of legal obligations and commenting on them is not a matter for me and it would be inappropriate for me to do so.  It is a matter for the courts.  As far as I know there are one or more cases in the courts on this point, so it would be particularly inappropriate for me to seek to make any comment on that aspect of the matter.  It was only this morning that I succeeded in getting clearance from the Attorney General to publish the report because there were a number of cases pending. My Department were fearful that <Col N="1157" /> perhaps the publication of a report such as this at a time when apparently there were some cases in the courts might be regarded as prejudicing those cases.  I felt the report was a matter of general interest and should if possible be published.  The Attorney General debated the matter for some time but finally he agreed this morning that it would be in order for me to publish it. Therefore, I propose to do so.</P>

      <P>The satisfactory reply impinges on thousands of consumers around the country.  Does the Minister regard what happened last year to many oil supplies around the country as obvious proof that this commodity is not up to the standard required in severe weather conditions?  Is there any change in the standard of oil now being supplied by any company in this country as compared with last year's supply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that arose last year.  As far as I am aware it was the first and only time that that problem arose because of the most abnormally severe winter with prolonged, extremely low temperatures which have not been experienced in this country for a great many years and which on the law of averages are not likely to be repeated again for a great many more years.  The problem arose from the gas/diesel oil which was refined in Ireland.  Last winter that constituted about 40 per cent of the sales here.  This winter it will constitute something less than 40 per cent.  There is no difficulty with the other oil unless the temperature falls to an even more abnormally low figure.  The Deputy should bear in mind that last winter was so severe that the standard which pertains in Britain and which pertains to 60 per cent of our gas/diesel oil was not sufficient to prevent this problem arising in Britain also.</P>

It would have been unreasonable to make an order without letting the parties concerned know what the recommendations were.

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> I thank all those Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  A number of Deputies raised points in relation to programmes and to the day-to-day administration of RTE, but this is an area in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has no statutory function.  I assure the Deputies, though, that any comments made here will be read by the Authority and taken into consideration. This has been the practice in the past. Naturally, I have my own views in regard to programmes and I made these views known while I was in opposition. It is only right that Deputies would express their opinions on the type of radio and television programmes they would favour because these media are important factors in regard to the moulding of attitudes in our society.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with other matters raised by the various speakers during the debate, I should like to put on record my own appreciation of the manner in which RTE covered so effectively the recent visit to Ireland of Pope John Paul II.  Undoubtedly, the outside broadcast operation on that occasion was the largest undertaking ever attempted by RTE and they carried it off without a hitch at very short notice.  They have brought international credit and admiration not only to the Irish broadcasting service but to the nation as a whole.  I am sure that everybody here will join with me in congratulating all concerned in RTE for the success of that operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that section 3 of the Bill has given rise to so many difficulties. The range of sinister interpretations that have been put on the section has been unbelievable.  I wish to assure Deputies that there is nothing sinister about section 3.  The amendment has no relevance to the question of establishing an independent local authority.  As I said in <Col N="1186" /> my opening speech, this amendment is purely for clarification of the existing situation regarding RTE.  The position is that recently the Attorney General had some doubt as to whether RTE had statutory power under existing legislation to provide some of the local services which they are at present providing&mdash;for example, Cork local radio and community radio services in various towns. He advised us that the opportunity should be taken at the earliest possible moment to remove any doubt on the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies have offered various interpretations of section 3, but with regard to the possibility of RTE being given approval to establish additional local radio services before the legislation providing for the establishment of the independent local radio authority is enacted, I can inform Deputies that the Government have not taken any decision on proposals submitted by RTE in 1978 for local radio services in Dublin, Cork and Shannonside.  The Authority were informed that the Government's decision to set up an independent local radio authority would not necessarily preclude them from further involvement in local broadcasting and that if they wished to put forward fresh proposals after the new independent local radio authority had been set up, the matter could be reconsidered in the light of the circumstances existing then.  Of course, RTE would require the Minister's approval before establishing any new local radio service.  There are not any fresh proposals from RTE with my Department.</P>
    <P>As I said in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy O'Connell on 31 October last, the drafting of the necessary Bill to provide for the establishment of the new Authority is at an advanced stage.  I expect that it will be ready for introduction shortly after Christmas.  Section 3 is purely for the purpose of clarifying the position.  It does not in any way strengthen the monopoly of RTE.</P>
    <P>This sudden concern on the part of the Opposition Deputies to ensure that RTE do not secure a monopoly in the area of <Col N="1187" /> local radio is difficult to understand.  I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the speech of the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, on the Estimate for the Department on 10 May 1973.  He drew particular attention to the part of the joint Statement of Intent of the Coalition Parties which read as follows:</P>
    <P>The review of the television service and broadcasting services will be speeded up and a special examination made as a matter of urgency of such matters as a second television channel, local radio and the provision of piped television and the relationship of the RTE Authority with the Government. </P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is a matter of principle with this Government to keep the promises in the joint Statement of Intent and the implementation of this particular promise falls on me. </P>
    <P>On 27 June 1974 in the course of his reply on the Estimate debate for 1974, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien said:</P>
    <P>A fully equipped mobile radio studio will be brought into operation shortly and will be available for programme origination from provincial centres.  The first steps in local broadcasting have already been taken with the experimental programming from the Cork medium frequency transmitter.</P>
    <P>A new development is that a daily half-hour programme from Monday to Friday is being provided for a period of two months from 24 June. This service has the benefit of guidance and advice from the newly established Cork Radio Advisory Committee.  The Cork experiment in the next few months will be important in indicating the possibility of development of other such services.  If the result of the Cork experiment are encouraging, I hope to see it developed in other areas.  We will be watching <Col N="1188" /> the experiment with great interest. </P>
    <P>Deputies will note that there is no mention of any possibility of a body other than RTE developing these services.  Section 3 of this Bill ensures that RTE's local radio services are properly constituted. The Coalition Government did not give a promise that they would establish an independent radio authority which we are doing now.  We have taken a positive step forward.  I was surprised to hear criticism of my Department and the Minister from the Fine Gael benches. They said we were giving a stronger monopoly to RTE, but that is not true.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> The Coalition Government did not put forward any provisions with regard to an independent authority.  We will be circulating a Bill very shortly and the Deputy will not be able to say then that RTE have any monopoly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy and a number of Opposition Deputies raised the question whether RTE's present monopoly is constitutional. This is a question that only the courts can decide.  The answer to it would not be affected one way or the other by the enactment of section 3 of the Bill.  Therefore, I can see no point in arguing about it, particularly as RTE will not have a monopoly under the provisions of the Bill which is being drafted to set up an independent local radio authority and which I have already stated will be circulated shortly after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan asked for additional details of RTE's capital plans and asked for what projects RTE had sought Government approval.  In my opening statement I referred to the broad categories of work on which RTE expect to spend £23,500,000 during the next four to five years.  RTE envisage that the major part of the expenditure, about £14.9 million, will be on equipping additional television studios and renewing various production facilities in the existing studios.  This would allow the service to provide more home-produced <Col N="1189" /> material and to keep abreast of the latest developments in production equipment. RTE also expect that the improvement of television and radio reception will cost £4 million.  A large part of this cost will be incurred on extending RTE 2 to those parts of the country where a satisfactory service is not yet available.  RTE plan to improve their regional inputs into the national services and to provide new television centres in Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>The Radio na Gaeltachta studios in Kerry and Donegal are also to be extended. All of these developments will cost about £2.6 million.  Finally, RTE would like to provide for the development of radio production facilities and various other support services at a cost of about £2 million.</P>
    <P>I made clear in my opening statement that this Bill does not imply any approval of RTE's plans for the years up to 1983.  Each year's expenditure and advances will be subject to examination annually in the context of the public capital programme.  The total expenditure of £23,500,000 envisaged by RTE included expenditure in the current financial year. The programme for the current year has, of course, been approved by the Government and it provides for repayable Exchequer advances of £2.45 million towards a total expenditure of £5.15 million.  As I also mentioned in my earlier speech, about £1.8 million of the repayable advances approved for this year cannot be paid over until this Bill is enacted.  RTE have submitted their case for expenditure and advances for 1980 and it is being examined currently with the rest of the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan also asked if it was intended when the RTE Authority were set up that borrowed capital should always be repaid.  The statutory position is that the terms and conditions as to repayment of Exchequer advances are proper to be determined by the Minister for Finance.  The Department of Finance have proposed arrangements for repayment of advances made to RTE up to the end of 1978.  This has been referred to RTE for their observations, which are awaited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> In the course of the debates on the Broadcasting Authority Bill, 1959, it was made clear that the establishment of a television service should not give rise to any ultimate charge on the Exchequer. Provision was made for repayable Exchequer advances up to £2 million for capital purposes.  The bulk of this amount was to meet the cost of provision of the television transmitter network and studios.  The then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stated in the Seanad on 10 February 1960 that RTE would be expected as soon as possible to put themselves in the position of repaying the capital borrowed.  Therefore, after a period of almost 20 years it is not unreasonable to expect the RTE Authority to begin repaying the Exchequer advances made to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy expressed concern at the level of television licence fee evasion. I share this concern and my Department are doing all in their power to combat the problem through special campaigns, door to door inspections, the use of information supplied by television dealers, and so on.  Unfortunately, it is exceedingly difficult to convince the hard core of licence evaders that they should make their just contribution to the cost of running the broadcasting service.  The problem is not peculiar to this country.  I have no doubt that every Member of the House would agree that everybody should pay his licence fee.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the need to introduce a computerised television licence system.  This matter is under consideration in my Department, but it is too early to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy, Deputy O'Keeffe and other Deputies referred to difficulties with television reception in various parts of rural Ireland and the extension of coverage of RTE 2.</P>
    <P>The provision of the transmitter network for RTE 2 is, of necessity, a phased development.  The first phase which has been completed, involved the provision of six high power transmitters which provide coverage of RTE 2 for approximately 90 per cent of the population. Provision was also made to provide <Col N="1191" /> RTE 2 at a number of low powered transposers from the outset for operational reasons.  This approach also had the advantage that the new service was provided for the greatest number of viewers in the former single channel area from the beginning.</P>
    <P>RTE say that their main development priorities for improvement of reception are: the provision of new stations for RTE 1 and RTE 2 at Holywell Hill, County Donegal and Clermont carn, County Louth.  These stations are expected to be in service in the latter part of next year; the extension of RTE 2 and RTE 1 over North Mayo and West Galway; the completion of coverage in West Kerry; the planning of coverage for South Tipperary, North West Donegal and West Clare areas.</P>
    <P>The improvement of reception in a number of other areas is likely to require the provision of additional transposers and adaptations to existing transmitters. A very large volume of investigative work is now being carried out by RTE to determine how best RTE 2 may be provided from those transposers not yet equipped for the service.  RTE are pressing ahead as quickly as possible with this work which is both complex and time consuming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also referred to reception of RTE television and radio programmes in Nothern Ireland.</P>
    <P>About 14 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland can receive satisfactory reception of RTE television signals at present using simple outdoor aerials. Fringe type aerials may give a service of variable quality to a greater proportion of the population.  Overspill of signals from new stations in Donegal and Louth, which are necessary to improve reception in those areas, will improve the position somewhat.  However under international regulations the power of transmitters must be limited to that necessary to provide satisfactory reception within the borders of the country concerned although it is understood that some overspill is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> Deputy Deasy referred to a demand for a greater provincial input to RTE programming.  RTE envisage greater emphasis on regional production and they are planning to spend some £2.6 million on provincial radio and TV facilities over the next four to five years. The techniques to be used for regional input to the national network is a matter for RTE.  However, I am aware of the existence of technology such as electronic news gathering which facilitates the speedy preparation of news items.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty referred to advertising and Deputy Kelly mentioned it also. Deputy Hegarty said that RTE should get out of advertising altogether when the independent local radio Authority is established.  This just would not be feasible. In the financial year ended 30 September 1978 RTE received over £12 million in advertising income.  This was somewhat more than they received in television licence fee income and only £2.9 million in respect of radio advertising. There is just no way that RTE could recover the loss of advertising income without a very substantial increase in the licence fee&mdash;even a doubling of it.  I doubt that Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Kelly would support that.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into any detail in replying to the points made by Deputy Keating, because he was clearly speaking with his tongue in his cheek.  I cannot, however, let him get away with his statement that RTE have never made any demand for the exclusive right to broadcast and with the extract he quoted from RTE's last annual report in support of that statement.  I would simply like to quote the full paragraph which he conveniently left out from the RTE Report. Deputies will see that what the RTE Authority had proposed was that they themselves should be given authority to provide a second national radio service and to introduce local radio services in a number of centres.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that RTE made no demand for local services.  We had submissions from the Authority with regard to setting up local radio in Dublin, Cork, Shannon and other parts <Col N="1193" /> of the country.  We had made a firm decision and we did not acceed to that request.  The paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>As in the case of television, the Authority had long been of the view that a single radio channel was inadequate for the provision of a full range of programming and of programme choice to the listener.  Attention had been drawn on a number of occasions to the need for a second national radio channel.  Moreover, the need for local radio stations offering a communitybased radio service to the public was also clear.  While every effort had been made within the constraints of a single channel to offer as comprehensive a programme service as possible, to provide some programmes choice through the VHI network, and to increase the number of programmes originated outside Dublin, these measures were by definition of limited effect.  The Authority, during the year under review, sought the formal approval of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the introduction of a second national radio channel and to the introduction of comprehensive local radio services in a number of centres. </P>
    <P>Deputy Keating and Deputy Deasy were critical of my Department in enforcing the law against the operators of illegal broadcasting stations.  As reported in the Official Report of 29 December Deputy Deasy said:</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the operators of such stations are labelled as pirates and as people who are breaking the law.  The fact is that they are good people who have a certain skill and acumen and are using it as they see best.  They are giving good employment and great enjoyment to large sections of the community.  Rather than prosecute and label them as law breakers we should be endeavouring to bring them within the ambit of a legal broadcasting system and give them the opportunity to partake in the independent local broadcasting system throughout the country. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> Deputy Keating complained bitterly that the operators of illegal broadcasting stations, whom he describes as people with entrepreneurial flair, a sense of adventure and a desire to communicate at local level, are branded as law breakers. I doubt that anyone in this House would support people who are not operating within the law.  I am sure we would be criticised on this side of the House if we did not uphold the law.  We took decisions in my Department to ensure that the law was upheld.  We cannot be criticised for that.  That is our policy. Everybody should be equal before the law.  I believe that my Department were right to make decisions to ensure that the laws of the State are upheld.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I am not misinterpreting what has been said.  Deputy Deasy referred to the fact that the output of educational programmes on RTE had fallen and sought the establishment of an &ldquo;Open University&rdquo; type service here.  The cost of such a service would have to be borne by the Department of Education.  The Department of Education have been unable to bear the cost of &ldquo;Telefis Scoile&rdquo; programmes in recent years.  Despite this lack of financing, RTE have retained &ldquo;Telefis Scoile&rdquo; on a modified scale and at a much reduced cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Open University in Britain is a system of higher education for adults involving a partnership between the BBC and the Open University&mdash;an independent teaching and degree awarding university. The BBC produces and broadcasts programmes for Open University <Col N="1195" /> students in a close working relationship with the university.  The British Government pays a grant to the Open University and they in turn meet in full the BBC production and programme costs.  Students pay a proportion of tuition fees, the cost of summer schools, books and other expenses to the university.  The cost of an open university here would be very great in relation to our resources.</P>
    <P>The question of any expansion of formal educational broadcasting on RTE is really a matter that should be pursued with the Minister for Education.  In this connection I should say that the Broadcasting Review Committee, who reported in 1974, came to the conclusion that the arrangement whereby the Department of Education pay for programmes produced for and broadcast to schools should continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan asked if it is intended that a person seconded from the employment of RTE could return to exactly the same position in RTE at the end of his service in either House of the Oireachtas. The answer is no.  He could merely be entitled to re-employment in RTE in a post of the same or similar grade.  In this connection, Deputy Keating wrongly interpreted the section.  He said that the section limits the freedom of RTE members in relation to access to the House. The present provision guarantees that members of RTE can return to RTE.  In the past they had to resign on coming into the House.  Now that they can be seconded.  I am surprised that Deputy Keating should take that interpretation of section 4 of the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> Deputy O'Keeffe asked if RTE were giving good value for money.  I would refer the Deputy to Occasional Paper No. 23 of the National Prices Commission, published in December 1976.  This report was prepared by consultants engaged by the commission to examine the operations of RTE.  The report states that the consultants' studies of other broadcasting organisations led them to the conclusion that RTE are by no means inefficient in comparison.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the situation is any different now.  In fact, the advent of RTE 2 and Radio 2 has undoubtedly brought about a greater utilisation of existing resources.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to over-staffing, inefficiency and so on.  I am sure that Deputy O'Keeffe will find Occasional Paper No. 23 of the National Prices Commission interesting reading in regard to the efficiency and operation of the station.</P>
      <P>While I said at the opening of my reply to this debate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on programming matters on RTE&mdash;and I am sure that Deputies realise that I have no function in regard to the day-to-day operation of their programmes&mdash;I must refer to Deputy Enright's remarks about the lack of investigative journalism in recent years.  The Deputy quoted the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme on illegal moneylending which was broadcast by RTE in 1969 as an example of the sort of thing RTE should be broadcasting.  I would remind him that it was necessary to set up a tribunal to inquire into, <i>inter alia,</i> the planning, presentation and authenticity of that programme and that RTE came out of the matter very badly.</P>

I <Col N="1197" /> have explained to the House that section 3 is only for clarification.  We were advised by the Attorney General that the constitutionality of local radio operating at present under the Authority is questionable.  He advised us that we should avail of the opportunity to rectify the matter.  The case was made that we should have waited until the new Bill was introduced.  It would not be an appropriate Bill in which to insert a section like this.  We are introducing a Bill establishing an Independent Authority.  In 1978, RTE applied to the Department for permission to extend local radio. Their application will not be sanctioned by the Minister until the Bill establishing an Independent Authority comes before the House.  We were hoping to have the Bill circulated before Christmas but it has been delayed.  When the Bill is circulated, Deputies will be able to see that we are not strengthening the monopoly of RTE.  Their monopoly will not exist once the Bill has been enacted.  Let us hope that it will be enacted early in 1980.</P>

The money will not go to an isolated section of the broadcasting service but will be distributed throughout the service.  However, a considerable amount will be devoted to the rural studios to improve local productions.  As I pointed out, a certain amount of money is due to the Authority.  In last year's capital budget that money was voted to the Authority but it is not possible to transfer it until this Bill is passed.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,990,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979 for grants-in-aid of An tUdarás um Ard-Oideachas, certain Higher Education Institutions and Services and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of items in relation to these Supplementary Estimates to which I should like to draw the attention of the House because I consider them important and there is a danger they may be overlooked.  One of the subheads we are discussing relates to the school transport service which was dealt with at length by Deputy Collions.  It is an irony of educational administration and, perhaps, of politics and finance as well, that when school rationalisation at primary level and free education so-called at second level was introduced few people realised the size of the transport bill that would be involved in the provision of this necessary service.  Indeed, in the Supplementary Estimates before us the additional sum required is of the order of £2 million, a substantial sum by <Col N="1200" /> any standards.  In fact, it is the largest subhead in the Supplementary Estimate on this Vote.  I should like to draw attention to one group of people in relation to the administration of this service.  When I did so before the answers I got were very unsatisfactory.  I should like to remind the Minister about this problem and ask him to do something to solve it.</P>
      <P>There are a number of people who live far enough away from their local primary school to be entitled to a free transport service if there were enough of them there to justify the sending of a bus or car.  But because there are not enough of them, because there may be only two or three of them, or perhaps one only, they get nothing.  They do not get a free transport service because it is uneconomic to do so and they are left to make their own way to school at their own expense.  Some time ago in a parliamentary question I asked the Minister how many people were in this position.  I got the answer that he simply did not know.  I am not making any special plea here for my constituency because, if I can be sure of one thing, it is that few, if any, of them live in south county Dublin.  But they do exist; they exist in the west, south and, I suspect, the north-west.  Perhaps they exist even in the Minister's constituency.  It would seem to me, in the interests of equity, a very valid and worthwhile exercise for the Minister to get the officers of his Department to find out who these people are and to include them in the free transport system at least in some way.  If he cannot send a bus or car for them&mdash;and I fully accept that this may be beyond the scope of the scheme&mdash;then he should consider making a cash grant out of this Supplementary Estimate to the parents of the children concerned so that they could at least defray the expense of getting their children to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Vote on Primary Education, reference has been made already to the question of the additional grants made by way of capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools.  An extra £500,000 is being provided here.  We are all glad that this <Col N="1201" /> amount is being provided but we must remember that this money, and the additional sums being provided under this Estimate, will be administered by boards of management which do not, at this time, include any representatives of the teaching profession in those schools.  The reason that the administration of the system will be lacking this very important ingredient is that, apparently, the review body the Minister set up to examine the operation of the system after their initial years in operation stalemated.  Since that stalemate nothing substantial has been done to bring the teachers back on to these boards.</P>
    <P>I am as aware as anybody else that the Minister cannot achieve miracles, he cannot do the impossible, but at least he should be making some kind of a stab at what is possible.  Surely he cannot agree that the continued absence of teacher representatives from these boards of management is in the best interests of the administration of these funds and indeed of the primary education system in particular. He must tell the House what steps he has taken since the stalemating of the review body to ensure that this state of affairs is brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  It was the last administration so frequently jeered at by the Minister which made a change in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>So frequently derided, perhaps, by the Minister that made a very substantial change in the administration which covers the allocation of these sums of money.  It is odd, to put it mildly, that the Minister who came into office has only partially honoured the commitment, not just to review but to act on the results of a review of that system after three years in operation. <Col N="1202" /> The part of the country from which the Minister comes is such that he will be no stranger to the art of striking bargains.  I am sure, if a bargain can be struck about anything, it can be struck here.  I would argue that it is vitally important to get the teacher back on to the boards of management in these schools and to undertake whatever negotiations are necessary to bring this about.</P>
      <P>In relation to the community schools, which are financed under the Vote for Secondary Education, I spent some time&mdash;and I do not propose to repeat myself&mdash;investigating the deeds of trust. All I should like to do at this stage is to specify the questions I was raising the last time: why, in the consultation processes that he initiated in relation to the finalisation of the deeds of trust, did the Minister treat two Protestant organisations differently from the other organisations invited to consult?  Secondly, is he happy with the situation in which representatives of some Protestant denominations have now stated that the deed of trust, as finalised, is unacceptable to them in certain respects?  Thirdly, does he propose to do anything about it?  I believe this whole episode has been a very sad, missed opportunity for the effective rationalisation of second level education in this country.  The irony is that, instead of rationalising it, we have now a secondary education system split in four different ways; whereas before the whole process of experimentation began it was split in two different ways only, between secondary and vocational, it is now split between secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive. Indeed, within that general split, there seems to be no likelihood that the so-called community schools, for any time in the foreseeable future, will educate more than a minority of the community's children.  This is a sad irony in view of their name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Vote for Vocational Education, could the Minister tell us what future he envisages for this system? Is it merely to remain as a rump of the second level educational system?  In reply to a parliamentary question recently <Col N="1203" /> the Minister indicated to me that the huge majority of the projected community schools were in fact to be green field schools and that less than five, if I remember rightly, involved the amalgamation of vocational schools. Therefore the question arises: what future does the Minister have in mind for this system?  Is he not prepared, even at this late stage, to consider these schools and the committee system under which they operate, however amended and refurbished, as the basis for a regional system of education?  I would urge that view on him, not just in the name of the vocational education system&mdash;because I would be the last to agree that this is perfect in all its aspects&mdash;but in the name of providing an important, democratically organised and based buffer state between the individual school and the tentacles of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to turn to Higher Education and to that part of the Minister's speech when he said:</P>
    <P>This amount also includes a sum of £1,750,000 towards deficits which are expected to accrue on the current accounts of the various institutions in 1979, due to increased approved costs on non-pay items. </P>
    <P>There is a very important issue at stake here.  The Minister should tell us exactly what is the current account state of the various institutions.  Is it not a fact that, owing to under-financing by his Department in the last couple of years, they have been forced to go into the red in order to keep their services to the student community and to the community at large at the appropriate levels?  Is it not a fact that his Department have refused, apparently until now, to face up to the problem caused by university institutions running into overdraft situations? Further, can he tell us whether any sums will be made available to pay overdrafts which may have been incurred prior to 1979, or indeed what is his policy in relation to the future incurring of overdrafts.  If he is going to allow and expect educational institutions to go into overdraft, he is perhaps introducing a <Col N="1204" /> new element into the political equation or balance between these institutions and his Department, which has implications for the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the grant to St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, for secular education, I have already said all I propose to say.  In case it should be misunderstood as a criticism of any particular institution, I should like to make it clear that I believe the concept of academic freedom should be defended by the Minister in any institution in which it is under threat. It is not so long ago since that late and very distinguished Member of Seanad Éireann, Owen Sheehy Skeffington, fell foul of his own authorities in Trinity College, Dublin, when he had the temerity to append the name of that insituation to a letter he wrote to the newspapers on some controversial subject or other.  This, too, I would regard as an infringement of academic freedom, although a considerably minor one compared with the one which involved the sacking of two professors in Maynooth. I ask the Minister to be vigilant on this and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that there are decent conditions created and maintained for the staff in those institutions.</P>
    <P>There is a subhead in the Higher Education Estimate in relation to the general expenses of the higher Education Authority.  The higher Education Authority have been doing an excellent job.  Their recently retired chairman deserves a vote of thanks for the contribution he has made at the end of a very distinguished public service career to the very demanding position of chairman of that Authority.  I would like to single out, particularly, in relation to the Authority the frequency with which they publish documents, reports and analyses, which do not shun controversy and which are clear if sometimes arguable.  I noted the Minister's exchanges with Deputy E. Collins about the participation rates in higher education and I presume the Minister was referring to things like the proportion of graduate students and the average length of courses in other European countries, <Col N="1205" /> which might be taken as qualifying some of the statistics in that particular report. While it is true that those statistics may be qualified, the Minister should not be allowed to suggest that because those statistics need to be qualified they are worthless.  I believe that a large part of them indicate a very substantial problem for higher education enrolements.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to one particular publication, which is not actually a publication of the Authority as a whole but one to which a section of the Authority contributed, in which a servant of the Authority, has a most interesting section called Higher Education in the European Community, A Handbook for Students.  I refer the Minister to the section of that publication on Ireland, which I believe was written by Mr. Hayden of the Higher Education Authority and refers, among other things, to the cost of living and states:</P>
    <P>It was estimated in June 1978 that the cost of living for an Irish student for a period of nine months amount to IRL £1,368 (or IRL £152 per month).  It should be noted that this figure which does not include student fees, will normally be higher for foreign students. </P>
    <P>Here is another example of a member of the staff of the authority publishing an important political fact which throws into a very disadvantageous light the Minister's apparent assumption that the level of the maintenance element of the higher education grant at the moment, which is substantially below the £1,300 that is considered by a member of the staff of the Higher Education Authority as being essential, in any way meets the real needs of the situation.  I urge the Minister, in at least this area if in no others, at this particular point in time, to take account of the wisdom of this member of the staff of the Higher Education Authority and to increase the maintenance element of the grant proportionately.</P>

      <P>While my colleague, Deputy E. Collins, and Deputy Horgan have covered this Vote in detail, I want to concentrate on more specific matters in relation to it.  I am glad to speak particularly <Col N="1206" /> on subhead F.1, the National Museum.  This subhead seeks an additional sum of £15,000 to enable the museum to purchase a Gunmoney Crown Proof in Gold dated 1690.  We are told the coin is one of only two original specimens, the other being in the British museum.  I am very disappointed that the Minister is not coming to the House seeking a much greater sum of money to carry out the very essential repairs which are so obviously needed for our National Museum.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the report of the board of visitors for the years 1977 and 1978 of the National Museum of Science and Art, which was presented to him.  This is a cry from the heart from the 12 members of the board imploring the Government to finally do something for our museum.  The board is composed of 12 members, four appointed by the State, three by the Royal Irish Academy and five by the Royal Dublin Society.  Nobody can accuse those members of being politically motivated.  Their aim is to advance the cause of culture particularly the National Museum.  This document is very critical of the Government for the neglect towards this most essential institute of culture.  The report states that the Government have completely ignored the advice which their report contained.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to give a solemn undertaking to the House that he will look at the recommendations and the points raised by the board of visitors so that the museum will be able to play its part in the cultural life of the nation.  There are many other references to this matter.  There is a very excellent article by Dr. Lucas of the National Museum, published in 1976, which gives an idea of the place of the <Col N="1208" /> National Museum in our cultural life.  In a report by the National Museum Development Committee called a Museum Service, there are recommendations which should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to bring up this matter also under the Board of Works Estimate.  As the Minister is a responsible person and the report has been presented to him he should give the lead in this regard.  It is amazing that, in 50 or 60 years of our freedom, no advancement at all has been made, indeed, the reverse.  The numbers visiting the National Museum in 1929/30 were 367,147 and the figure for 1970 is a mere 178,486 people visiting our Museum.  Also space has been reduced; little by little the museum space has been whittled away.  In 1920, their accommodation was 115,000 square feet; in 1972 this was reduced to 96,500 square feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but this is the only opportunity I have to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and understand that, but in case the simple facts have escaped the attention of the Minister, I ask him to bear them in mind. The exhibition space also has been reduced.  In 1920 it was 88,400 square feet and in 1972 it was reduced to <Col N="1209" /> 44,200 square feet.  Indeed, the National Library and the College of Art are worried that this House, Dáil Éireann, may make further encroachment on their very valuable space.  Paraphrasing the old country saying &ldquo;The nearer to the church, the farther from God&rdquo;, is it a case of &ldquo;The nearer Dáil Éireann, the farther from the Minister's purse&rdquo;, because these buildings are adjacent to Dáil Éireann?  Is there a parallel case here?  I urge the Minister, in the coming budget, to advocate a complete reappraisal of the role that the museum must play in the life of the nation.  I look forward to the day when our museum could enter for such competitions as the European Museum Award or, indeed, the Council of Europe Award.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that because of the poor state of the buildings, the coin may not be preserved properly.  Because of the lack of proper exhibition rooms and proper attendant staff we will not be in a position to show this coin to the numbers of people who wish to view it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is going to continue on those lines, he will have to resume his seat. Someone has said that the Chair has already had too much patience.  If the Deputy does not get away from that point, I will have to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about this coin and about the failure of the museum to exhibit it properly, to preserve it and about the lack of attendant staff to show this coin to the Dublin people.  I would urge the Minister to take all the necessary measures to ensure that this coin is properly exhibited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that somebody takes the coin as well as the measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it is properly preserved in our National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead F.3. on Wood Quay, the Government have been totally insensitive to the demands of the archaeologists who feel that Wood Quay has a significance at both European and international level.  Surely the Minister is aware of a resolution adopted by the <Col N="1213" /> Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe which urged the Dublin authorities to delay further construction until the systematic archaeological excavation of the site is completed, to reconsider plans for developing the site for offices for Dublin City Corporation and to consult international archaeologists about the best means of conserving and presenting the material discovered on the site.  In his reply would the Minister indicate if he is prepared to spend a greater amount of money on further excavations on the site?</P>
    <P>There is grave concern among archaeologists that no proper reported survey has been produced on Wood Quay by the National Museum.  I do not wish to enter into the controversy of Wood Quay.  I understand the humanitarian difficulties being encountered by the Government and by the Dublin Corporation in providing office space, but here we had a golden opportunity to preserve a site of rare archaeological importance and we failed miserably to take that opportunity.  In Stavanger a similar situation arose and it was dealt with differently.  But for the action taken in Stavanger a whole village of a wooden house area would have been destroyed forever.  The Wood Quay episode is a sorry episode in the life of the Government.  The Minister for Education should have taken the lead and urged his colleagues in the Cabinet to preserve this valuable historic site for Ireland and especially for our Northern European colleagues in the EEC.  Instead, it was brutally handled without sensitivity to the needs and wishes of the people genuinely concerned with its conservation and preservation.  I would urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to rescue what he can and ensure that further excavations are carried out under proper supervision, that a proper report of the archaeological finds to date is made and that a proper survey is carried out so that we will at least rescue something from the unholy mess of the Wood Quay site.</P>
    <P>I would also urge the Minister to give greater grants in future.  I am pleased to <Col N="1214" /> note that under subhead D.13 a grant of £1,500, small though it is, has been granted to Foras Éireann.  I would urge that an increased grant be given to them in future years to help them with their splendid work in the cultural adult education field.  I would urge the Minister also to take my remarks about the museum into account when he is formulating his policy for 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concentrate on vocational education and the role of the regional technical colleges since their establishment as institutions of higher technological education.  The ministerial decision of 1967 to establish them has been vindicated as these colleges have proved very successful in terms of their huge enrolment and their contribution to providing skilled people to industry.  I would compliment all those involved in the regional technical colleges for the success of this project.</P>
      <P>However, in recent years it has become obvious that we are facing a serious crisis because of the shortage of suitable trained people in certain key skilled areas.  This fact was confirmed recently by the FUE, the trade union movement and others who are alarmed at the serious shortage of skilled technicians to man industry as it comes onstream.  This crisis affects our ability to attract new industry which is vital to our national development.  There is an unfortunate situation in relation to the national attitude towards academic education at a time when we need more technological apprentices, scientists and so on.  We need workers to man industry which is needed so much as we face the eighties.  This crisis is further compounded by our growing population, the increasing numbers of boys and girls participating in third-level education and the serious shortage of places projected for third-level education by 1986.  The IDA Industrial Plan, 1978-1982, indicates what I am saying very clearly where it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central industrial strategy in the IDA Plan is to shift our industry into products with higher added value <Col N="1215" /> based on good quality and design, aimed at specialist market niches using well planned professional marketing.  The strategy will aim to capitalise on the strengths of the country, such as the high level of education, where we have an advantage over Third World Countries.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that a serious mismatch could arise between the job opportunities arising in industry and the qualifications of job seekers, particularly young persons.  We could, for example, have high unemployment side-by-side with shortages of graduate engineers, technicians and skilled craftsmen.  Investment in educational facilities and equipment should be adequately geared to give the education and training in technologies appropriate to the rapidly growing industrial sectors, such as, computers and electronics. </P>
    <P>A recent survey was carried out by a Dr. Hennessy for the NCEA which emphasised the points I am making.  He pointed out that an additional 12,000 places will be needed in the higher technological education sector by 1986.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a project which is in the minds of all the people in a united Tipperary.  I want to compliment the Minister on his recent sanctioning of the building of a vocational school in Thurles.  We are grateful for his interest in the needs of County Tipperary.  This year people concerned with the development of our county got together several times.  The local authorities of North and South Tipperary, the VECs of North and South Tipperary, trade unionists, SFADCo, our industrial agents for the area and voluntary organisations were unanimous that now that a new school is on-stream for Thurles we believe we have a very good case to make for one of the regional colleges which I hope the Minister will be contemplating in next year's budget and the years ahead.  We have many things going for us in Tipperary and our figures compare very favourably with areas where regional colleges were established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The money has been allocated for the building of this school in Thurles.  County Tipperary has a population 133,000 which compares very favourably with catchment areas of three other regional colleges.  I appeal to the Minister, after considering the very strong case put to him by the people of Tipperary, when deciding on the location of the new regional colleges to keep the Premier County in the front of his mind. The school being built in Thurles can be dovetailed into a technical college which will meet the needs of industry, employment and all the other infrastructures in our area.</P>
      <P>We are an agricultural county and are endeavouring to promote more industries for our larger towns and peripheral areas.  We believe the establishment of this college in Thurles will go a long way towards meeting the needs for skills and expertise which will be required when the new industries are established in our county.  I want to put on the record my appreciation of the establishment of the new technical school in Thurles.  I look forward to the Minister recognising it in a very short period as a regional college for County Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I want to make.  I want the Minister to consider building a new second level school in Dunboyne.  The situation there is that up to this year pupils were attending two schools.  The Coolmine school, which is in County Dublin, is the nearest school for the children living on the eastern side of Dunboyne and the children on the western and northern sides attend the Dunshaughlin Community College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> I made some inquiries recently about the situation and will be supplying the Minister within the next 24 hours with information I obtained from each of the three community colleges in the area.  In the case of Dunshaughlin, they have already reached capacity.  They have 24 classrooms and every one is full.  They carried out certain projections as to the needs for next year and estimate they will need 25 or 26 classrooms.  On the basis of projected enrolments this will mean that the authorities in Dunshaughlin will either have to turn pupils away or look for pre-fabs.  The same situation obtains in Coolmine.  The Minister may not be aware, but his Minister of State is, that Coolmine succeeds the Blanchardstown vocational school.  Coolmine is also full.  They told pupils from Dunboyne that they will not be able to accept any of them unless they come from families, members of whom are already attending the school.  The third school in the area is Blakestown, a new school recently opened in a new suburb&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to attend to the matter.  In relation to Vote 30, I notice there has been a saving on subhead D.9, grants towards clerical assistance in secondary schools.  I understand there is a considerable need for clerical assistance in these schools and yet this subhead shows a saving of £750,000.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how such a massive saving could be made, a saving which constitutes more than half the amount provided. Has the Minister received any representations on this matter from the teaching organisations?  Are they happy that money voted from this House was not spent?  On the face of it, there would appear to be some appearance of maladministration in failing to ensure that money voted by this House was spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a saving on Vote 30 according to the Estimate under subhead D.11 but in the provisional Book of Estimates I have&mdash;the yellow edition&mdash;there is no subhead D.11.  I am at a loss to know what the saving was.  It is a significant matter because the saving comes to more than £¼ million.  Where a saving of that nature was made and it relates to a subhead that does not appear in the Book of Estimates there should be some explanation as to how this occurred. <Col N="1219" /> Perhaps I am under a misapprehension because I am working from the yellow book.</P>

As the person responsible for commencing the grant-in-aid for youth employment albeit at a lower level than it exists now&mdash;I compliment my successor on the big increases made under this heading&mdash;I am surprised that a saving of a £½ million could have been made when there is such a need to aid youth employment.  Can the Minister explain those two matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long discussion on the museum.  I am proud to have been associated with the first ever increase in the space of the National Museum when the premises in Merrion Row were acquired when I was in office.  I am also proud that I was associated with the National Library when the premises in Leinster Lane were acquired and that I was associated with the initation of an educational service for the museum, library and National Gallery.  A co-ordinating committee were set up to bring together the various educational services and my information is that this committee have been meeting infrequently, if at all.  There have been some sub-committee meetings but no meeting of the plenary committee.  I do not know how a sub-committee can function without any meetings of the main committee. I should like an assurance from the Minister that the idea of a co-ordinating committee for all the educational services for the various institutions has not been abandoned.  It <Col N="1221" /> would bring good results in this general area.</P>
    <P>As regards the Primary Education Vote, No. 31, I agree with the Minister on the emphasis he has put, at least in his public statements, on the primacy of primary education and the need to give a greater weight to primary education than has been given in the history of the State. It is the one aspect of education that is availed of by the entire community. Those who are privileged, if not financially at least intellectually, benefit from higher education.  In the case of secondary education only half that period is covered by compulsory school attendance. Although every child attends for a time he or she does not have to attend for the full duration.  In the case of primary education every child must attend for the full duration of the primary curriculum.  The amount of money devoted by successive Governments to primary education has been less per pupil than the amount allocated to higher education, which absorbs a good deal more money than either of the other two, and less also in the amount devoted to secondary education.  I should like to see a continuing priority on primary education in the interests of social justice.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there seems to be&mdash;there is controversy about this matter&mdash;a number of children leaving primary school without the basic skills of literacy and numeracy being sufficiently imbued in their minds.  There are people in the secondary sector who claim that children come to them without these basic skills.  Given the pupil/teacher ratio and the many problems facing primary education this is not necessarily anybody's fault but it should be sorted out at the earliest possible date.  There should be some system of testing on an objective basis of pupils, not with a view to streaming them but to finding out whether they have these basic deficiencies. I suggest this could be done at the age of nine or ten years on a national scale so that these children, instead of not being identified until they reach leaving certificate which is the first time they do any comprehensive national test under <Col N="1222" /> existing rules, would be identified at that age.  Remedial measures could be taken to prevent their continuing to labour under the considerable disadvantage of not having numeracy or literacy.</P>
    <P>When one makes this point one is frequently chided by teachers who say the objective of education is not solely to make people read and write.  It is to develop the full person.  By having tests such as these one could be putting an undue emphasis on the learning of these skills to the detriment of the broader purpose of education.  That would be a valid argument if, as was done in the case of the 11 plus in Britain, we were going to stream children on the basis of the results of the tests.  If such a system was introduced here it could distort primary education.  If the purpose is merely to identify children who need help and is a positive one none of the objections I have heard made in the teaching profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy a lot of lattitude but we are getting into educational policy matters and on Supplementary Estimates they are not in order.  All these matters will be in order and relevant on the Estimate proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put that forward for the Minister's consideration but he may not wish to reply to it.  I note also that there have been considerable savings in relation to training colleges.  A sum of £400,000 was saved in relation to the training of teachers and £100,000 saved in relation to loans and grants to students in training colleges.  I understand there was a suggestion in the Green Paper that there would be a policy of bringing about equivalence in the conditions of pupils in the training colleges and those in the universities, that training college pupils would no longer have the benefit of residential facilities and so on and generous grants which are not available to the universities.  Is this policy continuing and are these savings an indication of its implementation?  If this is the case we should be told so explicitly and if not we <Col N="1223" /> should have some other adequate explanation as to why savings of about £500,000 have been made in regard to training colleges on these two votes.</P>
      <P>Again there have been savings on subheads C.9 and C.10.  I presume these savings are explained in the first Supplementary Estimate because there are no such subheads in the original Book of Estimates that I have.  There must be some other explanation.  It is all the more odd that there should be a saving on subheads C.9 and C.10 which were only created in a supplementary estimate in June or July.  Only five months later we find that money deemed to be urgently necessary then and requiring extra time in this House to give it now cannot be spent and has to be handed back.  It is no mean saving; it is £225,000 and I think the Minister owes the House an explanation. What went wrong?  We should be told.</P>
      <P>The main increase in secondary education is in the provision for an incremental salary grant.  I should like an explanation of this.  Is it a grant in relation to increments, accelerating the incremental stage or making it more generous or is it an across-the-board increase in salaries?  If it were the latter I presume it would have come through subhead A.1 which deals with teachers' salaries.  Instead it comes under subhead B.  I should like to know how salaries are distributed as between subhead A.1 and subhead B.  Subhead B is in fact the greater one and so the incremental grant is the bigger grant amounting to £61 million and the capitation grant which includes teachers' salaries comes to only £5 million.  There seems to be a rather odd congruence of two means of paying teachers' salaries through two different subheads.  Possibly A.1 relates to secondary school salaries which are paid on a different basis to community school salaries.  It still does not seem to make sense seeing that subhead B is so much greater than subhead A.1.  I should like the Minister to explain the need for the extra £10 million.  Is it a result of the national understanding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not, as the Minister knows, and so I shall not detain the House on that point.  There has been a saving of £700,000 in relation to building grants towards capital costs of secondary, comprehensive and community schools.  There is a very urgent need for additional school buildings in Kells, Navan and Dunboyne, three locations with rapidly increasing population. In the case of Kells and Navan specific agreements on the building of these schools were made more than two years ago but the progress seems quite limited. It surprises me that, where the money is provided and there is such an urgent need&mdash;I mention only cases in my own constituency as illustrations because I am familiar with them but I am sure there is the same situation in many other places&mdash;for additional classrooms in community and comprehensive schools, there should be a saving of £700,000 on such schools.  One could also build a school with the amount being saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is innocent if he thinks that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One could go a good way towards building a community school with it.  I should like the Minister to explain how money could be saved when there is such urgent need for community schools.  I am certain that there are ways and means by which this money could have been spent if the Minister had the will to spend it.  There are certain points at which money can be paid to contractors and others involved in the building programme and if the Minister had the industry and energy to ensure that the various administrative steps had been taken he could have arranged to have that £700,000 allocated to some schools and not have the situation&mdash;which is surprising for a Minister for Education&mdash;when having fought to get the money in the first place he has abjectly to hand it back because he was unable to spend it.  It is more than surprising <Col N="1225" /> that such a saving could have been made in relation to such an important matter.</P>
      <P>There is a similar saving of £200,000 in relation to vocational education.  The total saving on secondary school buildings&mdash;taking secondary as a global description&mdash;is nearly £1 million of money apparently voted for this purpose and not spent.  We should have an explanation for this.  I note there was need for additional expenditure in relation to examinations on Votes 33 and 34.  Does this indicate that examinations have cost more than originally expected or was there not proper budgeting or did more pupils present themselves for examination than originally expected when the provision was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That explains that.  The last Estimate that we have to consider here is No. 35 relating to higher education. I know there has been no supplementary estimate for residential homes.  The amount of money provided for residential homes was never adequate. It was not adequate when I was responsible for the area and it is not adequate now.  I would like to see the Minister do everything he can to increase the amount of money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about something that is not in the Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not bring in a supplementary estimate on that one, above all.  I am out of order on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher education Estimate amounts to £7 million approximately. The only point I would like to make here is in relation to subhead A.3.  This is in relation to the building grants and capital costs for university colleges and <Col N="1226" /> designated institutions of higher education and I note there has been a saving. The Minister should give us an explanation as to how this saving occurred.  I presume it was because some particular project did not proceed as fast as it should and as a result the money did not have to be paid out.  I can understand that happening when dealing with very big projects as in higher education.  It is not easy to transfer such savings to somewhere else because there are not so many projects going on in higher education that one can easily find another project to which to allocate the saving on a project which did not proceed as fast as it should.</P>
    <P>But that excuse does not apply in secondary or vocational education because there is no end of building projects in these areas.  While I am not surprised that the Minister finds himself with a saving in relation to higher education&mdash;and I do not blame him because that is due to something he has no responsibility for&mdash;I do blame him for the fact that he has to hand back almost £1 million in relation to secondary school building.  That certainly warrants some explanation.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one last concluding point here.  It refers to subhead F1 which is the purchase of specimens for the National Museum.  The position at the moment is that in respect of many of the specimens they have to purchase the National Museum have to compete on the open market, the antique dealers market, for specimens which are of vital national interest and which may be irreplaceable and unique.  But because the National Museum is only one bidder at a market where these items might be sold, they have found themselves having to pay an antique dealer's price to prevent something which is of vital national interest going abroad.  Something should be done to strengthen the museum's position in this sort of situation.  I realise there are considerable difficulties in regard to incursions on the rights of private property which is enshrined in our Constitution and I would be the last to suggest that there should be any incursion <Col N="1227" /> into that.  I believe that in the case of export of precious historic objects from this country there should be some legislative means of preventing this occurrence or at least of licensing it because the fact that historic Irish objects are now capable of being freely exported means that effectively there is a world market price on these objects.  If that situation did not exist the museum would not need as large a grant for the purchase of specimens because they would not have to pay a world market price.</P>
    <P>There is legislation at the moment whereby the Minister may designate a particular object to be an object to which the Act applies.  I am not quite sure what the Act is but I think it is one of the national monuments Acts.  If the Minister so designates an object it may not be exported unless there is a licence but if the Minister does not so designate an object then it may be freely exported. To the best of my knowledge no Minister for Education has ever exercised the powers under the Act to designate any object to be one to which the Act applies. I must accept as much responsibility in this matter as anyone else in that I held tenure of the Department of Education for four years.  Unfortunately at the time I was not as conversant with the legislation in the matter as I am now because I had other responsibilities.  The result of that situation, if I am not mistaken, is that one is free to export objects at the moment if one has them in private ownership.  There is no customs control whatsoever and it is very difficult to prevent objects being exported where there is no customs control even with the legislation.</P>
    <P>I believe there would be a good case for having the legislation on the Statute Books requiring everybody who is exporting an object which is in a particular category, regardless of whether that object has been designated to be an object to which the Act applies, to be licensed. The consequences of that would be that although one might not have power at the airports or at the ports to <Col N="1228" /> prevent objects going out, it would be known in the international markets or wherever these articles might be up for open sale that they were being exported contrary to the law of the country of origin and were in that market on that basis.  Therefore reputable auctioneers would be less likely to carry in their sales rooms objects which were exported from their country of origin without a relevant licence having being granted.  That would close off one of the possible outlets for this sort of trade.  It would also leave it open to the Minister to negotiate reciprocal arrangements with other countries who could have legislation for similar control of exports.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department did indicate over a year ago in response to parliamentary questions I put to him that he was preparing legislation on this subject.  I would like to have some information from the Minister as to how this legislation has progressed and if in fact any drafting work has been done at all.  We should have that sort of legislation.  The present Taoiseach raised this very matter here in the House when he was in Opposition and expressed concern about the lack of legislation on this issue.  I answered questions on the subject and at that stage I initiated inquiries about legislation and had some preliminary work done, but it was of an unofficial rather than official character. No heads of Bills or anything like that were prepared.</P>
    <P>The present Minister of State gave a commitment at Question Time, I understand, to do something about this and I would like to know how matters are progressing since this undertaking was given.  I would not like to see the present situation continuing for any length of time.  We seem to be heading back into a period of high inflation and in a period of inflation people who cannot find their money safe in stocks and shares tend to invest it in antiques and <i>objects d'art</i> and give themselves a veneer of culture by so doing as well as hoping to make a capital gain.  This is likely to increase the demand for historic objects, from this part of the world and also to increase the <Col N="1229" /> necessity for an education of this sort.  I hope that the Minister in the period remaining to him in the office which he now holds will take a personal interest in the matter with a view to having legislation of this sort introduced at an early date to protect our national heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene to make one single point.  The Minister ought to consider amending the Act to extend the functions of the HEA along the lines which I suggested when I was in the Seanad when this Bill was going through in July 1971.  I believe the Minister himself was not in public life at that stage and he may not, therefore, remember the debates which took place in this and the other House at that time, but if ever there was an argument against having a second House of the Oireachtas that argument was richly provided by his predecessor and present colleague, Deputy Faulkner, who was then Minister for Education.  Deputy Faulkner arrived in the Seanad with this Higher Education Bill after the Dáil had risen, and quite clearly he had made up his mind that not a single amendment of any kind whatsoever was going to be accepted. He was dealing with a Seanad which included a lot of people&mdash;I hope that the House will not think me opinionated and conceited if I say this&mdash;who had something of a nonpolitical kind to say about higher education. Apart altogether from the six professedly university Senators who were there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard that convention quoted from the Chair by you, Sir, and other occupants of it.  With respect, I cannot see the reason for it and I suspect that in this, as in so much else, we are trotting after the English and that because some rule of privilege which goes back to the English civil war or thereabouts inhibits them from allowing proceedings in one House to be mentioned <Col N="1230" /> in the other, we have to copy them.  Of course, that is more than good enough for the Irish, according to the frame of mind which is far more prevalent in the party opposite than ever it was in my party, although we all suffer from it to some extent.  However, I do not want to quarrel with the Chair, but for the benefit of the Minister I tell the House that, although a very large number of amendments were put forward then&mdash;Deputy Horgan will remember this&mdash;not one line of that Bill was changed because the Minister did not want to have to wait until October to go back to the Dáil with those amendments. In other words, a Bill like this would have been a justification for having a second House even if there were no other justification.  Various members of the Opposition put down amendments.  Not one comma was changed in that Bill when it left that House from the way it was when the Bill came in.  I never saw an exercise in stonewalling more disspiriting than that which Deputy Faulkner then put up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but it is a particularly bad example because if ever the second House had before it a subject on which people might have something to say, that was the subject.  A Government might be forgiven for going to the Seanad without changing a line of a Bill about security, agriculture or industry, but to go through a House which contained a number of people who had put down amendments was a depressing experience. I am not thinking simply of myself.  I did put down amendments but most of them came from other people. There were no politics, good or bad, in this.  The magic words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo;, &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; or any others, were not mentioned in the debate from start to end, nor were any of their respective philosophies.  I put down an amendment which the Minister, if he is interested, will find at column 1379, Volume 70 of the Official Report of the Seanad, to the effect that the functions of <Col N="1231" /> the HEA outlined in the Bill which proposed to set it up should be extended by the addition of a further function, namely that of watching the job market, watching the economy generally to see what kind of demand existed for various forms of higher education and third level training.  The intention was to conduct no very pretentious campaign, but in some appropriate level or way to evolve a system of informing young people and their parents about what kind of profession was likely to leave them three or four years later in a seller's market and what kind of professional training was available.  About eight and a half years have rolled by since then and I can say without exaggeration that events have borne out the view that I put to the other House at that time.  The universities here have continued to turn out very large numbers of Arts graduates from faculties which do not apply a <i>numerus clausus</i> or anything corresponding to that and a substantial number of them&mdash;not a majority&mdash;either do not find employment at all or find it difficult to get employment.  The Minister himself will know that an Arts degree very often leads to the teaching profession but there are and have been for years a large number of disappointed graduates who cannot find proper employment in that profession.  They come to me in my little political clinic.  It is sad for a young woman or man at the beginning of life, having set out with high hopes and gone through a rigorous training course, to find himself or herself combing the country looking for a job and certainly not able to find one in this city or even the county where he or she would like to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there are technical skills of which this country is in extreme need and for which there are literally hundreds of vacancies, as presumably the Minister knows and he can satisfy himself about it by looking at the situations vacant columns in the daily papers. The people to fill these are simply not there.  Apart altogether from the fact that here are instances of well-paid employment with a potentially very fine career <Col N="1232" /> profile, social position and so on, is it not simply a tragedy that jobs are going abegging in a country where a lot of people are looking for jobs?  It is not simply that, but that feature is already a very strong inhibiting factor in our national economic growth.  I appreciate that it is not easy to relate a topic such as education to the economy and that there are dimensions about this which prevent us from comparing one factor with another but the CII have complained repeatedly that one of the factors which holds back the country, apart from such other factors as the transport and communications networks, the abominable telephone service, the deteriorating roads in the city and country, the wage instability and the instability of credit as well as other such large scale macrofactors, is the severe shortages of skills in certain sectors.  We know that the Minister cannot produce such skilled persons out of a hat but I urge him to refer back to what happened in the Seanad eight-and-a-half years ago and to ask himself, whether, though the month was July and the Dáil would not be meeting again until the following October, the Higher Education Authority would not have been better had they been given the additional function which I recommended at that time.  However, it is not too late yet to give them that extra function.</P>
    <P>I am not saying anything original when I say that we Irish suffer from attitudes to life which are the result of our conditioning down through generations. We have a set of responses which I suppose are normal in a population which, looking back to their grandfathers, think in terms of very poor, simple and non-pretentious people, people who would have been delighted that their grandchildren would be living in nice houses with central heating and enjoying three square meals a day without having to worry about where the meals for the next day were coming from.  Perhaps we have the weakness and the foibles of an emerging population in any country with a history similar to ours but one of our weaknesses is a pathetic attachment to <Col N="1233" /> the white-collar job.  Though I denounce this attachment I find the same emotion stirring within myself in regard to what the future of my children will be like. This notion is associated above all with the vision of the public service as a haven of security.  People who work with their hands usually hope that their children or at least their grandchildren will work, complete with collar and tie, in a heated office.  I am not denouncing that aspiration but it is a situation that is a drain and a handicap on the economy. It is a sad waste of human resources that our training and career guidance systems should be so defective that they tend to produce many people who are trained to work in jobs where they wear a collar and tie and never find it necessary to work up a sweat but who are not trained for the skills that are needed in the economy and for which the economy is prepared to pay richly.  It is not simply a matter of talking about jobs for navvies or for those fellows who add to our priceless collection of ripped up footpaths in this city which must be unique in the world in terms of the number of footpaths that are ripped up, sealed and criss-crossed with multiple diggings going back long before I was born.</P>

      <P>It is easy to treat a subject such as this with levity, but it is not my intention to do that.  I believe that the functions of the Higher Education Authority could be extended by way of a one section Bill.  In saying that I am not in any way criticising the Authority. Perhaps I might succeed in persuading Deputy Collins to bring in such a Bill by way of a Private Members' Bill, a Bill that would extend the function of the Authority to give them, to use that ghastly trendy expression, a monitoring function&mdash;it was far from monitors we were all reared&mdash;in regard to employment opportunities in the technological branches of the economy.</P>

      <P>I suppose that the economy and the expectations of the people are topics which are outside the scope of this debate but in an Irish newspaper I was reading only the other day of a talk that had been given by Senator Whitaker.  The Senator's message was that far from tax reliefs, from reliefs for the PAYE earner, from expansion in the public service, from life becoming easier for everybody, that if we wished to take up the burden of increased oil prices as we must and the payment for the enormous ballooning in imports, particularly in consumer imports, we will not be able to devote to our own ends the degree by which the wealth of the economy may grow in the next couple of years.  That is a sinister message which presumably has a <Col N="1236" /> significance for higher education as well as for everything else.  Yet, in that area, too, unrealistic expectations are being generated.</P>
      <P>Recently leaflets were distributed by students in UCD concerning the level of grants.  On a previous occasion when there was some kind of demonstration at Belfield I recall reading a banner held by some of the picketing students and which read, &ldquo;cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  The implication was that those students were the ones who were not cherished when we know that exactly the opposite is the position.  Though students experience a certain privation and shortage of money at this time of their lives, they should remember that when they qualify they will have their foot on the lowest rung of a ladder that will lead them into practically any discipline. A graduate of any discipline changes his social bracket by that act and that means his economic bracket also.  I do not mind which comes first.  Of course, it is possible that he may not make much of himself.  He may have character failings and weaknesses that will prevent him from realising his full potential but essentially he is now on a ladder from which he cannot be thrust off by anybody.  He is being given as much of a privilege as it is in the power of this State to confer.</P>
      <P>I have had the benefit of an education by the National University of Ireland and I accept that that conferred a privilege on me.  I am not in any sense trying to pretend that there are differences between us in this regard.  The idea that the State must pay not just for the maintenance of these very expensive institutions but also pay for the maintenance of students is one that would be more acceptable and understandable in a rich country.  It is premature to talk about that here.  This is a personal view; it is not necessarily the view of my party although I hope it would be their view.  I realise it is something of a nettle and we know the record of the party opposite with regard to grasping nettles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the end we will have to have some system of financing higher education by <Col N="1237" /> loans.  I know that there will be students who will not pay back, who will vanish abroad, or who will not be in a position financially to pay back the money.  Let it be so.  We will have to think about some method of financing higher education so that the people who principally benefit from it will have to carry the burden.  I know they cannot carry it while they are at college and that many parents cannot carry that burden.  I do not ask that they should.  I am not advocating any regulation that would have the effect of keeping people out of higher education who could benefit from it.  Quite the contrary. The nation owes it to itself and to those individuals to make sure that everyone gets the chance which his talents make appropriate for him.  At the same time, when afterwards he climbs on to the moving staircase that can only go upwards&mdash;unless the person becomes an alcoholic or has illness or misfortune&mdash;he should be required to repay the money to the State.  In other words, he should be required to carry retrospectively some of the burden which others have had to carry in order to put him in that position.  I am not a Marxist or anything like that&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I think it is quite wrong that a man who has had a poor start in life&mdash;perhaps his parents did not have enough gumption to save or to direct or guide him&mdash;and whose whole life will be in some deadend occupation should be asked to pay a brass farthing to maintain higher education. I know that higher education has other values.  I regard myself as a beneficiary of the proposition that it has values other than purely economic ones. That poor man should not be asked to pay a brass farthing towards the cost of placing each year thousands of young people in a position of privilege for the rest of their lives.  Without harshness or unreasonableness and without ideological bitterness they should be asked to contribute from their earnings in their later professional existence.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the other dimensions of the matter such as whether we should demand more from somebody who emigrates.  These are difficult questions and I do not want to be taken as <Col N="1238" /> making over-short work of them but the costs of higher education have become staggering.  This is particularly so in the technical faculties but even in what I call the &ldquo;chalk and blackboard&rdquo; faculties like my own in which the main expense apart from salaries is simply acquiring books&mdash;we do not have any other equipment&mdash;the cost has become so staggering that it is a bit much to ask the State to go on not merely paying for it but to enhance its aid in the sense of paying salaries if you please to students or full maintenance virtually irrespective of the parents' means or of the students' future means.  I know that many of them will not be able to make full recompense.  So far as I am concerned they are welcome and are entitled to the support of the State but those of them who end up as doctors&mdash;in the way that a grub over-night turns into a butterfly, these students suddenly sprout pin stripe suits and cufflinks&mdash;are prescribing pills and potions for a lot of money.  It is absolutely right that they should be asked within reason to contribute retrospectively something towards the cost of putting them into the position of which they are the principal beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I should like to sum up the two points I made.  First, in my opinion, the function of the Higher Education Authority should be extended to give them a certain national career guidance function. Secondly, the Minister should get his Department to work on some system of extended loans for financing higher education.  I bring my remarks to a close and wish the Department every success.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a d'fháiltigh roimh na Meastacháin Fhorlíontacha seo.  Dáiríre, i rith na díospóireachta, chuaigh na Teachtaí ar strae, ar seachrán anois is arís, agus bhí ar an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, nuair a bhí sé anseo, tarraingt ar an mbéal bhocht, mar a déarfá, chun iad a thabhairt ar ais go dtí bunábhair na Meastachán.

Cuireann sé áthas ormsa gur chuir an Rialtas an t-airgead sin ar fáil domsa, mar Aire Oideachais.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an caiteachas seo atá árduithe, á chaitheamh chun cuspóirí agus fheidhmeanna fiúntacha a chur i gcrích.</P>
      <P>I have a good many notes and I want to go as quickly as I can through the various points made by Deputies in the debate.  As I have said, in the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;second supplementaries in some cases and first in the case of Higher Education&mdash;the total sum involved is £45 million.  The total sum for the year is the highest ever spent on education in this country.  I mentioned this in my introductory speech and Deputies who spoke should pay attention to how this money was spent.  It is my contention that the expenditure is watched very carefully and that it is directed to worthwhile educational objectives. I have every right to be pleased and to recommend the Estimates to the House.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to actual buildings at third level.  I want to tell the House that the following projects have been completed or are being planned; the Agriculture Building, University College, Dublin; the Arts Building, Trinity College; the Arts and Commerce Block, University College, Galway; the Arts Building, Maynooth; the Library and Lecture Theatre, University College, Cork; the Engineering Building, University College, Dublin; phase 2 of the Library, University College, Dublin; Thomond College; National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin; second phase of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick; and the Cork Dental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise particularly that major extensions to seven regional technical colleges are included in the development at third level.  There are major extensions also to three primary teacher training colleges.  I submit that is <Col N="1240" /> a substantial capital development and one which has as its objective the provision of places at third level for the various types of students.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly mentioned the feasibility of a system of loans.  I will come back to that later.  Obviously the Higher Education Authority are not hide-bound by the terms of the Act to which Deputy Kelly referred and make studies which are germane to the whole purpose of an tÚdarás.  They have done a study on the feasibility of a system of loans.  I have just received a copy of the study and I do not propose to take any action as of now until I see the full implications of a loans system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins referred to transport and the suggested charge of £21 per annum for school transport.  As the House knows, the Hyland Report to which Deputy Collins referred was commissioned by my penultimate predecessor in the Department of Education. I made a categorical statement on that report.  I got the impression that Deputy Collins hoped I would not be in a position to make that categorical statement. My impression may have been wrong, but his approach to it suggested to me that he was rather disappointed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins also referred to a change in policy with regard to the provision of transport for children whose parents are of the minority religions.  I assured the Deputy at the time that that was not so.  This also came up in the House when we were debating the NCEA Bill&mdash;Deputy Collins is not happy with the funding of the RTCs by the vocational education committees.  He indicated that he had a preference for the total funding coming from the Higher Education Authority, in other words, that the HEA would, so to speak, invade the territory of the vocational education committees so far as the RTCs are concerned, and fund the regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> I notice a certain ambivalence on the part of many people with regard to this type of question.  On the one hand we are supposed to favour devolution with maximum responsibility to be exercised at local level.  On the other hand, we have this centralising tendency.  That is what the suggestion by Deputy Collins means: a departure from a devolutionary system of financing and a return to central financing for RTCs.  We always claimed that the regional technical colleges were established in certain areas and that they were expected to absorb the industrial and commercial flavour of the area and to cater for it.  That very objective alone would indicate that the funding should be from the local committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also referred to and condemned the rise in fees in the regional technical colleges.  I contend that for the quality of the education provided in the RTCs, the fees are more than reasonable.  The increase was in no way the kind of hardship Deputy Collins pretended it was.  He also referred, as did Deputy Horgan later on, to the amount of money being allocated to Maynooth College.  Both Deputies referred to recent problems there with regard to the dismissal of two members of the staff.  The particular business we have with the college in this Supplementary Estimate is to approve a certain sum of money. Deputy Horgan said he had no intention of opposing it.  As the House knows, university legislation is being prepared, and the whole status and problem of Maynooth will be settled in the context of the legislation which we are preparing for all the universities, the existing university colleges and future independent universities.  We prepared the way for this legislation in the referendum last summer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned the funding of a fishery science course at University College, Galway.  I know there is a place for research and a very lively interest in fishery science.  The Department of Fisheries and Forestry are interested in it.  I do not know whether that Department have made any decision about any <Col N="1242" /> funding or any possible funding of the course.  I know that there is a precedent in that the Department of Agriculture fund certain departments in University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins claimed that the HEA pronounced against a rise in fees and said that the rise was not compensated for by grants.  First of all, before the rise in fees the official document from the HEA in the Department of Education dealing with this matter was in agreement with the rise in fees.  I should like to rebut Deputy Collins's suggestion about the rise not being compensated for by grants.  Deputy Collins did not seem to know that the fee element in the aid given is separate from the maintenance grant and is automatically paid.  I want to put it on record that since I took up office the maximum grant for students has been increased 100 per cent at maximum level and that the eligibility limit moved from £2,950 to £6,100 in that period.  I know there is a point of view such as Deputy Kelly expressed, and, significantly, he did turn his back on Deputy Horgan when he was preparing to make that statement&mdash;I do not know how deep the symbolism went&mdash;but as far as both grant and eligibility limit are concerned an effort has been made by the present Government.  If I may quote the President of the USI, he said that the real damage was done between 1973 and 1977 when no effort was made to keep in touch with rising inflation.</P>
    <P>I referred to the hazards of international comparisons.  In doing so I was not indicating that the statistics were invalid. However, I think Deputy Horgan put his finger on the area I was hinting at.  A graduate from a university in the Netherlands or in Germany will have spent about seven years in university. There are complaints about this on the Continent.  While Johann Schmidt might start in 1980 he would graduate in 1987, and Seán Mac Gabhann, who would start here at the same time, could graduate in 1983 or 1984, depending on which degree he took.  Many of our arts degrees take three years and many of our science degrees take three or four years.  Even <Col N="1243" /> the longest course, the medical course, is somewhat shorter than the normal degree period in many continental countries. That is one area in which it is difficult to make a scientific comparison. Another obvious one is that many of our students go into the universities at 17 years of age, which is far too young, and are coming out at 20.  Many of them are not caught by the statistics.  They are regarded as being not at university but in the pre-university system because of their ages.</P>

      <P>I am simply saying that we have many students going into universities at 17 and coming out at 20 or 21, whereas in many countries it is not unusual to start university at 20.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins referred to grants in the non-university sector.  He told the House that only 4 per cent of the non-university sector had grants.  This may be true, but what he did not tell the House was the number of scholarships available and the number of EEC grants available in, for example, the regional technical colleges.  They are of the same value as the grants and administered in the same way and they have been increased to the extent that in some areas vocational committees have had this year's scholarships for the regional technical colleges for all the people who were looking for them.  I am glad to say that the demand for places in the regional technical colleges is increasing.</P>
      <P>I was puzzled by the reference to secondary schools whose pupil numbers are falling.  Deputy Collins made a plea for them, but I should like him to let me know where exactly these secondary schools are.</P>

      <P>Because of the remarks made by Deputy Collins on Vote 31, I want to assure the House that we are committed to the proper heating of schools and to the provision of aid for the purchase of books to the maximum extent possible. As the House knows, there is provision in these Supplementary Estimates for an increase in that area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan started by referring to the position of Maynooth.  I have already commented on the matter.  Although one would find it difficult to get total agreement on the definition of &ldquo;academic freedom&rdquo;, I agree with him that it should be maintained and sustained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan referred to the White Paper and he also referred to university legislation.  The preliminary work on the White Paper has been done.  It only remains for the Government to examine it minutely.  We hope to have it ready for publication at an early date.</P>

      <P>Deputy Horgan referred to Wood Quay and welcomed the extra £75,000 available for work there.  I am particularly proud that since I came to office Father Martin came to me and asked me for an increase in the amount of money available for excavations.  I did not have any trouble in getting a substantial sum of money from the Minister for Finance for that purpose.  In 1978 a very large sum was made available for excavations on that site.  Deputy Horgan referred to the fact that money was being paid out as expenses rather than wages to archaeological assistants on the site. That is true and, as far as I know, that <Col N="1245" /> was done at the request of the people concerned because they felt they had more freedom.  They were agricultural undergraduates and graduates and they felt that system suited them better.</P>
      <P>On Vote 31 Deputy Horgan welcomed the extra money, £500,000, being made available in the Estimate for the heating of national schools.  I should like to make it clear that that sum was for the heating of schools in the period up to 31 December 1979, the period covered by the Estimate.  Deputy Horgan also referred to the cost of school books and welcomed the increase in the grant for them.  With regard to Vote 32, Deputy Horgan wanted to know if the money under subhead A.1 was for oil.  There is confusion about this matter.  Subhead A.1 provides for the capitation grant, including teachers' salaries grant.  The Deputy did not see how one could distinguish between subhead A.1 and subhead B, incremental salary grant.  That is an historical matter. Subhead A.1 is a capitation grant paid to the schools and when this Estimate was initiated in the twenties the capitation grant was paid to the schools and had an element in it&mdash;I remember from my innocent trade union days arguing to establish that&mdash;for the payment of school salaries of secondary teachers.  There is still a school salary which is paid by the schools and an incremental salary which is paid by the State.  The reference in subhead A.1 is to the school salary rather than the incremental one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan raised some points about community schools.  Parliamentary questions will be coming up which will help to clear the Deputy's mind of any doubts about how excellently I have handled the whole business of the community schools.  The Deputy will have an opportunity of congratulating me again during Question Time.  I am sure the Deputy is as pleased as I am that we made such progress in this very difficult field.  Deputy Horgan mentioned the problem of children who live far away from a school but are not in sufficient numbers to warrant a bus service to school.  I accept that that is a problem <Col N="1246" /> but I do not think it is possible to work out a system that will obviate hardship <i>in toto.</i>  The school transport scheme is a very expensive one and it is the intention of my Department to administer it with as much humanity as possible, making as many allowances as possible and bending the rules if necessary here and there.  No matter how elaborate we devise a system it will not cover every possible eventuality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan welcomed the £500,000 for the primary education system and referred to the boards of management and the problems.  I agree that boards of management without teachers are missing an important element which can contribute a great deal.  I can assure the Deputy that it will be my earnest endeavour to get the boards of management put together to the satisfaction of all participating groups as soon as possible.  I do not agree with the Deputy when he stated that our post primary or secondary system is split in four ways.  I would prefer to look at it as one system with variety.  There is nothing wrong with variety in education and I do not think the effectiveness of the educational process is in any way impaired by the fact that there are community, comprehensive, vocational and secondary schools.  It is my contention that the system is enriched by that.  With regard to the future of vocational schools, I should like to assure the House that I see a very good future for them.  There will be considerable development of vocational schools. Deputy John Ryan is on record as thanking me for the fine vocational education provision we are making in Thurles town.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan spoke about the current account going into the red on that account.  As the Deputy is aware the HEA assess the needs of the various designated institutions and if there is a deficit it is noted.  On a current account in a large transaction such as that, I do not think one could expect to have spot on budgeting year by year, particularly when we are dealing with the financial year from January to December and the <Col N="1247" /> academic year is from October to June. The Deputy also referred to the concept of academic freedom and my views on that are on record.  Deputy Griffin displayed an interest in numismatics which does him credit.  The &ldquo;Gunmoney Crown&rdquo; acted as the basis of his entire contribution.  He spent a good deal of time talking about it and its proper presentation.  Had he listened to my introductory speech he would have known that it is covered in gold, and that it did not tarnish.  He indicated that if this coin was not properly housed it might rust.  I do not think gold rusts.  I am sure he will sleep soundly tonight when he knows that &ldquo;Gunmoney Crown&rdquo; hopefully will be well housed and will not suffer the fate he feared for it.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to the House already&mdash;and do not need to repeat&mdash;what Deputy Griffin said with regard to Wood Quay.  I pointed out that Fr. Martin came into me in 1977, that I provided him with more money in 1977 and in 1978, gave him a substantial sum of money for excavation at Wood Quay, and we are coming into the House this evening to provide more money still.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan dealt with the problem which seems to be surfacing everywhere, that is, the one of the shortage of skilled personnel for industry.  I would not like people to get alarmist about it; it seems to me that everybody is up talking about that.  I know that we are today developing our industrial arm.  I know there are great opportunities.  The fact that there are opportunities will direct the interest and gaze of parents and students to the necessary disciplines.  I made certificate presentations at a competition sponsored by a computer company, at which one of the people involved in the computer business said that he would prefer a liberal arts base on which to impose the technical training in computer science.  It was an interesting kind of idea. Therefore, there is not necessarily the mutual exclusivity Deputy Ryan fears between the ordinary academic type subjects and the more scientific ones.  It is true that in the past, as Deputy Kelly <Col N="1248" /> also remarked, there was an overemphasis on the white collar type job. Frankly, I do not think that there is such a big danger in that regard nowadays.</P>
    <P>My philosophy on this is that what was wrong was more the philosophy which indicated that a certain type of education stereotyped the student for a certain type of job, that that is where the fault lay rather than in the type of education given.  I remember going to an AnCO training centre in Ballyfermot and being very pleased to find somebody there undergoing one of the skilled tradesmen courses who had just graduated in arts from one of our universities. Someone might think that this was a great waste of time but it gave me hope that this stereotyping of people through the subjects they took might be dying.  In that regard we could look at the United States where they do not allow that kind of thing to occur; in fact there the Ph.D may be cleaning windows the following day in a practical way if he finds he has no particular job to do in his own field. We could throw off some of our thought shackles in this regard, and it would be a great help.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan talked of a shortage of places in third-level schools. I think I have indicated the efforts being made by way of capital expenditure in the universities, the teacher training colleges but, above all, in the regional technical colleges, and I have indicated to the House that there have been extensions to several.</P>
      <P>I want to let Deputy Bruton know about some of the savings about which he waxed so indignant.  For example he referred to the £400,000, I think it was. If I could find my note on this, that £400,000 was actually transferred to something else and subsequently spent.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education grant.  All the capital moneys for the Higher Education Authority were spent. Reversing the role of Cassandra who always prophesied the truth and was never believed, I was afraid Deputy Bruton would be believed although he did not have the truth.  The saving on the building was spent on equipment, and that is clear from the Supplementary Estimate; the £400,000 was transferred from building to equipment; that is the point I am making.  The saving shown is £490,200, the extra £90,200 is bank interest which was handed back by the Higher Education Authority.</P>

    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke also about the clerical assistants and why the saving.  I am glad to tell the House that this was a new scheme initiated by me.  No clerical assistants had been available to any secondary school hitherto.  The House will understand that in getting a new scheme going there would be problems, that the whole system would not run smoothly from the beginning.  But I am very proud to tell the House that 340 have been appointed already and we intend to fill out the full complement.  I should like to tell Deputy Bruton also that as far as the caretakers are concerned, 190 have been appointed.  It is interesting for the House to know that the whole climate of employment is now much better, that there are not so many people around looking for these jobs as there used to be.  For that reason we are somewhat slower in the actual appointments than we had hoped.  But I am satisfied that in initiating the scheme, in employing the clerical assistants and the caretakers, and in setting a scheme under <Col N="1250" /> way, I deserve the support of this House.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Bruton came under the strict eye of the Chair in regard to part of his speech on Primary Education, his emphasis on the achievement of a degree of numeracy and literacy.  I agree with him but I will also yield to the Chair because we may have another opportunity to talk about that.</P>
      <P>There were some savings in the capital expenditure on the training colleges referred to by Deputy Bruton.  As the Deputy knows very well&mdash;I know he has a strong interest in farming&mdash;it was a very bad year for construction work. Any saving there was due simply to the inability of builders to continue their work during the very severe weather.  I think Deputy Bruton referred to that matter under Secondary Education. Does he understand now the point I made to Deputy Horgan about subheads A.1 and B?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two factors I should like to mention in regard to Deputy Bruton's point about expenditure under subhead H.2&mdash;all our builders were retarded during the spring by bad weather.  I should like to point out also&mdash;and it was in this connection that I made an interjection when Deputy Bruton was talking about £700,000 almost building a school&mdash;in the construction industry itself there has been considerable overheating.  A great deal of building is going on and tender prices for <Col N="1251" /> schools consequently resulted in being considerably in excess of the cost limits. We had to get going on bills of reduction, which I am sure the Deputy will agree is part of my function.</P>

      <P>We were not able to cater for the full demands.  I explained to Deputy Bruton, while he was speaking, about more money for examinations. This extra money was paid to examiners for examining the scripts and in travel and maintenance allowances.  I already pointed out to the House that Deputy Bruton is wrong when he says that there is not much building going on at third level.  I have already outlined the building that is going on.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that it is substantial and praiseworthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point, which was not relevant, about the export of <i>objets d'art.</i>  I will consult with my Minister of State on the promise which Deputy Bruton said he made in the <Col N="1252" /> House about legislation.  We also initiated a praiseworthy scheme of providing child care assistance during the year.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that the full 70 will be employed by the end of this month.  They do very good work in the handicapped schools and they were welcomed with open arms by the schools.  Not merely will the 70 we originally envisaged be appointed by the end of this month but ten additional assistants are being allocated and will eventually be appointed.</P>
      <P>I want, in reference to what Deputy Ryan was talking about, to refer to the quite substantial sum of money that was provided by me to initiate courses which resulted from the study of the Manpower Consultative Committee.  A sum of £1,725,000 was provided by the Department of Education to finance courses in various third-level institutions&mdash;the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick, university colleges and RTCs&mdash;to equip people for the skilled jobs which are available, as various Deputies have said and as the House is fully aware.</P>
      <P>I felt that Deputy Kelly was doing a little filling in an amusing way.  He spoke about his attempt to amend the Bill setting up An tUdarás um Ard Oideachas Bill and his failure, which he seemed to regret.  I pointed out in another connection that the Higher Education Authority are not inhibited from making studies along the lines Deputy Kelly referred to.  He said he wanted to watch the scene, so to speak, and to be able to inform parents the type of education and the courses in education which would put them in a seller's market, as he put it.  This is being done increasingly not merely by the Higher Education Authority but by the NCEA and by individual guidance teachers in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly went on to say that it was time to call a halt to a rise in the expenditure on third-level education.  I am not so sure that Deputy Kelly, as he said would find many in agreement on this.  It was significant that he turned his back on Deputy Horgan and then started on <Col N="1253" /> this particular line.  In fairness to him, he says what he thinks; but he created a kind of euphoric picture of the graduate with his foot on the social and economic ladder climbing steadily upwards, doling out medicines, nostrums, pills and so on to various people and being well paid for it.  He felt that the graduate should pay for this privilege.  He came down heavily on the side of loans rather than grants.  I have already told the House that the Higher Education Authority have made a study of the possibility of loans.  I am not making any statement about my view on it at the moment but I believe it will be necessary to continue the system of grants for those who cannot afford third-level education.</P>
    <P>I maintain that very often those who are from either large families, reasonably well off, or from families who are not well off should not be excluded from third level education because they have not got the money to pay.  If on top of the economic worries that will be on them because of the lack of ability on the part of their parents to pay they have this idea of a loan hanging over them, it would not be very good for them psychologically while they are at their third level studies.  In that area, whatever about a wider use of loans, I maintain that grants are necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said this side of the ill were not very good at grasping at nettles.  He said we would have to grasp a nettle.  He quoted Senator Whitaker as saying we were living above our means.  I know also that a study made sometime ago on the whole educational system by an American said we would not be able to cope with the rising costs in our educational system.  I will stick with the agrarian metaphor and say that I have a hard furrow to hoe, never mind the grasping of nettles, but that it is the intention of the Government to hoe that furrow and maintain the initiative in education, which has always been the proud boast of the party which forms the Government.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the House the Supplementary Estimates.  I thank those who contributed to the debate.  I am sure that <Col N="1254" /> many Deputies privately are amazed that the Government have been so good at providing money for education since they took office.  I know that the Jeremiahs said it could not be done.  I know that we have international experts and economists who say that we shall not be able to maintain our position. However, in recommending to this House Supplementary Estimates to a total value of £45 million, the Government are determined to maintain progress in education and to sustain people as long as possible in the system by aiding them with grants and special finances.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> This amount is required to meet additional expenditure which will arise on subheads A1, B1, C1, C4, D1, E, F and I of the Fisheries Vote.</P>
    <P>As regards subheads A1, (Salaries, Wages and Allowances), D1 (An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;Administration and Current Development), E (Inland Fisheries Development), F (Inland Fisheries Trust Incorporated), the aggregate additional amount now required, that is, £257,000, constitutes the bulk of the Supplementary Estimate and is due entirely to salary and wage increases which were not provided for in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead B1&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;is £70,000.  The original provision was £160,000.  Increases granted to the rates of travelling and subsistence, plus an increase in the volume of travelling to Europe in connection with Fisheries matters, make it necessary to provide the additional sum.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead C1&mdash;Sea Fisheries Development&mdash;is £20,000. The original provision was £125,000. The additional expenditure arises on boat hire in connection with a survey on herring stocks in the Celtic Sea.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead C4&mdash;Fishery Harbour Centres Fund&mdash;Grants under Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1908&mdash;is £28,000.  The original provision was £5,000.  Due to a shortfall in the anticipated harbour dues, it is necessary to make increased grants to the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead I&mdash;Expenditure in connection with Acquisition of Fisheries&mdash;is £3,000.  The original provision of £50,000 was to enable the Department to purchase the Weir Lodge adjoining the Galway Fishery already acquired, but the cost including legal expenses, amounted to £53,000.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead J&mdash;Apporpriations in Aid&mdash;is £64,080.  The original estimate of receipts was £46,920.  It now transpires that between increased income from the Galway <Col N="1256" /> Fishery, recoupment from the EEC of grants to producer organisations, and increases in fines and forfeitures, the receipts for this year will exceed the estimate by about £64,000.</P>
    <P>The net total of the foregoing provisions is £313,920.  It is anticipated, however, that savings on other subheads will more than offset the total excesses, but as two of these excesses occur on Grant-in-Aid subheads (D1 and F), it is necessary to seek approval for a Supplementary Estimate of a token £10, and I accordingly recommend this to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The motion in respect of Forestry is:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,488,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st December 1979 for salaries and expenses in connection with Forestry. </P>
    <P>This amount is required to meet additional expenditure which will arise on subheads A1, B1, B3, C2, C3, F and I of the Forestry Vote.</P>
    <P>As regards subheads A1 (Salaries, Wages and Allowances), C2 (Forest Development and Management), C3 (Sawmilling) and F (John F. Kennedy Park), the aggregate additional amount now required viz. £1,525,000, constitutes the bulk of the Supplementary Estimate and is due entirely to salary and wage increases conceded since the original Estimate was formulated.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead B1&mdash;Travelling Incidental Expenses&mdash;is £172,000.  The original provision was £1,115,000 but an increase in travelling and subsistence rates, effective from 1 January 1979, will result in an additional expenditure of £172,000.</P>
    <P>The provision for subhead B3&mdash;Office Machinery and other Office Supplies&mdash;is £26,000.  The original provision was £67,000.  The additional £26,000 now required arises from the purchase of office equipment following the transfer of part of the Forest and Wildlife Service to badly needed new premises during the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> The provision for subhead I&mdash;Agency Advisory and Special Services&mdash;is £10,000.  The additional sum is required in connection with activities of the Wildlife Advisory Council which were not provided for in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>The gross total of the foregoing provisions is £1,733,000.  It is anticipated, however, that savings amounting to £245,000 can be achieved on the following subheads: A2&mdash;Consultancy Services&mdash;£20,000; D&mdash;Grants for Afforestation Purposes&mdash;£15,000; G&mdash; Game Development and Management &mdash;£210,000.</P>
    <P>This leave a net total of £1,488,000 to be provided and I am accordingly recommending to the Dáil a Supplementary Estimate of that amount.</P>

      <P>In relation to this Estimate, I wish to deal specifically with what we call offshore fishing.  Yesterday, we dealt at length with what is called in-shore fishermen.  I have a few queries on this Supplementary Estimate to put to the Minister.  When dealing with subhead C1&mdash;Sea Fisheries&mdash;is the Minister dealing with the agriculture side of sea fisheries, or where does this extra amount of £20,000 come in?  We dealt yesterday, at length, with the agriculture side of it.  I suggested that a lot more development and expertise should be devoted to this side of what we call sea fisheries.  Also, under this heading there is the tourist end of fisheries, whereby we encourage quite a few tourists to this country to fish for shark, tope and other sea fish.  We are not doing enough to promote the angling side of our deep sea fishing.  When we were discussing the Fisheries Bill yesterday the Minister gave a commitment that he would deal with all sections of that Bill and I hope that the Minister will be in a position next week to honour that commitment. The political climate at the moment is such that I am fearful that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry may be promoted and may not be fishing with such a long line next week.</P>

      <P>The Minister's commitment is very important to the House and to the interests of the fishermen concerned. A lot of work has been done by BIM particularly in relation to promoting the eating of more fish.  They have fish demonstrators who do a lot of work in educating housewives about the proper manner of cooking fish.  It is amazing that in this island country we do not eat more fish.  There is no reason why we cannot catch fish and have it cooked within 24 hours.  This type of work by BIM should be expanded. For instance, we do not have enough sea food restaurants.  In the south of France and in Spain fish are displayed on slabs and a person can choose the fish he wishes to eat that evening.  A lot more can be done in this line here and perhaps we could promote Irish fish abroad as we promote Kerrygold butter. A lot of the money that we can give to BIM should be devoted to educating more people in relation to this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday we were dealing with in-shore fishermen but this evening I would like to deal with the trawlermen fishing for mackerel and herring off our shores. We need a Bill to deal with the offshore fishermen.  Smaller trawlermen are apprehensive because the larger boats have the equipment to catch a lot more fish. The ultimate thing is to reach agreement with the fishermen whereby different zones can be set up for the different sized boats.  At the moment there is no Irish or EEC policy in relation to offshore fishermen. We need a proper EEC fishery plan which will lay down proper limits for fishermen.  When the Minister came into office one of the first things he agreed with the EEC was that Irish fishermen fishing for herring would have no exclusive limit.  When discussing this again in the EEC we must insist on some type of an exclusive zone for our fishermen, then the Minister for Fisheries and <Col N="1259" /> Forestry must decide on some type of zoning area for the different classes of fishermen.  I know that the Minister told the fishermen that he would welcome any suggestions from them but it is not feasible to expect the fishermen to draft their own limits.  The Minister should introduce a Bill dealing with the offshore fishermen as it is badly needed at present. We need a proper national plan to direct the fishermen into the various waters.</P>
    <P>Cynics may say that there is no way in which we can get the agreement of the fishermen.  However, there are ways.  At present the FEOGA grant is only paid for a boat under 105 feet in length but it should be paid for all types of boats. After all, the FEOGA grant is paid by the EEC.  If the fishermen buys a boat which is 120 feet long he is not entitled to a FEOGA grant at present and this is completely wrong.  The bigger the boat the more capital the fisherman must pay. All boats, regardless of size, should be entitled to a FEOGA grant.  If that were agreed the Minister could introduce a plan whereby the larger boats would only get the grant if they fished in the outer waters.  One of our greatest failings at present is that we do not go after certain species of fish, such as hake, because the bigger trawlers stay closer to the shore.  We should get a proper EEC policy, then we should get a national policy whereby the larger fishermen would be entitled to the FEOGA grant as well as the smaller fishermen, with the intention of pushing the larger boats out further to catch the fish that are available in outer waters.  In days gone by it was very easy to fish within a few miles of our shores.  Now we have EEC boats fishing in our waters and we are not taking them on shoulder to shoulder. We should be encouraging skippers to buy larger boats but we cannot do that unless we give them the proper FEOGA grants.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the in-shore fishery Bill yesterday and came to the section dealing with jurisdiction, we agreed that the jurisdiction we were talking <Col N="1260" /> about was a 12-mile limit.  Even though we failed to get an exclusive 50-mile zone, in my view we have a case to take to the European Court and can insist that yesterday's Bill gives us jurisdiction over a 12-mile limit.  The least we should be looking for is a proper exclusive zone for our own fishermen.</P>
    <P>Recently our herring fishermen off the south-east coast had a very crucial time. They cannot fish even off their headlands or 100 or 200 yards out to sea, because the Celtic Sea has been completely banned in regard to herring fishing.  At the same time we allow EEC boats to fish for mackerel in the Celtic Sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The 5 per cent by-catch of the EEC boats is almost the equivalent in tons to what the south-east fishermen were catching.  The Minister said the by-catch is going.  Would he explain how this will come about?  If the EEC fishermen are allowed fish for mackerel, how will he ensure that they do not catch herring in their trawl as well?  If the by-catch is done away with and we do not allow EEC fishermen to fish in the Celtic Sea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but the Minister said the by-catch was going.  If the by-catch goes it will not be realistic to expect <Col N="1261" /> boats to fish for mackerel only.  If they catch herring what will they do with it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals specifically with scientific development in the Celtic Sea. That is the point I will come to shortly.  If boats fish for mackerel there is no way they will not catch some herring.  The Minister must know if boats catch mackerel they will also catch herring. What happens to any trawler, EEC or otherwise, that catches herrings with the mackerel?  Will they be automatically fined?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>If a fisherman comes on a shoal of mackerel, catches 95 per cent, and among the mackerel are herring, does the skipper have to throw the herring back into the sea?  If he does not, will he be prosecuted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is in the interests of the Irish Fishermen's Organisations; they asked me to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will work. We all agree the by-catch for EEC fishermen should be done away with.  We would like it if the EEC fishermen were allowed fish only outside our exclusive limits instead of raping our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead C.1 the Minister said <Col N="1262" /> that additional expenditure arises on boat hire in connection with a survey on herring stocks in the Celtic Sea.  I would appreciate it if he would tell us how did our technical people survey the number of herring?  I take it this is what the provision of £20,000 was for.  The original provision was for £125,000 and the total provision is now £145,000.  Are we providing £145,000 for a survey on herring?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister might tell us how this survey is being performed and what technical knowledge we have which enables us to tell the estimated number of herring in the Celtic Sea.  My information is that we do not have the technical know-how to carry out this survey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £313,000 has not been spent on the construction of exploratory vessels.  What exactly does &ldquo;construction on exploratory vessels&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean our technical people have not carried out the proper surveys for which the money was allocated or does it mean that some of this money should have <Col N="1263" /> been spent on the boatyards that have recently been handed over to private enterprise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is that this is a new fishery research vessel that no money has been paid for so far but which he intends will be on the high seas next year and that it will have the best technical people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>We are an island country. It distresses me very much, particularly in Donegal, that in the last year we saw the handing over of three boatyards Killybegs, Dingle and Baltimore to private enterprise.  I do not object to this as long as the Minister can give a guarantee that the work force in these will be increased.  Recently another boatyard which was handed over in the early seventies to private enterprise closed down.  I refer to the boatyard in Meevagh in Downings.  If there is no control on boatyards being handed into private enterprise they could also close in the future.  In Meevagh at present £4 million has been invested and it employs about 40 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this island country which deals so much with fishing there is no reason why we cannot make our own fishing boats as well and as cheaply as some of the boats being bought from Holland.  The standard answer is that we must import steel hulls from places like Holland and Norway.  As far as I am concerned this is absolutely ridiculous.  The Minister said we have the best technical people in the world and he must also appreciate that we have the best work force.  There is no reason why we cannot manufacture these steel hulls.  The problem that has arisen is a simple one but the answer is not so simple.  The reason these boatyards are being handed over to private enterprise is that BIM did not diversify quickly enough in steel hulls. <Col N="1264" /> Anybody in the fishing industry knew five or six years ago that the future of the boatyard industry was in steel hulls.  It is a terrible shame for the Department of Fisheries that we did not diversify and are not making our own boats.</P>
    <P>The Minister would say private enterprise will do this job.  I suggest they have not the finance at present to enable them to do so.  I am very disappointed that one yard has closed and that there is a big question mark about the other three.  My one hope is that these boats will see the light and if possible diversify and try to manufacture steel hulls.</P>
    <P>In Norway the major industry is probably fishing.  There is no reason why we cannot develop our fishing industry a lot more than we are at present.  A few years ago I said that the fishing industry in Ireland was only in its infancy.  At present it is still in its infancy.  We must develop and get more processing plants going.  There is no point in us exporting our fish on the bone the same as we do cattle on the hoof when we can process a lot of fish here.  We must have better grants to encourage the industry to develop this sector.  The main profit as far as fish is concerned is to be able to fillet it, freeze it, pack it and get it to the fish markets and supermarkets.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider getting more EEC grants for the fishing industry. I realise that I am being brief on this important subject but the reason is that we dealt at length yesterday with half of the fishing industry.  Perhaps the Minister will listen to the ideas I have on the other half of the industry.  We have tremendous possibilities as far as fishing is concerned.  We need a dedicated Department and Minister of Fisheries to see that fishing, as in Norway, is developed into one of our major industries. I welcome any money spent on this industry as long as it is not thrown away.  I should like to see more money spent on scientists, development teams, on the promotion of fish and on grants given for bigger boats.</P>
    <P>As far as repayments are concerned, if people cannot meet them every month, <Col N="1265" /> particularly those off the south east coast and in the Celtic Sea area, a lenient hand could be given to them.  It is through no fault of fishermen that stringent regulations have been brought in.  BIM should be lenient with them.  I should like to see more boats being built locally.  We spend £ millions buying boats from France and Holland each year.  A lot of thought must be given to the processing of fish here.  We should only send away the end product.  Up to recently we did not take our fishing industry seriously enough.  We have now some of the best skippers anywhere in the EEC.  The more successful they are the more good young successful skippers we will be able to encourage into the industry.</P>
    <P>As regards forestry we need a national plan.  I do not mean a plan in theory but one of action.  I have dealt with fisheries as it is probably the industry that has the best success of all our industries. However, having said that, our forestry industry is the most neglected industry at present.  I mentioned the millions of pounds we are spending building boats but when one thinks of the millions spent on importing timber it is absolutely disastrous.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a long-term plan from planting to cutting down.  When one thinks of the Munster Chipboard Factory which has closed down and of Scariff which is not 100 per cent healthy it gives great cause for concern.  Perhaps we are not doing enough to encourage the people to use our native raw material.  When one considers that £15,000 has not been used in 1979&mdash;I do not know why and perhaps the Minister can tell us&mdash;we must not encourage the people enough.  We have not convinced them that they should be planting different types of trees whether in their own small gardens, farms or on mountain farms where nothing is growing at present.  It is distressing that £15,000 has not been spent as far as planting policy is concerned.  I welcomed the initiative whereby grants were given to smallholders in different areas of the country to enable them to plant trees.  I <Col N="1266" /> welcome this but I am very distressed when I find £15,000 not being used by the Department of Forestry.</P>
    <P>While travelling through the country we all know&mdash;probably rural Deputies better than anyone&mdash;particularly in sparsely populated areas the extent of waste land.  Some scientist recently stated that probably one quarter of the land along the western seaboard is wasted land, being put to no use.  The Land Commission have tried to take over some of this land so that small farmers could increase their holdings and their incomes but there is so much of it&mdash;mountain land and land unfit for agriculture&mdash;that certainly the Department of Forestry should be investing money in it on this long-term plan I am talking about.  There is no point in saying, as the Minister will probably say, that the Department are doing this.  It is doing it in such a small way that really nothing is being done to plant any of the now useless land that could be useful land in the future.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the Minister to introduce a national plan by which money would be made available to buy the proper amount of land so that perhaps in ten years' time those who will be in this House will be able to see progress regarding the waste land of Ireland.  It is a national crime that this land has not been properly developed.  We can all see it.  Even in Donegal I can sometimes travel 20, 30 or 35 miles without seeing a blade of grass on either side of the road. But the Department are not particularly interested in taking over this type of land and developing it as we should if we want this to be a viable country in ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate deals with roads through forests but we are not devoting enough time and energy and money to the waste land we have. When I come to deal with forestry it is nice to be able to say something good and I must say that we have some very nice forest parks.  I hope this policy will continue and that the Department will open many more forest parks because Ireland's green belts are probably <Col N="1267" /> gradually disappearing.  Whether in a small town or a large town many people at the weekends wish to get back to nature.  We Irish are primarily a people of the soil and many of us like to visit the forest parks, see the birds and trees. Also, it is an education for the next generation on what nature is about. More money should be spent on forestry roads.  At present the only roads for which the Minister can allocate money are the roads directly under his control.  I suggest that the roads leading to the forests, even though these are not proper forest roads, could be put in better condition so as to encourage more people to visit forests even though these in turn might not really be forest roads.</P>
    <P>The countryside has been starved of money for roads and forests.  I hope when replying the Minister will give some definite commitment.  That is what we want from his Department at present, not just vague promises without money. We have come to the stage when we must analyse the whole forest industry. We might make money next year or in five years but in 50 years' time there will be money to be made in the waste land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards game development it is disturbing to think that in 1979 £386,000 was passed by this House for game development and that only £176,000 was spent and that £210,000 is coming back into the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is spent now.  The wildlife rangers have been appointed now but technically it has to go into next year's Estimate.  It will be a matter of contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall listen with interest to what the Minister may say in reply but I was shocked to think that so much money should be coming back into this Estimate and had not been spent on game development.  We must see that game development continues in relation to forest parks.  I know that in some areas the pheasant and grouse seasons are quite good but there are other areas <Col N="1268" /> where these species have been shot out in the last five or six years.  I know that the Wildlife Bill, as it was called, was brought in to protect different species of game and I am sure all sides of the House would like to see game not only restored to the forests but to the land also.</P>
      <P>There is no short-cut with the forestry industry: we must have a long-term plan whereby we consider seriously one of our best amenities that has been neglected for so long.  We talk of bringing German, Japanese and American industries here and these are welcome but we ourselves have probably an area of tremendous potentiality provided we can develop it and that is the forest industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Subhead C.4 includes harbours and I should like to refer to the major development now taking place at Howth harbour in my constituency. It is envisaged that Howth will be the major fishing port on the east coast and I welcome the development now proceeding.  The Howth fishermen generally also welcome the development but they have about three reservations which are causing a great deal of concern to local people.  The first concern I have is the facing of the new centre pier, which the Minister is familiar with.  It should be finished properly rather than leaving it with a rough stone faced finish. When speaking on Committee Stage on the Inland Fisheries Bill the other day I mentioned this to the Minister and I was not happy with the commitment I got at that stage that the pier would be faced and properly finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reservation I have is in regard to the up-grading of the west pier. The buildings there have great character.  Howth was built when the harbour itself was built in the nineteenth century and there are some wonderful facades which should be preserved.  I would also like to see the tenants who occupy these buildings, and who take a great interest in them, given more security of tenure. The front of the harbour, where it is intended to put a new carpark and where <Col N="1269" /> many people including anglers and day-trippers are attracted, should be properly finished.</P>
    <P>It is intended that in the second phase of the development five acres of the Claremont beach is to be taken over to develop an industrial estate.  I have serious reservations about this.  A committee has been set up and I know the Minister has had liaison with this committee to discuss the proper development of Howth.  They have serious reservations in relation to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of Howth and, I am sure, the people of Dublin will object to this.  Claremont beach is quite a small beach and generations of Howth and Dublin people have been using this beach and they will object to this.  The fishermen are happy with the development of the harbour, but they have serious reservations about the reclamation of five acres of land from the Claremont strand.  What was agreed by the Department and the different bodies in Howth was that two acres would be reclaimed and this would be acceptable to the public at large.  The other three acres could be reclaimed by extending the west pier, which would also safeguard the west pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the east pier, it is intended putting a nib there which, in my opinion, will be a silt barrier and not, as is <Col N="1270" /> intended, a help in the scouring of the harbour, because the tides coming from the Malahide end and down along the Broadmeadow Estuary and the Baldoyle Estuary will wash sand right into the harbour, silt up the part where the fishermen will have to moor their boats and also interfere with the yachtsmen.  I again appeal to the Minister to consider this matter.  In my maiden speech in the Dáil I spoke about this and I asked the Minister to consider taking that nib off the east pier.  We would then have a very good development in Howth.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the development with those reservations.  I would also like to mention that the Minister's intention to have a fish auction hall in Howth is very welcome.  I do not know how the Dublin fish market survives when fish is caught at Howth and brought into Dublin where there are terrible traffic problems.  I now suggest to the Minister that he close the Dublin fish market and shift it out to Howth.  That is the place for it because the fish are caught in Howth; the buyers would come there and at the moment buyers come from England.</P>

      <P>Two new fishing vessels were purchased in Howth.  I have a pain in my arm writing to the Minister because it was promised at the time of purchase of these vessels more than 20 months ago that the FEOGA grant would be paid. This week the purchaser received from Brussels a notification accepting that the fishing vessel had been purchased and would be based principally in the port of Howth.  The request was for a payment of aid from the guidance section.  This fisherman has consulted me and told me that he is in arrears with the board in regard to his payments and they are threatening all sorts of things.  But if he had his FEOGA grant he would be able to meet his commitments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Sea angling in Howth should be encouraged because it is so near Dublin Airport and so near the centre of the city.  The Minister should contact people like Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte so that they might set up a sea angling project to get people into Howth and give work to the local fishermen and local people who <Col N="1272" /> have shops and so on supplying sea fishing tackle.  I would encourage the Minister to look at this aspect of fishing along the sea coast itself.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like the Minister to consider the points I have put to him about Howth harbour and to look at the two cases I have mentioned in relation to the FEOGA grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Estimates for Fisheries and Forestry.  I will start by speaking on fisheries and refer to subhead C.1, Sea Fisheries Development.  It represents an admission of the fact that we know sweet damn all about the fishing resources and stocks around our coasts, and anything we have caught up to now since the foundation of this State has been based on hit and miss and a very localised knowledge.  By means of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1977, we created a 200-mile exclusive limit around these shores and, sad to relate, we know little or nothing&mdash;more nothing than little&mdash;about fish stocks in that area.</P>
      <P>A proper survey system to find out what is out there is long overdue.  The French and Spanish in particular know more about our fishing grounds, the species that those grounds contain, the amount of those species and, more important still, their location, than we ourselves know.  As if to reinforce that point, the General Manager, if you could call him that, of BIM, Mr. Brendan O'Kelly, paid a visit to the naval headquarters in Haulbowline last week, according to press reports, to ask the Naval Service to help him and the Irish fishermen to find out what is out there within the 200-mile limit.  It is amazing that we have made only a very scant effort to find out for ourselves up to now.  I am aware that the French Navy do help the French fishing industry in the same way and I imagine that the idea that Mr. O'Kelly had in going to Haulbowline was to try to set up the same type of co-operation and to get the type of information which we have not had.  I take issue with the Minister on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year I went on a factfinding <Col N="1273" /> mission to Brussels and I put the point to the sector of the EEC Commission who deal with fisheries that we could not know anything about the fish stocks within our 200-mile limit and I asked them to help us to do a proper survey. That type of survey obviously could not be done overnight.  It would take several years and vast resources which we and this Government could not possibly afford.  It transpires that at present we do not even have a fishing survey vessel.  We did have one&mdash;the <i>Cú Feasa</i>&mdash;but that has been out of commission for several years.  We are now left to hire out trawlers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a lot of good at this stage.  We should have known 50 years ago what stocks we had and where they were.  At present we are hiring out trawlers to do surveys for us, and that is the sum total of our knowledge of these stocks.  I asked about financial aid for such an extensive and comprehensive survey and I was told that the Commission would be only too glad to help us. After coming back from Brussels I put down a question and the Minister said that he had not applied for any such aid for such a survey and that he had no intention of doing so.  A very pertinent question is: why has the Minister not asked for such EEC aid so far?  The only type of aid that I have seen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The additional expenditure</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is £20,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>arises on boat hire in connection with a survey on herring stocks in the Celtic Sea </P>
      <P>From the Minister's own statement and his short replies when I have been speaking and from what he has said previously in the House, it seems that we have no means of surveying the stocks in the Celtic Sea at present.  Yet the Minister insists on imposing a complete ban on herring fishing in the Celtic Sea.  That begs the question: why have a ban when we have not even one survey ship to find out what stocks we have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> My constituency has hundreds of in-shore fishermen who depend on herring fishing and seasonal salmon fishing for their livelihood.  As a result of the restrictions placed earlier this year on the salmon fishing season, they could not make a living during that salmon season. Now they are being prevented and are being threatened with heavy fines and imprisonment for attempting to fish for herring on the grounds that the stocks are not sufficient to justify fishing on any scale.</P>
    <P>We do not even know what stocks are there.  The fishermen who are the people on the spot with the sonar equipment and echo sounders claim that the stocks are far in excess of the situation as stated by the Department whose scientific research facilities are extremely limited.  I ask the Minister to admit that he does not know what the situation is and that all he is making is an educated or, perhaps, an uneducated guess as to the exact stocks that are available.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago I was informed by the Fisheries Commission in Brussels that the question of Dutch by-catches in the Celtic Sea would be debated at the Council of Ministers on 3 and 4 December and for the past couple of days I have been scanning the newspapers in an effort to find out what was the outcome of those discussions and whether the Minister's proposals in that regard were accepted by the Dutch in particular and also by the West Germans but as I have failed to find any reference to the discussions perhaps the Minister will tell us whether he succeeded in getting agreement from the Dutch not to fish for mackerel in the Celtic Sea during which process they scoop up a huge amount of herring.  If there has been such agreement, why has it not been published? Until such time as agreement can be reached with the Dutch on this matter there should not be any question of interfering with small boat inshore Irish fishermen who fish in open boats in very bad weather such as that which we experience at this time of year.  The Minister should be ashamed to be <Col N="1276" /> wielding the big stick in this regard.  His guilt was evident during the Cork by-elections when he confined his activities to inland towns such as Mitchelstown and Mallow.</P>

      <P>Have we succeeded in getting from the Dutch the type of declaration that we have been seeking for a long time?  Perhaps the Minister was successful in this regard but the position is that the Dutch fish for herring in the Celtic Sea under the guise of fishing for mackerel.  My information is that last week there were unlimited supplies of herring for sale on the Continent, the source of which was suspected to have been the Celtic Sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the <Col N="1277" /> Minister refute that suggestion but undoubtedly the Dutch have been catching vast quantities of herring in recent years under the guise of fishing for mackerel. We on the south coast should be very disappointed to hear that the Minister failed to get agreement in this regard on Monday last.  All that is emanating from discussions of that kind is that the British attitude on a common fisheries policy is softening but we have not had any specific proposals in that regard though we know that the British as well as the Irish fishermen are anxious that these grounds be opened up again.</P>
      <P>On the question of Dutch by-catches and of herring stocks in the Celtic Sea why has the Minister not invoked that section of the Hague Agreement of 30 October 1976, an agreement which the last Government went to such considerable lengths to bring about but which the present Government have never utilised?  It is an extremely effective weapon and should have been used by the Minister in the present situation.</P>

      <P>On the question of a proper survey as mentioned in subhead C 1, why have not the Irish Fishermen's Organisation proposals been brought in? I refer to the proposals which envisaged a system whereby the type of survey we need could be carried out at a relatively low cost and which would prevent the type of poaching which is being carried on wholesale?  Earlier this year those proposals were put forward by the IFO. They were agreed to subsequently by the Minister but no action has been taken on them.  The proposals were that any foreign fishing boat entering our territorial waters or which was within the 200-mile limit would be boarded by an Irish fisheries officer who from then on would be in a position to supervise the catches of that boat, thereby eliminating <Col N="1279" /> the possibility of illegal fishing.  That seemed a highly commendable move but it is very disappointing that the Minister has not implemented the proposals.  The document concerned was one of the most outstanding I have ever seen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proposals to which I referred had been adopted there would not be any need to spend that kind of money because the fisheries officers could carry out the type of survey we are talking about and carry it out on the spot while supervising the catches.  These proposals refer not only to the Dutch in terms of their fishing for herring but they apply also to the Spanish in regard to their fishing for hake, a species which they catch in great quantities but which is very much an under-utilised species so far as Irish fishermen are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister clarify the position regarding the sale of the BIM boatyards at Killybegs, Dingle and Baltimore?  We were told that these premises were bought by private concerns but we should like to hear how the present work force compares with the work force in those yards before they were handed over to private interests.  Is it true that substantial grants were given to the people who purchased the boatyards, that in other words, what was involved was not really a purchase but a transfer of responsibility from BIM to private individuals?  That is a question I cannot answer.  I should like the Minister <Col N="1280" /> to refer to it because it is a question that is being asked in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Estimate poses the question, what are we growing trees for? Why have we hundreds of thousands of acres of woods and forests?  What do we intend using all this timber for and what is the end product?  I ask that question simply because during the past three years we were promised that the processing sector of the timber industry was going to be considerably expanded.  That was a very laudable sentiment and we all agreed with it.  I spoke on Bills and Estimates and I complimented the Minister on his progressive attitude because quite a lot of land here is suitable for forestry purposes.  We have a vast acreage under forestry at the moment.</P>
    <P>In reality, what happened in the past 12 months is as follows.  We have come from a situation where we had four major timber processing concerns to a situation where we now have only two. A considerable number of forests are rotting because there is no outlet for the product.  With a deputation of other public representatives from Waterford I met the Minister in September 1978 to ask him to ensure the future of the timber processing industry in that city.  We were referring to Munster Chipboard. He gave in his own words &ldquo;a categorical assurance&rdquo; that that processing industry would be retained and expanded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our timber processing industry has collapsed.  Two factories have closed down.  We have a forestry policy that has no natural culmination.  It is a hit-and-miss effort.  What is the Minister doing to formulate a national policy on forestry?  Are we growing trees and employing people in the factory industry just for the sake of giving jobs that have no end value.  That question must be answered.</P>
      <P>We want to see employment in that sector.  Employment could be expanded but we cannot allow the present situation to continue where forests are not being thinned and where timber is not being utilised because there are no outlets in the processing sector.  I should like the Minister to tell us if there is an EEC forestry policy on timber and forests. Can it be welded with the Irish notional policy on forestry?  Surely the two are compatible?  Surely that is why we are in the EEC, that our products will have a fair chance of being sold on the open market?  Obviously that is not the case nowadays because imports from third countries are flooding the market and making it uneconomic to produce processed timber here.  I should like the Minister to tell us what are the Government doing to stop this free for all which involves countries outside the EEC.  Our timber processing industries and the hopes of expansion are being ruined by this policy.  We would like to know when the imports will be stopped and when factories such as Munster Chipboard will reopen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there a future for a factory like Munster Chipboard, for a factory in Scarriff, for the Irish Board Mills in <Col N="1282" /> Athy which closed down this year, and for Clondalkin?  If not, what will we do with the products of our forests?  I should like a rational answer from the Minister on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the forestry section first.  A number of constructive points have been raised by the various speakers.  Deputy White expressed disappointment that grants in respect of private planting were not utilised to a greater extent and I agree with him.  At the moment we are reviewing the grants with a view to making a substantial improvement in the extent of the grants and in an effort to make the scheme more effective.  I hope this will mean there will be a better response.  I believe strongly in encouraging private planting.  We have a number of co-operative projects at the moment as well as banking and financial interests who are prepared to consider a long-term investment in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised the question of the whole forestry policy of the EEC and our national forestry policy.  He is right in that the EEC have not really evolved a forestry policy as such on a Community basis.  We would like to see that develop. Unfortunately there is surplus capacity within the Community in the wood pulp industry at the moment.  It is not just our trouble but is general Community trouble. However, it is important that we make some attempt to resolve it because we depend on wood pulp outlets such as Scarriff and Clondalkin&mdash;we are negotiating with both of them at the moment and they are working in a viable way&mdash;and also any other outlets to make use of the thinnings.  The proper harvesting of the end mature timber product depends on thinnings taking place.  It is the thinnings that give rise to the ultimate quality of the saw-log product.  The whole purpose of forestry investment and development is geared towards the provision of a good saw-log product that can fit into the timber mill industry.  That industry is a major employer employing more than 1,000 people in Ireland.  There are about 160 timber <Col N="1283" /> sawmills and there are three or four new proposals before the IDA for setting up operations.  There is a very extensive grant scheme being made available by the IDA for the adaptation of existing sawmills.  The whole future in that area is good.</P>
    <P>At the moment we import for the building and construction industry 75 per cent of our timber requirements, with the Irish sawmills supplying only 25 per cent.  The outlets will increase and improve. It is a certain market and the IDA and my Department are optimistic about this matter.  The problem area is the pulpwood area that makes use of the thinnings in the interim stage and that is where we are facing problems at the moment caused by the over-capacity I mentioned. That is the score.</P>
    <P>Deputy White raised a query to the effect that there appeared to be non-spending in the current year on game development.  That does not apply to game development as such.  It relates only to the new scheme we have initiated. We are now in the course of appointing wild life rangers.  There were delays because of the postal strike, to be candid about it.  A number have been appointed in the past few weeks and a number of others are on the way to being appointed.  We hope to have between 60 and 70 of these wild life rangers appointed before the middle of February.  The shortfall to which Deputy White referred will be expended.</P>

      <P>I agree.  By the way it is drafted it seems to imply that it is related to game development.  In fact it is not. Game development continued.  The exact figures are that a total of 66 appointments will be made.  Already 16 have been appointed and offers of jobs have been issued to a further 24.  They have been inspected from the medical point of view and the suitability point of view, and we hope to have the others appointed before the middle of February.</P>

      <Col N="1284" /> Deputy Cosgrave referred to Howth Harbour.  We have done our best to get an understanding on the ground in regard to Howth Harbour and to reconcile the various interests involved.  I appreciate that there are differing interests. There are the fishing interests, the amenity interests, the sailing interests and the residential interests.  Howth is a gem of a place.  There is no question about that.  At the same time there are very good reasons why it should be developed as a major fisheries centre. We published a leaflet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">

I want to assure Deputy Cosgrave that Claremont Beach, about which there is a lot of concern from the amenity point of view, will not be used as an industrial site.  We have sought to emphasise that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand something of that kind has been worked out.  We have set up a liaison committee and we have had a number of meetings.  We are making a real effort to get this together. We have reached agreement with the sailing club as to where they will have their premises.  They are having a marina development on the right hand side of the harbour, and a fishing development on the left hand side of the harbour.  My colleague tells me east and west would be more correct than left and right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">

      <P>What about the facing of the pier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking at that aspect with a view to getting the facing of the pier done properly.  It is a roughedged facing which is objected to from the aesthetic point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boat yards are going very well under <Col N="1285" /> private management and control.  I want to assure Deputy White of that, and particularly the boat yard in Killybegs which had been taken over by an excellent company from Arklow with long associations with the boat building industry, the Tyrrell family.  There were some redundancies which were agreed upon with the trade unions.  I understand the wage and salary rates are higher than they were when the boat yard was owned by the State company concerned, BIM.</P>
    <P>There is an expansion of business particularly on the repair side which has proved very beneficial to the local fishermen who have a very important interest in getting their boats repaired quickly to get them out fishing as quickly as possible. The private firm have proved very expeditious there so far as the fishermen are concerned.  We have been congratulated by Mr. Murren and the local Donegal Fishermen's Co-operative on this development in Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Similarly in Baltimore and Dingle the private takeover of the boat yards has proved successful.  Arrangements have been made in the case of the very few redundancies which arose which have been agreed to by the unions and the incoming owners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

      <P>I have heard no reaction. I understand the discussions were fruitful and that proper redundancy payments were made where they arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made about the fishery research vessel.  I want to emphasise that we are now in the course of placing a contract with Verolme Cork for the construction of a very up-to-date modern fishery research vessel.  We have saved time in getting it under way by reason of the fact that we purchased the basic designs from Norway.  They are the most advanced people in the world in this area.  We have paid for those designs and drawings.  They are now with Verolme Cork, and work on this very modern <Col N="1286" /> design will start inside the next month.  It will have accommodation for up to 12 scientists with full laboratory facilities and equipment.  We expect delivery of the vessel in 1981.</P>
    <P>Pending that we have to proceed on the basis of what is outlined in the supplementary estimate and proceed by way of utilisation of existing fishing craft.  We are doing this in the Celtic Sea at the moment.  We are hiring four vessels belonging to local fishermen, putting our scientists aboard them, and making our scientific assessments in that manner.  It is a practical way of doing it.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered everything that was raised.  I do not want to widen the debate.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, there is a danger in this debate of getting into a more general discussion. The supplementary estimates are really confined to specific areas.  One point was referred to by Deputy White which I omitted to mention.  We get a FEOGA grant for boats of up to 90 feet.  We give a national grant over and above that. This suits us because the pressure is on from bigger countries who have a greater utilisation of big boats to get FEOGA grants.  We and the Italians are the big users of these grants because they apply up to 90 feet only.  In addition to what we get from FEOGA by way of a 50 per cent grant, we have our own national scheme of a grant of 25 per cent on top of that and there is no length limit.  By reason of the limitation we are benefiting to a greater extent than the larger fishing nations and, at the same time, we can top up grants with our own grants where necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the House for the constructive approach adopted to the Estimates. I hope we can have further constructive debates on the development of fisheries and forestry.  I want to thank the House also for the very constructive discussions we had yesterday on the Fisheries Bill.  I am sorry we could not get the amendments in today but I hope we will have them on Tuesday when we can have an accommodating debate on Report Stage amendments.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £13,139,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid. </P>
      <P>The major factors giving rise to the Supplementary are the impact of the National Understanding on the pay elements of the expenditure by my Department and the bodies under their aegis and the additional provision for capital expenditure by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>The details are as follows:</P>
      <P>On subhead A1&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;the sum of £600,000 sought is required to meet the cost of implementing the terms of the national understanding and for payment of some grade awards which have been approved by the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On subhead A3&mdash;Consultancy Services&mdash;the additional £62,000 sought is <Col N="1288" /> required to meet the cost of consultancy projects which arose during the year and which had not been provided for in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>On subhead B1&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;the extra £30,000 sought reflects the cost which arose from increased air fares and subsistence and mileage allowances.</P>
    <P>On subhead F1&mdash;Institute for Industrial Research and Standards&mdash;approximately £432,000 of the £532,000 sought by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is required to meet the cost of the national understanding and some grade claims.  The remaining £100,000 will be used to finance the institute's lead role for energy conservation.</P>
    <P>On subhead G&mdash;International Organisations, etc&mdash;the extra sum required results from Ireland's contribution to the budget of the European Coal and Steel Community.  Ireland's share this year, based on our proportion of Community GNP, is 174,564 EUA or approximately £117,200 and it is proposed to pay this sum by way of grant to the funds of the European Coal and Steel Community.  As there are offsetting savings elsewhere on the subhead the additional amount required is £52,200.</P>
    <P>On subhead H1&mdash;Córas Tráchtála&mdash;the additional £380,000 sought by Córas Tráchtála is required to meet the cost of implementing the national understanding and grade claims amounting to some £230,000.  The balance of the amount sought, £150,000 is required to meet increased costs of administration due to greater promotional activity, recruitment of staff and higher costs abroad arising from the Board's offices and activities in other countries.</P>
    <P>On subhead H2&mdash;Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited&mdash;the vote for the current financial year provided £474,000 towards the Grant-in-Aid for the Kilkenny Design Workshops Ltd.  An additional amount of £50,000 is now required by the company, to meet further commitments.</P>
    <P>Of this sum £21,000 is needed to <Col N="1289" /> cover wage and salary costs arising mainly from the implementation of the first phase of the 1979 national understanding and the increased rates of pay-related social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>A further £29,000 is needed for general expenses, the principal item being £25,000 required to meet part of the loan repayments in respect of Butler House, Kilkenny, which could not be fully met out of European Social Fund grants.</P>
    <P>On subhead I1&mdash;IDA Administration and General Expenses&mdash;in the original vote the Authority were allocated £8,500,000 for Administration and General Expenses.  An additional £815,000 is required to implement the national understanding and to meet certain grade claims.</P>
    <P>On subhead I2&mdash;IDA&mdash;Capital Expenditure&mdash;the original allocation for the capital grant-in-aid for 1979 was £109 million.  An extra £10 million is necessary in respect of unforeseen significant variations in the grant payments to, and equity participation, in a small number of large projects and also in respect of the escalating rate of building cost increases.</P>
    <P>On subhead J1&mdash;SFADCo&mdash;Administration and General Expenses&mdash;a supplementary provision of £137,000 is required to meet the Company's commitments in regard to the national understanding and grade claims.</P>
    <P>On subhead J2&mdash;SFADCo&mdash;Grants to Industrialisation&mdash;between July and September 1979, SFADCo carried out a survey of new and established firms at Shannon who have qualified for grants. As a result of the survey the original allocation of £700,000 was found to be insufficient by £750,000.</P>
    <P>On subhead K2&mdash;Credit Financing of certain Capital Goods Exports&mdash;provision is made for the payment of a compensatory element towards interest charged by the Associated Banks in respect of the credit-financing of exports of goods of a capital nature at concessionary rates of interest.  The total amount payable this year is £663,500 <Col N="1290" /> but as only £350,000 was allocated in the original Estimate it is now necessary to provide an additional £283,500 for this service.</P>
    <P>On subhead M&mdash;Irish Productivity Centre&mdash;the additional amount of £31,400 sought for the IPC is required to meet the cost of the national understanding and increased pay related social insurance and certain grade claims.</P>
    <P>On subhead P&mdash;Irish Goods Council&mdash;the extra £5,000 is required to meet the cost of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>On subhead T1&mdash;Grant to National Film Studios of Ireland Limited&mdash;an additional grant to the National Film Studios of Ireland Ltd. to cover unforeseen additional trading losses during 1979 is needed.  The company are now experiencing serious cash flow problems and funds are urgently required to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>On Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;there will be an overall deficiency of £920,000. The major part of the deficiency is due to a shortfall in receipts under the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act, 1960, and from the EEC in respect of specific surveys.  The gross deficiency has been partly offset by additional receipts from the IDA in respect of repayable grants for industrial housing; by an increase in receipts from export guarantee premiums and so on and under the Trade Marks and Patents Acts.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure, together with the deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid is £15,024,000 but there is an offset of £1,885,000 in savings mainly made up of £900,000 on Subhead I3&mdash;Industrial Development Authority&mdash;Grant for Industrial Housing, due to a procedural change in the method of payment by the IDA to the National Building Agency in respect of Industrial housing.  There will, however, be no diminution in the IDA's commitments for Industrial Housing.  Other savings on the voted provision include £140,000 on subhead L&mdash;Technical Assistance; £150,000 on subhead O1&mdash;Shipbuilding subsidy; £114,000 on <Col N="1291" /> subhead U&mdash;Energy Conservation; £180,000 on subhead DD&mdash;State support for Avoca Mines Limited and £150,000 and subhead BB, Petroleum Licences&mdash;Funds for training and so on. The net amount needed is, therefore, £13,139,000.</P>
    <P>I have explained in the case of each subhead the reason for the increased expenditure but, if Deputies wish to raise any points in relation to them, I shall deal with them as far as possible in my reply.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has gone through a variety of subheads in relation to supplementary estimates.  It is unfortunate that, so far this year, we have not had an opportunity to discuss the Minister's Department or the economy, despite the fact that the Fine Gael Party sought Government time in which to do so.  We were told that we could discuss these matters in Private Members' time. The refusal to accede to our request could be an indication of the degree to which the Minister and his colleagues are trying to cover up the present state of the economy, knowing that a debate in Private Members' time would not suffice to give a clear picture of the position.</P>
      <P>While most of the subheads mentioned by the Minister come up every year, there are some subheads which require a wider explanation than a mere statement of fact.  For example, on subhead J2&mdash;SFADCo&mdash;there was an original estimate of £700,000 requiring a supplementary estimate of £750,000.  The original estimate is only 50 per cent of the total requirement.</P>
      <P>The next one is subhead K2, where the total amount needed is £350,000.  To put it mildly that is not a very accurate estimation of what the needs might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department are responsible for running industry and a wide area of the economy.  The scenario which faces us now in that area is one of a struggling economy trying to come to grips with many difficulties.  Some of <Col N="1292" /> these difficulties are not of the Minister's or the Government's making, but some are.  Industry at present, as was the case for most of this year, is struggling in the face of major difficulties.  Not so many months ago there was no assurance of availability of oil supplies and no assurance of an adequate and continuous power supply.  That is still the position.  We spent half of this year without a postal service, something which militated very much against our industry.  Another factor which has been a major problem is the poor industrial relations record we have.  That was a major problem in the public sector.  Other areas of difficulty included the shortage of skilled labour in the technical field, which was adverted to in other quarters recently.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is making life difficult at present for industry is the credit squeeze.  Small industries are facing a very lean time.  In the past two to three weeks I have had many requests and contacts from people&mdash;many of them family concerns&mdash;who have been engaged in industries such as light engineering, fabrics, clothing and so on for many years and do not have any money.  In many cases those industries did not receive any grants.  Because of the financial restraints and regulations many of them are forced to have huge sums of money frozen in a bank while awaiting delivery of raw material from foreign countries.  That difficulty, in conjunction with the credit squeeze, is placing an intolerable burden on many industrialists. Unless special measures are directed towards them, their survival is in grave doubt.  Without sounding alarmist, many of them say they will have to let some of their employees go, something they never had to do before.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of scenario which our economy faces.  Many of the problems facing those people were created at home.  Other problems were imported and the Minister and the Government had no control over them.  The main imported problem was the increase in fuel costs which brought about a new difficulty <Col N="1293" /> which needs special attention.  It is the Government's prerogative to point to this as being the source of all evil.  The increase has been in the region of 50 per cent, but I should like to point out that four years ago this former Government faced an increase in fuel costs in the region of 300 per cent in a very short period.  In spite of that massive increase, which brought with it consequential problems, the then Government handled the matter well.  On leaving office they were able to prove that they had come to grips with the situation.  Of course, that was not made clear until after the general election of 1977.  That is clear now to anybody who cares to compare the record of the performance of the Government with that of the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>Our economy is also suffering from miscalculations.  We can all recall the budget earlier this year.  In the run up to that budget people, including industrialists, were given to understand that things were going very well.  They were told that there was confidence in the Government, who were capable of surmounting any problems that might arise, foreseen or unforeseen.  The miscalculation I am referring to took place at budget time.  When this country was told it was on an even keel, that inflation was on a downwards trend&mdash;as indeed it was in 1978&mdash;and we were told that it would continue to do so.  Such was the confidence that the prediction was that a 5 per cent inflation rate by the end of this year was achievable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the subheads in <Col N="1294" /> the Supplementary Estimate refer to increased costs due to rising wage demands. I put it to the House that this increased wage demand syndrome we now face is due to the very thing about which I have been talking, that the prediction made in the early part of this year turned out to be way off the mark.  In fact, the inflation rate predicted is one-third of what the actual inflation rate will be by the end of the year.  Consequently, we are now dealing with Supplementary Estimates to meet that need caused by that miscalculation.</P>
      <P>The other matter with which I want to deal is the prediction with regard to our gross national product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is rather wide of the mark on a Supplementary Estimate for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me tie this in with the Supplementary Estimate before us. No doubt the Minister will be endeavouring to tell us, in winding up this debate, that industry is performing very well and will be able to quote certain figures giving that impression.  Indeed, the resilience of industry in this country is such that, despite all the difficulties outlined, it is doing a very fine job.  But it is feeling the pinch and this cannot be denied.  The recent survey about the shortage of money, the credit squeeze, gives us ample evidence of the way in which our economy is going, and paints a very bleak picture for the immediate future.  Of the 278 manufacturing firms recently surveyed in relation to their present position and the future, almost one-quarter stated that their existing level of output is currently constrained by lack of credit.  One-third of them state that growth in output is currently constrained through lack of credit.  Almost one half of them have cut back on material stock level because of lack of credit and, even where credit is available, because of exorbitantly high interest rates.  Almost one half of them intend to cut back on material stock levels because of high interest rates.  Nearly one-third of them in the current survey have already <Col N="1295" /> postponed investment projects because of the current high interest rates.</P>
      <P>Those are some of the signs that our economy is literally being suffocated by factors over which it has no control but rather is caught up in this vicious circle of inflation, rising costs and interest rates, bringing a higher demand for wages.  Yet we go on our merry train in this vicious circle.</P>
      <P>I shall mention the subhead concerning the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards if only to put on the record what we feel on this side of the House about the recent vicious attack on that institute, an institute doing a very fine job in this country.  In the past fortnight in this House we have had long discussions on an enabling Bill concerning this institute.  It was unfortunate that the Minister failed to recognise the importance of amendments put down to ensure that the Minister for Finance would underwrite capital borrowed by this institute for certain purposes.  In fact, in this case a precedent has been created. In a convoluted way, I suppose, it does not show in the institute the kind of confidence the Government ought to be showing.  This more recent public attack on them should be refuted by Members of this House.  It is an unwarranted, exaggerated and ill-informed attack on a body doing its utmost to fulfil its functions, indeed going beyond the call of duty in many instances to do so.  The IIRS can be said to be doing their work in the manner expected of them.  We must not tolerate this kind of attack being made on them inside or outside the country.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority, a body set up by the Coalition Government to do a particular job, a body which at the time of its inception was frowned on as being typical of Fine Gael thinking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously not.  I am glad to be a member of the party that set <Col N="1296" /> up that body.  I am glad also that it succeeded and that the people who saw fit to castigate it at the time are now fully behind it, as they should as good patriots and statesmen, because the IDA have proved their worth in the field in which they operate: the promotion of industry at home and the inducement of foreign industry here.  In the past six to eight months I have often felt that the IDA must be suffering agony endeavouring to sell this country as the right place in which to establish industry because of the many factors I have outlined already over which they have no control and which must diminish their arguments in favour of this country.  They must have felt the cold chill of the economic climate during the past few months.  I am glad to say that despite that they are doing a very worthwhile, successful job as outlined by the Minister in the Limerick area.</P>
      <P>The Irish Goods Council hide their light under a bushel and play their role in very low key fashion.  The personnel of that council and their approach to their work is first class.  We have many examples of their success.  Their job is to promote the sale of Irish goods.  This is a formidable task, given the conditions of trade which apply in a small open economy.  They do not get the recognition they should get.  They have a very definite role to play and I hope they will be given the means to play it.  The council are composed of a very dedicated group of people who know what they are about and have a good record of success chalked up to prove that.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I, with the other members, examine the Appropriation Accounts which bring us into close contact with the accounting systems in the different Departments.  We commented in our recent report on one area of activity which we felt should be mentioned, that is exploration licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably the lateness of the hour which is causing me to go off the subheads.  Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, another State body, are doing very fine work abroad in promoting the sale of Irish exports.  The Minister, as his predecessors have done, and as part of his function, does a great deal in this area.  I wonder if the announcements made after very successful tours by the Minister are not politically motivated in their timing?  Nobody would be more happy than I if the Minister could announce 40 new projects on his return from a promotional tour abroad.  It is the manner in which this thing is done which causes me to say that a lot of the good work done is ruined by the political bias brought into the scene at that stage.  I suppose it is the way of politics which causes this type of approach.  I hope the Minister will give us a full picture of what the current position of industry is and what the prospects are in the near future and in mid-term.  The type of comment made by the Minister on radio a few weeks ago that the economy was booming is not worthy of a man of his calibre.  It was a very generalised statement.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will give the House and the people involved in industry some idea of what the future holds for them.  Confidence and trust at the moment is in very short supply because the people are not being told what the position is.  This refers not only to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy but also to many of his colleagues.  I hope that the Minister will be in a position to do that.  Before I conclude, I hope that in the not too distant future the scenario that I have outlined for the industrial field will be changed and that we shall be in a position to look back and say that we have overcome our difficulties satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by protesting at the rush which has overtaken these Supplementary Estimates.  It is true that, at least as far as my fairly short recollection of these things goes, the days coming up to the Christmas Recess tend to be crowded and the Estimates are shoved in at the end and whatever are outstanding are dealt with in a hurry.  I remind the House that this is only 6 December, a Thursday.  The House has frequently sat on a Friday and during quite long periods when I was Government Whip it sat on Friday, week in, week out, having sat on the Wednesday and Thursday up to 10.30 p.m.  There are two full weeks left before anybody can start talking about the Christmas holidays.  There is next week&mdash;in terms of ordinary sittings, 11, 12 and 13 December&mdash;and the week after, 18, 19 and 20 December.  There can be no possible reason why the Government are short of time when we might have sat on Friday 14, or even Friday, 21 December. It would not kill anyone at all to sit on those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object very much to business being done in the dark, which is what is being asked of the House this evening.  We were told that the House would sit until 10.30 p.m., hours after&mdash;as everybody here knows and let us not be mealymouthed <Col N="1299" /> about it because this is the game we are all in on both sides of the House&mdash;the papers have gone to bed, hours after the media have ceased to pay any attention to what is happening in here. That is no way to do business.  It might be all right if one were dealing with a Government such as we were, who had to put up with non-stop obstruction and filibustering from the day we took up office until the day we left office.  It is fair to say that not one hour of this Dáil, since it met on whatever day it was in July 1977, has been squandered by the Opposition.  Not a single unnecessary speaker has been pushed in to speak on anything since then.  Any business done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will come back to the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the Estimate and on the fact that I am being asked to speak to that Estimate, or that the only opportunity I have of speaking to that Estimate is at 25 minutes to 10 on a Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>I know it is a rather special week and sincerely understand that the Government&mdash;no matter who and what members are involved&mdash;have a serious decision ahead of them and that the Dáil will be asked to approve various things next week, which will necessarily take up a lot of time.  I understand that and do not want to make little of it, or appear to want to make it look trivial because it is not trivial.  However, this Dáil has not been characterised by obstruction.  No one knows that better than the Minister himself.  He has not had to sit here, night after night, listening to people being shoved for anything at all&mdash;people who knew absolutely nothing at all about the subject, with no reason other than to keep the House busy for the Ministers opposite, who in our day were relying on an overall majority in the first year of, at most, one.  Later the position improved when we won a couple of by-elections. That was the kind of opposition we had to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> That has not happened the present Government who have been treated reasonably and civilly for the past two-and-a-half years.  There is no reason why, on 6 December, we should be kept here until this hour of the night to discuss Estimates in the dark&mdash;and I mean that from the point of view of the media.  Not one word of what the Minister or anybody says, will be reported tomorrow and I am not going to be mealy-mouthed about that.  We are in the business of publicity and of speaking to people and if people will not sit in the Public Gallery, the only way they will discover what is happening in the Parliament is through the media.  The media are under time restraints as well as the rest of us and effectively what happens is that by 5 o'clock in the evening unless there is a very important and startling matter when a special quorum will be kept, nothing will be reported.  In fact, we are lucky to be reported after lunch; that is the way it is these days.  I know the media have constraints of various kinds but that is the reality.  There is no reason whatever when there are two full weeks to go, why we should be here at this hour, an hour to which the Dáil has not sat, in my recollection, since 1975&mdash;fully four years, unless my memory is slipping. What is the reason for the rush now?</P>
    <P>I want to mention another symptom of the rush&mdash;and I do not mean this personally against the Minister&mdash;the reason why we are sitting here at this hour in a situation in which, undoubtedly, the Members on the far side have things on their minds.  If they were a Government of angels they would be right to be anxious about what is going to happen tomorrow and next week.  I am not trying to trivialise that&mdash;it is an important thing for all of us&mdash;but that is no way to do business.  This party do not mind being asked to sit extra time, or extra days, but to be asked to sit until this hour of the evening, not that any of us are tired or unwilling to do business, but to be asked to speak into the wind and in the dark is too much and for what, and with what excuse?  There is absolutely no excuse. I do not intend this to be in any <Col N="1301" /> sense a personal attack on the Minister opposite.  I have had many a brush with him in the past but, in a general way, I wish him well and cannot withold from him a certain regard for him.  However, his speech here this evening was as graceless and as loveless a performance as I have ever witnessed in this House. He went through his Estimates speech&mdash;and I do not wish to be blasphemous&mdash;like a priest of 90 years of age reading the Latin Mass and hoping to get through it in 15 minutes, in the days when such a thing was possible.  He did not even stop in between the subheads. He charged from one paragraph to another, from J1 and J2 to L1 and L2. He did not even bother to stop, nor did the person who wrote the script for him tell us what were the reasons for some of the things he mentioned.  I would have liked to have had information, as I am sure Deputy O'Toole would have, about the background to the cash flow difficulties which our National Film Studios are having.  I did not want a long speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I briefly interrupt the Deputy?  I had a longer speech prepared for me and they took it off me a few hours ago and gave me a shorter one on the Whip's instruction, because the Opposition did not like Ministers speaking at length on Supplementary Estimates.  They objected to it.  I shall read out the long version for the Deputy if he wants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell the Minister this.  He probably was over in Kildare Street, perhaps looking out the window to see could he spot that Spook of Schoolhouse Lane, the Industrial Development Consortium.  He was so occupied a few hours ago when his colleague, the Minister for Education, spoke for one hour in replying to his piddling Education Estimate, having spoken, in the first instance, for a far shorter time than that.  If he was all that interested in getting his business through quickly, he could have done better than speaking for one hour, so if the instructions of the Minister's Whip&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the conclusion I am driven to.  The Minister for Education can have no regard for his Whip if he is capable of speaking for an hour on an evening when the Dáil is trying to pass 20 Estimates&mdash;not in opening his Estimate, but in replying to it.  If the Minister for Education can see fit to waste the time of the Dáil at this hour of the evening and speak for an hour in replying to three or four Deputies who spoke from this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not feel it a constraint that we&mdash;all the rest of us&mdash; can weigh all that heavily.

We can rule him out of the leadership stakes, if his word is made so little of and so light of by Zeus, the Thunderer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what I have said about Deputy O'Malley, and I hope to live to say many more things against him, he is not a man who is afraid to lead with his chin.  I am amazed to hear him uncharacteristically shoving off on his officials the responsibility for having dropped from his speech an explanation as to why the National Film Studios are having serious cash flow problems.  I would have liked to know in a couple of words what these cash flow problems were&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but why?  Had Senator Keating, the Minister's predecessor been introducing a Supplementary Estimate and looking for money for Bula and had said that they <Col N="1303" /> were having cash flow problems without explaining what they were or how they had arisen, I can imagine the searing tones that we would have heard from Deputy O'Malley across the floor about it.  I can appreciate that the National Film Studios are not a gold mine, they are not even a Bula mine, but I would have wished for some explanation.  That is only a symptom of why I described this as as graceless and loveless a script as I have ever heard here.  It could not be because anybody is short of time, when Deputy Wilson could spend one hour replying to his Estimate.  This is just an unjustified attempt to clear the Estimates off the desk in the dark.</P>
      <P>The only part of the Minister's Department for which I still carry Opposition responsibility is energy, and I have no intention of making a speech on energy at a time when anything I say will go no further than the ears of the Minister and his officials.  I will make two points and will save the rest for a more propitious occasion.  The Estimate contains an item for salaries, wages and allowances.  It is not a saving but an increase. In this context I would like to draw attention to the very defective arrangements which the Minister has had in his Department in regard to proper advice on energy since he took office.  I hope the Minister will not go up in smoke when I say this because I do not intend to reflect on anybody.  I am sure that the Minister is served by a group of officials who are as dedicated and as hard working as is humanly possible, but he has not the kind of expertise necessary for an energy Minister in this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That became obvious in April this year and in the months thereafter, when we were unique in Europe in having queues at petrol stations and general panic.  At that time no such thing had developed in any other European countries. The Minister's advice was so bad that he blamed the oil companies for hoarding and he accused them of keeping oil up their sleeves in Whitegate when the Department of Finance could <Col N="1304" /> have told him that their excise inspectors were using dipsticks on those tanks every day.</P>
    <P>The information about the resources was available to the Minister if he had lifted the phone.  The oil companies were the villians then, and when anybody spoke a word against that point of view he was accused by the Minister or by Deputy R. Burke, his man friday, of being the darlings of the oil companies.  I was accused of being a darling of an oil company.  I have no shares in oil companies but I have casual acquaintances who are employed in oil companies.</P>

It was put into his mouth by someone, to say that anyone who took a point of view different to that of the Minister was the darling of an oil company.  That was the best his Department could do by way of reply.

I am absolutely in order in commenting on the quality of the Minister's official advice when we are being asked to vote this money.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I interpret the Minister's smile correctly.  The quality of the advice the Minister was getting at the time of the oil shortage which was the product of the Iranian revolution at the beginning of this year, was very bad.  No doubt his officials were doing their best but their best was not good enough and the quality of their advice was so awful that it left the Minister in a situation where he was able to wreck the tourist season and we were in the unique position of having petrol panic from April to July on a scale which existed nowhere else in Europe.  We, out here in the Atlantic usually get the last ripple of a wave but on this occasion the tide first hit us just because of the incompetence of the energy section in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and of the Minister.  There was no way for us to get through that summer except with those panics.  The Minister would not pay the higher price thinking he was striking a brave political posture.</P>

      <P>I put down questions during the year about the number of staff above the very junior level in the energy section in the Minister's Department and those questions elicited the information that there were no more people in that section than there had been three or five years ago.  The section has not expanded and no experts have been seconded to it. The Department does not have what it takes to deal with the energy problem in this day and age.  We saw during the year, absolutely fantastic occurrences which in any other country would have led to the Minister being laughed out of office.</P>

      <P>One thing they have not got is oil.  That is the thing that Deputy O'Kennedy did not know because when he came back to Dublin, the press conference he gave was to the effect that he had very useful talks with the Finnish National Oil Consortium and hoped for oil supplies to follow as a result.  He might as well have been bringing home coconuts as oil from Finland because when Russia cut off their oil supplies in 1973 it nearly wrecked the Finnish economy.  The briefing that man got from the Minister's Department was so poor he did not know it.  That Minister was either too busy or too often abroad&mdash;and he spent too much of his time abroad&mdash;to warn his colleague where he was going and to brief him about it.</P>

      <P>If the House is still sitting I will be back.  This Minister, I presume, is a partial beneficiary of the national pay agreement for which we are being asked to vote £600,000.  Maybe I am wrong in thinking he gets his cheques from that head.  Let me assume for a moment that he does.  If so, let me express my opinion that he spends too much time abroad and allows his curates to look after the shop too much of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay sincere tributes to Deputy Burke for his work as Minister of State in that awful thankless task of getting people to buy Irish.  He is saddled with the political necessity of going through a series of motions which could not possibly have any other outcome than they had in countless previous &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns, namely a very marginal outcome, <Col N="1308" /> even though we all wish it the best.  He was saddled with the task of producing a turnaround of 3 per cent of national expenditure with an attendant growth of 10,000 new jobs, the figure mentioned in the manifesto.  The wretched Deputy Ray Burke has to go from Skreen, County Sligo to Skibbereen day in and day out trying to get people to buy Irish when they cannot buy foreign goods fast enough in consequence of the lead they have been given from the top.  That is an awful job and the Minister of State has done it manfully. I do not withhold that tribute from him.</P>
    <P>He and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn are left far too often in this House answering questions when they come here, which is not very often, and for that the Opposition must take the blame because we ask too many questions.  When questions do come up the Minister is likely to be in Santiago or Sydney or anywhere but here.  The whole point of having assistant Ministers is that they can go around the globe.  Surely the Minister is not so vain as to suppose that in Hong Kong or Yokohama they will be able to tell the difference between himself and Deputy Ray Burke?</P>

      <P>This Minister who carries the responsibility in government and to the people for what happens in his Department should be here minding the shop and let Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn or Deputy Ray Burke go to Yokohama for a change.

      <P>Only if the debate got out of hand and that has not happened here for a while.  It is some time since the former Deputy James Dillon reported that in 1932 he saw an old gentleman at the change of government fitting together a machine gun in a telephone box.  Those days have gone and I hope with every passing event the Civil War will draw more and more to a close.  Those days have gone and we need not come to blows about these matters.</P>
      <P>Since we are being asked to pass a Vote of £600,000 for this Department, it is fair to say that this Minister does not spend enough time in the shop.  He is far too often abroad.  I am not under the illusion that he is sunning himself on the beach.  I know he is not, but he spends too much time abroad doing essentially representative work which could quite easily be done by one of his two subordinates. He should be here minding the shop.  He must know what a difficult and vital shop it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> The insufficient expertise on the energy section is something I criticised before.  Another symptom of the inadequate advice and staffing his Department seem to have, possibly because of the structure, no doubt something inherited from the British, is visible in the fact that the Seán Lemass-type industrial development consortium, this spook of Schoolhouse Lane, not only does not have as far as I have been able to gather a single full-time member, but the Minister has to stop and think before he can tell the Dáil whether it has or not. He does not know.  That is what he told the Dáil two weeks ago.  I can tell him it has not, any more than it has a premises, an address, a letterhead, a telephone number or so much as an office cat. That is the Seán Lemass-type industrial development consortium that was going to get this country moving again.  It is a phantom organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who, during a notional period of the day, are attached to this consortium have to be paid.  There is a curious thing about this consortium. When it was originally announced it consisted of 11 members.  I understand from the Minister's reply to a question that it has divided itself into ten sub-groups. How could you divide 11 men into ten sub-groups and leave any group with anything to discuss?  One would be able to have a conversation and the other nine would be silent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> The Seán Lemass-type industrial development consortium is a joke and it does not require any topping up of levity from me to maintain it in its status as one of the national jokes, and the number is growing all the time.  What is not a joke is the kind of advice the Minister is getting and the fact that the structure he has behind him should be so poverty stricken that they are not able to provide a proper back-up for the tasks which the consortium might have to carry out.  I am not saying there would not be a role for something like an industrial or national development consortium because there may be.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government we were to some extent persuaded, and I was partly persuaded although with misgivings, by the Labour Party notion that there was a role here for a national development consortium or agency which would take up jobs for which private enterprise had no room or which private enterprise could not deal with. That was the idea we had.  I had misgivings about it because I believed, I am sure the Minister shares this view, that if private enterprise will not touch a particular task there must be something in it which is loss-making rather than profit-making. Otherwise they would be in there quickly enough.  I am suspicious about it.  There may be undertakings which would be wealth-creating and employment-creating which a national development consortium or agency could do not so much from the point of view of making profit but of breaking even.  It would not interest a businessman because he would not make a living out of it but on a breakeven basis it would enrich the country and provide employment.  There is room for something like that.  I cannot put my finger at present on particular tasks which it could do but I imagine it is not unthinkable.  That is not what this industrial development consortium is about.  It is not about anything, when I asked questions about it I got a lot of Kildare Street waffle about co-ordinating this and monitoring that, but it does not <Col N="1312" /> boil down to any concrete activity which is not already being carried on by the IDA.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not be sorry to hear that I am coming to a close.  Under the heading of savings the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure, together with the deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid is £15,024,000 but there is an offset of £1,885,000 in savings mainly made up of £900,000 on subhead 13....  Other savings on the voted provision include £140,000 on subhead L&mdash;Technical Assistance; £150,000 on subhead O1&mdash;Shipbuilding subsidy; £114,000 on subhead U&mdash;Energy Conservation;... </P>
    <P>The Minister generously offered to deal with points that anybody raised in his reply and I should be obliged if he would tell the House how it is possible in this year of all years to save on that vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with spending more money on energy conservation and increasing the IIRS vote on its own account?  Why this fiddling around with figures in a year in which it was possible for us to elicit, as we did earlier, that in 1978 the programme which Deputy Peter Barry, as Minister for Transport and Power had inaugurated of publicity for the purpose of energy conservation had been run down to zero? Such things make one wonder if one is living on the moon.  Governments can slip on banana skins but this is incredible. <Col N="1313" /> This Department is not under pressure.  On the contrary it enjoys a more complete consensus of public support in regard to most of its undertakings than any Department.  We are all in favour of price control, consumer protection and energy conservation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are prepared to do is give him a cheer and a clap on the back if he makes a visible effort to get people interested in energy conservation. Although it was a dull uninspiring chapter, as the Minister mentioned, in his Green Paper published in July 1978 the impact which energy conservation has made on our energy demand is invisible. I am sure the Minister will not contest that.  It is so small as not to be palpable. There is no sign in the pattern of life around one or even in official life that it has begun to bite or that there is any serious direction involved.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question last month which was taken by Deputy Burke in the Minister's absence about the programme of energy conservation. It is by no means negligible because the State owns a positive empire of buildings all of which have to be heated and lighted, apart from their fleets of vehicles. I got a lot of flummery from Deputy Burke about this and that.  I asked for concrete instances of how any Department had made a worthwhile saving by following guidelines about temperature control and so on.  He was not able to provide a single instance.  He just said they are all doing it.  That is as good as saying that none of them are doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister talks about energy conservation a lot and I know he realises the importance of it and how a unit saved is one which we need not import and how vital it is to get ahead with this.  How is it <Col N="1314" /> possible to run down to zero an energy conservation publicity programme which Deputy Peter Barry, when Minister, had inaugurated?  It does not make sense and it is a sign of muddled leadership from the Minister and his Department, insufficient expertise&mdash;I cannot blame the people for that because perhaps it found them unawares in 1973&mdash;and insufficient constant monitoring, to use the favourite Civil Service word, of what is going on in the regions of his Department subordinate to him.  That is all I wish to say except to observe to the House that this is St. Nicholas's day, the feastday of Santa Claus and I hope it is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo what Deputy Kelly said about a saving on energy conservation. I note that it has been transferred to the IIRS which has received an additional sum of money. What was originally planned when that money was allocated to a separate subhead? When this money was voted to that purpose one would expect that it would have been spent in that way.  The fact that it was moved to another subhead suggests that there was a change of plan.  One should be told what the reasons were for the change.  How was the remaining £300,000 which stays in the vote for energy conservation, subhead U, spent?  Was the programme that was undertaken under that subhead unsuccessful to the extent that it was decided to cut it and hand the money over to the IIRS to spend instead?  If so we should be told why this happened. The Minister sought to convey that it <Col N="1315" /> was purely an administrative or technical change.  That I might accept if the entire vote for energy conservation was transferred to the IIRS vote.  The fact that a considerable amount of money was spent under subhead U, and a slice of it was taken and transferred somewhere else suggests that there was some change of policy which we should have explained to us.</P>
      <P>The vote for subhead 1.3 for industrial housing was one on which there was a significant saving.  Of £1,000,000 voted little more than £350,000 was spent.  If my recollection is correct there was a saving of a similar magnitude last year.  I am speaking entirely from memory on this.  It is odd that, if that was so, savings of that size should occur.  There should be some explanation as to what is happening in the field of industrial housing. Is there some change of policy?  What is the idea of having IDA grants for industrial housing when the National Building Agency are also involved, as well as the normal local authority programme and the programme of private house building supported by the State through the system of housing grants?</P>
      <P>We have four means by which State moneys are put into housing.  It seems strange, and essentially discriminatory, that because a person works in one particular industry he is offered housing under this subhead whereas if he works in another type of industry, even though he may have to make an equally large displacement of his family arrangements in order to be employed there, he does not qualify.  Is this policy being questioned? Is that why there is such large underspending under industrial housing? We should have a further explanation than has been given in the Minister's introductory statement.</P>
      <P>There has also been a saving in subsidies on ship building.  Is that because fewer ships are being built or are ships being built more competitively so that less subsidy is necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should draw attention to the fact that in the early part of this year when <Col N="1316" /> the Estimate was introduced, £50,000 was provided for the expenses of the Film Board.  Not a penny of that will be spent, because there is no Film Board. We heard from the present Minister&mdash;I heard it loud and clear when I was sitting where he is now&mdash;complaints about delays in the introduction of legislation. He is now hoist on his own petard in that he went to the extent of producing a subhead in an Estimate and obtaining money from the Minister for Finance for a Film Board which should be in existence but which because he has been either less industrious or less successful in getting legislation introduced, does not exist and the money must be handed back.  He owes the House an explanation for that also.</P>
    <P>Of all the Votes this year it is worth noting that the Vote for Industry, Commerce and Energy has had the largest increase&mdash;approximately 37 per cent over last year compared with an increase overall in Government expenditure of about 14 per cent, almost three times as much of an increase.  One wonders if we are getting the value for which one would have hoped.  We should look seriously at the comparative cost of creating jobs in industry.  The cost of creating jobs through the IDA is quite high.  I would think that the cost of preserving jobs in other sectors&mdash;agriculture for instance&mdash;would be considerably less.  It is instructive to compare what has happened to the Industry, Commerce and Energy Vote this year with what occurred in regard to the Vote for Agriculture which has actually been cut&mdash;of all the Votes the only one that has been cut in the entire gamut of Government expenditure.  We are basically an agricultural country.  It is certainly true that expansion in agriculture stopped the flight from the land and there is an obvious necessity to create jobs in the industry.  It seems there is something of a misallocation where there is such a large increase in the Vote for Industry, Commerce and Energy and a cut in the Agriculture Vote in the same year when one would have thought that basically they are both horses in harness pulling the cart in the same direction. <Col N="1317" /> That one should be so well fed and the other so undernourished seems to be a misallocation of resources which deserves comment.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister give some indication of the work of the Irish Productivity Centre, which has an additional sum voted to it of £31,000.  Would the Minister give a report on the work of this body?  It is one which does not impinge very largely on one's consciousness in this House.  I understand it is available to do consultancy work for firms in relation to problems of increasing productivity.  I know that such services are also available from private sources and I should like to hear what distinguishes the work of the Irish Productivity Centre and warrants the considerable expenditure of almost £500,000 on its activities.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to Córas Tráchtála, a very specific point as I am referring to personal experience in the matter.  It concerns the possibility that Córas Tráchtála might consider locating an office in Hong Kong.  I was there early this year and had discussions with people in the Hong Kong Government involved with external trade.  Their market is expanding very rapidly, a market of approximately five million people, but what is more important is that it is a trading crossroads in Asia, where many goods are brought in in raw form and exported in complete form.  It has the headquarters of many firms extending throughout the whole of east Asia.  It would seem to be a very sensible arrangement if Córas Tráchtála were to open an office in Hong Kong.  It would provide access to one of the most dynamic and fast-growing markets in Asia and a place also where they could make contact with other nations which are accustomed to deal with Hong Kong on a broad basis.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to the trade personnel in the Hong Kong Government about their concern with getting goods into the European market they were at pains to say that, while they believe in free trade into Europe for Hong Kong goods, they also believe in free trade into Hong Kong <Col N="1318" /> for European and specifically Irish goods.  They expressed some surprise that Ireland did not have a trade office there.  That was said to me by a member of the Hong Kong Government civil service whom one would not expect to express an opinion of that nature.  Considerable benefit would be derived by this country from the opening of such an office.  It would be a facility to us also in relation to our new Embassy in Peking. It would liaise effectively with Peking. Many of the goods imported to service the Peking Embassy must come through Hong Kong, and if there was some Irish contact in Hong Kong in the form for instance of a Córas Tráchtála delegation it would facilitate the work of the Embassy in Peking which at the moment is quite isolated.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will mention briefly the IDA and the problems that can arise with regard to small industries.  I have had occasion to make representations on behalf of people seeking grants from the IDA for small industries and I feel that the IDA, far from helping some people who are seeking help to set up small industries, are hindering them in every way.</P>
      <P>I will give the example of one specific case to try to explain the situation that can develop.  There is a lady who is making very nice traditional dolls here.  They are expertly done.  She sought a grant from the IDA to set up a small industry because she had done some investigations here and had found that these dolls were being made abroad and sold here.  I sought advice from the IDA about it. They made it very difficult for her application to be considered.  I say this because the IDA have great pride in their grants for small industries but they put every obstacle possible in this lady's way.  They wanted to know projections for ten years.  If one is talking about a small industry one is not in a position to talk about projections for ten years. They said she would have to show evidence of considerable orders for such goods.  One cannot show evidence of orders if one cannot supply them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This lady had some money; she had an accountant to provide some information. The IDA said they were keeping <Col N="1320" /> the situation under observation.  I asked them when they would be able to come forward with some conclusions as to what happened and they said that they were keeping the situation under observation. I could not get that clarified; I could not get them to elaborate on it and the matter went on for almost two years. I consulted the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who took a specific interest in it and looked at every aspect of it and said it had great potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the wrong thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was the wrong thing to do.  He showed great interest and said it had great potential.  It went again to the IDA and again came back the remark that the matter was being kept under observation.  I said that this lady wanted some help with premises, some grant towards setting it up.  The matter went on for over two years without any conclusions being reached.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I wonder if the IDA and their small industries branch are serious about setting up small industries. This was a traditional industry. It could have expanded considerably. The craftsmanship was there and I feel that we should be talking about the craft industries here.  In Denmark they have succeeded in establishing very successful small craft industries.  Unless the IDA show more sympathy and concern for small industries like this they could demoralise many people who have the necessary expertise to set them up.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister discuss matters like these with the IDA and say that it should be the IDA's intention to foster these and encourage and promote them in every way possible?  In this way we can do a lot.  We are lacking in small craft industries here that could be viable, that could be of great interest and concern to the country and they could have a good export market because they would be peculiar to this country.  Denmark has built up a number of these small craft industries and they are very successful. We should be aiming to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Sometimes we are inclined to talk about bringing in multi-national companies and spending millions of pounds by way of grants.  But we are all the time at the mercy of these multi-nationals and if anything happens on the world market, any recession in industry abroad, the industry in Ireland is very vulnerable and that is a dangerous situation to be in.  I recognise the Minister has done trojan work in bringing industry here particularly in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries where there are major projects operating successfully but they are multi-national companies subject to the whims of executives abroad and if anything happens the market internationally we are very vulnerable; it could leave us in a very dangerous situation with the workforce here.  I would be more concerned to talk about the indigenous industries, the ones suited to Ireland.  This small craft industry is one to which the IDA could pay a lot more attention.  I admit that it is very nice to talk in terms of a £10 million industry with perhaps 3,000 workers but many of these are heavily costed; what we are spending per worker can be enormous.  I hope the Minister will give a little more attention to this.</P>

      <P>Since Loughan House came into operation 23 boys have been released from there.  Of these eight were transferred to other special schools, nine were released either to take up employment or to avail of facilities in community hostels and so on, four were released by the courts on appeal and two were convicted of fresh offences and sentenced to St. Patrick's Institution.  (One of these boys was sentenced for his involvement in the two roof incidents last July while the other was sentenced for offences committed while unlawfully at large from Loughan House).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authorities in Loughan House do not follow up the progress of boys once they have been released outright or transferred, so that it is not possible to give details of the present whereabouts of each boy concerned.  It is known, however, that apart from the two sentenced to custody in St. Patrick's Institution <Col N="1165" /> directly from Loughan House four are at present serving sentences in St. Patrick's Institution and one in Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    <P>Boys are released from Loughan House as soon as it is considered that they offer a reasonable prospect of reintegrating into the community.  Some boys may be deemed to need a further period of care in a more open setting before outright release, and in these cases transfers are arranged to other special schools.</P>

      <P>A certificate of tax-free allowance for 1979-80 was issued recently to the person for whom details have been supplied.  The delay which occurred stemmed from the recent postal dispute and is much regretted.</P>
      <P>The person mentioned first applied for the certificate on 8 March 1979, when she called to the Athlone tax office.  As her husband's tax affairs were dealt with in Dublin, it was not possible, owing to the postal strike, to ascertain what balance of tax-free allowances was available for use in connection with her income, until September 1979.  At that stage a large accumulation of arrears had built up in the Athlone tax district in consequence of the strike and the information received from the Dublin office could not be acted on until recently.</P>
      <P>In reply to Question No. 338 on today's Order Paper I have given details of the steps which have been taken to deal with arrears of PAYE work in the Athlone tax office.</P>

      <P>Following the settlement of the postal strike a substantial accumulation of arrears developed in income tax offices throughout the country.  The arrears in certain districts, including Athlone, became particularly acute.</P>
      <P>The following steps have been taken to deal with the situation in the PAYE section of the Athlone office: (a) overtime has been worked since 24 September 1979 and is continuing; (b) as from 13 November 1979, ten heads of staff have been temporarily transferred from other sections of the Athlone office to help in the PAYE section and this number has been increased by a further four as from 26 November 1979; and (c) certain modifications in PAYE procedures have been adopted and the carrying out of certain other work has been deferred to enable the maximum number of staff to be devoted to clearance of the arrears.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that these measures will enable the PAYE arrears to be overtaken early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The method of issuing fuel vouchers is primarily a matter for the local authority or health board concerned <Col N="1169" /> and I have no plans for a general postal delivery.  The methods vary in the different areas where schemes are in operation.</P>
      <P>In Dublin city by far the largest number of vouchers are collected by recipients at post offices or employment exchanges together with their weekly social welfare payments and I do not consider that postal delivery would be of any advantage.  Under the new scheme operated by the Eastern Health Board eligible persons may collect a month's supply of vouchers in advance from the Community Welfare Officer and this arrangement minimises any inconvenience to the persons concerned. Vouchers are posted to recipients living in remote areas or unable to visit the health centre because of illness or infirmity. The board will give sympathetic consideration to any case where difficulty is experienced in calling to the health centre.</P>

      <P>The services administered by my Department which are referred to by the Deputy may be divided into the following categories:</P>
      <P> (a)  short-time claims such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit, and unemployment assistance,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  long-term claims such as the contributory schemes of widow's pension, old age pension, invalidity pension and deserted wives' benefit and the non-contributory schemes of <Col N="1170" /> widow's pension, old age and blind pension and deserted wives' allowance.  </P>
    <P>The time normally taken to process the short-term claims is between one and two weeks provided that the application form, containing all the necessary data, is furnished to my Department at the commencement of the claim.  As pay-related benefit is not payable in respect of the first two weeks payment cannot be made before the expiration of that period.  In the case of unemployment assistance the time scheme can only be met where the applicant is the holder of a qualification certificate at the date of the claim; otherwise it is necessary to investigate the means of the claimant which can take approximately six-eight weeks.</P>
    <P>The time normally taken to process a long-term claim under the contributory schemes is about four weeks.</P>
    <P>In the case of a long-term claim under the non-contributory schemes it is necessary to visit the applicants in their homes to investigate their means before a decision as to entitlement can be made. These inquiries normally take about six-eight weeks but in the case of blind pension, where medical examination is necessary, the time taken in finalising the claim can be longer.</P>
    <P>It is not always possible to process claims for deserted wives' benefit and allowance within the times set out above as the inquiries as to desertion in these cases can be more prolonged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following an inquiry into the operation of the means tests applied by <Col N="1171" /> my Department the following measures were taken from April 1979 with a view to removing anomalies:</P>
      <P> (1)  There was an increase from £25 in the case of claimants for old age non-contributory pension and from £100 in the case of widow's non-contributory pension, to a uniform £200 in the amount of capital which is not assessed as means of such claimants.</P>
      <P>(2)  Prior to April 1979 widow non-contributory pensioners had to surrender their pension when they reached age 66 and to apply for old age non-contributory pension.  Where means were derived mainly from capital this could have resulted in a reduction in the amount of pension payable as compared with the widow's pension previously paid.  Widows now retain their non-contributory pension after age 66 thus preventing a reduction in pension at that age.</P>
      <P>(3)  The unearned income of children up to £26 yearly for one child and £52 yearly for two or more children which was assessed against a widow in the calculation of her means for pension purposes was not made in the case of old age non-contributory pensions or unemployment assistance. The anomaly was removed by disregarding all the unearned income of a child or children of a widow when assessing her means.  Deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives also benefited under this adjustment.</P>
      <P>(4)  Under a widow's, old age and blind pensions schemes a certain part of an applicant's earnings was not regarded as means if he or she had qualified children.  The amount of the disregard was £78 in the case of widows, £39 in the case of old age pensioners and £104 in the case of blind persons.  This anomaly was removed by increasing the disregard to £104 in all cases.  It also extended to deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> (5)  &ldquo;Earnings&rdquo; are defined for widow's pension purposes as being &ldquo;derived from personal exertions&rdquo; and were defined for old age pension purposes as &ldquo;from employment under a contract of service&rdquo;.  This anomaly was removed by adopting the first definition in all cases thus ensuring that, where there are qualified children, earnings from small farms and other types of self-employment up to £104 a year are not reckoned as means under the old age pension scheme. </P>
    <P>(6)  A pensioner whose means include a pension payable under statute or by another Government may not have his or her non-contributory pension reduced by more than the amount of any increase granted in the other pension.  In the interests of equity this provision was extended to cover occupational and other pensions not already covered.</P>
    <P>(7)  The tables of means limits and corresponding reduced rates of pension formerly provided for stages of £1.40 between rates.  Cases arose, therefore, in which applicants for non-contributory old age pension, widow's pension, deserted wife's allowance, unmarried mother's allowance, single woman's allowance, or prisoner's wife's allowance had their pension or allowance reduced by £1.40 a week where their means increased by £1 a week.  As a step towards achieving the position that the pension or allowance will not be reduced by more than £1 a week for each £1 a week increase in means above the level at which maximum assistance is payable, stages of £1.30 between rates were provided as from April 1979.  This benefited those in receipt of non-contributory pension or the other specifed allowances at less than the maximum rates.</P>
    <P>(8)  Dwelling houses and farm buildings had been assessable as means in the case of applicants for means-tested pensions and allowances on the basis of the rateable valuation less ground rent or mortgage interest.  Provision was made to disregard the value of such premises in reckoning means. </P>

      <P>Such a cost can be measured in different ways.  What seems to be the best way of calculating a current figure is to include an appropriate proportion of the Estimate for the total Prison Vote and to add a figure for the estimated cost, which is borne on other Votes, of the welfare service for the particular prison and of the teaching staff.  No expenditure on capital expenditure is included.  On that basis the current annual cost per prisoner is approximately £8,100.</P>

      <P>Loughan House accommodates a maximum of 25 boys at present.  Taking all current expenditure into account&mdash;that is, the cost of the high level of staffing, victualling etc. but not capital costs&mdash;the expenditure per boy works out at about £24,000 per annum.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> Part of the building is being used to accommodate staff pending the completion of new separate staff quarters.  When the staff move out the building will be able to accommodate a maximum of 46 boys.  Additional boys would not necessarily call for a proportionate increase in staffing, so that the annual cost per boy should reduce as their number increases.</P>

      <P>While the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the Community and of Political Co-operation continues until the end of this month I believe that we can be seen to have discharged efficiently the tasks entrusted to us and to have succeeded in overcoming serious obstacles to the conclusion of Community work in areas of major importance. The Presidency has sought to ensure that the Community were united and consistent in their efforts to tackle the major problems facing them.  I know that the Deputy appreciates that many matters are still being pursued in the normal course of Community activity.  I can tell him that areas where progress can be reported to date in both Community and <Col N="1175" /> Political Co-operation frameworks are as follows:</P>
      <P> (1)  <i>European Council</i></P>
      <P>A meeting of the European Council was held in Dublin on 29-30 November and the Taoiseach reported to the Dáil on 4 December on the outcome of this meeting.</P>
      <P>(2)  <i>Inauguration of Directly Elected Parliament</i></P>
      <P>The concern of the Presidency was to establish and maintain good relations with the Parliament and this has been successfully done so far.  On the suggestion of their President, the Council (Foreign Affairs) agreed to study the operation of existing procedures governing the relationship between the Council and the European Parliament and to examine whether any improvements to these procedures could be introduced. Work is currently proceeding on this matter.</P>
      <P>(3)  <i>Lomé Convention</i></P>
      <P>One of the major accomplishments of the Irish Presidency has been the final negotiations and signature of the second Lomé Convention in Lomé, Togo, on 31 October 1979.</P>
      <P>(4)  <i>Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN)</i></P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency was happy to play its part in preparing the conditions for and in presiding over the approval by the Community of a package of measures which, it is generally acknowledged, will play a major part in shaping international trading relations in the nineteen-eighties.</P>
      <P>(5)  <i>Enlargement</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Presidency has succeeded in maintaining a satisfactory rhythm of work in the negotiations for the accession of Spain and Portugal.  A further negotiating session at ministerial level is foreseen for 18 December.  The Bill for the ratification by Ireland of the Instruments of Accession of the Hellenic <Col N="1176" /> Republic to the European Communities was recently passed by both Dáil and Seanad.  This will enable Ireland to be among the first of the member states to complete the ratification process.</P>
    <P>(6)  <i>Portugal</i></P>
    <P>The Community concluded a supplementary Protocol with Portugal revising the terms of the 1972 Trade Agreement between the two parties.</P>
    <P>(7)  <i>Relations with Mediterranean Countries</i></P>
    <P>Relations with Yugoslavia, Turkey and Cyprus have been developed satisfactorily during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>(8)  <i>Community-ASEAN Relations</i></P>
    <P>Negotiations between the Community and the ASEAN countries on a co-operation agreement have been concluded.</P>
    <P>(9)  <i>Vietnamese Refugee Problem</i></P>
    <P>At the UN meeting in Geneva in July on the Indochinese refugee problem, which came about partly as a result of an initiative by the Nine, Ireland, as Presidency, undertook close coordination of the positions of the Nine. The Community and the member states have since implemented programmes to relieve the refugee problem through financial aid to the UN High Commission for refugees and acceptance of substantial numbers of refugees for resettlement.</P>
    <P>(10)  <i>Aid to Cambodia</i></P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs on 29 October agreed on measures amounting to $35 million in emergency aid to Cambodia.  The impetus for this decision came from the informal discussion at Ashford Castle.</P>
    <P>(11)  <i>Energy</i></P>
    <P>Energy has been one of the major preoccupations of the Irish Presidency. The principal task of the Presidency has been to steer the implementation of the Tokyo Summit conclusions, particularly those related to the adoption of national oil import targets for 1985.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> (12)  <i>Resarch and Development</i></P>
    <P>The first Research and Development Council in four years was convened by the Irish Presidency and agreement was reached on programmes for recycling urban and industrial waste and the management and storage of radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>(13)  <i>Environment</i></P>
    <P>Two major conventions on the Environment have been concluded and signed during Ireland's Presidency&mdash;</P>
    <P> (1)  the Convention on the Conservation of Wild Life and National Habitats.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution.  </P>
    <P>(14)  <i>Unemployment</i></P>
    <P>The Community took a significant step in the fight to reduce unemployment in the Community by agreeing a resolution on the reorganisation of working time.</P>
    <P>(15)  <i>Agriculture</i></P>
    <P> (a)  On the question of establishing a balance in the market for wine the Council have been examining a wide range of measures and agreement in principle has been achieved in a number of key areas.</P>
    <P>(b)  Areas of disagreement have been narrowed on the Commission proposal for a common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and the Presidency is hopeful of further advances at the December Council.</P>
    <P>(c)  Progress has also been made in protracted discussion on a common organisation of the market for potatoes and the Presidency hopes to achieve agreement at least on broad principles before the end of the year.  </P>
    <P>(16)  <i>Fisheries</i></P>
    <P>On the initiative of the Presidency a high level working group were set up to try to find agreement on total allowable catches and quotas.  Good progress is being made in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> (17)  <i>Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade</i></P>
    <P>Agreement was reached in October 1979 on a proposal for an amending directive which specifies the volumes which must be observed in the packaging of a wide range of beverages.</P>

    <P>Following is a summary of the main issues on which the Nine consulted and co-ordinated their policies in this framework:</P>
    <P>(18)  <i>The Middle East</i></P>
    <P>The Middle East remains an area of tension that is of concern to the Nine.  It is hoped that discussions among the states in the area will move in the direction of a comprehensive settlement in which all parties involved, including the representatives of the Palestinian people, would participate and which the international Community could endorse.</P>
    <P>Following their meeting in Dublin on 11 September 1979, the Foreign Ministers of the Nine issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and calling on all parties to assist the UNIFIL operation and respect the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>(19)  <i>Iran</i></P>
    <P>The grave situation in Iran following the occupation of the US Embassy and the holding of their staff as hostage has been kept under constant review.  At their meeting in Brussels the Foreign Ministers condemned this violation of international law and called for the release of the hostages.  The European Council at their meeting in Dublin on 29-30 November, reiterated this condemnation and again called for immediate action from the Iranian Government to ensure the release and safety of the hostages.</P>
    <P>(20)  <i>Euro-Arab Dialogue</i></P>
    <P>Following the agreement by Ministers of the Nine in Brussels on 20 November, representatives of the Presidency and the Commission made contact with the <Col N="1179" /> Secretary-General of the Arab League in Tunis, on 4 December, with a view to effecting a resumption of work already undertaken, at the technical level, of the dialogue.</P>
    <P>(21)  <i>Africa</i></P>
    <P>With regard to Africa, during the Irish Presidency there has been continued support by the Nine for peaceful and just solutions, through negotiated settlements, for both Namibia and Zimabwe.</P>
    <P>(22)  <i>UN</i></P>
    <P>In preparation for the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly, as Presidency we continued the practice of seeking to concert the views of the Nine and of adopting common voting positions wherever possible.  This process is of course continuing during the session which lasts usually until late December, and common statements on an increasing number of issues are being made by the Presidency on behalf of the Nine. The effectiveness of the Nine co-operation in the United Nations has grown steadily over the years.</P>
    <P>(23)  <i>Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)</i></P>
    <P>During the period of the Irish Presidency the Nine have intensified their preparations for the next Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE) follow-up meeting which will open in Madrid in November 1980. They have been defining their positions on all the substantive and procedural issues connected with the meeting in the light of their concern to take advantage of all the possibilities of the Helsinki Final Act while at the same time preserving its balance and integrity.</P>
    <P>(24)  <i>Agreement concerning the Application of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism among the member states of the European Communities</i></P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>At a meeting of Ministers for Justice of the Nine member states of the European Communities held in Dublin on 4 <Col N="1180" /> December this agreement was opened for signature and was signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of all the member states.</P>

Nevertheless the Presidency is seeking to achieve maximum progress in the consideration of the draft Second Programme, which would be a central item at such a council.  Consideration by the council cannot be concluded until the opinions of the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee are given.  The opinion of the Economic and Social Committee has still to go through Plenary Session while the opinion of the European Parliament is not expected to be available at least until after its public hearings on the Second Programme in Dublin in January.</P>

      <P>It is proposed, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to reply to Questions No. 358 and 359 together.</P>
      <P>The concentration of lead in the atmosphere is monitored by Dublin Corporation at O'Connell Street, Dame Street and Kilbarrack.  The monitoring results indicate that the levels of atmospheric lead concentrations on a mean annual 24 hour basis at both the O'Connell Street and Dame Street stations, which are located in heavily trafficked areas, are below the level of two micrograms per cubic metre which is the limit value prescribed in the proposed EEC Council Directive on air quality standards for lead to help protect human health against the effects of lead in the environment.  The atmospheric lead concentrations measured at the Kilbarrack monitoring station, which is in a residential area, are also below the proposed EEC limit value.  My Department are at present actively engaged in discussing the proposed directive at EEC Environment Council level.</P>
      <P>The emission of lead into the environment from all sources is not monitored. It is estimated, however, that during 1978 about 620 tonnes of lead were emitted from petrol driven engines in Ireland based on the estimated consumption of petrol and its lead content.</P>
      <P>The results of monitoring carried out by the Department of Health in implementation of the EEC Directive on biological standards for lead and the screening of the population for lead indicate that the blood lead levels of the population groups tested are below the levels prescribed in the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any evidence that <Col N="1183" /> lead in air in this country has reached or is likely to reach a level which would justify concern in relation to public health.  Accordingly, no research is being undertaken by any Department in regard to dangers posed by emissions of lead to the atmosphere.  I am aware, however, of studies which have been carried out elsewhere and of studies currently in progress in the UK which are expected to be completed soon.  My Department keep in touch with such research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a Question on 10 May 1979, article 7 of the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning the lead content of petrol provides that petrol with a lead content not exceeding 0.64 grammes per litre may be placed on the market in Ireland for a period of five years from 1 January 1981, whereas in the other member states the maximum permitted lead content of petrol placed on the market from 1 January 1981 will be 0.40 grammes per litre.  The derogation in favour of Ireland was sought because the large investment which would have been required to enable the Whitegate refinery to produce petrol with a lead content conforming with the directive would have placed the continued operation of the refinery in jeopardy.  In addition, imports of crude oil would have had to be increased to produce petrol with a lower lead content and there would also be an increase in petrol consumption, estimated at 10 per cent.  The petrol refined at Whitegate represented about 55 per cent of the total consumption of petrol in Ireland in 1978. The remaining 45 per cent was imported from the other member states which will <Col N="1184" /> be obliged to comply fully with the directive.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 363 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to previous questions from the Deputy, it was my original expectation that building work on the new school at Carrigaline would have commenced during the summer of 1979 and that the school would be ready for occupation in September 1980.</P>
      <P>Difficulties which subsequently arose in connection with the site and the level of the tenders received precluded the placings of a contract by the date originally envisaged.  I have recently had discussions with a representative deputation from the area and it has been agreed that the opening date for the school should be September 1981.</P>
