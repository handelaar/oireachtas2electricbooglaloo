      <P>The recently announced reorganisation of the Defence Forces which provides, <i>inter alia</i> for the separate development of the Permanent Defence Force and An Foras Cosanta Áitiúil will not affect the arrangements whereby FCA personnel may volunteer for full-time duty with a permanent Defence Force unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the plans, if any, to purchase high-speed in-shore craft for fishery protection; and the details of any such plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is a widely held expert opinion that one of the best ways in which to preserve our salmon stocks would be to purchase this kind of vessel rather than spending resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asks if the Minister has plans and the Deputy is now proceeding to discuss the merits or demerits of doing it.  This is a stratagem about which the Chair must be careful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that question and the other supplementaries posed by the Deputy, I should like to inform him that salmon fishery protection is not the primary or direct concern of my Department. As the Deputy knows, at present the Naval Service provide assistance to the Boards of Conservators and to the Garda Síochána in the enforcement of salmon fishing regulations.  Therefore, in the first place, it would be a matter for the Boards of Conservators to acquire such vessels if they thought them necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the number of miles per gallon of fuel that will be obtained from the Hawker Siddeley 125 executive jet to be leased or purchased on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a previous question in the House, a contract has been signed with British Aerospace for the supply of a Hawker Siddeley 125 Series 700 aircraft for delivery in December 1979.  Pending delivery of the new aircraft a Hawker Siddeley 125 Series 600 aircraft has been leased from British Aerospace.</P>
      <P>Aircraft fuel consumption is normally calculated in lbs. per hour.  At economic cruising speed the 600 series aircraft consumes 2,000 lbs. or 256 gallons per hour.  At the same speed the 700 series aircraft consumes 1,200 lbs. or 154 gallons per hour.  Translating this data to miles per gallon would produce 1.8 and 3.01 respectively.</P>
      <P>These are, of course, but indications of the fuel consumption of the aircraft as the rate will vary depending on payload, weather conditions, distance of a particular flight, air traffic control requirements and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures I have already quoted <Col N="2586" /> would produce passenger miles per gallon of 19.8 and 33.11 respectively at the standard passenger configuration of 8 passengers and 3 crew.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made any special arrangements to ensure that he will get a continuous supply of fuel for the aircraft in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made, and will continue to be made, for the supply of necessary fuel, not just for this aircraft but for the Defence Forces in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is that the question tabled is in regard to the establishment of regional high courts.  This matter was raised in the Dáil 12 months ago.  The Minister's response was that if and when the free legal aid people make a submission to him he will consider it.  I want to establish a point clearly from the Minister: is it a fact that he has not, after two years in office, considered at all the possibility of establishing regional high courts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the proposals, if any, to increase the numbers of personnel in the vice squad and the number of female staff approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;vice squad&rdquo; is usually, though not officially, used to refer to a Garda unit dealing primarily and on a full-time basis with problems relating to prostitution and I assume that the question is intended to be interpreted accordingly.</P>
      <P>The only part of the State in which such a unit is in operation is the Dublin Metropolitan Area, although of course all members of the force pay attention, as required, to those problems.  The strength of the unit in Dublin is determined by the Garda authorities and it is temporarily augmented at intervals, as and when the need arises.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they do not propose at present to effect any increase in the permanent strength.  There are no ban-ghardaí assigned full-time to the unit, but ban-ghardaí do of course assist the unit from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the reported growth of the form of crime with which this squad would normally be dealing and of the fact that it is a problem on which ban-ghardaí could be employed usefully full-time, has the Minister any proposals to recommend to the Garda Commissioner or to bring to his attention the need for any changes, particularly with regard to an increase in staff or any increase in the number of ban-ghardaí who may be employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the full-time membership of the squad at present is sufficient at the level at which it is.  I <Col N="2589" /> refer the Deputy to the part of my answer where I stated that at times, when it is thought necessary by the Garda authorities to augment the full-time squad, then they do so.  If banghardaí are required they too are considered by the commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it unusual that a squad dealing almost exclusively with women apparently is staffed full-time exclusively by men?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in saying that this problem is not alone in Dublin and that the squad are centred in Dublin only, but it is a normal part in ordinary police duty or police training to deal with this problem wherever it might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>If all police are trained in this duty and there is no special training for performing this duty, why have a vice squad at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the problem in Dublin, due to the size of the population, is more serious than in any other part of the country.  The Garda authorities believe that a small number of persons such as the personnel forming the vice squad are necessary to deal with the problem where it is greatest.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that they can deal with the problem in other centres wherever it might arise in the course of ordinary police duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will arrange to have the case of a member of the Garda force who was dismissed (details supplied) reinvestigated and if there is any possibility of reinstatement of the said Garda officer; in default of such reinstatement the steps that were taken to pay any gratuity or pension to the said Garda officer who had over ten years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the commissioner that, in accordance with the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Retirement) Regulations, 1934, he ordered the retirement of the member referred to on grounds of incapacity for the performance of his duty.  In case the member were by some means identifiable, I should say for the record it was an incapacity with a medical background.  The question of reinstatement could not arise at all unless it were shown that the incapacity no longer existed and, without implying that he would be likely to be reinstated even if there were a change, the commissioner is not aware that there is in fact any change.</P>
      <P>With regard to the steps taken to pay pension and gratuity, I am informed by the commissioner that the case was not reported earlier to my Department for superannuation purposes because there were issues which the Garda authorities were anxious to have clarified in the interests of the member so as to enable the maximum amount of his service to be reckoned for superannuation purposes. He was given oral advice in the matter but so far he has not followed the advice. Arrangements are now being made to authorise payment of superannuation benefits on the basis of the documented details already available.</P>

      <P>He was appointed in 1968.  The Garda surgeon examined the member on 18 December 1978 and certified that he was so incapacitated by infirmity that he was unable to perform his duties.  I have not the information here, but I gather that it would have been within a very short time of 18 December 1978.  I have not got the answer, but I would think that it would have been immediately after the surgeon certifying the illness in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the term of office of the last Government the then Attorney General put out a fairly detailed discussion paper containing some provisional recommendations on nullity law.  Some of the proposals led to so much criticism that when Deputy Kelly became Attorney General he decided to refer the whole matter to the Law Reform Commission.  That decision was made shortly before the change of Government and it was endorsed by the present Attorney General when he took office.  Apart from the fact that the Law Reform Commission are an independent body set up by statute we must bear in mind it was precisely because this matter turned out to be so complex that it was referred to the commission for thorough examination.  I hope the commission will be able to make their recommendations soon but when they are asked to deal with something that has been found to be very complex it would be particularly unfair of me to say anything that would suggest that they were unduly delaying the matter.  The members of the commission obviously are aware of the structural problems that can arise&mdash;after all these are the people who are dealing with the problems&mdash;and I have no doubt that they are as anxious as anybody else to have it dealt with as soon as possible.  It is even more important that it should be dealt with properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the continued proliferation of gaming machines in places of entertainment with severe detrimental effects on young persons; and the encouragement of gambling generally; and if he will take immediate action on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware and I have no function in the matter if it is licensed amusement halls that the Deputy has in mind when he refers to &ldquo;places of entertainment&rdquo;.  The granting of licences to such establishments is controlled by the courts who have power to impose limits on the numbers of such machines in any particular premises.</P>
      <P>If, however, the Deputy has in mind gaming machines on premises which are not licensed amusement halls, that is another matter.  Some time ago the Garda received complaints about the operation of these machines in premises not licensed for the purposes of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.  As a result, the Commissioner issued fresh instructions to each Garda station about the enforcement of the law in regard to the presence of these machines in pubs, clubs, hotels, fish-and-chip shops and other such areas.  I may say that the Garda have my full support in their efforts to eliminate abuses in this matter.</P>
      <P>For the record, there were 86 prosecutions for breaches of the Gaming and Lotteries Act during the first five months of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are only a small number of people who supply those machines would the Minister consider having the Garda Commissioner or his Department insisting on the suppliers forwarding to his Department or the Garda a list of the people to whom they have supplied those machines?  This would ensure, rather than having a proliferation of those machines all over the place, which people have to spend a lot of time chasing up, the Minister getting a centralised list at the distribution point which might help in relation to pursuing complaints about no licences and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on pool tables, which have been a problem in certain development areas, and other machines which may not come under the heading of gaming machines but are certainly creating a problem which leaves the Garda possibly without the muscle to deal with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is aware of the concern felt at the abuse of under age drinking.  Would he consider amending the law in relation to drinking to perhaps prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor especially on sale in supermarkets? <Col N="2599" /> I realise the owners of those supermarkets do their best to control it but it is very difficult for a check-out girl to check what a young person is buying especially during rush hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, that particular aspect of the licensing laws has been raised in the House on a number of occasions.  The licensing laws are presently being examined in my Department to see what changes are necessary.  I cannot say to the Deputy when it is likely that I will be in a position to come before the House with any amending legislation.  I appreciate the seriousness of the matter and I have certainly sympathy for the families whose children get drink where they should not get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the white belt and torch equipment of gardaí doing road traffic duty at night is adequate in view of the danger from traffic involved; and the plans, if any, to provide extra equipment in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The white belt and torch referred to in the question are issued to all gardaí on ordinary patrol duties but those doing road traffic duty at night have other aids available to them.  All Garda patrol cars are supplied with fluorescent jackets, flashing beacons, big beam lamps and reflectorised triangles.  Additional equipment is available to members of the force operating check-points.</P>
      <P>Of course it may happen from time to time that a member doing ordinary patrol duty may also have to become involved in some road traffic duty as, for instance, where there is a traffic accident, but the Garda authorities consider that the equipment they have is reasonable for protection purposes on such occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Would the Minister bring to the attention of the Commissioner that quite a number of gardaí seems to be doing road traffic checks such as registration, licences, tyres and so on while they do not wear the fluorescent jacket made available?  In many instances those gardaí, particularly late at night when they are in the centre of the road with their backs to oncoming traffic, are likely to be killed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The Constitution provides that all judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  Under our legal system, the arrangement is that the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  The law enables the judge to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence, assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 makes provision for meetings of district justices to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergences in the exercise of their jurisdiction.  While there is no similar <Col N="2601" /> provision in the case of the other courts, I am aware that over the last few years the chief justice has convened regional conferences of judges to discuss the administration of justice.  The holding of such regional conferences was recommended in the Twelfth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  I am satisfied that such meetings are a better means of achieving greater uniformity in sentences than any intervention by the Executive, which could have very undesirable consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that reply and realise how restricted the Minister is in taking action in this regard but would he consider that there is cause for concern when a charge of murder which was reduced later to manslaughter was awarded with a one year sentence, a case of rape was awarded by a two year sentence, but where a case of robbery involving a sum of £57, in which there was only slight violence, was awarded with a three-and-a-half year sentence and when the accused did not have any previous conviction from the time of reaching manhood?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Both questions are related.  Would the Minister agree that there is cause for concern concerning the question of discrimination against people from the sort of area I represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that meetings take place at district justice level for the purpose of avoiding any undue divirgence among district justices in the exercise of their jurisdiction.  In recent years the chief justice has convened meetings in other areas.  This procedure is regarded as satisfactory.  As I have said, if these approaches are successful, it is best that that situation continue rather than to have interference by any government or by any Minister for Justice.</P>

    <P>17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of a recent interview by a BBC 1 staff reporter of an alleged member of a terrorist organisation (details supplied); if the Irish security forces were aware of the arrangements for the interview; the action the Government have taken on this matter and if he will make a statement on the allegations in this interview concerning the assassination of the late Mr. Airey Neave and the method of collection <Col N="2606" /> of funds by this organisation in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that such an interview was broadcast on a BBC television programme on 5 July.  I am informed by the Garda Síochána that they were not aware of the arrangements for this interview&mdash;indeed it is scarcely conceivable that they could become aware of such a thing in advance unless somebody were to give them a tip-off.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy possibly may be aware, there was nothing new in the interview in relation to the murder of Mr. Airey Neave.  The organisation calling themselves the Irish National Liberation Army had already claimed in a statement published in the press that they were the organisation responsible for the murder and it was widely accepted that that was the position.  Certainly the Garda authorities do not doubt it and, moreover, the Garda say that there is good reason to believe that the primary source of revenue of that organisation comes from the proceeds of armed bank robberies.</P>
      <P>One of the many problems that arise in relation to a programme of this kind is the impression it is liable to give that members of paramilitary organisations are walking about openly in Dublin, or elsewhere in the State, plotting murders and other crimes of violence in Northern Ireland or, as in this case, England.  The reality is that the organisation in question just like the provisional IRA are an organisation that exist in the North as well as here, and that members&mdash;by which I mean known members&mdash;of both organisations are walking about openly and freely in Northern Ireland, as indeed they are at times in this State, the explanation in both cases being that the evidence is not available to convict them in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is no quick or easy solution to the problems posed by these organisations, which exist and operate both north and south of the Border.  In so far as the position in this State is concerned, control of paramilitary activities will depend in part on the work of the Garda and in part on attitudes in the community.  The Garda <Col N="2607" /> Síochána must, and I am certain will in fact, keep up the long hard grind of doing everything they lawfully can do to hamper paramilitary activities and to make detections when crimes are committed. So far as community attitudes are concerned, it is a matter of all of us maintaining a clear undeviating attitude that there is no place for and no condoning of these activities.</P>

      <P>Does he consider it appropriate that this should be done in view of the fact that a British citizen came to Dublin and consorted with a terrorist, did not contact the security forces here, and interviewed this person who professed to have murdered a citizen of another country and also professed to be engaged in bank robberies, although admittedly it was expressed more elegantly?  In that context, does the Minister not think we should contact the British Government and advise them that we do not wish to have British citizens acting in that manner in Dublin?</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs when it comes to lodging complaints with other Governments on matters such as this.  I can only give a personal opinion.  I certainly do not approve of what happened. It was wrong, and it was extremely dangerous.  It could have sparked off a reaction from the Unionists in the North who could come down here and create terrible trouble.  It was extremely inflamatory. <Col N="2608" /> It was reckless and careless. That is a personal opinion.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think it odd that foreigners can come here, seek out and interview a person such as the person interviewed?  Is there not something lacking in the security net when this can be done, and our police force cannot seek out the same information and get the people who have been interviewed?  In view of the fact that the BBC authorities have made their information available to Scotland Yard, will the Minister be seeking this information from Scotland Yard, or is it his intention to interview the BBC personnel and get the information from them?</P>

      <P>To deal with the first part of the Deputy's question, it is an extremely difficult one to answer, in that I do not think any of us would want a situation in which foreign journalists, whether they be newspaper or television people, coming into this country should be screened by our security forces.  I do not think anybody would want that for a start.  Secondly, with regard to the BBC being able to seek out these persons and the Garda not, perhaps we could look at that in another way.  Very often persons such as the INLA representative seek out the media for their own propaganda purposes and therefore the BBC might not have any difficulty in making contact with them.  It is a completely different matter for the Garda to meet these people and for them to talk as freely to the Garda, or any other police force in any other country.</P>

In view of the fact that the BBC seem to be co-operating with the authorities, and allegedly made it clear that they would not feel obliged to withhold any information, will the Minister adopt the normal procedure and send members of the Garda to interview the people concerned and get the necessary information with a view to tracking down the person concerned?</P>

I know the Garda authorities have been in touch with the British police force in connection with this matter.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot reveal what has gone on between the two police forces.  I know the Garda and the British police force are very anxious to deal with the situation as best they possibly can.  I am not familiar with what appeared in the statement on behalf of the BBC that all the information at their disposal would be made available to the British police force.  I did not see that statement.  I accept that it was made.  From our point of view, the Garda have been in touch with the British police in an effort to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, this matter has already been discussed in the House on several occasions over the past few days.</P>
      <P>In the light of these discussions, I feel it would be useful, at the outset of this reply, to recall some basic facts about the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  UNIFIL was established by decision of the UN Security Council in March 1978 with the aim of ensuring Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon and restoring the authority of the Lebanese Government in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The force is under the command of <Col N="2610" /> the United Nations and carries out its peace-keeping mandate under the overall direction of the UN Secretary-General, Dr. Waldheim.  In response to a request from the Secretary-General, the Government, with the approval of the Dáil, agreed to contribute a contingent to this force even though we had no direct interest or involvement in the area.  We felt that by so doing we were giving practical expression to our commitment to international peace and security.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL has had great difficulty in carrying out its mandate.  It has been unable to establish control over a strip of territory just north of the border with Israel, which the Israelis handed over to the <i>de facto</i> forces of Major Haddad when they withdrew from Southern Lebanon.  In addition the force has been subject to continual harassment from the <i>de facto</i> forces which Israel continues to support.</P>
    <P>The United Nations, under whose responsibility the force operates, constantly uses its best efforts to reduce this harassment and it has engaged in intensive diplomatic activity on the occasions when the level of harassment increased. We have helped and supported the United Nations in these efforts and it is in this context, and in the interests of our troops, that I wrote to the Israeli Foreign Minister in January of this year and the Taoiseach wrote to Prime Minister Begin in April.  Following these representations, the level of harassment of our troops lessened somewhat.</P>
    <P>We have also, along with other troop contributors, on several occasions made formal representations to the Israeli authorities through our Permanent Mission in New York.  In addition we have ourselves been in frequent contact with Israel and we have pressed it very strongly on this matter both directly and through other friendly Governments such as that of the United States which are in a position to influence it.  I believe that the pressure which we bring to bear through these continuing contacts has helped to reduce the risks faced by UNIFIL, but that is not to say that we are satisfied with the Israeli response to the constant representations I have referred to.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, wholly unacceptable <Col N="2611" /> that there should be interference from any quarter with a United Nations Peace-keeping Force.  In order to make quite clear publicly that we deplore the continual harassment to which UNIFIL is subjected, I instructed our Permanent Representative to the United Nations to request to speak in the Security Council on 14 June last when the mandate of the force was being renewed for a further six months.</P>
    <P>On that occasion our Permanent Representative made it quite plain that we condemn any harassment of UNIFIL from whatever quarter, and that we are seriously concerned at the dangers which such harassment poses for our troops on this peace-keeping mission. Indeed, in the same debate the Secretary-General referred in particular to the harassment to which UNIFIL is subject as a major obstacle to further progress and pointed out that, if the situation of UNIFIL did not improve, it might become necessary to consider the withdrawal of the force despite all the dangers this would entail for the region and for peace in the Middle East area as a whole.</P>
    <P>Despite all difficulties, however, it remains the view of the Secretary-General that UNIFIL is performing an indispensable function in Southern Lebanon and has done a great deal to reduce the threat to international peace and security.  The Government share this view of the Secretary-General and we shall continue to assist him through all channels open to us in his efforts to reduce the risks faced by the force and to enable it to carry out its mandate successfully.</P>
    <P>It will never, of course, be possible to give an absolute guarantee of the safety of our troops in any peace-keeping operation or in this very difficult situation in one of the world's major trouble spots.  I am satisfied that the Government and the United Nations are doing everything open to them both directly and indirectly to ensure conditions under which the force can operate effectively.  I am sure this House will join with me in paying tribute to the way the officers and men of our Defence Forces who have volunteered for this duty have been <Col N="2612" /> carrying out their difficult and hazardous assignment on behalf of the world community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as I mentioned, an assurance from Prime Minister Begin in a direct letter to the Taoiseach that he would instruct his forces to ensure that there was no direct harassment of or firing on our troops, and advise the Christian forces as well.  That was an assurance. The Deputy will also have noticed in my reply that I referred to an assurance given in the UN Security Council debate.  There were those, and many other assurances.</P>

I can only rely on the professional assessment.  I have indicated to-day that I am not satisfied.  We have not been satisfied and we are not satisfied that the Israelis are behaving in a manner <Col N="2613" /> which would enable the UN troops, of which ours are a contingent, to implement their mandate.</P>

On that basis we make our representations in support of the UN.  On this occasion we have taken the extra steps, which is not usual, of making direct representations in support of the UN to Israel and to the US.  We have continued to ask both countries to use their influence in their appropriate ways to ensure that the harassment will not continue.</P>

      <P>While welcoming the marked change of tone in his remarks in comparision with last week, in the light of the assurances received from the Israeli Government that their forces would not intervene in the UN controlled territory, what action does the Minister propose to take in view of the fact that they did raid into the Irish zone about a week ago?  Has a further protest been made and has the Israeli Prime Minister been asked what value his assurances have if his forces pay no attention to what he apparently instructs them to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made protests and we have sought further <Col N="2614" /> guarantees that it will not be repeated. We have been in contact at every level. In regard to the Deputy's remarks about the change of tone in my remarks, it might be helpful to remind the Deputy that on the previous occasion, as the record shows, perhaps unwittingly, he stated that it was my responsibility to ensure the safety of the troops.  When the Deputy makes a mistake in a suggestion of that nature he should understand that I might tend to respond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>Ireland recognises the states of Uganda, Iran and China.  As regards relations with the Governments of Uganda and Iran, I would refer the Deputy to Question No. 23 of 8 March and Question No. 6 of 10 May.

In accordance with decisions of the Security Council, the Government do not extend recognition to the Salisbury regime.  As regards Namibia, Ireland recognises the special responsibility of the United Nations for Namibia, following the termination by the General Assembly in 1966 of South Africa's mandate over the territory, a decision which Ireland supported.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe is no doubt referring to an interview which I gave RTE radio on 18 June after a meeting of EEC Foreign Ministers in Paris.  When I was asked, in the course of that interview, whether Ireland would be receiving more than the 100 refugees from Indo-China which had already been announced, I said that I felt sure the Government would make a further positive response towards relieving the terrible plight of the refugees.  I did not however, indicate what this response would be in terms of any specific extra numbers of refugees to be admitted to Ireland.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government have now taken a decision in principle to admit a further 100 refugees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's view that, even increasing the figure to a total of 200, it is a poor response to this awful situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of where these figures came from.  I have indicated the Government's readiness to respond to the situation.  There are practical problems for the refugees, particularly in relation to the pre-reception stage, which means that before we can indicate the number we must have accommodation to cope effectively with 100 or 200.  It is proving very difficult to get that kind of accommodation.</P>

In that context does the Minister agree that the number of places this Government have offered is not at all sufficient?

      <P>As this was the first meeting between the Secretary of State and members of the Irish Government the initial discussion between the Ministers over lunch was general and introductory.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The dual aims of this short Bill are, first, to enable the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 to be brought into operation in stages and, second, to provide for an advisory council on dangerous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1972 Act consolidated and amended the law relating to explosives and petroleum and provided enabling powers in relation to other dangerous <Col N="2679" /> substances.  The purpose of the Act was to regulate the industrial as distinct from the criminal use of these substances.  My intention is to bring certain provisions of the Act into operation and at the same time to make comprehensive regulations relating to the areas of law affected.  The Act provided for the repeal of controls under old statutes, and among these were certain parts of the Explosives Act, 1875.  Because of a development in the meantime, which I shall presently explain, repeal of these provisions now would leave a serious gap in our laws for dealing with the criminal uses of certain substances, which, if freed from control, would tend to be used as explosives even though they were not considered to be explosives in 1972.</P>
    <P>In the latter part of 1972, after the legislation of that year had been passed, orders were made by the Government under the Explosives Act, 1875, prescribing ammonium nitrate, sodium chlorate and nitro-benzene to be explosives for the purposes of that Act. Two of these substances were at the time in common use as weed killers or fertilisers, but it was established that they were also being used as ingredients for the manufacture of explosives.  The needs of public order dictated that they should be controlled and, on the initiative of the Minister for Justice, the Government introduced the controls which they considered to be necessary. The position today is that the need for these controls remains.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the substances in question are not &ldquo;explosives&rdquo; within the terms of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972; therefore they would cease to be controlled if that Act were brought into operation as drafted.  Hence the need to leave the legal position with respect to explosives as it is for the time being, while bringing other provisions of the 1972 Act into operation.  It is my intention to bring the Act into operation minus Part II, which relates to explosives, and also to arrange that the relevent provisions of the Explosives Act, 1875, shall remain in force.  Powers in relation to explosives will continue in force under the existing legislation and will remain with the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2680" /> I turn now to Part III of the 1972 Act relating to petroleum.  Last autumn, having reviewed the work done in the Department on the preparation of regulations on petroleum, I gave notice of intention to make four sets of petroleum regulations and invited observations from the parties affected by them.  The observations received have been examined, discussed with the interests concerned, and where appropriate, changes have been made in the draft regulations.  These, I hope, can be made in a matter of weeks.  They will operate from the date the Act comes into operation and certain existing provisions will be repealed by the Act.  The intention of the regulations is to reduce, in so far as it is within our compass to do so, the risks to persons and property involved in the conveyance, loading, unloading and storage of petroleum.</P>
    <P>As to other dangerous substances, to which Part IV of the 1972 Act relates, these will come within the scope of the Act according as orders are made declaring that the Act applies to them.  I intend in the near future to initiate action under the Act to deal with the packaging, labelling, transport, loading, unloading and storage of some 25 substances which have already been identified by the industrial inspectorate as requiring attention under the Act.  The collaboration of a number of other Departments and State agencies will be involved in the implementation of any such regulations and the necessary consultations are proceeding.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the growth in the number and variety of materials being used and developed, there is a need for vigilance in the identification of hazardous substances and providing information on the dangers, precautions and protective measures in respect of them. Even though advice will be available to me from official sources, as well as from the EEC, the ILO and other agencies, I believe that an advisory body representative of interests concerned will be of considerable assistance in making for the effective working of this legislation. There is no provision in the 1972 Act for such a body.  I am therefore availing of the present opportunity to provide for an <Col N="2681" /> advisory council.  The provisions in the Bill aim to give maximum flexibility as to representation and terms of reference of the council.  It should enable me to draw on the best advice on all aspects of the safe movement, storage and handling of dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for explaining it for the benefit of the House and the country. Ever since the major disaster took place a year ago this week the movement of dangerous substances has been the cause of great concern.  Of particular concern in this country is the movement of acrylonitrile or vinylchloride from the port of Dublin to Ballina.  In making regulations under the 1972 Act, as amended by this Bill, I should like the Minister to have regulations that would ensure the absolutely optimum degree of safety in regard to that very dangerous cargo.</P>
      <P>I think the advisory council is a very good idea but I wonder why the Minister is circumscribing it so much.  It is stated that an inspector may attend a meeting if the advisory council request it.  Why should that not be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; attend a meeting?  There is a further qualification, &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo;. Here the Minister who appoints an advisory council over which he has total control is saying that one of his inspectors may attend a meeting subject to his consent.  Without making an issue of it, I consider the subsection a little tight.  The advisory council should have more freedom than the subsection provides.  I hope that the Bill will go speedily through both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I join Deputy Mitchell in welcoming the Bill.  It has our full support. There has been some criticism, as the Minister is aware, in regard to this matter and there has been some pressure to have the Bill enacted.  I am glad to see it brought in before the recess.  We particularly welcome the setting up of the advisory council on dangerous substances. <Col N="2682" /> There is a good deal of concern at present about the transport, loading and unloading and, indeed, storage of a number of dangerous substances.  Today I had a question down to the Minister&mdash;it will not be reached now but we shall have a written reply later in the day&mdash;regarding the transport of ammonia from the NET plant in Cork by rail through various railheads to Arklow. That is the type of instance where the problem has been highlighted by the <i>Cork Examiner</i> recently in a major report, of which no doubt the Minister is aware, regarding the proposed arrangements for the transport of bulk ammonia from Cork over a major rail network through Dublin to Arklow.  We have yet to get to grips totally and completely with that kind of issue.  We have the case of the Dublin-Ballina issue and the new one now arising in regard to Cork-Dublin-Arklow by rail.  I am glad, therefore, that the legislation has been amended and the situation clarified between the Explosives Act and the new Dangerous Substances (Amendment) Bill.  The dangers have been self-evident in situations other than the normal use of these substances.  On that basis we welcome the clarification given by the Minister in the Bill and the setting up of the advisory council and hope that it will be brought into operation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister in his reply might refer to the situation which has been raised extensively in the Cork area and which has given rise to serious concern. It is a situation which should be clarified as the House will not meet again until mid-October.  A number of us have been asked to ask the Minister what precautions are being taken and the extent to which he will be consulted, for example, by NET and the extent to which CIE, in the event of their tendering for such contracts, would consult the Departments of Labour, Tourism and Transport or Environment on transportation. I have no doubt that the advisory council can provide considerable assistance to the Minister in facing issues of that nature.  I welcome the Bill and the setting up as quickly as possible of the advisory council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Environment spokesman for the Labour Party I want to refer to what Deputy Desmond has just raised, the Marino Point ammonia gas spillage and its relationship to the terms of reference of this Bill.</P>
      <P>On Saturday week I was at a funeral of a colleague in Cork and I took the opportunity of going to Cobh and looking at the environmental damage.  Subsequently, I attempted to put down a number of questions to the relevant Minister as a result of representations from people working in CIE in the Cork area and from other people.  I was told that the matter was directly of concern to CIE and that it did not fall within the competence of the Minister to answer.  I accepted the Chair's ruling on that.  The point I am making is that because of the nature of our industrialisation programme and our positive encouragement of certain large-scale chemical plants whether Schering Plough, the Corkbased ones or Asahi in Mayo, we are putting our environment at risk in a way which none of us, despite the goodwill attached to the industrial benefit of such projects, can adequately measure in the full administrative sense of the word. This falls within the terms of reference of the Bill and of the advisory committee that the Minister will appoint.</P>
      <P>There is a double responsibility on a Government which attract by way of grant or otherwise or, as in the case of NET fund to a substantial amount, a development.  They have the responsibility to ensure that all reasonable safety precautions take place.  It is not sufficient that adequate safety regulations are designed and implemented&mdash;they must be seen and felt by the public to be implemented.  I will have to write back to the people in Cork this week and say that I am sorry that I cannot raise the question in the Dáil and cannot get an assurance from the relevant Minister that the situation will be safeguarded and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in his appointment of the advisory council to make it clear that that advisory council and its members should be fearless in their advice to the Minister, should be unequivocal in their recommendations <Col N="2684" /> and should not hold back on them for fear that they may cause problems of one kind or another.  It is the Minister's task to make decisions and it is the job of the advisory council to give advice.  If that advice has a price-tag which is difficult to pay or politically onerous to honour, that is not the problem of the advisory council.  It is the political problem of the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>If we have a serious environmental accident, which hopefully we will not, for whatever reason&mdash;inadequate regulations, inadequate maintenance, human error and so on&mdash;the political will of the community to industrialise and develop growth will be weakened.  If that political will is weakened we are putting our prosperity and that of our children's generation at risk.  We are not just narrowly talking about dangerous substances; we are talking about the relationship of the political acceptability of industrialisation in the latter part of this century at a time when&mdash;the next Bill we debate will be in relation to tourism&mdash;we will have to counterbalance the benefits of our environment to the tourist industry with the development of our environment as a resource for human exploitation.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the implementation of this Bill and the appointment of the advisory council will make it clear to the public, directly or through public representatives, that there are safety regulations in relation to dangerous substances.  If anybody, whether the wife of a worker driving a train for CIE or a relative or friend of a person employed in the plant, wants assurance or information about the exact state of play in relation to X, Y or Z material they should have immediate access to the Department concerned directly or through their public representatives.  This is something they do not have at present.  The advisory council the Minister will appoint should be seen to be a very strong independent council charged clearly and explicitly by the Minister to give the best possible advice in any circumstances.  The Minister of the day should worry about the political consequences of that advice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>If we have a major environmental accident it could wipe out, for example, an entire crop of peas with a loss of thousands of jobs.  We all want industries and we need the industrial will to forge ahead with them.  At the same time, we must ensure that nothing we do by way of industrialisation will hinder the jobs already in existence in other industries. There is a real danger of hazard to crops from dangerous substances, leaks, human error and so on.  We should be able to assure people that this will not happen.  The advisory council, as Deputy Quinn pointed out, should be a fearless council.  The political side of it will have to be decided by the Minister but he should get the facts.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the constructive approach to the Bill and the businesslike way it has been dealt with by the House.  Having regard to the importance of the Bill, I felt this would be the approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to a major disaster in Spain 12 months ago and felt this highlighted the need for legislation here.  The Government and former Fianna Fáil Administrations realised the necessity for legislation as far back as 1972 when the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, was passed.  At that time certain difficulties were found to exist regarding explosives with the result that the Act lay dormant for a considerable time.  When I took office in 1977 I was aware of this situation and immediately became concerned that as this was an important matter no effort should be spared to ensure that the 1972 Act was brought into operation and that any obstacles to this were eliminated.  With the co-operation I received from the Department of Justice and the help and assistance <Col N="2686" /> I got from the Attorney General I have been able to achieve that situation by the introduction of this amending Bill.</P>
    <P>Vast volumes of regulations are required in respect of petroleum and the various dangerous substances.  In the latter half of last year the petroleum regulations were prepared in draft form and, as is required under the Act, submissions were sought and obtained from the interested bodies.  Certain specific points were made about the advisory council.  I agree with Members who lay emphasis on the importance of this council.  I took advantage of this Bill to set up such an advisory council because I have long held the view that such a council should be established to give me ready access to the most reliable information on the wide variety of dangerous chemicals here. The best expert advice on these measures should be available to me so that any special risks associated with such substances are eliminated as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who said that the terms of reference of the council should be flexible to allow for adaptation to meet situations as they arise.  It is my intention that the matters on which the council will advise me will include the desirability of amending or revoking any orders or regulations under the Act, matters relating to the enforcement of the Act or of orders and relations made under the Act, the nature and extent of the movement of dangerous substances in Ireland, the several international systems relating to the safe transport of dangerous substances, co-ordination of the movement of dangerous substances by sea, through ports, by air, road and rail.  That is an indication of my concern about the importance of that advisory council.</P>
    <P>Specific substances were mentioned by Deputy Mitchell.  He referred to the transport to acrylonitrile to Asahi.  I should like to tell the Deputy that it is my intention to have that included under the list of dangerous substances.  In fact, it is one of the 25 dangerous substances we have listed and are working on in the preparation of regulations.  Deputy Desmond referred to the Cork scene and the ammonia problem involved in the transport of that product from Marino Point <Col N="2687" /> to Arklow.  Deputies Quinn and Hegarty also referred to this matter.  I am concerned and aware of the situation as reported in the press but I am not aware, nor do I have any information, of the concern stated to have been expressed by certain people in those reports.  When this Bill comes into operation I will examine the position with regard to bye-laws for the transport by rail of dangerous substances, including this ammonia. I will have power under this Bill &mdash;something I do not have at present&mdash;to request that bye-laws be made.  I have also power to vet the substance of the effectiveness or usefulness of those bye-laws and express whether I deem them to be acceptable.  That is a step forward.  However, I believe progress should have been made during four dormant years when nothing was done in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>On 8 July an interviewer on RTE, during the course of a radio programme on the Cork scene, commented on an interview I had given the previous February.  That interviewer said that nothing further had been heard from me or the Department of Labour since.  Obviously, he was not up to date with his information and had not been keeping in touch with the progress that had been made, because on 15 June this Bill was circulated to enable the 1972 Act to be brought into operation.  In fact, it had already passed First Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the House for the co-operation given to me.  I agree with Members who expressed the view that this was an important Bill because it enables us to introduce certain provisions of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 which are needed.</P>

      <P>I would have preferred had the advisory council been a little less restricted.  The proposal that there should be an advisory council is a good one, but in the interests of all concerned, particularly the Minister, it should be seen to be an independent body.  In saying that, I do not mean to reflect on the Minister, former holders of the office or future Ministers, but a Minister may come under pressure in this regard.  It is possible that the advice tendered to a Minister would be what the council think the Minister wants to hear rather than what they would like to give him. The council may only consider matters referred to them by the Minister, and the chairman and ordinary members appointed by the Minister will hold office for such a period as the Minister may decide.  Subsection (3) provides that, on the request of the advisory council and subject to the consent of the Minister, an inspector may attend a meeting of the advisory council for the purpose of giving any information which the advisory council may request for the purposes of discharging its function.  Therefore, the council cannot request an inspector to attend a meeting.  First of all, he must obtain the consent of the Minister.  I presume, if the Minister says, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; the inspector will go but the subsection says that an inspector &ldquo;may&rdquo; go.  I should prefer that to read that an inspector &ldquo;shall&rdquo; go.  Perhaps the Minister is being over-cautious in these provisions.  For example, would he consider amending subsection (3) to read:</P>
      <P>On the request of the Advisory Council an inspector shall attend a meeting of the Advisory Council for the purpose of giving any information which the Advisory Council may request for the purposes of discharging its functions.</P>
      <P>In other words, this would mean the deletion of the words &ldquo;and subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the second line of the subsection.</P>

      <P>I do not feel that the terms of reference of the Advisory Council are in any way restrictive.  I <Col N="2689" /> have availed of the opportunity to introduce this Advisory Council.  Naturally it would be my wish that it be independent and worth while.  Obviously Deputy Mitchell must have some reservations about my capacity to select independent people for such an advisory committee or council.  He need not have any reservations in the matter because I too fully appreciate the necessity for an independent Advisory Council, particularly one having the kind of expertise and knowledge of what is happening in this entire area.  For that reason it would be my wish that this would be a more broadly-based Advisory Council than others at present operating under some other Acts.  The type of people needed to act on such a council as I see it, would be, first of all, the social partners.  There has been reference to the chemical industry and its growth.  Obviously there would be a need for that to be covered. The transport industry is extremely important, and then there are the various Government Departments because this covers quite a number of areas.  There has been reference made already to transport. Deputy Quinn made reference to the environment.  The Department of Tourism and Transport were referred to by Deputy B. Desmond.  There are also the Departments of Health, Industry, Commerce and Energy and Justice, which Department will be charged with the enforcement of some of the provisions. I believe that the Advisory Council so set up should be of particular benefit to all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer to the point made about the attendance of an inspector at such Advisory Council meetings.  The subsection provides specifically that an inspector may attend at the request of the Advisory Council, and give any information requested by the Advisory Council for the purpose of discharging their functions. Deputy Mitchell advocated a changing of the wording of the subsection. I do not see the necessity for that. There is a similar provision contained in the Factories Act and in the Mines and Quarries Act in relation to those Advisory Councils.  The Deputy can be assured that, when I saw an opportunity to establish an Advisory Council, I was concerned that it would prove to be <Col N="2690" /> worth while, one that would advise me or indeed any of my predecessors on various aspects of the operation of this important Bill.</P>
    <P>I was asked earlier about the Cork scene, about the benefits or advantages I would have when this Bill becomes law on the transport of dangerous substances. At present I am informed by CIE that the equipment used, and to be used, conforms to the best international standards.  The board operate international practices laid down for the movement of these dangerous substances. In addition, it could be said that all of the people concerned are given specific training in the various areas and that the situation obtaining has been satisfactory.  But the passage of this Bill will give me powers not in existence at present.  The Transport Act of 1950 provides that CIE are not obliged to accept dangerous substances for conveyance by rail and that, if the board do accept such goods, they shall be carried and shall be stored subject to such bye-laws, regulations and conditions as the board may think fit.  If CIE should decide to make bye-laws in this matter, under section 22 (2) of the Transport Act of 1950, such bye-laws must be confirmed by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  That is the position at present. But, when this Bill is passed, the Minister for Labour may require that such bye-laws be prepared, and may accept or reject them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Without unduly delaying the debate, we are entitled to express our serious concern about the proposition.  What we have just been talking about is the bulk transfer, or transport by rail, of bulk ammonia. There has not been any effective homing-in&mdash;apart from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> which gave a very responsible analysis of the situation&mdash;or examination of it as it affects the country as a whole.  Without being scary, what is now proposed is that literally thousands of tons of bulk ammonia, a highly dangerous substance&mdash;one need only examine what it did to the vegetation on an estate in Cork to imagine what it would do to human beings&mdash;be transferred <Col N="2691" /> from the Marino Point plant in County Cork by rail right into Cork city, into a densely populated area, up through a tunnel, out of Cork city at a very slow speed&mdash;an area which has constant track difficulties requiring very heavy maintenance by CIE&mdash;to Mallow, progressing through all the railheads into Dublin, into the major population centre of the country.  That is bad enough, but then it is proposed that it be brought right through Dublin, through south Dublin, out through Sandycove to Dún Laoghaire, through Bray, on an notorious stretch of track, and then on a slow track to Arklow.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minister's reply to my parliamentary question here today&mdash;and I accept his remarks in absolute good faith&mdash;my question has been shunted round literally by rail through seven different Government Departments in the past fortnight until finally the Minister for Labour answered the question under the Dangerous Substances Act.  I had a question down to the Minister for the Environment who said he had nothing whatever to do with it.  Apparently the Minister for Tourism and Transport had no responsibility for CIE's operations in that area.  I share the view of the senior staff of Cork County Council that, despite the fact that the tender might be somewhat more expensive, that bulk ammonia should be trans-shipped by bulk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall conclude by saying that, in my opinion bulk ammonia should be trans-shipped by ship from Cork harbour right into Arklow port.  That is the proper way of doing it.  I cannot see any other prospect in terms of Dublin to Ballina because there there was no other option.  There is an option in relation to the current situation and, notwithstanding the fact that CIE may use the best of equipment and so on, that is the kind of instance.  I urge the Minister that when it comes to making the regulation under the Dangerous Substances Act the regulation may, and I hope would, preclude the unnecessary <Col N="2692" /> transport of the major dangerous substances to major population areas.  That is the kind of concept that I would like to see provided in the Bill.  I accept the Minister's competence in that regard.  I regret that we had to raise this on the second last day before the House adjourns. I thank you, Sir, for the latitude you have given me.</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Deputies went through a list of the people whom they felt should be on the advisory council.  Let me add one other class of people&mdash;the people who live with this problem daily and in whose vicinity a lot of these dangerous substances are stored.  They should have representation on such a council.  The Minister is well aware that my constituency has the Asahi plant and in the town of Ballina they have a considerable amount of acrylonitrile stored there.  The residents there, who have had almost weekly consultation with CIE, should be considered on any advisory council.</P>
      <P>I also contradict one thing that Deputy Desmond said.  There is an option in the transportation of this substance. It can come by sea, and we should not close our eyes to that option.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am sorry, if only for the peace of mind of the people who live on the Foxford road in Ballina, that this legislation was not brought in and enacted three or four years ago.  Perhaps in that case they would have had some peace of mind.  I look forward to the Minister consulting with them, as he has done with CIE and Asahi, to see how this problem can best be overcome to the advantage of everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, Sir, I should like to reply to Deputy Desmond, who obviously used this to get across some of the points made in his parliamentary question today.  Obviously also, he was as aware of the latitude he was taking as you were yourself.  CIE's arrangements for the movement of anhydrous ammonia have been drawn <Col N="2693" /> up in accordance with the standards laid down at an international convention concerning the transport of dangerous goods by rail.  The special precautions being taken by CIE have safety as the prime overall requirement and include a specially designed train, special tank containers and specially trained staff engaged in the operation.  If, however, despite stringent precautions being taken, an accident should occur, co-ordinated emergency measures have been established, following discussion with appropriate Government Departments, to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Ammonia is one of the chemicals most commonly transported by rail all over the world with a very good record of safe handling.  I say that in reply to Deputy Desmond.  I also say to him that he is expressing concern now about the Bill before the House.  His Government during their time in office should have seen to it that a Bill like the one I am bringing in here today was brought in then.  It did not take the Spanish disaster of last year or any other disaster to make the Fianna Fáil Government in 1972 conscious of the need for that Act. I listened while Deputy Desmond, in a snide, mischievous way, did a little bit of scaremongering.  Reasonable precautions have always been taken.  This Bill gives to the Minister for Labour certain powers which were not available to him prior to now.  Deputy Desmond is concerned about this Bill being introduced only now.  Had he been concerned earlier to see this amending legislation introduced, it would have been before the House before now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Calleary raised an interesting point about representation on the advisory council.  That very valid point was that the community should be represented, and I will have that examined in a favourable way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this Bill.  I support it.  However, I must criticise the Minister for not including in the Bill, or indicating in his speech introducing the Bill, any provision to salvage the present disastrous tourist trade.  At the start of 1979 it appeared that we were heading for a record year in tourism.  Then the difficulties started with the post and telegraphs dispute, the petrol problem and adverse publicity <Col N="2695" /> abroad, and our tourism for the current year is suffering a marked setback.  It is the function of a Government&mdash;indeed the Minister is responsible&mdash;to show imagination and vision in tackling problems of that nature and endeavouring to find solutions to them.  What we have before the House at the moment is a Bill which will help the tourist industry in the future, but it will not do one iota for tourism in 1979.</P>
      <P>I have three suggestions to make to the Minister and I ask him to consider them as being as constructive as possible from this side of the House and not given in any destructive sense.  In order to salvage the tourist industry for the current year the Minister should do the following: (1) diversify and improve the distribution of the petrol coupon system, (2) provide a foundation for a blitz publicity campaign at home and abroad, and (3) give an assurance and guarantee to those involved in the tourist business who are suffering losses in this current year so as to encourage them to face the future with some optimism.  Generally the tourist industry has an immense impact on the economy of this nation and employs, directly and indirectly, approximately 100,000 people and could generate an income for this nation of hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>In regard to this Bill, obviously we must make plans for the future.  It is important for the Minister and the House to remember that when building for the future one must build on firm foundations. The first and most immediate job is to make the foundations for 1979 firm.  I have noticed in the past that when suggestions have been made by Opposition speakers the response has been that the Opposition speakers are sabotaging the industry.  That is a very unworthy suggestion.  The Minister should not be looking at contributions from the Opposition in that way.  I come from a very important tourist area in the country. Other people who have contributed to this debate, even though they may not live in areas which are important to the industry, have spoken with a genuine commitment as Irishmen attempting to provide suggestions to improve our tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2696" /> I hope the Minister will consider the three points I have made.  The idea of the petrol vouchers was a good one originally and I commend the originator of the idea but the execution of the idea has not been perfect.  It was a new scheme but the reaction to the difficulties as they became evident has not been quick enough.  There has not been enough thinking put into improving the scheme to make it as effective as it might be.  I asked the Minister at the end of June to extend the scheme to Northern Ireland. He said then it would be impossible to do so but I am very glad that within a week he accepted my suggestion.  I am not here to blow my trumpet about it, as I am sure other people also suggested it to him.  That is the kind of quick response I would expect from a Minister for Tourism.</P>
    <P>Considerable difficulties are being experienced in relation to the petrol vouchers because the distribution is not wide enough.  I know the problems of tourists in West Cork who have to travel up to one hundred miles to get vouchers. People who have neglected to get vouchers on coming into the country, those who are getting a second supply after the nine-day period has elapsed and tourists who are hiring self-drive cars have to travel long distances to get petrol vouchers.  A person who hires a self-drive car in Skibbereen has to travel over one hundred miles to get his vouchers.  Is there a better way of putting that person off hiring a car and having a touring holiday?  Is there a better way of wasting a scarce resource?</P>
    <P>I have been told that in the whole area of Connacht there are only two distribution centres, one in Galway and one in Sligo.  When I was young I used to holiday in Achill.  Is it not a ridiculous situation that a tourist who hires a car there has to travel a return journey of one hundred miles to collect his petrol vouchers?  I strongly urge the Minister to take immediate steps to widen the distribution of those vouchers, which I understand is confined to the ports and the head offices of the regional tourist organisations.  There is a network of offices through the country.  It would be a great reassurance to tourists who are already here and to those they will be in <Col N="2697" /> contact with after they return home if this was done.  It would not cost anything to extend this scheme to all the tourist offices through the country.</P>
    <P>The second point I suggested to the Minister was a propaganda campaign. I commend him for travelling to the UK and having a conference there.  I am worried about the follow through.  The Minister should make funds available to follow up that type of effort at home and in the UK.  He is well aware that a single shot fired in the publicity business has a limited effect.  There has to be a follow through.  I strongly urge the Minister to map out a publicity campaign and to provide the funds for it.</P>
    <P>The third suggestion I made was a guarantee to the people in the tourist industry who are suffering losses at the moment.  Many of those people have expanded their premises and have invested a considerable amount of money in the expectation that this would be a record year.  They are now feeling the pinch and must be protected.  The people who are doing development work by stages must be encouraged to continue this work and must be given help to stay in the business.  There may be other suggestions that can be made but I wanted to put to the Minister suggestions which I believe highlight the importance of having a rescue operation for the tourist industry in the current year and bringing home to him that while we all wish to see the tourist business developing in the years ahead, this year is the first priority. I support the Bill and the Minister's plans in the years ahead, but I strongly urge him to do everything possible to rescue the 1979 tourist year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the nicer Bills we get an opportunity of discussing. I welcome all aspects in the Bill, extra money for additional rooms in hotels and guesthouses and extra money for additional amenities around the country. It is obvious that there is a great shortfall of hotel accommodation and goodclass guesthouse accommodation in the country.  Those of us who have to stay regularly in Dublin can assert that Dublin lacks sufficient bedrooms.  Every incentive should be given to ensure that <Col N="2698" /> there is a great increase in the number of bedrooms available.  Many people are trying to improve matters in that direction but I believe their efforts will barely keep in line with the demands.  The Minister and Bord Fáilte should ensure that our tourist industry does not suffer because of the lack of such a basic commodity.</P>
      <P>Last year, when we were discussing the rates remission legislation, I considered it a serious disincentive to the provision of extra bedrooms in registered guesthouses that these establishments were not also being exempted from rates.  Though there were a number of amendments tabled by this party in this regard the Minister for the Environment did not accept them.  The people who own these guesthouses are making a valuable contribution to the tourist industry and, consequently, one might have expected them to have been included for the purpose of rates remission. The exemption was allowed in the case of unregistered guesthouses and farmhouse accommodation.  While the standard of accommodation the latter categories provide may not be as high as the standard which prevails in the registered guesthouses, they are making similar profits and are not taxed in the way that the registered guesthouses are taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree totally with the provision of extra money for the improvement of facilities.  I appreciate the demands for additional moneys with which the Minister for Finance must cope, but the industry concerned in this instance is very important in terms of the revenue it creates for the economy as a whole, perhaps even greater revenue than is created by any other industry with the exception of agriculture.  Tourists are coming here in large numbers and there is a tremendous increase in the number of continental visitors.  The Dutch, the Germans and the French perhaps to a lesser extent are visiting my part of the country in ever-increasing numbers.  We must cater for these people.  They are not seeking a Brighton- or a Blackpool-type holiday or even the Tramore- or Salthilltype holiday.  They are looking for the secluded beaches and coves and the quiet way of life and it is for us to ensure <Col N="2699" /> that there is access to those secluded spots.  However, it is no exaggeration to say that half of our beaches and coves are inaccessible because there are not access roads or lanes to them.  In order to reach some of them it would be necessary to climb down cliffs.</P>
    <P>Boating harbours are a very necessary facility but far too many of the possible locations of such harbours are not usable because it would not be possible to keep boats at them.  Money spent on the provision of camping sites, access roads, boat harbours and so on is money very well spent.  However, there is a lack of private initiative in areas where there is much potential.  We do not seem to have the type of business acumen that one finds among other races.  We know of the opportunities there are for making money in such areas as intensive farming or perhaps the liquor trade, but a camping site might be regarded nowadays as something of a goldmine.  Unfortunately, not sufficient Irish people see the potential of such development.  Bord Fáilte should be empowered where necessary to provide camping sites or, if necessary, to give the money required to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>An example of how necessary is such development is the situation of a fine harbour in my constituency to which huge numbers of tourists flock in the hope of camping there but who find that they are summonsed for illegal parking. There is no legitimate car parking or camping in the area.  The result is that what should be a booming industry is negligible because people must drive 15 or 20 miles from the most convenient car park or camping site to reach the harbour.  Obviously, therefore, there is need for a more planned and co-ordinated system.  Of course, not all tourists use cars.  Many continentals in particular travel by bicycle, but we should have basic camping sites for them, sites on which there are at least toilet facilities and running water.  It is in respect of the provision of such facilities that the regional tourists organisations and the local authorities can be of help in regard to the money the Minister is providing.</P>
    <P>A matter I have raised in a number of <Col N="2700" /> places but to which I have never received a satisfactory reply relates to the obliteration either <i>in toto</i> or in part of some of our most scenic views as a result of the growing of State forests.  I have put questions in this regard to the planning department of my own county council.  The reason for a person not being allowed build a house between a public road and a scenic view is obvious but why should a State Department &mdash;the Department of Fisheries and Forestry&mdash;be allowed plant trees anywhere without restriction?  They are doing this all over the country in terms of the plantation of hundreds of new forests.  The most beautiful scenery consists of a combination of water, mountain and trees but what is happening here is that one of these attributes is cancelling the other two.  Is there any co-ordination between the Departments concerned to ensure that any one Department is not destroying either the beauty created by another or the natural beauty of an area?</P>
    <P>If we are to improve our tourist industry we must provide a sufficient standard of service for tourists and for our own people who holiday in different parts of the country.  The standard of service is slipshod.  Our system of education is not designed to encourage basic manners in terms of the ordinary everyday pleasantries.  Tourists, like ourselves, are influenced by the mood of people.  Unfortunately, the attitude of many of our shop assistants, waitresses and people in the services industry generally is &ldquo;Take it or leave it&rdquo;.  One finds a much superior standard of manners in countries such as Switzerland, Germany and Spain.  Good manners do not cost anything but they are very important. We must start with our young people if we are to change the situation. At the moment far too many people have an insulting attitude.  I am referring to a minority.  I do not want all the shopkeepers and their assistants to come down on top of me like a ton of bricks because I am not making a general reference.  I am saying this type of slipshod service is too prevalent and it must be very off-putting to people who are spending their money here and, by doing so, doing us a great service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2701" /> Our standards of hygiene leave much to be desired.  That has been said time and again but I see no improvement. Some years ago EEC regulations were introduced stating that certain foodstuffs should not be handled in shops.  You will still see the shop assistant who has been licking his or her fingers, or handling something which is not clean, picking up cold meat, or vegetables, or fruit and selling them to a customer.  That type of activity must be stopped.  I wonder what are the health inspectors employed by our health boards doing.  This should be their concern, but they do not seem to be concerned about it.  I have not seen any prosecutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Our standard of hygiene is not what it should be.  It falls short of EEC regulations.  Since we are having such a tremendous influx of continental visitors who must be disgusted at the low standard of hygiene prevailing here, I hope the Minister will ensure, in consultation with the Minister for Health, that the position is improved.</P>
      <P>We all know the scandalous state of litter and filth we have here.  We did not earn the name of the dirty Irish for nothing.  Despite all the advertising campaigns, pleas by junior chambers of commerce and essay competitions in schools, the position has not improved. Litter is increasing instead of decreasing. We had a major campaign lately.  I have seen school children wearing badges saying: &ldquo;Stop throwing litter.&rdquo;  That campaign will fail.  We had numerous campaigns in the past ten to 20 years. There is only one way to solve the litter problem and to stop it from escalating, and that is to enforce the law.  There are laws under which people can be prosecuted, but I have not seen one person being prosecuted for littering.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2702" /> About four weeks ago I was driving up to Dublin and we got caught in the traffic in Callan in County Kilkenny. The driver in front of me emptied the refuse in his car out through the side window; cigarette packets, cores of apples and orange skins were thrown onto the public street.  This is a disgusting sight.  People like that are not doing any service to us as a nation.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry is our second largest industry.  It has a fantastic potential, despite all the obstacles put in our way, such as the interview on BBC television referred to at Question Time with the IRA man who blew up Airey Neave.  That does us immense damage on the British market.  We know what the British Foreign Office and the British papers are capable of&mdash;they are capable of anything.  They go into the gutter at will to run us down.  They have no love for us.  We must have promotional drives to safeguard ourselves.  We must be diplomatic and a bit conniving in our counter attacks and in our counter propaganda.  We do not wish to attack the British.  They are no enemies of ours. They have always been our best customers in tourism and when it comes to buying our products.  They are very welcome here and we would see to it that they are invited to come here in the nicest way possible.</P>
    <P>If the statistics I have seen are correct, last year 180,000 Irish people went abroad for their holidays.  That is quite a large number for such a small country. It adds up to quite a high percentage. These people must feel they are not getting value for their money at home.  Obviously a certain number of people would have the urge to travel, but that figure is extremely high.  They must feel they are getting better value in Spain, or elsewhere, and they do not see Ireland as being such a pleasant alternative.  We should concentrate on the idea of home holidays which was promoted three or four years ago.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind some of the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on his initiative in introducing it.  I hope there will not be <Col N="2703" /> too much red tape attached to these grants.  It is almost impossible for people down the country to get a grant from Bord Fáilte.  They send down inspectors week in and week out, but the money is not forthcoming.  The Minister might have a chat with all the inspectors Bord Fáilte seem to have and tell them that, when the job is completed and up to standard, people should get their money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy touched on a few very good points.  The way our local authorities neglect our beaches is a scandal. County councils do not take much notice of Bord Fáilte, but the Minister and his Department should notify local authorities that they have a statutory obligation to clean the beaches.  Too often oil from passing ships, dead animals and plastic containers are left lying on beautiful beaches for months before they are taken away.  The local authorities seem to be neglecting our beaches, and that is a disgrace.  If the Minister put the boot into the local authorities in a good Kerry fashion he would be doing a good day's work.</P>
      <P>The petrol coupon scheme may be working in some areas, but there are difficulties. The Minister might consider providing more centres.  If people forget their coupons they have to go back to one of the main centres to collect them.  That is ridiculous.  There should be give and take, especially so far as the coastal areas are concerned, and particularly areas like Dingle, Caherciveen, Waterville and Kenmare.  If a person leaves an area and has a limited supply of petrol only, he will not go back to that area again.  During the month of August the Minister might consider giving a limited number of coupons to the different recognised tourist offices in the small towns around the coast.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the way the Department of Posts and Telegraphs treat these small offices.  Since the postal strike the telephone in the Dingle tourist office was out of order for 14 days before anybody came to fix it.  Despite representations made by many people, nothing was done.  This type of thing should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amenities are important to tourism. <Col N="2704" /> In my county a number of people keep horses and ponies for hire to tourists during the summer.  As it is expensive to keep horses and ponies during the winter months, Bord Fáilte should give grants towards their upkeep.  I have made this point time and time again to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have alienated themselves in certain ways from local authorities, which is unfortunate.  Too often they object to planning applications without seeing the areas involved.  Members of local authorities and Members of the House know the value of our heritage.  The Minister should tell Bord Fáilte to be more discerning in their objections.  The giving of planning permission by a county manager or county planning officer should be good enough for everybody, including Bord Fáilte.  I would not like to see Bord Fáilte being used as An Taisce are being used at present. An Taisce are used by persons who have no hesitation in going for a section 4 in order to get planning permission. An Taisce do not object to the applications because the persons involved hold prominent positions in An Taisce.  I hope that the same sort of thing is not happening in Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider giving a subsidy to all English and continental tourists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2705" /> The cost of accommodation and meals should be more competitive.  I believe that some hotels are charging £38 for bed and breakfast.  Hotels receiving grants from Bord Fáilte should limit their charges.  I believe that we are in danger of pricing ourselves out of the market.  Bord Fáilte should have more control of the licensing of hotels and guesthouses.</P>
    <P>Most persons who hire horse-drawn caravans never see a horse until they arrive here.  The sooner licensing is introduced in this area the better.  There have already been tragedies involving horse-drawn caravans.  There is the old story of the couple who came to Ireland and hired a horse-drawn caravan.  The following morning they met someone who asked them how they had slept.  The reply was &ldquo;We did not sleep at all; the horse kept moving around all night&rdquo;. They did not even take the horse from under the caravan.  That is a true story. The situation is so bad that either the Minister for the Environment or Bord Fáilte should do something about it.  It is ridiculous to see eight horse-drawn caravans travelling in convoy with 30 cars trying to pass them out.  It would be sensible to leave a distance between each caravan.  People who hire horse-drawn caravans should be given some training before they are let out on the road.  I know what I am talking about as I have experience of travelling those roads.</P>
    <P>The tourists in my area this year are mainly from the continent.  Many of them travelled to the south-west by CIE. Most of the carriages being used by CIE are disgraceful and the Minister should ask CIE to update their carriages and to keep them clean.  The use of old and dirty carriages gives visitors a bad impression.</P>

    <P>Finally I wish the Minister well.  I <Col N="2706" /> hope that as far as the grants are concerned the Minister will not be too strict because I have met so many people who were disappointed by Bord Fáilte.  I do not know whether is was a misunderstanding on their part or a deliberate misunderstanding by Bord Fáilte.  Certainly in that area a better public relations system is needed than exists at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when the Second Stage was moved but I want to confine my remarks to what was actually said during the Minister of State's contribution.  I specifically want to deal with the section relating to the new scheme of grants for hotel accommodation. I should state at the outset that as an architect in practice and dealing with a number of hotel operators I have direct experience and consequently some kind of indirect interest.  I would declare that first and foremost.</P>
      <P>I want first of all to welcome the fact that this new grant scheme has been proposed, because it is necessary.  I also want to identify some possible difficulties which will arise as a result of its implementation if these principles are detailed and fleshed out in full by Bord Fáilte and&mdash;and this is the essence of my contribution&mdash;there is not essential consultation with the Department of the Environment and the local authorities in major conurbations to which the Minister's speech refers.  The Minister of State said in column 1686 of 4 July:</P>
      <P>The main features of the new scheme are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it is framed on a selective basis so that it will represent a correct response to our needs;</P>
      <P>(b)  it is related solely to the cost of providing additional bedrooms;</P>
      <P>(c)  there will be different levels of grant related roughly to estimated need with grants from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of room cost subject to fixed cash maxima;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  priority will be given to the extension of existing hotels over the construction of new hotels, and new hotel construction in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Shannon, Killarney and other major conurbations <Col N="2707" /> with a substantial tourism/ business base will not qualify for grants.</P>
    <P>The proposal to introduce a new grant scheme to provide extra bed space for the tourist industry and confine it to existing operators is a reasonable one.  I do not think anybody in the industry would argue with that in the light of our experience in the mid 1960s of building new hotels from scratch and trying to staff up the seasonal labour with limited management expertise, although CERT have bridged the gap there quite considerably since that time.  Our experience with the crash in tourism in 1969 and 1970 makes this particular strategy a very acceptable one and a reasonable one so far as the hotel industry is concerned. Therefore to confine it to existing operators who have their heads above water and who are attempting to recoup their losses as a result of some of the bad years certainly makes sense.</P>
    <P>My concern, however, is that certain hotel operators in existing built-up areas throughout the country, by definition of the age of the hotel and its physical location on the ground in the town or city that it occupies, would be physically constrained from expanding by providing extra bedroom space given normal planning constraints.  If this is a Government policy that is to be pursued logically and persistently, then the local authorities and the planning departments of the local authorities should at least be made officially and formally aware of the Government's intended strategy.</P>
    <P>It is quite conceivable that a small hotel operator in Deputy Hegarty's area of Cork may apply for permission to extend and be told by the local planning officer that that area of the town is already congested and that extra bedroom space is going to produce car parking requirements and would he not move out of town where there is plenty of space and room to build a new hotel because that might fit in with the five-year development plan of that local authority.  The operator would say that he would not qualify for a grant if he builds a new hotel and is therefore not interested because he cannot finance the project, <Col N="2708" /> certainly on the basis of interest rates at the moment, without some degree of assistance since there will be no assistance for anything other than bedrooms in the first place.  Grants for new hotels do not exist and therefore the financing would not have been on.  So it is conceivable that the legitimate and reasonable planning constraints taken on their own, if they do not have regard to this Government strategy, may make it extremely difficult or delay the process of finally getting permission from an Bord Pleanála for the implementation of this strategy.</P>
    <P>I formally request the Minister to consider how best he can advise the local planning authorities of the Government's policy in this area.  I use the word &ldquo;advise&rdquo; because the Minister cannot direct the local planning authorities to move in this area and he cannot tell them to grant planning permission but if a planning committee and the planning officials are aware of this Government policy it is going to make their job a little bit easier and it will make the implementation of this scheme easier.  That would apply throughout the entire country in varying degrees depending on how strict or how built up the area was in which the applicant or hotelier might be located.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to item (d) of the four points made by the Minister in his contribution.  That relates to the exclusion from grants of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Shannon and Killarney. There are two points in that section. Priority is given generally to existing hotels with the exclusion of the ones that I have mentioned.  The fact is that Dublin, by virtue of its role as capital city, and Cork as a major and expanding city in a very dynamic part of the country economically, suffer a shortfall of bed space which has got as much to do with the business activity of those cities as with tourism.  Certainly the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy will testify to the fact that there are difficulties in getting bedroom accommodation for visiting businessmen or people of one kind or another who come to Dublin or Cork to do business and not necessarily as tourists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2709" /> That fact should be recognised in this because hoteliers are not going to expand unless sufficient encouragement is given to them through Bord Fáilte.  I know we are talking about a tourist traffic Bill and therefore accommodating the business needs of major expanding cities like Dublin or Cork would not necessarily come into this category.  But if we are talking about hotels here and about improving the standards of hotels and meeting the need for hotels according to the Green Paper strategy to which the Minister's speech refers, then, in reality, we are talking about Bord Fáilte who are directly responsible to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would simply ask the Minister when he is discussing with Bord Fáilte the details of the scheme to which he refers to bear that fact in mind as well.  This shortfall of bed space in Dublin has something to do with tourism, but on top of that it has something to do with the development of Dublin, and we are going to see it in real terms after the summer period when this country is in the full flight of its Presidency of the EEC between now and December 31.</P>
    <P>When the summit takes place here in November obtaining bedroom accommodation in Dublin will be impossible in the last couple of days for people who come in and out and want to do so fairly quickly.  If it is difficult and if people are obliged to take substandard accommodation the whole tourist image will suffer.  I am drawing the Minister's attention to the matter of the provision of extra bedroom accommodation and asking him to have that in mind in his discussions with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that as far as we are concerned tourism and the environment are very much integrated and the provision of bed space throughout the country and in the larger urban areas through which most tourists must pass before they get to Deputy Begley's horse drawn caravans is very important.  They come in through Rosslare or somewhere else and, fortunately for people other than Kerry people, they spend some money in other parts of the country on their way there and back and they need bedroom accommodation.  In order to make this scheme work there should be <Col N="2710" /> some communication of a formal nature between the Department and the local authorities regarding provision of extra bedroom accommodation.  There are and will be difficulties in the expansion of existing hotels which will not be given the benefit of the doubt by a planning authority because of overall planning constraints.  Conceivably, they could be given such benefit it the planning authority which wants to do the best thing for the country feels there is a Government strategy which has the support of the majority of the Oireachtas and which is being given effect to by not inconsiderable sums of money.  It would be tragic if the strategy behind this Bill, the taxation taken up in the next budget which will be collected whether it is spent or not, cannot be as effective as the Minister would wish because of a misunderstanding or lack of understanding of this tourism strategy in terms of hotel accommodation by various planning departments around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what I feel has been a worthwhile discussion on the Bill.  It underlines the fact that Deputies could appreciate the vital importance of the tourist industry to the economy. Before replying to specific points I wish to emphasise again that this Bill is a declaration of the Government's confidence in the industry and in its future. The industry has been faced with problem after problem in the past year but with the quick and effective assistance which the State and Bord Fáilte have provided it has already rallied.  I am re-inforced in my confidence by the overwhelming interest in Ireland which was shown during my recent promotional visit to Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.  There is a very strong likelihood that in the case of the latter two countries we shall improve on our 1978 performance.  It will be a tougher job in Britain but Bord Fáilte are engaged in an all-out effort in that market and in Northern Ireland and in the home market and there is every reason to hope we may yet attain overall equality with 1978 figures, which were a record.  With this confidence and with <Col N="2711" /> the peak period only now beginning I see a profound need for an attitude which will inspire the industry in its efforts to secure a turnabout on the problems which faced it in May and June.</P>
      <P>It is no help and is damaging to tourism to speak of disaster at every turn.  We could have no better example of such damage than the BBC television programme mentioned in the debate on the previous occasion when this matter was before the Dáil.  In view of the criticism of the earlier BBC broadcast I might in fairness record that on last Monday week, I think, BBC Northern Ireland produced a feature on tourism in this part of the country which was very fair and balanced and which I think would encourage people from the North to come here on holidays.</P>
      <P>It is even worse to belittle or disparage without foundation the efforts being made to deal with the difficulties which tourism has been and is facing.  It is on these criticisms that attention will be focussed and adverse publicity abroad generated.  The tourist industry needs a positive approach to its problems which the Government along with Bord Fáilte have always offered.  The situation is not as gloomy as many people would have us believe.  I accept that the original expectations for this year are not likely to be reached and that some areas and sectors will not do as well as they did last year.  But, putting the matter in perspective, we should remember that last year was our best year ever, so that if we attain or even approach last year's level, considering the variety of problems we face this year, that will be an achievement in itself.</P>
      <P>With the fairly quick resumption of normal postal services and the special promotional measures being taken I am confident that the situation can be turned about and that the achievements of 1978 are rational targets for 1979. The introduction of the petrol voucher scheme for overseas and Northern Ireland tourists and the extra efforts Bord Fáilte have made to reassure motoring tourists, particularly in the UK, are beginning to have effect and traffic has begun to pick up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the <Col N="2712" /> Northern Ireland situation.  When he raised the matter here I felt and still feel that the organisational aspect of that is very difficult.  Nevertheless, having reconsidered it, I decided that I would adopt it.  I regret that some sectors have been very hard hit especially those in the non-STD areas but I think it is also true that the reports of setbacks in particular areas or sectors do not make for a good assessment of the overall situation.  To recover the ground lost the co-operation of all sectors that serve the industry is necessary.  In this regard I am very concerned about the unofficial action by the oil company employees.  I hope this will soon be ended so as not to undo the good results of the measures already taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that the Bill in effect is the right response to the wrong problem and that what is needed now is a massive injection of extra funds to enable Bord Fáilte to mount new promotional campaigns.  The same point, I think, was made today by Deputy O'Keeffe.  We need to intensify our promotional efforts and we have been doing so where it is most needed.  In the past few weeks Bord Fáilte spent or committed £330,000 over and above their budgeted figures in the UK alone in getting the message across that we are still very much open for business.  I am sure Deputies are also aware that Bord Fáilte have launched a campaign aimed at home holidays and the Northern Ireland market which Deputy Hegarty acknowledged are of considerable importance to us.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have a budget allocation of over £12 million, which is no mean sum, for promotion and marketing. The question of increasing that amount does not call for legislation.  I assure Deputies that there is no question of the present promotional efforts being inhibited by any inadequacy of funds.</P>
    <P>The situation in the United States market remains reasonably satisfactory considering all that has occurred, including events in the Us itself.  Since the beginning of the year Americans have been reluctant to travel abroad, mainly on cost grounds, and this has affected all destinations as I discovered on my promotional tour.  It affects Britain, Germany <Col N="2713" /> and Holland as well as Ireland. Problems of petrol supply in North America have contributed to this reluctance. Nevertheless, we hope that the US market will hold and that we will maintain or get at least close to last year's levels.</P>
    <P>Now that we are coming to the peak season, the most pressing need is for an all out effort to encourage tourists to travel to Ireland.  During my promotional trip in Britain, the Netherlands and Germany I spoke to the press, radio, television, travel and transport trades and representatives of the Irish community, and gave them the assurance that Ireland is the place this year for holidays.  This trip which I took was keyed into a major new campaign which Bord Fáilte and the carriers have launched to capture traffic for the peak months.  If we can turn things round during this critical period, last year's record levels are still attainable.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on press reports relating to British Rail advising people not to come to Ireland.  This was raised by Deputy Barry.  The reports do not represent the true picture.  One statement made by a junior staff member without authority and out of line with his company's policy has been made an occasion for further alarm and weakening of confidence in the tourist industry here.  The question was immediately taken up with British Rail.  The remark was most unfortunate and does not do us any good, but it is totally out of keeping with British Rail policy on tourism in Ireland.  British Rail demonstrated their full commitment to tourism in Ireland when they put the £20 million St. Columba on the Dún Laoghaire route in 1977.  They will have a further vessel in the next year or two.  I have a copy of a letter which the manager in the Republic of Ireland sent to the editor of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 6 July which states:</P>
    <P>Our publicity programme for the development of our Republic of Ireland business will cost us in the region of £¾ million this year and I feel that such expenditure should be ample proof of our full commitment <Col N="2714" /> to the development of tourism in this country.</P>
    <P>As regards the new scheme which the raising of the statutory limits heralds, I should make it clear that the sums made available under the Bill will be capital moneys and will be in addition to the current budget which Bord Fáilte get for promotional purposes.  The record shows that we have increased Bord Fáilte funds appreciably over the last two years. Deputy Hegarty said the Bill does not provide for a sufficient level of capital expenditure on tourism compared to other public sector programmes, but that comparison is not valid.  Despite the many prophets of doom, we are confident of maintaining growth in tourism and are aiming with new aids, to develop accommodation at the required rate without producing an over-supply.  The working of the arrangement will be kept under review and can be further considered whenever the need arises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry commented on the proposals.  He was surprised that the Department should have a role in the design and development of a hotel grant scheme.  He should recall from his own time that all capital schemes are subject to ministerial approval.  This implies the examination of the need for and the adequacy of the schemes proposed to meet particular situations.  When I studied this matter I had advice and a basic scheme drawn up by Bord Fáilte and also submissions from other sectors of industry. I took my decision on the basis of what I thought was the correct response.</P>
    <P>The new scheme gives preference to hotel extensions because during the depression in the early seventies the accumulated reserves of the hotels were largely wiped out and confidence was shaken.  The purpose is to restore confidence in the business.  By providing extra bedroom accommodation by way of extension to existing hotels which already have the necessary kitchen, function rooms and other back-up facilities, the scheme can be implemented at lesser cost than in the construction of new hotels.  It is quicker and easier to bring on an extension rather than a new construction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty feared that since assistance  <Col N="2715" /> is to be confined to bedrooms, lower standards would prevail in other areas of the hotel premises.  I can assure the Deputy that the quality of the whole undertaking and its management will be taken into account in dealing with grant applications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the manner in which these grants are being made available.  Under the old grants scheme there were suggestion that hotels were not always located in places where the greatest need existed and hotels in some cases were constructed in locations where it was difficult to achieve viable operations.  There was also the point that when the tourism downturn was experienced a number of commitments had already been entered into with the result that we went through a period of overcapacity in the hotel industry.  Under the new scheme the aim would be to provide extra rooms where demand arises.  In this way we will have a controlled and regulated expansion to meet anticipated need.  The scheme will be monitored to ensure that it is working satisfactorily. As I have said I will be prepared to consider adjustments in due course if experience suggests that that course should be adopted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty asked why kitchens and other public areas were being excluded from the existing Bord Fáilte amenities and improvement scheme and the proposed new hotel bedroom scheme.  With regard to the existing scheme I should like to state that about 67 per cent of all hotel bedrooms are fitted with a bath and the growing need is for rooms with a bath in all cases.  It is important that we should adapt quickly to match this demand.  We are aiming, therefore, to increase the proportion of bedrooms with a bath to 95 per cent by 1981.  That is why we are putting the main emphasis of the existing scheme on bedrooms.  That is in line with the aim of the new scheme, which is to increase the number of bedrooms of good marketable quality as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new scheme, I should like to state that the emphasis is on extensions where all back-up facilities such as the kitchen, function rooms and so on are already there and what is essentially  <Col N="2716" /> needed is an extra block of bedrooms.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear of the welcome given to the supplementary accommodation scheme by all speakers.  I am extending the grant scheme to the country at large and doubling the size of the fund.  I am also increasing the level of grants.  I expect that that news will be welcomed by those involved in providing farmhouse and town-and-country home accommodation.  I should mention that people who avail of this scheme undertake to make their premises available for receiving tourists for at least five years. The change will be good news for tour operators and organisers who are aware of the considerable demand by visitors for this type of accommodation, particularly the farmhouse variety which has developed into what one might term a prime tourist product in its own right.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to hear of the response given to my proposals to increase the level of capital spending on amenities and facilities for tourists.  I was heartened by the remarks about the value of the scheme throughout the country.  Sometimes there is criticism that the benefits of this spending are spread too thinly around the country so as not to have any real impact on the level of tourist activity.  I do not accept that criticism.  The infrastructural amenities and facilities provided are of the type and range which visitors and our own people are entitled to expect. Some of the facilities provided, such as the cabin cruisers and the horse-drawn caravans, are major tourist products in their own right and have a direct appeal. The non-commercial range of amenities and facilities, such as forest parks, encourage visitors to stop off for a few days during their visit.  They also help to encourage repeat business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the petrol voucher scheme, I should like to state that the introduction of this unique arrangement is an indication of the high priority which the Government attach to tourism.  It demonstrates our concern that tourism in the areas most dependent on the motoring visitor would not suffer unduly. The open-minded and flexible approach of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, by my Department <Col N="2717" /> and Bord Fáilte did much to overcome the difficulties and to get the scheme working quickly and effectively. It is a pity that there has been a disposition, to put it mildly, to make damaging remarks about the scheme which are bound to be picked up and publicised abroad.  The complaints I heard about the scheme related mainly to the first days of its operation but they have been substantially overcome and many voucher holders got supplies without using their vouchers.  One rarely hears anything about that but, on the other hand, a single case where something unfortunately goes wrong is turned into a major issue.  Not one complaint from a tourist has reached my Department in relation to the scheme.  The response of tourists to the scheme, which comes through direct surveys and indirect reportage, was good and resulted in very good word of mouth publicity from visitors on their return home.</P>
    <P>I have heard allegations that some filling stations not participating in this scheme are directing tourists to designated stations.  Such behaviour would be surprising.  Tourists are among the normal customers all over the country and in the tourist areas in particular I would have expected that filling stations would have had as big a stake in caring for tourists as either retail shops or providers of accommodation.  I should like to congratulate those private individuals and local bodies who got together to ensure that tourists get supplies and I urge others to follow their example. I do not believe that there is a need to provide further outlets for these vouchers but, as Deputies have requested that I look into this matter, I will investigate it.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that very extensive arrangements were made to help the tourist industry overcome the problems associated with the postal dispute. As in the case of petrol supplies, some of these problems were overstated in a way which could not but damage our image abroad.  Bord Fáilte tackled the problem vigorously and employed all their normal resources in communications, services and publicity to assist the industry at home to maintain contact with the market abroad.  The board had <Col N="2718" /> considerable success in the efforts they made, particularly in relation to block bookings and to STD areas generally.  I keenly appreciate, nevertheless, that there are sectors, particularly in the non-STD areas, where serious problems were encountered and where only limited help could be provided.  I am aware that in some such cases hotel and guesthouse proprietors, by very commendable self-help, managed to maintain their market contacts and are now reaping the benefit in good bookings.  Bord Fáilte have redeployed large sums from their budget for special advertising and mailing abroad to help cope with the difficulties and to produce effective counter publicity where we were getting at times adverse coverage in the media in other countries.  This will continue and the board are planning further measures, in conjunction with the industry, to maximise the benefits from the peak season.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish quite rightly drew attention to the appalling litter problem.  It will be recalled that on my initiative Bord Fáilte and private interests operated a campaign during May, at a cost of £212,000, which created a better awareness of the litter problem and helped to bring home to everybody the responsibility which we all share in this matter.</P>

      <P>I would not say that.  It may not have been as successful as we would have liked but Bord Fáilte have to be commended for the effort they put into it.  I hope they get the support of local authorities and others in the efforts to overcome the litter problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the question of the level of cross-channel fares.  In fairness to the carriers, I should say that at least they have been open with the public in trying to explain the basis for their fares policy which, while perhaps not rendering the air fare any more agreeable, increases their appreciation of why fares differ.  In this respect people tend to oversimplify the situation by comparing fares on different routes.  It may not be fully appreciated that most of the airlines costs relate to landing and <Col N="2719" /> take-off and that the route distances is not the overriding factor.  Unfortunately for us the cross-channel routes are all extremely short and they are also international routes which mean that they attract charges from which domestic servicing is exempt.  When like is compared with like I think the cross-channel fares stand up to comparison.  One of the problems is that criticism focuses on the standard fares and ignores the special fares used by tourists in particular.  I am concerned particularly&mdash;I must stress this&mdash;that Aer Lingus keep their fares at the lowest level consistent with their commercial obligations.  I know that within these limits they have been making genuine efforts to meet the needs of the Irish in Britain, especially family groupings.  For example, there have been no fare increases this year apart from an unavoidable 7 per cent fuel surcharge. While everybody loosely throws out the cost of the London/Dublin air fare as being at the level of £77, it should be remembered that the carriers offer an excursion fare at £64, an APEX fare at £57.50, a spouse special fare at £38.50 and a free way motoring flight, which includes a car, for seven days with unlimited mileage from £80.50 to £97.  Of course similar fare reductions apply from other centres in Britain.  All in all, I think they represent good value. However, I have asked Aer Lingus to maintain their vigilance so that the fares are held at the minimum possible.</P>
    <P>On the shipping side the carriers have displayed remarkable innovation over the past few years in developing traffic. They have offered huge increases in capacity and have introduced a range of fares to fill this extra capacity.  The result for the passengers has been what one might term a tempting array of special fares, family fares, mid-week and off-season fares which have resulted in a sizeable reduction in real terms in the cost of travel.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this point I should mention that it is a matter of regret that TWA, which had been operating into Ireland since 1946, have decided to withdraw their scheduled services between the United States and Ireland as from October next.  However, the airline will continue  <Col N="2720" /> to operate charters into Ireland.  It is unlikely that tourism will be affected. Aer Lingus have assured me that they have the capacity to take care of the shortfall created by TWA's departure as a scheduled operator.  The question of the designation of a US carrier to replace TWA on the North Atlantic route is a matter for the United States authorities.</P>
    <P>Overall I am satisfied that our long-term tourism prospects are good.  The industry shares this mood despite what one might term the temporary adversity we suffered this year.  We must now plan for expansion and not wait until demand outpaces available supply.  The present Bill by increasing the statutory limit will ensure that money is made available to Bord Fáilte to stimulate growth of the accommodation sector and ancillary amenities to cater for the extra tourist demand.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of presenting this Bill to the House and I have no doubt that it will be given full support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 17 and 18, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) For the purpose of the giving of grants referred to in subsection (1) of this section, &ldquo;development of holiday accommodation&rdquo; shall include all aspects of hotel development including improved hygiene and catering and the provision of additional or improved facilities and the grants may be given in respect of holiday accommodation in any part of the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2721" /> The purpose of this amendment is to broaden the scope of the Bill.  The Minister was inclined to indicate that hotels already had these facilities but, from my discussions with some hoteliers, they assert that any improvement works, such as extending of bedrooms, enlarging a dining area, kitchens and so on, are all tied up in one major operation.  My amendment seeks the inclusion of all aspects of hotel development, including improved hygiene and catering and the provision of additional or improved facilities.</P>
    <P>The second object is that major areas such as Cork and Dublin be included, in other words that such grants be applicable to hotels in all parts of the State and should not exclude such places as Cork, Dublin, Killarney and so on.  It is obvious to all of us Deputies who try to get a bed at short notice that Dublin is in a bad way for bed space.  Therefore it is unfair that Dublin or Cork be excluded from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already made the point that if a tour operator does not succeed in getting first-class accommodation in Dublin or Cork then the danger is&mdash;and I have checked this with the Hotels Federation people&mdash;the entire tour will be cancelled. Obviously we must pay attention to these places, particularly to ensure that there is first-class accommodation available in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the first part of my amendment, I would exclude bars from these grants because, from what I can ascertain, they are fairly well self-supporting and bar areas should not be included in any grant aid.  Indeed my own view of some of these hotels is that they have turned out to be types of drinking factories, which is a pity.  I should much prefer to see more interest being taken in the provision of afternoon tea or coffee, catering for families and so on.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has made a very valid point about additional bedrooms, and we must keep our priorities in order. Certainly there is one aspect the Minister should consider, that is, that where these people have to undertake the work in conjunction with the provision of extra bedrooms they should have <Col N="2722" /> the guidance and advice of Bord Fáilte in all aspects of their development.  Bearing in mind also that in the future tourists will not be as mobile the provision of some sort of indoor recreational facilities not needed heretofore should be afforded some grant aid.  Also, I emphasise that for the hotels who are having financial problems we might look at restoring the aid formerly given towards meeting the financial commitments by way of interest-free loans or helping where interest rates are now around 20 per cent and are a real burden.  We might look at hardship cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as those who undertake developments are concerned they will have the guidance and advice of Bord Fáilte.  I cannot accept the amendment.  Far from broadening the scope of the Bill, it would narrow it.  Under the Bill as it stands, nothing is excluded. &ldquo;Accommodation&rdquo; has a very broad meaning and, therefore, if the Deputy is dissatisfied with what we are proposing he is dissatisfied more with the Minister than with the legislation.  We can introduce any type of scheme under the legislation as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister is saying that it is possible that where a hotelier is putting up 15 to 20 extra bedrooms, if in addition to that he has to improve his kitchen and dining areas, it would be possible to grant aid for that as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, if I were to have that as part of the scheme, but I have not.  There is nothing wrong with the legislation.

    <Title>British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1979: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2725" /> The purpose of the Bill is to provide authority for the Minister for Finance to take up 15 million additional ordinary shares of £1 each in the B &amp; I Company. The Bill also provides for an increase of £10,000,000 in the amount of borrowings by the company which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The present Bill will bring to thirty-three million the number of ordinary shares of £1 each which the Minister for Finance is authorised to take up in addition to the ordinary shares purchased by him under the 1965 Act, and would raise the company's total authorised share capital ceiling to £35 million.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the present Bill is necessitated by the need to make provision for the capital and borrowing requirements of the B &amp; I Company in respect of a further passenger car ferry. As announced by the Taoiseach on 18 May 1979 the Government have decided to authorise the B &amp; I Company to acquire a fifth passenger car ferry from Verolme Cork Dockyard to be followed in due course by an order from Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
    <P>The new ferry for the B &amp; I, on which construction is to begin without delay, is expected to be available around mid-1981. It is expected to cost around £21 million on current indications.  This represents a very sizeable investment. The cost of the new ferry reflects the dramatic worldwide escalation in the cost of new ships in recent years.  The cost of new ships is reckoned to have quadrupled over the last ten years.  Price escalation of this order imposes an intolerable burden on shipping companies. I am satisfied that the B &amp; I Company could not finance this new vessel wholly by loan capital and that an Exchequer contribution in the form of additional equity is essential.  It is proposed, therefore, to allocate part of the additional £15 million Exchequer equity provided for in this Bill towards the cost of the new ferry.  The balance would be met by borrowings by the B &amp; I Company and in that connection the proposed increase in the State guarantee limit will provide for any guarantee which may be required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2726" /> The commissioning of additional capacity by the B &amp; I at this time is a necessary step in forward-planning taking account of the need to renew the company's fleet during the 1980s.  The company's existing ferries represented considerable advances in standards of service and passenger comfort when they were introduced in the late 1960s.  It is necessary to plan now to meet the requirements and demands of the next decade and the further new ferry vessel now to be built represents a first step in that direction.</P>
    <P>The fleet renewal programme forms an important element of the company's future development plans.  The implementation of these plans will gear the company to exploit the market opportunities of the 1980s and provide for the expected growth in traffic.</P>
    <P>Features of the company's plans, apart from fleet renewal, include the introduction of a jetfoil service between Dublin and Liverpool, early in 1980, and a new car ferry service on the southern corridor between Rosslare and Pembroke.  The company are also planning additional roll-on/roll-off freight capacity on the Irish Sea, which the company pioneered in the 1960s, and which is now a significant growth area.</P>
    <P>The company will also be providing additional capacity on their continental freight services, a market which is also showing considerable growth potential following Ireland's entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these plans will enable the company to create an additional 400 jobs within the organisation with a considerable number of further job opportunities also arising in other areas associated with the company's developments.</P>
    <P>The planned introduction next year of a jetfoil service between Dublin and Liverpool is a particularly novel development.  The B &amp; I have been in the forefront of technological change of this kind and over many years have been studying both hovercraft and hydrofoil modes of transport.  The culmination of these efforts will be the introduction of this new service which enables the company to offer a completely new concept in surface travel across the Irish Sea in <Col N="2727" /> conditions of maximum passenger comfort with a crossing time of approximately 3 hours city centre to city centre.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I were taken into State ownership in 1965 mainly to secure a greater measure of Irish participation in cross-Channel services in the interest of trade and tourism generally.  I believe that this objective has been very largely achieved by the company despite the extremely competitive conditions prevailing on the Irish Sea.  The company now carries a significant proportion of all passengers, cars and freight moving on cross-Channel sea services and is thus in a strong position to influence the competitiveness and the quality of service to Irish tourism and to Irish exporters and importers.  The company's well-established freight services to Europe have also assumed a greater significance with our membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The recent report on the B &amp; I by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored bodies is under consideration by my Department and the B &amp; I.  The Joint Committee made a very probing examination of the activities of the B &amp; I and the committee were impressed by the company's market performance and expansion of trade in the passenger and freight markets and also by their record of social commitment to the community evidenced by the moneys invested over recent years in having ships built at Verolme instead of abroad.  The committee made a number of very interesting suggestions on a number of points and I have arranged for my Department to examine these critically in consultation with the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic expansion in the activities of the B &amp; I company since their passage into State ownership in 1965.  1978 was the company's most successful year to date.  Passenger, freight and car carryings rose to record levels.  A record net profit of £1.35 million was achieved, although the company consider that this could have been over £2 million but for net losses of nearly £900,000 caused by labour disputes outside the company's control at various ports to which the company operate services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2728" /> The continued development of the company and the provision of new vessels and ancillary equipment to that end is important in the furtherance of national development.  Apart from the essential services which they operate in the interest of trade and tourism, the company's activities are of very considerable direct benefit to the economy. For example, 65 per cent of their turnover is earned in the form of valuable foreign exchange while 71 per cent of their expenditure is made in Ireland thus maximising the benefits to the economy. They provide employment for nearly 2,000 people and their total annual payroll is over £10 million.  Between 1968 and 1978 they paid £31 million to Verolme Cork Dockyard for the construction of five new vessels and the conversion and overhaul of others.  The present car ferry order will provide full employment at Verolme Cork Dockyard for the next two years.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the present Bill will provide a basis for the continued development of the B &amp; I company.  I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill involves a sum of £15 million which is not at all dissimilar to the previous Bill we discussed here today.  People might be inclined to say that this is just another mickey mouse Bill where we pass more money for State-sponsored bodies.  However, this is far from the case.  I have studied the 1978 annual report of B &amp; I, the annual report for the other State-sponsored shipping company, Irish Shipping Limited and also the report of the Joint Committee of the House of the Oireachtas which examined the affairs of B &amp; I some months ago.  I am very perturbed at the performance of B &amp; I, not just for 1978 but for many years past.  I have also consulted many people who are involved in the shipping industry.  I am sorry to say they support the poor impression I have formed of the performance of B &amp; I for many years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a growing tendency in this country to shout &ldquo;nationalise&rdquo; when an industry is seen to be in financial difficulties and when employment is jeopardised. <Col N="2729" /> There is a certain amount of merit in a demand like that but it does not mean we should support it at any cost.  I have been told that the share capital being demanded by B &amp; I is in excess of that for Aer Lingus, a far greater concern which has far greater assets and far greater commitments and does far greater work for the State at large.  I have been told that this is a case of pouring good money after bad down the drain.  I would like the Minister to state if he has had expert independent opinion about the performance of B &amp; I since their formation in 1965 when they were purchased from Coast Line Limited, the shipping company which were the original British and Irish Steam Packet Company.</P>
    <P>The State at that time allowed the company a share capital of £1.6 million and we have come from that figure up to the present level of £35 million if this Bill is passed.  I would like to quote from the original motivation which led to the formation of this semi-State body, as stated in the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, Second Report, page 11:</P>
    <P>The company was taken into public ownership to secure a greater measure of Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade .... continue to be operated on strictly commercial lines.</P>
    <P>That is very important because the company do not seem to have been operated on strictly commercial lines.  I also want to refer to page 15 of the same report where one of the objectives of the company is outlined as follows:</P>
    <P>To provide and develop a modern, efficient, profitable national and comprehensive surface transport system to and from Ireland.</P>
    <P>The company have not been profitable, despite the fact that the share capital was increased from £1.6 million in 1965 to £4.6 million in 1971, to £20 million in 1976 and now we are being asked to increase that share capital to £35 million.  I have spoken to many people involved in the shipping world and those involved in other semi-state bodies about this company. <Col N="2730" /> The company are operating on a small scale, internationally speaking, but, nationally speaking, they may not be operating on a small scale.  It is incomprehensible that a company operating on such a scale should be demanding this kind of money year after year.  When the board was formed in 1955, the word &ldquo;profitability&rdquo; was used as one of the objectives but the operation has been anything but profitable.  In this report there were put forward a number of ideas to the joint committee but I venture to suggest that that committee did not carry out their job properly.  In saying that it is not my intention to criticise any one party or to criticise the Minister or the Government.  All parties are represented on that committee though unfortunately it was not a healthy sign that on the occasion in question only half the members attended the meeting. At two such inquiries I note that only six of the 11 members were present while at a third inquiry there were only five present. This indicates a lack of interest on the part of the members concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board we are concerned with here were the subject of the first such inquiry into the working of any State-sponsored body.  But I do not think that the committee succeeded in eliciting the relevant facts.  That is not to say that they were told why or that they were misled but it is doubtful that they used their terms of reference in a manner that would have enabled them to examine the affairs of the company as they should have been examined.</P>
    <P>The committee's terms of reference provided that, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, the committee may engage the services of persons with technical or specialist knowledge to assist in inquiries.  In other words, the committee have the authority to engage specialists who would be in a position to offer a third-party opinion. Obviously, it is very difficult for ordinary laymen like ourselves to understand the detailed workings of a major national company such as the B &amp; I.  So far as the committee were concerned they were dependent on the information supplied by members of the board of that company.  I am sure that the board <Col N="2731" /> members were forthcoming in their answering but no doubt they could have been asked much more searching questions in which case we would have been in a much better position today to adjudicate as to whether the company was being run in a proper manner, on sound commercial lines.  From the inquiries I have made in the meantime it would appear that the company is not operating effectively and that this House should have cause for concern in that regard. Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether he has made any independent inquiry into the situation.  I am not an advocate of the nationalisation of industry because I do not believe that such nationalisation leads to maximum efficiency. Quite often it leads to inefficiency.</P>
    <P>Last week while debating a private notice question we discussed these matters and made the point that if some of our semi-State industries, such as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, were handed over to private enterprise they would probably become big profit-making bodies rather than being big loss-making bodies as they are now.  It is unfortunate that State-sponsored bodies should be losing so much money.  My opinion is that any time it is possible for us to transfer a State-sponsored operation to private enterprise, we should seriously consider such a move.  Further nationalisation can only result in an increased burden on the taxpayer and on the Exchequer if our experience so far in this area is to continue to be the norm. The B &amp; I represent a glowing example of a company which should be operated on a profit and which could justifiably be handed back to private enterprise. That possibility should be considered.  A deficit of £35 million is a heavy burden on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It is said that anything can be proved by way of statistics but the statistics as outlined in the B &amp; I report for 1978 are identical with the statistics given to the committee.  They emanate from the same source and I have no reason to doubt their authenticity.  They show that the company carried in 1978 one-and-a-half million tons of freight, 760,000 passengers and 154,000 cars.  To illustrate <Col N="2732" /> the point I am making we might compare this company with Irish Shipping who are involved in the same type of operation but who have not been registering losses for many years. Indeed, Irish Shipping have not received a subvention from any Government since the late fifties or early sixties, and I expect that the scale of their operations is far in excess of those of the B &amp; I line. In these circumstances we are entitled to ask why B &amp; I cannot also show a profit.  If it is not the intention to hand the B &amp; I back to private enterprise we should at least amalgamate the company with Irish Shipping, since there can hardly be justification for having two semi-State bodies when one is registering severe losses and the other registering high profits.  Irish Shipping have been so successful that they have been able to underwrite their own capital expenditure, whereas the other concern continue to look for increasing subventions. Subvention of £15 million in present circumstances is not something that we should regard lightly.</P>
    <P>The shipping industry in general is going through a bad patch, but even at the best of times it is a dicey business.  A huge oil tanker may cost millions of £s but even in the Harland and Wolff yard in Belfast a couple of new tankers have had to be left there because of buyers refusing to accept them, there not being any business for them.  In the Irish Shipping report for 1978 the chairman said the best way to go broke in shipping nowadays is to own an oil tanker.  But it is unpredictable business.  It is not a business in which you will make a fortune but Irish Shipping have shown that by astute management and by coupling up with other firms in the shipping business, it can be a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>At the moment Irish Shipping have eight large cargo tramp vessels ranging in weight from 26,000 tons to something like 40,000 tons, together with two car ferries, the St. Killian and the St. Patrick.  B &amp; I operate nine ships.  Four of those are car ferries.  The others are involved in the freight business but their involvement is not as great as that of Irish Shipping.  They own one of the five freight vessels.  Two of them are on long-term <Col N="2733" /> lease, although managed by their own personnel, and one is jointly operated by the company and the P &amp; O line on a long-term charter, and the ninth vessel involved is on short-term charter. At a time when there is great instability in the shipping industry, and when profits are low if not non-existent, Irish Shipping with a far greater liability and a far greater amount of tonnage are making money, and B &amp; I are a heavy loser.</P>
    <P>To illustrate my point I will quote briefly from press reports about the recent AGM of Irish Shipping.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> says: &ldquo;Profits Top £3 million at Irish Shipping.&rdquo;  The <i>Cork Examiner</i> states: &ldquo;Irish Shipping on the Crest of a Wave.&rdquo;  The <i>Irish Press</i> says: &ldquo;Irish Shipping rides out of the recession.&rdquo; That illustrates the point I am making that shipping generally has gone through a very tough period.  The <i>Irish Times</i> says: &ldquo;Sparkling Profits from Irish Shipping.&rdquo;  Their profits for 1978 were in excess of £3 million net.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I made a profit for 1978.  It was not a very big profit but it was a profit, which contrasts rather starkly with the fact that they have been making losses year in year out, and some of them pretty heavy losses.  Therefore they asked for other handouts from the Exchequer, in this case £15 million.  The Minister should ask B &amp; I a very pertinent question: &ldquo;Why do you have to come cap in hand time after time looking for subventions to buy new boats when Irish Shipping can do it from their own profits?&rdquo;  If Irish Shipping can do it from their profits, why cannot B &amp; I?</P>
    <P>In 1978 B &amp; I carried 760,000 passengers and, in the same period, Irish Shipping a mere 161,000 passengers. The imbalance can hardly be blamed upon the carrying capacity of the two companies.  Irish Shipping carry far less, and their capacity to carry is far less. B &amp; I have the major portion of the market.  That market may not be as lucrative as that operated by Irish Shipping. For the benefit of Members of the House, B &amp; I operate two passenger services, one from Dublin to Liverpool and one from Cork to Swansea, or more latterly from Cork to Pembroke Dock. <Col N="2734" /> They are not as long as the runs operated by Irish Shipping who ply between Rosslare Harbour and Le Harve, and Rosslare Harbour and Cherbourg. There is not a major difference, and surely the numbers involved more than make up for the imbalance in the length of the runs.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask for, and the Minister should demand, a definite explanation as to why one company can make money and the other company can lose money hand over fist.  The taxpayer is entitled to ask that question.  The question does not seem to have been asked. As representatives of the taxpayer, we are entitled to an explanation.  If a reasonably good explanation is not forthcoming, it is time for the Minister and the Government to do something about it.  I have put the options in front of the Minister: either to amalgamate the two companies and use the superior management and expertise at his disposal or hand it back to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we should increase the number of State-sponsored bodies. We should be getting out of nationalised industry.  The EMS situation has not helped.  It is not so easy nowadays to go abroad and invest money, with our pound in such a shaky state.  It is a far better proposition for an Irish investor with money in hand to keep it at home if a good business proposition is put to him.  That is all the more reason why we should be endeavouring to coax and encourage people with large amounts of finance to invest in companies which are capable of making major profits in private hands, but which are losing millions in public ownership.</P>
    <P>I have never seen so many red herrings as there are in the Report of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  There are wonderful new ideas as to how B &amp; I will improve their situation although, if you read their 1978 report, you will note from the chairman's comments at the end of the report that, while they made a profit in 1978, things look very gloomy for 1979, and he lists about three different reasons. We are going back to the old position where B &amp; I will be a liability next year and probably for a long number of years <Col N="2735" /> to come.  I hope what I say is not true but, on past performance, it is the likelihood for the future.  There is a possibility that some of the major undertakings which they propose entering into will be disastrous.  I will illustrate the likelihood of such ventures being uneconomic.</P>
    <P>In the report the chairman is not too optimistic.  They are looking for £15 million, £10 million of which is to go to buy a new car ferry.  It is very strange, and certainly would not encourage a businessman to invest his money in such a company, to see such a quick change of mind.  Last September, B &amp; I approached the Government for £5 million to purchase a new roll-on roll-off freight carrier.  You might say it seemed like a sensible idea at the time.  Less than six months later they changed their minds and came back to the Government with a completely different proposal for £10 million for a new car ferry.  They scrapped the original proposal for the roll-on/roll-off vessel.</P>
    <P>I should like to know has the Minister questioned the board of B &amp; I on this quick turnabout.  Surely that overnight change in thinking must cause some doubts in his mind as to the capabilities of the people involved.  We know there has been a major change in the type of freight transportation on the Irish Sea and on the continental runs.  Whereas containerisation was all the go up to seven or eight years ago, and B &amp; I invested heavily in that mode of sea transport, nowadays roll-on roll-off has taken over almost exclusively.  Containerisation is no longer a paying proposition. B &amp; I are left with a major part of their operations in that form.  They are anxious to get out of the container trade and to confine themselves exclusively to roll-on-roll-off. They have suddenly decided not to build a roll-on roll-off type of ship but to lease one.  However, they want to buy a car ferry.  They have not been using one of their existing four car ferries for some time.  As late as last week the car ferry in question, the <i>m.v. Munster</i>, was leased to a firm plying the car ferry trade in the British Channel.  Why do they want to buy a new vessel for £10 <Col N="2736" /> million when they have not been using one of their four existing vessels?  The vessel may be a bit old but it cannot be said that it is obsolete.  If it has been accepted on the British Channel run it must be capable of doing quite a bit of work.  Its capacity is twice that of two of the other vessels, if my information is correct.  It is still capable of carrying 250 cars, which is the capacity of two of the other three ferries in operation, the <i>m.v. Leinster</i> and the <i>m.v. Innisfallen.</i></P>
    <P>The company paid in the region of £10 million for a new car ferry in 1976. It came into operation during the winter. I had the pleasure of travelling on it and thought it was a fine ship.  However, I am told that it may not be such a fine ship.  As this is only hearsay, I should like the Minister to ask some experts in the business to either verify or deny what I am saying.  I am told that it is wrong for the type of business for which it is used.  The fault does not lie with the builders; it lies with the people who designed it, a British team of architects. It has also been alleged that there are some major defects in the design which were not discovered until the ship was partly built.  Expensive modifications had to be made to the ship to the exclusion of a great deal of its capacity.  I should like the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee were not capable of examining the affairs of the company without expert advice.  The committee failed because they did not utilise their powers of calling in independent experts to advise them.  They were given only one side of the story.  The setting up of the Committee was a good idea, but if they are to be of any use independent expert knowledge must be available to them.  The report reads like the old pals act.  Everybody was being clapped on the back and told that they were doing a great job.  They are not doing a great job and I hope I have managed to illustrate some of the deficiencies.</P>
    <P>One of the good things about the B &amp; I in recent years is that they were the first company to elect employees to their board of directors.  The new board has twelve directors, four of them elected by <Col N="2737" /> the employees of the company.  That is industrial democracy in action and I hope it will work satisfactorily.  I have every confidence that it will work well.  I am sure that the four directors concerned, who would have an intimate knowledge of the company and of shipping, will help to improve the lack of expert knowledge which has been so evident.</P>
    <P>The cattle exporting section of the farming industry was very annoyed with B &amp; I.  To try to curtail their losses they discontinued the livestock export section of their business.  The decision to do so was a great disservice to our cattle exporters who have problems, especially when there are outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain and they can only export to a limited number of ports. The decision to discontinue the service may have cut losses but it eradicated one of their social obligations.</P>
    <P>In the report there is the suggestion by the executives of B &amp; I that they enter the continental car ferry business.  The suggestion is that it be a joint venture with Irish Shipping who have made such a success of that business since they went into it in conjunction with Normandy Ferries.  Normandy Ferries, as the Minister probably knows, pulled out of that business in 1973 and Irish Shipping have run the business on their own ever since.  I believe that they own 99.96 per cent of the shares in the business and that CIE own the remainder.  B &amp; I want to get into that business because Irish Shipping have made a success of it.  I can tell the Minister that Irish Shipping do not want to know anything about it.  The suggestions in the report that there might be agreement or that plans are being discussed are a lot of eyewash.  The venture has been successful and has earned a great deal of money for Irish Shipping, so why should they share their profit with B &amp; I.  It has been suggested in the report that some of the ferries being operated by B &amp; I would be suitable for the Le Havre-Cherbourg run.  Shipping experts tell me that the B &amp; I ferries would be most unsuitable for this run because of severe weather conditions and the length of time at sea, which requires <Col N="2738" /> a vessel of greater capacity than any of those presently owned by B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>The other red herring in the report is that B &amp; I hope to introduce a jetfoil service between Dublin and Liverpool in April 1980.  My information is that this idea is very risky.  It sounds like desperation on the part of B &amp; I that they are going to try something which has never been tried before.  It is going to be the longest sea run by jetfoil yet attempted. That venture should be treated with caution.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer back to the section of the report which deals with that jetfoil innovation, if I may call it that.  That report refers to European Ferries.  They are a shipping firm who have been making heavy profits in the car ferry business.  They operate at a 15 per cent profit margin according to this report and that is extremely high in shipping circles.  It is by emulating that type of performance that Irish Shipping have made their profits on the continental run and it would seem that B &amp; I want to attempt a bit of the same action.</P>
    <P>In the report Senator Cooney asked if they ran the jetfoil on the English Channel. Mr. Mulligan of B &amp; I replied that was not so, that that was the P &amp; O line. Senator Cooney then asked if that was profitable.  Mr. Mulligan replied that he did not know at the moment because it was experimental.  That speaks for itself. Is the Irish taxpayer obliged to be a guinea pig?  There is a further run through where we are told that it will run for 11 months of the year but, with weather conditions in the Irish Sea, can anybody here visualise with certainty for how long in the year a jetfoil service will run?  We know that a jetfoil service is influenced by climatic conditions and I would not like to bet too heavily on such a venture.  If the admission here in the report is that it is experimental it must give rise to concern and in view of the performance of B &amp; I in the past I am expressing that concern here this evening.</P>
    <P>Another very important issue that runs right through this report and keeps arising is the social obligation of B &amp; I to the Irish shipbuilding industry.  We know that B &amp; I had their last car ferry, the <i>Connacht</i>, built by the Verolme <Col N="2739" /> Cork Dockyard.  We all laud the idea of having Irish ships built in Irish shipyards, but I would hate to think that B &amp; I were using Verolme as an excuse for the uneconomic running of their company.  It surely should be possible to differentiate between the excess cost of building at Verolme and the cost of building elsewhere.  We should be able to differentiate between that portion of the losses incurred by B &amp; I through that activity and losses incurred elsewhere.  We have no means at present of determining how much the losses of B &amp; I can be attributed to this social obligation of having their ships built here.  I would hate to think that they could get away with the excuse that a major portion of their losses could be explained in that manner because I believe that would be blatantly untrue.  I am not asserting that but some people would read that into the situation.</P>
    <P>In fact their earlier ferries were all built abroad, some of them in Germany and one in Yugoslavia, so that argument would not hold water.  In that inquiry the question was asked by Senator Cooney if the level of profitability and B &amp; I's return on capital were as big as they might be or than they would otherwise be if they had not that constraint, that is, to build their ships in Ireland.  Mr. Mulligan replied that a major example would be the car ferries.  He said that in relation to the three car ferries that were bought in 1968 and 1969, Verolme's price was only marginally greater than the German prices and that those were built abroad.  So it is no good blaming the Verolme dockyard for B &amp; I's losses. There is a tendency to do that and I would ask the Minister to try to divorce the finance involved so that we would know exactly what was being lost due to the shipping activities and separate that from the excess being spent in building the ships in Verolme.  I know we should subsidise Verolme and we are all prepared to do it to maintain employment. We know that other countries throughout Europe are subsidising their shipyards in order to keep employment going and to keep their shipbuilding industry going, but we would like to see the cost of the social obligation as it is referred to.  Can the Minister put a price <Col N="2740" /> on that because it is valuable information and as far as I can see from this report no attempt has been made to figure it out.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the report that the profitability of this shipbuilding business is largely with the passenger carrying and car-carrying content, that freight is a more difficult thing to assess and that it probably runs at a loss most years.  I do not know if the Minister has any views on that or if he has any suggestions as to whether the whole operation of B &amp; I might be switched from freight to passenger carrying only.</P>
    <P>In finalising my statement here this evening I would reiterate that it seems alarming that a shipping company with such a lucrative run, who are carrying in excees of three quarters of a million passengers annually, should in most years lose money, at the very best make a tiny profit, and at all times when they need capital come back to the Government for millions and millions of pounds.  Any such company in private hands would no doubt operate at a profit and not at a loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this Bill.  I am pleased that Dáil Éireann has decided to authorise the Minister for Finance to take up a further £15 million in additional ordinary shares of £1 in the B &amp; I and also that we are providing an increase of £10 million in the borrowings which the company may obtain by guarantee from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess that I am rather aghast at the contribution from Deputy Deasy because I have never heard such an erroneous condermnation of the role of a company, such an erroneous condemnation of the concept of a State-sponsored body and such an erroneous analysis of the role of other State companies in the shipping field, whether on the high seas or cross-Channel.  As we know, in the national interest in 1965 the State purchased the B &amp; I from Coast Lines Limited for the express purpose, which was fully supported at that time by Deputy Deasy's party, of securing a greater measure of Irish involvement in cross-Channel trade which was then in a <Col N="2741" /> state of chaos and was not being operated on strictly commercial lines; it was very fragmented.  The work done by the B &amp; I since 1965 has been generally effective.  It has been working on a very attenuated and limited capital base. Even with this injection by the State the present Bill will bring to 33 million the number of ordinary shares and in the case of the total authorised share capital of the company, the ceiling will be raised to only £35 million.  For a major shipping company £35 million capital is not very large.  This is a crucial factor in the role and operation of any State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>I find the criticisms of Deputy Deasy extraordinary.  They were not shared and were never given voice to either by Deputy Cooney, vice-Chairman of the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies or Deputy O'Donnell, who has ministerial experience and who was very much involved in the examination of the B &amp; I by that Joint Committee.  At no stage was there any suggestion whatever that B &amp; I should be sold back to private enterprise in this country.  I do not know of any politician in the Houses of the Oireachtas other than Deputy Deasy to come forward with that proposition.  I do not know who has been advising him, whether it is a Waterford source or another State-sponsored shipping company source or whether these were his own observations.  I have met the chief executives of the B &amp; I, the board and workers' representatives on the board and I have visited the ships and installations of the B &amp; I, and at no stage could I find support for the extraordinary views expressed here today by Deputy Deasy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy seems to suggest that there can be some comparison between Irish Shipping and the B &amp; I.  That is like comparing Bord and Móna with Aer Lingus.  The two companies are engaged in entirely different enterprises and to suggest that one can compare the continental passenger carrying work of Irish Shipping with the cross-Channel work of the B &amp; I is not rational.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what Deputy Deasy is aiming at.  He suggested that the two <Col N="2742" /> companies should be amalgamated at one stage: at another stage he felt that in no circumstances should they be amalgamated because Irish Shipping would be mad if they amalgamated with the B &amp; I.  I do not know his mind except that it seems to me there is some sort of ideological block in relation to the role of the B &amp; I.  We are all under pressure coming to the end of a session and I am sorry Deputy Deasy is not here at this stage to comment further on Committee Stage.  I know we must take the Bill quickly this evening.</P>
    <P>The constraint on the B &amp; I Company has been massive.  This is of considerable importance: there has not been planned State capital investment in the company down through the years since 1965. Rather we have had the situation of the B &amp; I seeking capital and, depending on its availability, capital being allocated. There is not very much of a State transport policy either at the internal or cross-Channel level or indeed at the international level, even in terms of air transport.  We had an amalgam of general responses and within that the B &amp; I have, by and large, operated quite well, even though they have been substantially under-capitalised through the years.  They are doing quite well with the nine vessels they operate.  One cannot, as seems to be implied by Deputy Deasy, blame the B &amp; I for the fact that we had a miserable tourist season in 1972 and 1973 when there was a negative return on capital employed by the company.</P>
    <P>Of course the B &amp; I want a capital return higher than 6, 7 or 8 per cent.  If it has to lease one of its ships at present and to take it off the Irish runs one can not blame the company because at present one finds that British Rail have taken car ferries off the Dun Laoghaire-Holyhead run because of the downturn in tourism.  Companies naturally respond to the market situation.  It is ludicrous to suggest that there is something particularly wrong with the motor vessel &ldquo;Munster&rdquo; and that the whole capital structure of the company is out of gear and inherently unprofitable.</P>
    <P>I have some criticisms of the operation of the B &amp; I.  These are contained in <Col N="2743" /> the Joint Committees Report.  We had criticisms to make of capital gearing&mdash; not so much criticism as comments. These comments are there for everybody to read.  We feel the question of depreciation of vessels requires special examination by the company.  There has been a tendency in the company to undertake investment appraisals in constant prices. We have drawn attention to that and the Minister has responded in a rational manner by saying that some of the suggestions in our report are interesting and will be examined by the Department.  On that basis I have no doubt that the work of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored bodies will be highly effective. We expressed the view in our report that underlying assumptions regarding relative cost increases in material such as fuel should be spelled out by the B &amp; I in its commentary on the corporate projections it has made.  We made various suggestions in our report and the report is in the Dáil Library.  It has been published and made available.</P>
    <P>As regards Irish Shipping, we have expressed the view that there should be greater liaison between the B &amp; I and Irish Shipping.  We have drawn attention on page 35 of the report to the fact that both companies will be operating into Rosslare Harbour in 1980.  The Joint Committee considered that the proposal for a car ferry between Ireland and the Continent on a joint basis should be decided on as quickly as possible.  The Joint Committee favoured co-ordination between the two State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Deasy was getting at.  If he is of the opinion that the State will hand back the B &amp; I to private enterprise he will be waiting for a long time before that comes about.  If he is suggesting that B &amp; I ships should be built abroad the workers at Verolme would be rather aghast at that proposition. There has devolved on the B &amp; I the general obligation and the State policy that their ships should, as far as possible, be constructed at Verolme. This is a policy which the joint Committee, on balance, notwithstanding the fact that it is more costly to so do, support. The ideological nonsense we go on with between State-sponsored bodies and <Col N="2744" /> private enterprise companies explodes when one thinks of the fact that if the Department of Defence vessels and the ships for the B &amp; I were not constructed at Verolme the company would not be operating even on a private enterprise basis.  It would have gone into receivership a long time ago.</P>
    <P>The car ferry order envisaged by this Bill will provide full employment at Verolme Cork Dockyard for the next two years.  I do not see what argument can be made.  Verolme is a private company. Let us sell it to some Dutch shipbuilding company and we will see how anxious such a company would be to take it over.</P>
    <P>As regards employing expert advice the committee considered that.  We had available to us on a full-time basis our own expert staff and advice and assistance from Mr. Tom Ferris.  I should inform Deputy Deasy that he worked for B &amp; I before he worked for the NESC and before he began to work full-time for the Joint Committee.  We did not require to engage full-time staff but had we felt it in any way desirable we would have done so.</P>
    <P>We shall have an opportunity in the Joint Committee of examining Irish Shipping Limited and I shall put some of the questions posed by Deputy Deasy today to them to know if they represent the commercial and State-sponsored view of Irish Shipping.  Their reply should be interesting.  Perhaps it is the view of some other shipping company down south which Deputy Deasy is echoing.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>It is not wise for Deputies to come in here on a party political basis in a situation where Members of their own party on that <Col N="2745" /> Committee, for example, Senator Cooney and Deputy O'Donnell and other Members nominated to serve on the committee, find themselves signing reports totally at variance with the view expressed on behalf of Members.  It is all very illuminating in terms of the individual view of Members.  It is not fair to attack a State-sponsored body without somebody on this side of the House having the opportunity to reply on behalf of that company.</P>
      <P>B &amp; I in 1966 carried 22,000 cars on their traffic lines; today it is carrying 154,000 cars.  It carried 370,000 passengers in 1966; today it is carrying 758,000.  In freight tons the growth of the company has gone from 381,000 tons to 1,468,000 tons.  These have been phenomenal average annual increases. They reflect the growth of the economy. That has been done at a very small cost to the taxpayer.  We have an efficient, modern, reasonably profitable national surface transport system to and from Ireland in a cross-Channel area which was once the most expensive stretch of water in the world.  Now with the introduction of car ferries and roll-on/roll-off the cost has been reduced.  On that basis we can say that we have a reasonably viable and effective company.</P>
      <P>We should not drag in red herrings such as the B &amp; I opting out of carrying livestock.  That is a story which is interesting to tell and is justifiable in the context of the commercial operation of the B &amp; I.  There is not a cattleman in the country who does not know that B &amp; I were better off out of it and it is being operated in a better way at present.  B &amp; I explained at great length why they opted out, the reasons why another company is operating it and why the livestock trade is getting an equally efficient and effective service.

      <P>Deputy Deasy is well able to look after himself and I do not propose to delve into that side of it.  This Bill provides for an additional car ferry. For some time one of the problems in bringing people from the UK here was that we did not have an adequate service. There was overcrowding especially on the Rosslare line.  I welcome the Bill on the basis that we are now going on the right direction.  The performance of the B &amp; I, especially with their new ship, the <i>Connacht</i>, is in line with the continental-type service.  The importance of the car ferry cannot be over stressed because the tourist gains his first and last impressions of the country on that ferry.  It is important that a good service is provided on that car ferry.  It is hard to measure the profits of B &amp; I, but if the company helps to impress tourists that should be considered a profit.  I welcome the plan of the company to build a car ferry in Verolme Dockyard.  That shipyard has had to diversify into a lot of other work such as repairs to keep the massive workforce going but they need to build ships.</P>

      <P>I share the amazement of Deputy Desmond at the contribution of Deputy Deasy.  Bearing in mind the expansion that B &amp; I had to undertake, the company is very successful.  The losses sustained by the company since 1965 were to a considerable extent a reflection of the heavy burden of debt-servicing arising from the company's attempt to modernise the fleet in the late sixties wholly from borrowings.  I should like to make it clear that B &amp; I made a profit in most years.</P>

Had it not been for the considerable losses sustained by the company <Col N="2747" /> due to labour disputes in various ports to which the company operate, something which is outside the control of the company, they would have made a profit of £2 million.

      <P>As well as being profitable in the last year, it should also be remembered that the company in its operations provides considerable employment.  As Deputy Hegarty stated, it has contributed exceptionally to the development of tourism and portrayed its social obligation to the country by having ships built in Verolme Dockyard resulting in considerable local employment.</P>
      <P>Following its takeover by the State in 1965 the company had to undertake a very comprehensive modernisation programme which was funded almost entirely by borrowings.  The servicing of that debt placed a considerable burden on the company and this affected its profitability over a number of years.  It was precisely to correct the imbalance in the company's debt-equity ratio that the B &amp; I Acts of 1971 and 1976 were passed to increase the company's share capital and bring the debt-equity ratio into a more reasonable balance.  The sum of £15 million being provided for in this Bill must be understood in the context of the massive worldwide escalation in the cost of new ships.  All shipping companies face great difficulties in financing new vessels wholly out of earnings and I do not know of any company that is capable of financing ships out of its own earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked whether or not the company's performance and capital structures had been examined.  In 1970 such an examination was carried out.  I do not wish to be led into the situation of comparing  <Col N="2748" /> the B &amp; I with Irish Shipping Limited and pin-pointing their virtues and defects.  We should examine each on its merits.  Irish Shipping have not had to undertake the fleet modernisation which the B &amp; I had to engage in.  The vessel <i>Munster</i> was mentioned.  That vessel initially was intended for traffic here this year, but because of the downturn in prospects in tourism it was decided to put it on stand-by on the understanding that it would be brought back if necessary. That is not to say that we do not have the same carrying capacity this year as we had last year.  We have the same carrying capacity as far as the B &amp; I is concerned as we had last year.</P>
    <P>Our tourist potential is great.  We will have considerable expansion in that industry in the years to come.  For that reason the B &amp; I is correct in planning for this expansion for the future.  The company is also affected by competition from British Rail and that does not apply to Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>With regard to the jetfoil, I should like to state that the B &amp; I has always been to the forefront of technological change. The company studied the jet foil and hydrofoil modes of transport in recent years and the proposed jetfoil service is the culmination of that study.  The service to some extent, is experimental.  But the company is confident of its viability bearing in mind the attraction it offers, and I believe it will be a success.  The B &amp; I are a very successful and worthwhile company.</P>

      <P>In page 4, lines 29 to 31, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the amount&rdquo; in line 29 down to and including &ldquo;so prescribed,&rdquo; in line 31.</P>
      <P>The Bill with which we are dealing introduces a levy of £3 per head per animal slaughtered and .5p per gallon of milk processed to raise £10 million for disease eradication.  This is one of many levies being imposed on the farming community.  If taken in isolation it might not be objectionable but, taken in conjunction with the other levies being imposed, it is most certainly objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent the levy which is being introduced at the figures I have mentioned being increased in future by order, and the Minister does have power in the Bill to introduce an increased levy by order. We wish that this would not be possible and, if a new and higher levy is introduced, that it be required that the Minister bring in legislation here in the normal way.  In effect it is possible for this levy to become nothing more than another form of taxation.  If the Minister for Finance, in introducing taxation, wishes to increase it, he must bring a Bill before the Houses which must go through five stages of consideration in both Houses.  However, under this Bill, if this amendment is not accepted, the Minister for Agriculture is taking the power to increase taxation without that process, but simply by order which must be accepted by a single resolution which will be debated here once without the necessity of going through the stages I mentioned or any possibility of amendments being introduced; the resolution is introduced and the order must be accepted <i>in toto</i>, with no possibility of amendment.  That is an unsatisfactory <Col N="2750" /> procedure.  The Minister for Finance&mdash;if he is introducing taxation&mdash;must go through the process of introducing a Bill. I believe that if the Minister for Agriculture is going to increase the taxation contained in this Bill he, too, should have to introduce legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a rather exhaustive discussion on this subject on the Second Reading.  I attempted to point out, evidently without much success, first of all, the urgency of the disease eradication problem and the consequent requirement of very large sums of money which, in the context of the expenditure of moneys on disease eradication, most likely will go up, for the time being at any rate until the real results being to make themselves felt.</P>
      <P>It is not correct, nor can it be contended, that this is some kind of sinister or underhand device by which the Minister for Agriculture can arrogate to himself the functions of the Minister for Finance and use this legislation whose stated and specific purpose is to collect money for the eradication of bovine disease alone as an ordinary method of tax collection.  That simply is not the case. For a Minister for Agriculture, as they come and go, to be unduly hamstrung by having to introduce the measures recommended by Deputy Bruton and his colleagues would be to render the disease eradication programme thus far ineffective or, at any rate, reduce its effectiveness. There is no valid, positive reason for so doing, having taken the unpleasant decision to levy cattle and milk sales for this specific purpose, for the benefit of the cattle herd, the owners of which as I have already pointed out are the farmers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that our cattle herd is probably the biggest, single economic factor in our whole economic structure. It is true also that this enormous national asset is owned by our farmers. It is unassailable that they have a particular interest&mdash;for their well-being&mdash;in the rapid eradication of disease, that this will require constant fuelling with money; that the eradication army, no more than any other army, will not <Col N="2751" /> march without the sinews of the disease war, which is money also.  It would be better were there some other source for raising the necessary money.  Unfortunately there is not.  But there is a case that can be made&mdash;which I have made already during the discussion of this Bill &mdash;that the people who will be the first beneficiaries of its good results and of the very expenditure itself&mdash;in that sense it is an investment in their own future&mdash;will be our farmers.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments proposed by Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not really answered the case.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent this levy being increased beyond the amount of money necessary for the financing of disease eradication.  There is no statutory guarantee that that may not be done at some time in the future. Therefore, this Bill could become one of general taxation.  Amendments introduced by me on Committee Stage to prevent that happening were not accepted. Therefore the position remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in seeking to speak of the urgency of disease eradication in this context, in my view, is not stating the facts as they are; the introduction of this levy does not help to accelerate disease eradication.  Indeed it creates temptations for farmers to seek illicit means of disposing of their stock and produce to avoid the levy, to dispose of them through channels where perhaps this levy is not being collected, to send cattle to butchers who are not registered, to have animals got rid of in ways in which it will not be possible to collect the levy. In so doing they would not alone be engaging in activities which are illegal but which would also make the tracing of disease more difficult than would be the case if the animals were disposed of through regular channels where, unfortunately now, a levy will have to be paid where it was not in the past.  Therefore the introduction of the levy could work against rather than in favour of disease eradication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are some of the reasons I must insist that this matter be put.  I believe <Col N="2752" /> the Minister should not have the power to increase this levy at will without seeking amending legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>There shall be established a fund to be known as the Disease Eradication Fund.  The expenditure of all moneys in the fund shall be as authorised by the trustees of the fund for the purpose of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis and for no other purpose.  The trustees of the fund shall be appointed by the Minister on the following basis:</P>
      <P>(a)  two persons appointed by the Minister one of whom shall be an officer of the Minister;</P>
      <P>(b)  three persons who shall represent the producers of bovine animals shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of such producers and</P>
      <P>(c)  one person who shall represent the members of the veterinary profession on the nomination of such organisation as the Minister considers to be representative of such profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to require that all money raised by the levy be paid into a fund to be known as the Disease Eradication Fund which will be administered jointly by the Minister for Agriculture, representatives of the farming organisations and the veterinary <Col N="2753" /> profession and would be capable of being used only for the purpose of disease eradication.  The Minister has said, in the course of his contribution here today and previously that it is the intention that this money be used only for that purpose.  If that is the case it should be seen to be so, and a mechanism such as the payment of the levy into this fund should be instituted so that there will be a statutory guarantee that that money will be used for disease eradication and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>The levy will be an effective means of securing the disease eradication only if it has the support of the farming community and if the disease eradication programme itself has the support of that community.  The setting up of this fund into which the levy would be paid would contribute towards getting farmers' support for disease eradication because the farmers, having half of the total number of seats on the board of trustees of the fund, would, through the mechanism of this fund, have a direct say in the disease eradication programme, which they do not have at present.  Farmers will accept that they have to pay the levy if it is to be used in a way over which they have some control.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to agree that the levy will be paid into such a fund to ensure, first, that it is used for disease eradication, and secondly that farmers have a say in the way in which it is used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recommend this amendment to the House, nor do I look with any great approval on the suggestion that the group of trustees, presumably from the farmers of the country, be set up to ride hard on the Minister whose democratic job it is to see that these funds are used correctly for the eradication of disease.  The political responsibility is his.  The suggestion that what Deputy Bruton called farmer control over this national Government scheme is needed is not acceptable to a democratic Government operating on democratic lines.  It would introduce proliferation of Parkinsonian dimensions and it would be impossible to manage if you had to get the agreement of a group of trustees to particular <Col N="2754" /> spending of a particular fund of money in a particular sector of the disease eradication scheme.  That should be the responsibility of the Government through the Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be at the time in question.</P>
      <P>There is no question but that the disease eradication programme has the support of farmers and will continue to have that support.  I am glad to say that our own efforts in this regard over the last couple of years have borne a very remarkable improvement in that the herd-owners of the country, the more lackadaisical especially, have finally been alerted to the difficulties and dangers that lie in any <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude towards disease eradication and to the breach of the disease regulations. For instance, Deputy Bruton's suggestion when he was speaking to his former amendment, was tantamount to suggesting that farmers will readily break the law and that to do so will on the whole, be an attractive proposition, made attractive by the imposition of the levy.  The vast majority of farmers, well over 95 per cent I would imagine, realise that any illicit movement of cattle between herds, apart from the the risk of very severe legal punishment, is a highly dangerous thing to do and a dangerous risk for a farmer to put his own herd at. Therefore, the question does not arise. Possibly Deputy Bruton misunderstands the present mind of farmers in the matter of disease eradication.  It would be well if the Deputy would give the programme his whole-hearted support in saying to farmers, as I say to them, that this is not an easy job, it is going to hurt in spots and may hurt very severely but it has to be done, and no amount of soft talk or plámás, bodies of trustees or committees of farmers set up to do this, that, or the other will ease the job.  In fact they will encumber the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has invited me to give my support to the disease eradication scheme.  I have already done so on a number of occasions both inside and outside this House.  I endorse fully the efforts that have been made to bring about the eradication of these dangerous diseases.  I have stressed on numerous <Col N="2755" /> occasions in this House, with far greater frequency than has the Minister who has largely ignored the subject, the fact that these diseases are a danger not only to the economic wellbeing of farmers but also an imminent danger to human health.  Brucellosis and tuberculosis can spread from animals to humans.  I have made this point on numerous occasions and in so doing I have made it quite clear how urgent I regard the eradication of these two diseases.  I hope that that is as clear to the public as it is in my mind.</P>
      <P>The Minister denigrated the idea that the farmers should be involved in the control of funds being raised from them on their animals and being expended on disease eradication.  He seems to have a very low opinion of the contributions that farmers would make when he would regard them as making some sort of Parkinsonian contribution in being members of a disease eradication board of trustees if such were set up.  If farmers were involved directly in administration of those funds, then the farmers would have a very practical contribution to make in terms of advice to those making the decisions.  I am referring only to those funds raised from the farmers by means of levy to assist in the eradication of disease, not to other funds which might be derived from another source. By virtue of the farmers having a partial say in the use of the levy they would be able to back up that advice with real power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context the farmers' contribution would be very valuable and a lot of the mistakes that have been made in the past in the eradication of disease by various Ministers could and would be avoided if farmers were involved more intimately in disease eradication.  In part it is in order to provide for such farmer involvement that this amendment was moved.  I am surprised that the Minister adopted the attitude which he has towards this amendment.  The other value of this amendment is that it would ensure that the money raised in the levy would be used for disease eradication and for no other purpose.  In other words, it would be prevented from becoming a general measure of taxation. <Col N="2756" /> For those two reasons, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I ask you to put the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 45 and 46 to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Wherever a notice of inspection is issued the local health authority shall be so informed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2757" /> The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, where it has come to the notice of the Department of Agriculture that a herd is infected with either brucellosis or TB and a notice is to be served on the herd owner and on the people buying milk for processing from that herd owner that that man's herd is infected with brucellosis or TB and people should be wary about it, this information should also be conveyed to the local health board.  It is not enough that this information is simply conveyed from the Department officials to the creameries. The Health Board should also be made aware that this herd is infected with brucellosis or TB.</P>
    <P>Milk sold from a herd infected with those diseases is a danger to the health of humans.  I had a question down today to the Minister for Health for written reply and in the reply I was told that 35 per cent of all milk produced in the country for human consumption is consumed in a raw state without having been pasteurised.  I said in this debate that the figure was 25 per cent and I was quite alarmed to discover that the situation is even worse than I thought.  The Minister for Health in the course of his reply to my question said that the consumption of raw milk by human beings was a serious threat to human health as it raised the possibility of human beings being infected with brucellosis and also non-respiratory tuberculosis and other enteric diseases.  It is the view of the Minister for Health that the consumption of raw milk is a grave danger to the health of humans.</P>
    <P>We must also be aware that there are many herds throughout the country which are infected with those diseases.  It is not necessary in law at the moment that milk from those herds be pasteurised before it is consumed by humans.  It is not necessary in any part of the country that it be pasteurised before it is sold.  In many cases a farmer producing milk from an infected herd will continue to consume that milk in the household.  Milk from an infected herd is not only a danger to them but it is a danger to anybody who uses that milk without it being pasteurised.  I believe <Col N="2758" /> that where a herd is found to be infected there should be an automatic procedure whereby the health board are informed so that they can take whatever preventive measures are necessary to ensure that this disease does not spread to humans by consuming milk in an unpasteurised form.</P>
    <P>I believe the reason that brucellosis and non-respiratory TB in humans are on the increase here is because adequate preventive measures are not being taken to prevent their spread.  Those measures are not being taken because of inadequate liaison between the officials of the Department of Agriculture, who have the information, and the officials in the Department of Health, who have the legal power to do something to prevent human health being endangered.  I believe that this amendment, which will require by law that the information be given to the health board, will make a valuable contribution towards the elimination of those two diseases as far as they affect humans.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal in what Deputy Bruton says about the passage of infection from bovine sources to human beings in the case of TB and brucellosis.  I believe that Deputy Bruton's amendment possibly confuses two separate and important matters, one of which is animal disease eradication which has among other possibilities human health considerations as an objective. It confuses the measure to some extent to introduce into a purely bovine disease eradication measure a measure which is designed more for the protection of human health.  This is not to say that the measures that are at present in operation for the protection of human beings from contaminated food from any source are not improvable.  I am quite sure they are improvable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of human brucellosis in recent times seems to have been going up.  Its diagnosis is certainly going up.  It is a very serious and debilitating disease in humans.  There is no dispute about that.  I believe this amendment seeks to amalgamate those two important things to the detriment of one and not to the improvement of the other.  I do not see <Col N="2759" /> that the protection of human subjects from infection by bovine sources would be greatly enhanced by the adoption of Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
    <P>I recall that when Deputy Bruton's party were in office I addressed questions on this subject to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Corish, and the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, and I got nowhere.  There was a reluctance even to admit that the subject was extremely important and that human health was definitely concerned. I have no hesitation in admitting that because that is the truth.  My concern in this Bill is to get the best measure possible for the eradication of the bovine source of those diseases.  This is in no way to the detriment of the argument that Deputy Bruton has advanced: the question of the sale of infected milk and other food substances.  Unpasteurised milk and other products can be a very dangerous source of infection.  This is a public health matter.  It concerns public health.  Obviously if ameliorative measures were contemplated it is under public health legislation that they should be enshrined.</P>

      <P>There is always in these debates a degree of political position taking. Naturally enough one tends to express ritual disappointment with a Minister when he does not accept an amendment which an Opposition Deputy hopes he will.  I wish to preface what I am about to say by saying that I accept that as part of the parliamentary game.  However, without any political motivation.  I can only say that I deeply regret that the Minister has not seen fit to accept the amendment.  It is an amendment which would be of much benefit and which would not in any way harm the measure.  Its purpose is to ensure that where officials of the Department of Agriculture become aware of the breaking out of a disease in a herd they would be required by law to pass that information by way of letter to the health authorities.  My reason for suggesting this is because of the likelihood of the spread of disease from a herd to humans unless the appropriate precautionary measures are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2760" /> The Minister said that acceptance of the amendment would lead to confusion regarding this measure, that my suggestion was a public health matter and he suggested that the appropriate time for me to introduce an amendment on those lines would be on the occasion of some Health Bill going through the House. However, if I were to do that I am sure that the Minister for Health would tell me that the matter was one for the Department of Agriculture and that consequently he could not interfere.  That Minister would pass the matter back to the Minister for Agriculture, who is now trying to pass it to the Minister for Health.  This is an example of what is happening in relation to the spread of brucellosis and TB in humans.  One Minister is passing the buck to the other.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to hear the Minister admit that, when he in oppostion raised this matter with the then Ministers for Agriculture and Health, he got no response.  But, despite the fact that both he and the present Minister for Health have been in office for two years, there has not been any move in the matter to make the situation any better than was the position when the Minister questioned his predecessor in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Minister should accept this amendment.  It would not interfere in any way with his legislation. It entails merely legislation requiring officials of the Department to notify the health board concerned that there was an outbreak of disease in a certain herd and that the farmer concerned should be notified to give him an opportunity of deciding what course to take to prevent the disease spreading to members of his family or to anybody else consuming the milk from his farm. After that the matter would be entirely one for the health board.  There would not be any cost involved and nothing but good could come from accepting the amendment.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to take a risk and accept the amendment.  I am sure he would not regret his decision.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 28, after &ldquo;animals&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;goats, horseflesh&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to a matter that arose on Committee Stage.  In accordance with the Bill as drafted the CBF <Col N="2762" /> will be responsible for the promotion of the consumption at home, and more particularly abroad, of Irish beef, mutton and lamb.  I am proposing that they would have responsibility also for the promotion abroad of Irish-produced goat flesh and goat products which include very valuable skins that are used for furnishings.</P>
    <P>In the relevant EEC directive, sheep meat is defined as including goat flesh also.  In specifically excluding goats we are doing something that is not common practice in the Community.  The production of both goat flesh and horse flesh is very small in Ireland, but I know of one very small farm in my constituency where the prime form of production is that of pedigree goats that are very valuable both in terms of milk and of skin.  Some statutory agency should have responsibility for assisting these two industries. It might not be necessary for the CBF to take any action in this area in the immediate future, but if the amendment were accepted we would be ensuring that at least if somebody engaged in either of these areas of production were to approach the board for help at some time the board would be in a position to provide that help, whereas if the Bill remains as drafted the board would have to say: &ldquo;Sorry.  We believe you have a good project.  We believe that if you got help you would be able to do a good job and earn foreign exchange for the country but, under the Act, `livestock' is defined as meaning bovine animals and sheep and we can do nothing for you.&rdquo;  To provide against that situation, if for no other reason, the amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I do not think this amendment is necessary.  I am not aware of there being any dramatic export trade in goat flesh or in horse flesh.  Such horse flesh as has been exported in the past decade came, in the main, from what remained of our draught horse stock which, for better or worse, is very severely run down now.  I do not think the Bill would be improved in any way by the additions recommended by Deputy Bruton.  It is not my intention to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 31 to 36 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where an order under this section is proposed to be made, a draft of the Order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with the situation where the Minister can assign new functions to the CBF.  Under the section in the Bill as it stands, it is possible for the Minister to give the CBF any new functions he thinks appropriate simply by a regulation which does not need the explicit approval of this House.</P>
      <P>Where new functions are being given to a State Agency, it should be necessary for the Minister to obtain the explicit approval of the House.  The section says the only functions he may add are those he considers &ldquo;to be incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned to the Board by this Act.&rdquo;  It is simply a question of what the Minister considers to be incidental to or consequential on the functions assigned to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible for the Minister to adopt, for his own purposes and to give himself power, a very liberal interpretation as to what is consequential on the existing functions.  It is quite possible for him under section 5 to add functions to the CBF which are quite unforeseen now.  Where the Minister is taking power to give new functions to a board, in other words to undo or to add to the work being done in this Bill, he should have to get the approval of the House by means of the order he is making to give them those new functions being put to a <Col N="2764" /> vote in the House.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If this provision were not adopted as it is in the Bill, it would not be possible for the Minister, if he saw fit, to recommend to the CBF that they should give aid and assistance to the export of goats which Deputy Bruton was looking for in the earlier amendment he proposed.</P>
      <P>I do not like the notion that the CBF should be hog-tied over what essentially must be trivial.  On Committee Stage Deputy Bruton thought the Minister for Agriculture was taking very wide powers.  This is not the case.  I do not think he should need to in order to implement useful changes in the functioning of the CBF without undermining their statutory purpose.  He should be able to do this without reference back to the Dáil.  To adopt Deputy Bruton's amendment would be to hog-tie oneself unnecessarily to a cumbersome Dáil process over what would be a rather minor matter for the tactical benefit of the CBF and for the improvement of their operations.  If the Minister should attempt anything else, he would have to face the political risks.  The Minister is and will continue to be a political person, and all his actions as Minister must get the sanction, if necessary, of the voters.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.  &mdash;No member of the Board or member of a committee of the Board shall have access to information which is or could be, in the opinion of the chief officer, of immediate commercial use in trade or business unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it is being made simultaneously available generally or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  it is being made simultaneously available to all other members of the Board or committee of the Board either at <Col N="2765" /> or in association with a meeting of the Board or committee of the Board, as the case may be.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent the chairman or a member of the board from making use of his position, and the access to information he has by virtue of being on the board, to gain information which gives him an advantage over his trading competitors in Ireland.</P>
    <P>An amendment of this sort is more necessary in the case of a board like the CBF than it is in the case of other boards.  One of the essential functions of the CBF is obtaining and passing on useful marketing information about openings for trade in respect of particular types of meat in particular parts of the globe.  If we have a situation, as we will have, that people who are directly involved financially in the meat trade are members of the board, and by virtue of being members of the board they can get this information which is coming to the board at public expense, and if members of the board, being in the milk trade, or being in the meat trade, and being therefore financially interested in that trade, are able by being members of the board to get that information in advance of other Irish people in the same trade, and use it, that would be a serious abuse amounting almost to corruption.</P>
    <P>It is essential that no person should have any advantage over anybody else in so far as his own personal dealings are concerned by being a member of this board.  It must be clearly the case that members of the board cannot make use of their position to give them an advantage which nobody else in the trade has. The amendment provides that information which is of immediate commercial use in trade or business should only be made available to members of the board (1) where it is being made simultaneously available to anyone else who wishes to obtain it, in other words, any member of the trade ringing up the CBF could get that information at exactly the same time the member of the CBF can get it, or alternatively, where for one reason or another&mdash;and I have no doubt there will be cases where this will be so&mdash;the information  <Col N="2766" /> cannot at that time be made generally available.</P>
    <P>If it is being made available to one member of the board it must be made available to all members of the board at the same time.  This ensures that, in the event of a member of the board who is interested in the trade getting this information, other members of the board who are not interested in the trade and who, perhaps, represent the public interest, will get that information.  Therefore, it will not be possible for people by back door methods to get information of immediate commercial use to themselves which other people are not able to get in the same trade.  In the absence of this provision there will be problems of support for the board by people who are not members of it.  They will feel that members of their trade who are members of the board are getting advantages. In my view that would be an unsatisfactory situation.  The amendment was introduced to ensure that full support would be given to the board and its operations by all people in the trade.</P>
    <P>An amendment of this sort should be incorporated in any Bill which is providing for an agency like CBF.  I hope the Minister will understand that, in moving the amendment, I am making a point which is generally applicable to other boards as well as to CBF, and that he will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider what Deputy Bruton's amendment proposes. It proposes that, by statute, we erect barriers against possible dishonourable conduct on the part of members of the board.  The board consists of seven members nominated by the farming organisations and the other organisations who, I am certain, would not appoint dishonourable people to the board. The other members are the three nominations of the Minister, including one civil servant.  The Minister, whoever he is, must be responsible for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the board is to do business.  All business is based on trust. If we set them up to advance the sales of our livestock and meat abroad and simultaneously tell them that we do not trust them, that we are going to hedge <Col N="2767" /> them with regulations to guard against dishonourable acts, we would not get the kind of board we want.  I will not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not denied that membership of the board puts people in the position of obtaining information which could be used to their advantage and he has not denied the possibility of this happening.  It is essential that the House provide a safeguard against the abuse of such a position by members of a board.  It is in no sense a reflection on the community.  It is in no sense a suggestion that the majority of people are criminals because we have laws against criminal offences.  Those laws are there to deal with the minority who commit criminal offences. Therefore, putting a provision in a Bill which might deal with a minority of cases where there would be an abuse of trust is in no sense a reflection on the board or on most members of boards of State companies.  The fact that there is a law against murder does not suggest that everybody is inclined to commit murder.</P>
      <P>There should be statutory guarantees against possible corruption in public bodies being financed by the State.  I do not believe that one needs to apologise to anyone, potential board members or anyone else, for having statutory guarantees against corruption.  If a case of corruption were to arise there would be a clamour from both sides of the House for the introduction of legislation to prevent it.  The best time to take action is before such an event occurs. Prevention is far better than cure and I believe that this amendment would prevent corruption.  We should look at it in that context and we should take action now rather than waiting until something goes wrong.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;22.  &mdash;(1) All contracts for the supply of goods, provision of services or <Col N="2768" /> carrying out of works entered into by the Board shall be awarded on the basis of open public tender except where another procedure is approved by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(2) In any case where the Minister approves the entering into of a contract other than on the basis of open public tender he shall lay before the Dáil and publish in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> within fourteen days thereafter a statement indicating the fact that he has done so and the reasons for so doing.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is concerned with the placing of contracts for the supply of goods, the provision of services and the carrying out of works by the board.  If the State wants to obtain a supply of goods, or to ask that services be provided for reward, or to have works carried out, it must go through specific procedures.  It must advertise and invite interested parties to tender.  It is not possible for the State to give out work of a valuable nature on the basis of favouritism.  Similar specific requirements should exist in the case of the carrying out of works or the provision of goods to CBF.  Similar safeguards should exist in relation to the abuse of public funds where they are administered by an autonomous body like CBF.</P>
    <P>At present it would be conceivable for only one person to be invited to carry out work for the board.  No other person might be given the opportunity of even offering to carry out the work in question. One person might be invited to do the work for justifiable reasons.  The persons involved might think that they were doing the right thing in giving the work to one man instead of asking anyone else.  If the work was not properly done, or if the man defaulted and the Exchequer had to pay a large sum of money, the question would be asked why some other contractor had not been given the opportunity of offering his services. The acceptance of this amendment would be proof against such a happening because it would not be possible for one person to get a job without others being given an opportunity to tender.</P>
    <P>I believe that the amendment would <Col N="2769" /> protect the board against criticism of their actions.  It does not provide for all work to be distributed solely on the basis of public tender because a job may need to be done quickly and too much time would elapse if public tender procedure was adopted.  In that case it is possible for the Minister to give his approval for derogating from the public tender procedure and requiring that the fact of his doing so be published after the event so that there is no need for any delay where delay would cost money.  I believe that the amendment is sufficiently well drafted to meet all possible cases where speed would be necessary and therefore that as a valuable protection against suspicion of actions by the board in awarding contracts to one person as against another the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments that Deputy Bruton advanced are very similar to the arguments on amendment No. 3.  I am well aware of original sin and the inclination to evil.  That is human nature; we learned about it at school in the catechism which existed at that time. Allowing that we are all aware of these feelings to which humanity is susceptible, we must also have some faith.  The very setting up of any Government board is in itself an act of faith.  We hope they will do the job that they are doing. We have confidence that they will do the job they are being asked to do.  This amendment impairs the trust that one is putting in one's selected people for whose performance one initially, as the political person, must bear responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the procedures advocated by Deputy Bruton will insulate members of the board from their common humanity any better than the Bill as it now stands.  I reckon that we will get a better approach with less Gestapo measures incorporated in the legislation setting up the board.  Having picked the board and the representative bodies in the trade having sent their members in, they should be told that they are more or less on their own within the statute.  We are saying in effect that we trust them. We are not saying that we are a crowd <Col N="2770" /> of fools and that we expect to be codded, but I do not think we will achieve our objective by having an unnecessarily elaborate process for getting jobs done quickly.  Possibly errors may be made but there is no reason why fewer errors will be made with the elaborate processes Deputy Bruton proposes.  We have to support the people that we select and be responsible for their results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is so drafted that it does not prevent speedy decisions being made where it is deemed necessary by the board and the Minister agrees that it is necessary to get the job done without going through the tender procedure.  There is a process contained in the amendment whereby this may be done quickly.  All that is necessary is that the fact that it is being done be published subsequently.  That meets the main objection of the Minister to the amendment which I put forward.  I believe the amendment would be a valuable protection because it would ensure not only that justice would be done but that it would be seen to be done and that anybody that had criticisms about contracts awarded by the board could be told that they themselves had the opportunity to tender and did not do so and that there is no point in complaining now about how the job was done.  If the matter is left as it is it is possible for the board to pick one person and others in the trade, if they complain afterwards, would be in a position to do so saying truthfully that they were not given a chance of tendering.  I believe that that would not be a satisfactory situation to allow to exist and that the amendment should have been accepted by the Minister.</P>

I consider that the amended definition is an improvement on the original since it would remove the doubts expressed as to whether an outoffice in its own right could be interpreted as a house.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;outoffice&rdquo; in the definition is necessary because of the fact that an outoffice such as a coal or a turf shed need not necessarily be part of a building suitable for use as a dwelling.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment may not be necessary. It is simply to enable the Minister to decide if he wishes to make provision for the phased payment of grants.  There was under the old system which we referred to on Committee Stage a provision whereby a certain proportion of the housing grant was paid when the structure reached the roof so that the cash <Col N="2773" /> flow of the builder could be improved. This amendment is simply to reintroduce the legal provision for that if it does not already exist.  It does not put any extra charge or any extra difficulty upon the Minister but it does give extra flexibility in the event of the housing grants reaching the scale of financing that they had reached in the late 1950's.  In that event it would be essential to have some provision for phasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment not because I disagree with the sentiments which prompted the Deputy to move it but on the grounds that they are unnecessary in the context of this Bill.  I am advised that it is unnecessary to provide specifically in section 4 of the Bill for the payment of new house grants by instalments.  The section as drafted is adequate to enable grants to be paid by instalment if that is desired.</P>
      <P>At present new house grants are paid directly to the members of the voluntary housing associations and not to the association. Section 4 provides for payment of a grant to the person.  A voluntary housing association would come within the definition of a person.  Consequently an association may qualify for a grant under section 4 subject to such regulations as may be made.  Regulations may provide for different amounts of grants for different classes of persons and the amendments are unnecessary.</P>

If the Minister is assuring me and the House that a voluntary housing association can benefit by coming together and getting payment either in a lump sum or in one <Col N="2774" /> or two parts and that he has the legal powers to do that, then my amendment would be unnecessary.</P>

      <Col N="2775" /> The purpose of the amendment is to meet criticisms made by Deputy Fitzpatrick on Committee Stage that the optional arrangements proposed under section 13 would be used by housing authorities to avoid their responsibilities in relation to the carrying out of pre-sale structural repairs.  The amendment which I am now proposing will provide that in the event of failure by a tenant to carry out all necessary work the onus of ensuring that such works are actually carried out continues to rest with the housing authority.  Under this amendment there should be no undue delay on the part of the authority in seeing that the work is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This amendment is an improvement but it is still a bad section. Originally, the onus was on the housing authority to put the house in structural repair before the sale to the tenant was completed.  I consider that did not go even far enough because the onus should have been on the housing authority to put the house into reasonable repair.  The section as drafted gave an alternative to the housing authority to put the house into structural repair or to enter into an agreement with the tenant whereby the tenant would put the house into structural repair and the housing authority would recoup the tenant the amount spent by him on the repair.  I regarded that as a sort of never ending operation and an effort by the housing authority to wash their hands of the obligation to repair the house.  I made the point that the housing authority were really passing this on to the tenant because they could not get the work done in a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of section 13 (2) provided a procedure whereby if the tenant did not honour the agreement entered into the local authority might then come in and do the work.  That was entirely unsatisfactory.  The Minister is now amending it by saying that if the tenant and the authority opt for the agreement procedure whereby the tenant does the work, where the tenant does not carry out his part of the agreement, the housing authority must come in and do <Col N="2776" /> it.  That is an improvement, but it is still a bad section and it will prolong in a most unreasonable way the carrying out of the necessary structural repairs to the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has made this change.  He has come part of the way towards what we have been looking for but there are still problems.  If in the first place the local authority could not carry out the repairs because of lack of staff and facilities the Minister is now making it mandatory on them to do so.  If they could not do it in the first place and the work is not done by the tenant, the Minister is making it mandatory on them to do it although the reason they could not do it was that they did not have the staff or facilities.  It is rather a tweedledum-tweedledee situation. That is my only point of disagreement. I am in favour of the local authority doing the work or farming it out to a small contractor and so at least making sure that it is at all times in the control of the local authority.  The Minister is passing the job on to the person buying the house, and if he does not do it it is passed back to the local authority.  It is still unsatisfactory.  The wording is stronger but I am still not satisfied that it meets the case we are concerned with.</P>

The Minister is right to cede to a local authority the powers in relation to planning.  But the conditions in relation to grants and so on should not necessarily include planning provisions as indicated in section 5.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is embodied in this clause.  The one the Minister proposes to delete simply states that the regulations may provide for and goes on to specify certain things.  I should like to think that the Minister responsible for housing would still retain, where public moneys are being used, sufficient powers to request the local authority to ensure that the house development programme it engages in is not wasteful in terms of density or other considerations.  The argument we had in Dublin Corporation with regard to Dublin County Council was that they persisted in the belief that they were a rural authority and therefore should maintain their development at ten houses per acre, which was enormously expensive.  If the Minister says it is unnecessary in general terms let us delete it and not have unnecessary clauses cluttering up legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to assure me that he has sufficient powers, by virtue of being Minister for the Environment and the Minister responsible for housing, to ensure that a local authority tied by a development plan designed in the mid-sixties, before the Ayatollah was ever heard of, can be sufficiently leant upon so that in its own housing development programme it will not be wasteful.</P>

      <Col N="2780" /> In page 12, to delete lines 45 to 51 and in page 13, to delete lines 1 to 3 and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;16.  &mdash;Section 60 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for subsection (4) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>`(4) A scheme under this section may specify that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  particular priorities shall be accorded to particular categories of persons in the letting of particular dwellings;</P>
    <P>(b)  for the purpose of determining the order of priority to be followed in the letting of dwellings to persons in accordance with the scheme, the housing authority shall obtain and have regard to a report from a medical officer of health of the health board established under the Health Act, 1970, in whose functional area the functional area of the housing authority is situate&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in the making of all such lettings, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the making of all such lettings in relation to the making of which priority is claimed on grounds consisting of or including medical grounds.' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the points made by Deputies Fitzpatrick, Quinn and O'Brien in the course of the debate on section 16.</P>
    <P>When speaking on proposed amendments Nos. 19 and 20 on Committee Stage I emphasised that I am anxious to facilitate some housing authorities who are experiencing lengthy delays in getting reports of medical officers under section 60 (8) of the Principal Act.  I am prepared, however, to concede that the elected members of a housing authority should be in a position to require that a report be obtained from the medical officer of the health board either in respect of all housing applications or only for those cases in which a medical factor is included in the grounds on which the application is based, and that where such a report be obtained the authority shall have regard to that report.</P>
    <P>This concession will, for example, enable an authority like Dublin City Council to continue with their present <Col N="2781" /> arrangements, if they so wish, while allowing a county council which may feel strongly about delays to decide to allow their county manager to make lettings without referring cases to the medical officer or referring to the medical officer only cases with a medical factor involved in the grounds of the application.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable compromise which preserves some degree of the flexibility which I originally sought in section 16 of the Bill but concedes substantially the view that a medical officer should be involved where medical grounds are present in an application.</P>
    <P>Section 60 of the Principal Act is built around the principle that each housing authority should itself decide, subject to the primary objectives specified in section 60 (3), the provisions of a scheme of letting priorities best suited to their own area.  I am preserving the essence of this desirable principle in the compromise amendment which I now propose which will give the elected members of each housing authority the right to decide an important element of the letting priorities.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 60 (8) of the Housing Act, 1966, is consequential on this new amendment and is provided for in amendment No. 22.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I should like to thank the Minister for reconsidering his decision in regard to the letting of local authority houses.  This is an enormous improvement because under the section as originally drafted the function of the county medical officer of health disappeared completely from the procedures for the letting of houses, even in the case where applicants claimed priority on the basis of the condition of the health of a member of the family.  That was monstrous and the Minister's attitude in reconsidering it is to be welcomed. Indeed, it shows what can be done by a <Col N="2782" /> reasonable Committee Stage debate on Bills.

In my view that should be changed to &ldquo;particular categories of persons in the letting of dwellings&rdquo;.  It may be necessary from time to time to have certain priorities.  For example, Dublin Corporation have introduced a scheme for categories in the medical and welfare fields.  We find that many people qualify on welfare grounds also.  It is possible that the Minister is referring to disabled persons having a particular type of dwelling. The Minister should leave a little more scope in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 13, to delete &ldquo;certificate.&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;certificate, or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of these amendments will be to: (a) provide for a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against the refusal of a CRV; (b) enable the Minister to make regulations fixing the maximum site value which would be permissible for CRV purposes, and (c) enable the Minister to refuse a CRV where the cost or value of the site included in the price of a house is greater than what he considers to be the reasonable value of the <Col N="2783" /> site and to indicate in advance whether a particular site price is considered reasonable.</P>
    <P>The two main issues involved, namely, the suitability of the Circuit Court as an appellate tribunal for appeals against the refusal of CRV and the possibility of influencing land prices by means of the CRV system, were both discussed at length during the Committee Stage debate so I will be as brief as possible.</P>
    <P>In that debate Deputies Fitzpatrick and O'Brien laid much stress on the fact that there would be enormous delays&mdash;periods of one and two years were mentioned&mdash;involved in getting an appeal heard before the Circuit Court. In view of this, and as I certainly would not wish to bring in an appeal system that would involve excessive delay and expense to house builders, I agreed not to press the amendment on Committee Stage and to reconsider the matter before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I have checked the position about Circuit Court delays.  I understand that any delays of the magnitude mentioned by the Deputies would not be due to court arrears as there is at present no backlog of cases awaiting hearing in any of the circuits. In Dublin, for example, I am informed that there is at present only a time lag of ten days between the setting down and the hearing of cases.  Similarly, the circuits in Cork, Limerick and Waterford have no arrears awaiting hearing. Therefore, I am quite happy that this is not an argument against the right of appeal being to the Circuit Court and I would hope the Deputies opposite would now accept that this proposal will offer aggrieved applicants a fair and reasonable appellate tribunal.  The Circuit Court can call in experts fairly readily and it is located throughout the country.  Considering the legal status of the Planning Appeals Board as the body appointed by the Minister to determine planning appeals and the fact that an appeal lies to the Minister against a refusal by the board of a request for an oral hearing it would be entirely inappropriate to have the board determining appeals against the decisions of the Minister.  As well as that the assignment <Col N="2784" /> of such appeals to the board, might divert the board from its primary function in the planning area possibly with consequential delays in the processing of planning of appeals.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am not convinced that a special tribunal would have any appeal advantages over the Circuit Court from the point of view of time or public confidence. I have every confidence that the provision I made in the amendment for Circuit Court appeals will enable the functions assigned to it to be discharged in a reasonably prompt and impartial manner.  I will keep the position under review in this respect.  I am asking the House to accept this part of the amendment as it had been drafted for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The remainder of this group of amendments deal with the question of land or site costs.  I am not going to repeat what I said at Committee Stage about the question of land costs generally except that I am pushing ahead with proposals which I intend to submit to Government as soon as possible.  These amendments which are of an enabling nature are made without prejudice to whatever proposals finally emerge from the Government's consideration of the Kenny Report and are unlikely to be invoked in advance of such proposals.</P>
    <P>However, I accept Deputy Quinn's point that it may take some time before a further Housing Bill comes before the House and it is partly for this reason that I am prepared to include provisions of this nature since there is always a possibility that in the future the position about the cost of sites could be such as to warrant the invocation of these powers at short notice without the delay which the preparation of new legislation would entail.</P>
    <P>Regulations specifying the maxima for different areas densities and so on would, of course, be known to those engaged in the selling and as well as those involved in the purchase of sites.  Therefore, no builder could argue afterwards that he bought the site in ignorance and was being penalised unfairly.</P>
    <P>If amendment No. 16 is accepted and the new subsection (4) is invoked there <Col N="2785" /> will be a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against a refusal of a CRV on the grounds that the value of the site is not considered reasonable.  Paragraph (b) of subsection (4) expressly gives the Minister power to issue an indication of whether the price proposed to be charged or paid for a site represents reasonable value.  This is to ensure that in the event of paragraph (a) of the subsection being brought into operation a small builder purchasing sites will have an opportunity to know where he stands <i>vis-a-vis</i> a CRV application before he pays for the sites.  I believe that this would be welcomed by many small builders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There are two principles or issues involved in this group of amendments, first of all, the control of the price of the site and, secondly, the appeal to the Circuit Court.  There has been quite a considerable improvement effected here but, quite candidly, in regard to the attempt to control the price of sites, I thought the Minister was going further in these amendments.  I was somewhat disappointed to hear him say it is not proposed to implement the power given to him here until the Kenny Report has been dealt with.  I do not think that that report is involved in these amendments.</P>
      <P>The first of this set of amendments Amendment No. 15&mdash;seeks to add another paragraph to subsection (3) of section 18.  Subsection (3) begins by saying, the Minister shall not grant a certificate in respect of the sale of a house, (a), (b), (c), and then (d), to be added would read:</P>
      <P>if the amount of the cost or value of the site of the House included in the price is greater than an amount standing prescribed for the time being under subsection (7) (h) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 proposes to add to subsection (7) a new subsection (h) which will give the Minister power to make regulations in relation to a number of things, including the amount that is the greatest amount that may be reckoned by the Minister in respect of the cost or value of the site of a house in <Col N="2786" /> determining an application for a certificate. The Minister can only shelve the procedure until after the Kenny Report becomes law if he does not make a regulation dealing with the price of land under subsection (7) of section 18, and I think he should make such a regulation.</P>
    <P>Amendment 16 proposes to add a further paragraph to subsection (4) which reads at present:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, on the application in writing of a person to whom a certificate was granted under subsection (1) (a)....</P>
    <P>Anyway it proposes to add a paragraph to subsection (4) reading as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister may refuse to grant a certificate in any case where the amount of the cost or value of the site of a house included in the price is greater than the amount for which the site appears to the Minister to represent reasonable value.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Minister says it appears that he does not intend to implement that subsection either until the Kenny Report is dealt with.  That is a pity because an unanswerable case was made on Committee Stage that it is just not possible to control the prices of houses without controlling the price of land.</P>
    <P>As soon as this Bill becomes law, as soon as the Minister gets round to making regulations under it, I would urge him to take the power to at least consider whether or not the site is value for money.  If we are to have astronomical prices for sites, there is no way the Minister can keep down the price of houses.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that even if the price of the site was a bit dear, a contractor by economising here, there and everywhere, could still make the whole package value for money.  That is putting a temptation in the way of the builder to economise unwisely on the materials in the house or the workmanship, and that is bad.  I strongly urge the Minister to utilise the powers and authority I am glad to see him taking in these amendments.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the appeal to the Circuit Court.  I admit I had not brought myself entirely up to date with delays in <Col N="2787" /> the Circuit Court, although I attempted to do so on several occasions between the Second Reading and Committee Stage of this Bill and was unsuccessful. The Minister tells me&mdash;and I am glad to hear it&mdash;that the present President of the Circuit Court has made improvements and brought things more up to date.  But, from my knowledge of the procedures in the courts there will be delays.  The Minister says at least it will not be the fault of the Court, that when appeals get onto the list and are ready for hearing they will be heard.  But there will still be the solicitor, counsel, the architect and all the other experts to be consulted and brought together.  I believe that the Minister still could allocate a Circuit Court judge to hear these appeals and be engaged in nothing else.  I am not sure, but I believe he could perhaps give a Circuit Court judge the power to have the assistance of assessors because, if appeals under this section&mdash;against decisions of the Minister in regard to certificates of reasonable value&mdash;are heard in the formal way in court as obtains at present, they will be entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>In this respect I note also that the Minister has not changed the amendment, as originally drafted.  The Circuit Court judge will have two options only&mdash;he will be able to affirm the decision of the Minister, that is, to affirm the decision in refusing the appeal, or he will be able to grant the certificate, that is presumably, in the amount requested by the applicant.  But I wonder under the subsection whether he will have power vary it.  I maintain he should have power either to affirm the Minister's decision or vary it, that is, perhaps grant a certificate for some figure in between the amount requested by the applicant, or to refuse that amount.  It is not easy to get this point over.  As I see the position at present the court may, as it thinks fit&mdash;on the hearing of the appeal&mdash;affirm the decision of the Minister refusing the certificate, or direct the Minister to grant the certificate.  If the judge is satisfied and is advised that he can direct the Minister to grant the certificate in a sum other than that for which the applicant <Col N="2788" /> has applied, I would be satisfied. But if the judge is to be tied to either affirming the refusal of the Minister or accepting the figure of the applicant, that is not a sufficiently wide discretion; he should have discretion to grant a certificate in a reduced sum.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, nowhere in the Bill so far is there provision which will make the Minister give reasons for refusing a certificate, and until the Minister gives reasons for refusing a certificate an appeal is meaningless.  How is a judge to hear an appeal in a meaningful way and give a reasonable decision unless he knows why the Minister refuses the certificate? It might be on site grounds.  It might be because the roof was too dear. It might be on any one of a multitude of things, and unless the judge is going to go into all the plans and specifications item by item, he will not be able to arrive at a meaningful decision that will satisfy the parties unless the Minister gives his reasons for refusing the certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The collective amendments in this section deal with one of the most contentious elements of this whole miscellaneous legislation.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has enabled future Ministers&mdash;even possibly a Fianna Fáil Minister although I have reservations about that&mdash;to do something positive about the cost of building land.  I welcome the fact that these sections are here now and could be used, but I find it hard to accept the reasoning put forward by the Minister in relation to the whole question of appeals and his rejection of the idea of the Circuit Court not being a suitable venue for such appeals.  &ldquo;An equitable and just forum&rdquo; was the phrase he used originally on the grounds that there was not a backlog of cases, and that therefore it was the best vehicle. By extension the suggestion was that An Bord Pleanála, because they are a body appointed by the Minister, could not reverse the decisions of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments to section 18 on Report Stage still have evaded the essential criticism that the private sector of the building industry, upon whom the Minister's housing strategy depends, have not been dealt with and they relate <Col N="2789" /> two things.  Firstly, there is the reason for the refusal of a certificate, and I will come to the appeals procedure in relation to that.  Secondly, there is the consultation. The Minister in his Second Stage speech talked about being flexible in his approach and consulting at all time with the relevant interests.  In deciding the most suitable venue for an appeals procedure I would have thought that any Government Department&mdash;particularly this Government Department, depending as they do on the private sector&mdash;would realise that the people with whom decidedly they should discuss such a venue would be the private sector and the housing industry.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply to this section will indicate how the CIF feel about their members going into the Circuit Court complete with the expensive services of Deputy Fitzpatrick's colleagues, counsel, some of my colleagues and quantity surveyors.  A builder operating in a small way is not going to feel comfortable in a legal chamber&mdash;some of which are quite out of date, badly ventilated and awesome in their physical appearance&mdash;where he is obliged to swear an oath and to perform in a semi-theatrical fashion in a legal court in order to try to show to a judge not that his houses are of reasonable value&mdash;because the judge at the end of the day cannot even say that they are&mdash;but to try to show to the judge that the Minister was wrong in not granting a certificate.  That does not seem to be the right kind of venue.</P>
    <P>I regret that, for whatever reason, the Minister has not seen fit to be more flexible in deciding the nature and location of the appeal process.  I accept that between Committee Stage last week and today some of the difficulties in relation to the suggestion I made could not be resolved. I am not suggesting that my proposal for An Bord Pleanála is the solution.  There may be difficulties which I do not foresee.  I am irrationally terrified of courts.  I feel uncomfortable in them.  I do not feel at home there.  Many others hold that view.  Fortunately, I do not have to be in them, but I know a number of architects, for instance, who do not like to do legal work.  We are supposed to be educated and professionally <Col N="2790" /> trained and therefore, presumably, more at ease and more comfortable in such a venue than somebody who has not the benefit of such education and training.  I shudder to think of the discomfort in which people will have to be placed in trying to argue their case, to say nothing of the cost which eventually will be put back on to the purchase price of the house.</P>
    <P>Those are my comments in relation to the venue and the process of appeal to which, unfortunately, the Minister is still wedded and obviously there will be no movement in that.  Perhaps in his reply he will indicate if the CIF or any of the interested bodies, or individual private builders who might not necessarily be members of the CIF, have indicated their reaction to that section.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification on another point.  I am trying to think in the context of someone who would be called upon by a solicitor to act professionally in court on behalf of a builder who was refused a CRV.  All the lawyers do is argue your case with facts supplied by other people.  How would you go about preparing a case?  How would you write the technical brief for the senior counsel or the solicitor to argue?  How would the Minister's representatives go about defending that case?  Are we not logically brought to the stage where the reasons for the refusal of the certificate in the first instance would ultimately have to be brought out in court by the Government's counsel?  Alternatively, if that was not the case we could be continuing to play some kind of bureaucratic spot-the-ball contest in which we would never be able to get down to the nub of what was considered by the Minister and his people to be the unreasonable section.</P>
    <P>If, at the end of an appeal process, representatives of the Government through their legal advisers and the Attorney General's Office end up by saying to the judge and to the court, &ldquo;Of the one hundred items that made up the bill in the application for a CRV we found the following four items unacceptable because they were over the prevailing levels of cost&rdquo;, why can they not do it initially? If that is done initially there will <Col N="2791" /> be very few court cases.  If a builder gets back a refusal and he is turned down on half a dozen grounds, that builder, if he has any sense, is not going to engage in a legal wrangle.  He will simply go away and see if he can take his costs down to that level.</P>
    <P>These amendments are critical to the nub of concern in section 18 which relates to the way in which the CRV system is being administered and the grounds upon which a CRV refusal is issued. If the Minister can indicate that some format of reason for refusal will issue as a result of this prolonged discussion in the Dáil, then we may have made some progress.  I have some indication from the Minister's Committee Stage speech that by engaging a quantity surveyor in consultation with the CIF there was movement in that direction.  The movement is pretty slow and the appeals procedure offered to the private sector, upon whom the Government's housing strategy now depends, is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could have regard to the factors which I have raised when he is replying.  Firstly, has he followed his own advice on Second Stage and sought real discussion and consultation with the CIF in relation to the proposed system of appeals which is now embodied in these amendments?  Is the Minister happy with their assessment of how their members will attempt to operate this appeals procedure?  Does the Minister envisage that in a court action where the Department will be defending a decision of the Minister to refuse a CRV that the legal team for the Minister will give specific reasons why they have found the application to be unreasonable and will identify the areas which were considered to be unreasonable in terms of value?  Will he not, therefore, consider that it is possible to give such reasons in the initial refusal?  This would save dragging the unfortunate builder through the court with the expense of the legal trappings which go with it and the time delayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the CRV for the site when this Bill was introduced <Col N="2792" /> there was nothing in it about controlling land prices or site development costs.  Deputy Fitzpatrick and I have at least something sewn into the Bill to ensure that this is considered.  I realise the Minister has plans with regard to land and how it should be controlled. That may or may not be accepted by the Government.  It is important that the Minister writes this into the Bill.  He wants to leave it dormant until he has his own proposals on the control of land before the Government.  While he is waiting for this he should examine the whole situation of site costs and should take all the powers he can to ensure that there is no abuse in this area.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the CRVs is the control of the price of houses.  We all know that today one of the great factors in escalating the price of houses is the cost of the plot of land on which a house is built. We all know that there are some very high prices and some builders are actually getting out of building and engaging in site development work so they can sell the sites at very high profit.  The Minister has gone some way in the amendment but not far enough as far as I am concerned. I hope he will not leave this dormant until he has his proposals approved by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of appeals I am very disappointed the Minister did not accept the proposal from this side of the House with regard to the Circuit Court.  I said on Committee Stage that it is a lazy way out.  We are talking about whether or not the price of a house is too high.  I do not consider it is the function of the Circuit Court to judge those matters. The prices commission was suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I suggested an appeals board, and Deputy Quinn suggested the Planning Appeals Board.  We did not want something very formal and costly.  The Minister said he will keep an eye on this and obviously if it is not working satisfactorily he will review it.  Our courts appear to be totally unsuitable for this type of activity.  I would go along with it if the Minister had said that he was appointing a Circuit Court with assessors, experts and people qualified to make decisions on whether a house was good value or not <Col N="2793" /> and this would be done in a formal place.  The Minister did not say that.  The appeal has to come before the Circuit Court.  The Minister says that the Circuit Courts are fairly up to date and the builder will only have to wait 10 days before his appeal is heard.  He will have to employ counsel, get quantity surveyors, architects and all the other expertise. All the law we are making is a bonanza for the legal people.  We are giving them another bonanza in this Bill.  If one went down to the Circuit Court without counsel some of the judges would throw you out.  If a builder is seen hanging around the court by some of the people he owes money to they will be checking up on him and wondering what type of trouble he is in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn pointed out that when one goes into those austere places one is made feel a criminal.  We are now forcing people to go to the Circuit Court to prove whether or not they are right.  The Minister stuck rigidly to the fact that he will not give his reasons why he refused to give a CRV.  If he goes into court and his counsel says that he will not give his reasons a reasonable judge will throw him out.  I am against going into the court but it will certainly expose the Minister's hand.  He will either have to lose all his cases or he will have to stand up and give some valid reasons why he refuses to give CRVs, which might not be a bad thing.  I am very surprised the Minister wants to run into the Circuit Court.  Who will pay the cost?  If the Minister loses does he pay the costs?  If the builder loses does he pay the costs?  I believe that it is only the consumer who will pay the cost.  While he might not pay it the first year all these factors will be taken into account and will have to be charged some way or other.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to build in for the future the cost of litigation, I would say unnecessary litigation, whereas it should be possible to have a situation of a number of reasonable men sitting round a table, examining the facts and reaching a quick decision.  The Minister would not agree to our proposal that a decision would have to be given within 21 days.  Presumably he realises that <Col N="2794" /> there will be a backlog in the system causing serious delays.  We have experience of the grant system and of inspections in that regard in respect of which there can be delays of some months.  If an applicant for a CRV should fail to obtain the certificate after waiting for many months for his application to be dealt with, he must then go to court.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that that would happen within ten days, but within six months or a year the Circuit Court may be back to what was the former situation of nine-months delays.  Obviously this additional workload being put on the Circuit Court will create a backlog. Inflation is rampant in house building prices so that delays in relation to any aspect of the industry are bound to add substantially to the ultimate cost of houses.  If a builder is not able to recoup his costs he goes out of business. Therefore, he must pass on additional costs to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is determined to bring the Circuit Court into this matter despite our pleadings, which stem from genuine concern for the industry as a whole and of course for the consumer.  Our fears would be allayed to some extent if the Minister would at least promise to review the situation within three months and then to consider it again after another three months.  This legislation is not workable.  The builders will be reluctant to go to court.  If after a review of the situation the Minister should find that it was not working, I should hope that he would be big enough to come back to the House and propose whatever changes might be found necessary.  We shall be tabling questions as to the progress of the legislation and, generally, we shall be taking note of how the system is developing.  Hopefully, the Department, too, will monitor the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone some distance in relation to this amendment.  The main point that has been clarified is the question of the long delays to which the Deputies have referred and which would concern all of us.  We have established that there is no backlog and that the time lapse in taking a case to the court would <Col N="2795" /> be about 10 days in places like Dublin, Cork, Waterford and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised a couple of points.  He raised the question of how the court might give a decision in the absence of information concerning the reason for a CRV having been refused. The court would have to be informed as to the reason for such refusal before they would be in a position to give a decision.</P>
      <P>The other point related to the situation of a builder who is refused a CRV. It is my intention that in a case in which there is refusal that there will be communication with the builder concerned and that he will be invited to come in and discuss the situation.</P>

      <P>Section 18 creates a number of criminal offences and subsection (12) provides that in certain cases it shall be a defence to these criminal proceedings if the accused person shows that the act or omission giving rise to the offence was not done by him but was done by somebody else.  Subsection (12) (b) provides that in any case where it is a defence to show that the accused person did not actually commit the act giving rise to the offence, if he is making that defence he shall be obliged to notify the prosecution seven days before the hearing of the name and the address of the person who committed the act giving rise to the prosecution.</P>
      <P>I am objecting to that proviso.  My amendment seeks to delete lines 47 to 56, the paragraph which obliges the accused person seven days before the hearing to notify the prosecution of his defence.  I believe this subsection is introducing pleading into criminal proceedings.  I know in some other countries in the case of a defence of an alibi, it is necessary for the accused person to disclose his alibi some days before the court hearing.  That is not the case here.  My objection to this subsection is that it is amending the criminal law piecemeal and making special provisions for the defence of a criminal prosecution under this Bill that are not in other Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the criminal law and the law of evidence in regard to criminal prosecutions is to be amended, it should be amended right across the board and not piecemeal.  There is a school of thought in favour of the amendment the Minister is making to the criminal law here. Perhaps there is something to be said for that, but this is not the place to amend one section of the criminal law.  If the law of evidence in regard to criminal prosecution is to be amended, it should be amended in the case of manslaughter, murder, assault, and every other sort of criminal prosecution, and not merely in this isolated instance under the provisions of this Bill which provide for the <Col N="2798" /> granting of certificates of reasonable value.</P>
    <P>A prepared argument could be made which would take a very long time.  Time does not permit us to develop it.  The kernel of my argument is that this is amending the law of evidence in criminal cases piecemeal and that is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick objected to paragraph (b) of subsection (12) on the grounds that it introduced a new principle to the criminal law of this country.  I want to point out to him that it does not.  In fact this subsection is identical to section 22 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  Section 107 of the Factories Act, 1955, has a somewhat similar provision.  Therefore we are not introducing a precedent in this paragraph.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks the provision is wrong in principle but he is more concerned lest a precedent be established in the criminal law. As I have established that we are following existing valid precedents, I expect that he will be happy to leave the subsection stand.  In any event I cannot accept this amendment because it would weaken the provisions of this section. We must ensure that a person charged with an offence cannot too easily shift the blame on to somebody else without having good grounds for doing so.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am sorry I cannot accept the Minister's reasoning.  I made the case that this is amending evidence in criminal law piecemeal.  The Minister has found other Acts in recent times in which there is this provision.  The Government of the day are now seeking when the opportunity presents itself to put these provisions dealing with the creation of criminal offences.  In a murder case a person is not obliged to do this.  He can go into the witness box and say for the first time: &ldquo;I was not at the scene of the crime.  At the time it was committed I was at a race meeting in Killarney with someone else, or I was out of the country.&rdquo;  He is not obliged to give notice of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any one of a host of criminal cases the defence of an alibi is available <Col N="2799" /> without an obligation on the accused person to notify the prosecution in advance that he is making the defence of an alibi.  He does not have to make it until his counsel opens the defence.  For the instances the Minister has given, anybody who did a bit of research could point to hundreds of other cases where such a defence would be open and where there is no obligation on the accused person to go through the procedure laid down here.  It is wrong, and it should have been objected to in the other cases as I am objecting to it here.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 29, to delete &ldquo;1965&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;1979&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment to update the reference in section 18 (14) of the Bill to the Trustee Savings Bank Acts.  The Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1979, was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and is likely to become law before the passing of this Bill.  The Trustee Savings Bank Acts, 1863 and 1965 and the 1979 Act will be construed together as one Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 33 and 34.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; in subsection (14) of section 18.  I had included this amendment on Committee Stage but, on the basis of Deputy Fitzpatrick's comments on it, I agreed to reconsider the matter and withdraw the amendment with leave to re-enter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; was originally included in subsection (14) of section 18 so as to exclude bridging loans from the scope of the section.  On reconsideration I am inclined to believe that, first, this exclusion could be likely to be used to circumvent the whole purpose of section <Col N="2800" /> 18.  Even Deputy Fitzpatrick described the definition as an &ldquo;escape hatch&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The second reason why I now propose the deletion of this definition is that there is no valid reason why bridging loans should be excluded from the terms of section 18.  A bridging loan is made to enable a person to complete the purchase of a house in advance of receiving a long-term loan.  However, at the time of completing the purchase of the house, whether by means of a bridging loan or a long-term mortgage, a CRV should have already been obtained and the sale should be completed in accordance with it.</P>
    <P>It would seem a bit illogical, therefore, to exclude bridging loans from the scope of section 18.  To do so would be likely to cause grave difficulties in cases where, after a person had purchased a house by means of a bridging loan, the application for a CRV was refused and the person was unable to obtain a long-term mortgage.  This type of situation would lead to untold difficulties for house purchasers.  I am firmly of the opinion that, in order to ensure that the effect of the section is not diminished and to avoid difficulties for hire purchasers, a bridging loan should not be made unless a CRV is obtained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised another aspect of this proposal in pleading a case for persons who were solvent and who did not need a mortgage loan in reality but might need a short-term loan for two or three months.  I am advised that under sections 14 and 18 (2) of the Bill regulations would be made to exclude certain types of short-term loans, if that were desired.  If necessary, bridging loans could also be excluded.  I propose, therefore, to proceed with the deletion of the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; in section 18 (14).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am opposed to this amendment.  As originally defined, &ldquo;loan&rdquo; did not specifically include moneys advanced for a period not exceeding three years.  The object of the definition was not to prevent people who not alone were solvent but who did not <Col N="2801" /> want a loan provided they had reasonable time to realise their securities. I concede that the definition as originally drafted might have led to abuses but the present amendment is a lazy one because the draftsman did not have time to look at it and simply amend the matter by taking out the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo;, thereby enmeshing all loans, whether for three weeks or three months.</P>
      <P>The person I am concerned about is the person who sees a property that he wants to buy and who has sufficient assets to pay for it.  Those assets might consist of money in the US or elsewhere which would take time to get back here, or they might consist of property which he would have to sell.  He knows that he can realise more money out of his own assets than is necessary to complete the purchase.  If he goes to a bank for a temporary loan he will be driven to get a CRV.  If the seller of the house says, &ldquo;I am not interested in that sort of thing; I have another purchaser,&rdquo; he will lose the house.  It is unnecessary interference with a private transaction.</P>
      <P>The object of this measure is to preserve loan finance for people who should be able to avail of it.  This is a lazy amendment which will lead to grave inconvenience and trouble.  It shows that legislation like this should be introduced and dealt with in a more leisurely way.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter and to let the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; stand.  He even weakened his own argument by saying that he may exclude bridging finance by regulations.  If he can do that by regulations why can he not do it now?  Why has he to wait for regulations when it was originally thought that it should be done in the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>During my Second Reading speech on 27 June I referred to a notice which was inserted in the Press on 1 June about section 18 of the Bill.  I said that it contained several inaccuracies and misleading statements.  A further notice was inserted by the CIF on 4 July which also contained the same type of inaccuracies.  The notice referred to my lack of consultation with the CIF about the Bill.  As I have already stated in this House and to the press, there have been numerous meetings between the CIF and my Department since the Government came into office.  At these meetings various, aspects of the CRV system were discussed and the CIF were informed that further discussion on specific provisions of the Bill could be held after it was published.  I received a request from the CIF for a meeting at which they would give me their views.  I replied that I was prepared to meet them and that firm arrangements for a meeting would be made as soon as they gave me details of the matters which they intended to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 June I was informed by the CIF that they had nothing to add to their views already contained in the press notice.  They chose instead to insert a further notice in the press on 4 July, notwithstanding the points I made to them.  It is fair to say that the amendments passed will both strengthen the provisions of the section and ensure that builders are treated fairly.  The notice says that the Bill will extend the CRV system to all new houses for sale.  This is incorrect.  The notice also says that the Bill will give my Department the power to decide the number and type of houses <Col N="2803" /> to be built by a particular building firm. This is also incorrect.  Any regulations made under the Bill in common with all other regulations having the force of law must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will be the subject to a motion of annulment by either House.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Bill becomes law I intend to invite representatives of the CIF to discussions regarding the implementation of the revised procedures for the CRV system which will be necessitated by the provisions of section 18.  As I have already indicated, I will go as far as I can to meet them, especially in regard to the question of giving reasons for refusals, where this is possible.  It is certainly my intention that these discussions should not be prejudiced by what I referred to earlier and that they will be frank and fruitful.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to a printing error in section 6 (2).  The words &ldquo;contribution in kind&rdquo; in line 4, page 6, were inadvertently hyphenated in the text of the Bill as initiated.  This error was overlooked at the proofing stage and the words appear incorrectly in the text of the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>On Friday last I issued a statement giving details of a special house improvement grant of up to £600 to reduce dependence on oil.  This Bill covers the making of these grants.  The grant applies to the following works: conversion of oil, electricity or gas central heating systems to solid fuel systems; the installation of a back boiler or other solid fuel burning appliance where a house has a fireplace but no back boiler; the cost of replacing a fireplace or appliance or installing an additional fireplace or appliance is not reckonable for the special grants; the installation of a fireplace or solid fuel appliance in a house which has central heating but no fireplace or solid fuel appliance in it; the cost of installing a back boiler in such fireplace or appliance may be included in determining the amount of the special grant.  This special grant is not subject to the normal limiting period of ten years for further grants.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that this announcement has far-reaching implications for our energy policy.  Let me say here and <Col N="2804" /> now in unequivocal language that, while I stand over everything I said on 13 June during the course of supplementaries to questions put down by Deputy Collins on this subject, at that stage our policy in the matter was being developed.  Last Friday's statement shows that we have at least got the guts to tackle the oil problem head on.  We are now determined to take a number of measures to reduce our dependence on oil.  The latest announcement is a further important step in meeting this need.  I now wish to bring the attention of the House to the fact that I do not propose to hold up the payment of any grants under this special scheme.  After the Housing Bill becomes law section 5 will be brought into operation and regulations will be made under the section as soon as practicable.  For the benefit of Deputy Horgan section 5 of the Bill covers these grants.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to thank Deputies Fitzpatrick, Quinn, O'Brien and Tully who were mainly concerned with the lengthy debates during the various stages of this Bill.  The debate lasted some nine hours on Second Stage and 19 hours on Committee Stage.  The Deputies that I have mentioned have generally adopted a constructive approach to the provisions of the Bill which reflected their own views and, in the case of section 18 and section 20, the views put forward mainly by the building societies and the CIF.</P>
    <P>For my part I have very carefully considered the observations made by Deputies and by outside bodies.  It is of course impossible to reach agreement with all interested parties.  For example the CIF described section 18 of the Bill as a draconian measure and at the other extreme Deputy Keating said that the CRV provisions were weak-kneed and cosmetic.  In fairness to the CIF they indicated the changes they wished to have made.  On the other hand, Deputy Keating spoke in vague emotive generalities which seemed to be designed to grab the media headlines at the time. But I failed to hear him make any practical suggestions as the other Deputies did.</P>
    <P>Any fair-minded Deputies opposite will accept that I have gone a long way <Col N="2805" /> towards meeting proposals for amendments. Essentially as amended the Bill provides a statutory framework for housing grants, loans and subsidy systems.  The Bill also provides a flexible framework for a form of house price control which may be applied, modified or dismantled as is necessary.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I must of necessity be very brief because after we conclude this Bill I understand the House, in order to permit the Government and the public services to be carried on, has to agree to estimates totalling over £2,000 million between now and 10.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The next thing I want to say is that I do not intend to follow the Minister into whatever sort of a conflict exists between the Construction Industry Federation and himself; one thing is clear and that is that the honeymoon is over and divorce seems to be imminent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for the way he dealt with this Bill, which was introduced at a very unsuitable time during the final days of this session although a Housing Bill has not been introduced since 1966.  It was only by slaving here for entire days, practically without anything to eat, that we succeeded in giving this Bill a reasonable processing.  It has certainly left the House in a much better state and that is due to the fact that the Minister listened patiently to arguments put up by this side of the House and accepted many of them, as witnessed by the fact that he put down 16 amendments to meet points <Col N="2806" /> brought forward on this side.  I thank him for that.  I still believe that, if the Bill has been introduced at a time when we could have had a Committee Stage spread over a few weeks and a Report Stage, we would have a much better Bill. For example, as regards CRVs, the Minister refused to yield to our suggestion that he should give reasons for refusing to grant these certificates and should give a decision within a certain time.  The Bill stands with this objectionable provisions still in it.  I am satisfied that when the first case under this Bill comes before the Circuit Court it will either be adjourned for interrogatories&mdash;a system of getting information from one of the parties necessary to hear the appeal in a reasonable way&mdash;or the judge will adjourn the case in order to allow the Minister to give reasons for refusing the certificate so that he can hear the appeal.  In that case the costs of the day will be given against the Minister.</P>
    <P>I wish to go on record as saying that I still think and that time and experience will prove before long that the Circuit Court or indeed any court is not a suitable tribunal to process appeals of this sort.  A Circuit Court judge without the benefit of assessors is not a suitable tribunal to deal with these technical matters. Judges are skilled men who, through long experience, are qualified to adjudicate on differences brought before them, but those differences must be brought before them clearly and all the relevant facts and considerations put to them.  That is why I believe that it would not be possible to do this in a reasonable way in the Circuit Court.  We made the best job that could be made of the Bill in difficult circumstances.  We shall now sit down and allow the people who apparently are very anxious to do so to get at the £2,000 million Estimates and Votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the manner in which the Minister dealt with some of our observations on the sections of this Bill, which is largely enabling legislation. The real guts of the Government's housing strategy will emerge in the regulations drafted under the sections passed here tonight.  In drafting those regulations <Col N="2807" /> and in the circulars that will follow them I ask the Minister to pick up the points about the granting of SDA loans and building society loans to minors, a question that has been discussed at length.  It cannot be dealt with in the Bill because it is a major problem and will become increasingly so, given the structure and age of the population.  I urge the Minister to reach as soon as possible some sort of accord with the more rational sections of the CIF and in so doing to realise that the public housing sector is perhaps the more stable, rational sector of the housing market and if some of the Government resources could be put back into that area we would not have the sort of trouble that appears by way of public notice in the newspapers.  In asking the Minister to ensure that all Deputies get details of the revised grants scheme, subsequent to the Government meeting last Friday presumably, I should like to congratulate him as being the first Fianna Fáil Minister who has successfully converted the backbencher views by way of having an unlimited grant for back boiler conversions.</P>
      <P>One of the evening newspapers effectively states that this grant can be given more or less on the approval or recommendation of either a peace commissioner or public representative.  Whether that is the case or not should be clarified quickly for all Deputies and public representatives.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for his handling of the Bill and the way he dealt with our amendments.  I would ask the Minister in the case of amendments he did not accept to make changes by way of regulation as he sees it necessary.  We opposed section 20 but the Minister did not yield an inch as regards the building societies and the meddling.  When the present Government were in Opposition they opposed this proposal when it came before the House in 1976 and it was withdrawn.  For some reason they have now brought forward the same legislation <Col N="2808" /> and put it through.  I ask the Minister to ensure that, if this has the effect of slowing down the inflow of funds to building societies, the necessary changes will be made immediately.  The Minister for Fisheries when in the Seanad was the main opponent of this provision in the Building Societies Act.  I was amazed at the silence on the Government's side of the House on this issue.  Therefore I want the Minister to keep an eye on this because it is very important to have an inflow of funds.  The Government may be happy with the inflow in the last few months but it is the coming months about which we are concerned. If there is any deterioration in the inflow the Minister should take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and change this unnecessary legislation which he bulldozed through the House for no good reason other than to penalise one building society.</P>

It is an important issue on which there is genuine concern and it must now be clearly seen to rest with the Government in that the law agent of Dublin Corporation, the city manager and the legal advisers of the city council have clearly said that the nature of the consent and the nature of the contract with the contractor is such that any change now will involve sums of money.

    <P>I also wish to impress on the Minister the urgency of introducing national monuments legislation which has been promised for many years by successive Governments.  An endeavour to modernise this law was rejected out of hand by the Government when it was made by this side of the House a few months ago on the promise of legislation from their own side.  Nothing has appeared and I gather that nothing has yet been presented to the Government.  Would the Minister for State try to have something done about this quickly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>): Yes, I am aware of the recent report issued by Professor J.H. Fremlin of Birmingham University which considered, among other risks, the risks of the occurrence of cancer in persons consuming fish caught in the area of the Irish Sea adjacent to Windscale in Cumbria.  He concluded that some three to ten people mostly in Britain may die of cancer in the next 20-30 years.  The report adds that &ldquo;this assumption is probably pessimistic as our understanding of cancer is increasing rapidly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Contamination of fish results from the discharge of liquid low level radioactive effluents from the Windscale Works and is most noticeable in the vicinity of Windscale.  It has been estimated that a small number of people eating the fish caught in the area of Windscale might receive a radiation exposure of about 30 per cent of the dose limit established by the International Commission for Radiological Protection for members of the public and adopted in the EEC Directive on the health protection of members of the public and workers against ionizing radiation and in corresponding UK regulations.  All discharges of effluents are subject to authorisation by the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that it is unlikely that anyone in Ireland could receive a radiation exposure in excess of 1 per cent of the internationally recommended dose limits.  In addition the Nuclear Energy Board in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries undertakes a limited monitoring programme to verify that fish caught in the Irish Sea and landed in Ireland do not present a hazard to anyone in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The disposal of radioactive waste in international waters around Ireland is regulated and controlled by the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes <Col N="2624" /> and other Matter, 1972 (The London Convention).  It forbids the disposal of certain kinds of wastes including highly radioactive wastes and limits the disposal of others including solidified low level radioactive wastes to disposal under an authorisation issued by the competent national authorities.  Conditions were laid down to control disposals. Prior to the convention disposal of solidified low level wastes was controlled by the OECE Nuclear Energy Agency.</P>
      <P>Most countries felt that disposal of solidified low level wastes to the deep seas should be carried out under strict international surveillance.  Consequently a Multilateral Consultation and Surveillance Mechanism operated by the Nuclear Energy Agency was established. It provides for the prior notification of disposal operations and for an NEA representative to accompany each disposal operation to verify that safety requirements are observed. These safety requirements and operational procedures were reviewed by international expert groups under Irish chairmanship last year and a further group again under an Irish chairman is undertaking a detailed hazard assessment of disposal.  Ireland have furthermore provided an officer to act as an NEA representative on several occasions in recent years.  The current disposal site is 370 miles south-west of Ireland, about 280 miles outside the Continental Shelf and it has a depth of water of some 2.8 miles.  The Nuclear Energy Board have assured me that the disposal of solidified low level wastes to the deep seas of the Atlantic Ocean does not represent in any way a hazard to Ireland.</P>

More than £2,000,000 is paid annually by the Department of Social Welfare to Irish beneficiaries in Britain and the Department of Labour operates a scheme under which payments of allowances and expenses are made to facilitate the return of Irish workers and their families to take up employment in Ireland.  In addition my Department provides funds for the repatriation from Britain of certain categories of Irish citizens there, such as minors and other persons who are totally destitute and in respect of whom repatriation in their particular circumstances is in their best interests.  Recently, in addition, the Government decided to provide financial assistance to help with the employment of social workers in areas in Britain with large Irish populations. The latter assistance will be administered by the Advisory Committee on Emigrants' Services which it is expected will shortly be suitably reconstituted by the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland voted against the resolution approving the second report of the Assembly's Credentials Committee, at the recent resumed 33rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which met to consider the question of Namibia.  The credentials committee had decided that a communication from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa did not constitute valid credentials for South Africa.</P>
      <P>We voted against this recommendation of the credentials committee, because we believe that all member states of the United Nations, however much we deplore particular political systems, are entitled to participate in the proceedings of the General Assembly unless and until their membership rights are suspended in accordance with the proper procedures laid down by the UN Charter.  Decisions on the credentials of delegations of member states are however a technical matter in the sense that the function of the credentials committee is to determine whether the credentials of a delegation are in proper order and have been validly issued by the appropriate authority of the Government concerned.  A credentials committee, in our view, has no mandate to recommend a step which in effect suspends the membership rights of a member state; such a decision should only be taken in accordance with the explicit provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the Charter.  If we had agreed to its recommendation in this case, we would in effect have been acquiescing in a precedent which would endanger the rights of all member states and the efficacy of the United Nations organisation itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither this vote on credentials nor our abstention on the substantive resolution about Namibia at that resumed session, in any way constituted support for the policies of the South African Government in South Africa and <Col N="2627" /> Namibia or for the abhorrent system of apartheid about which Deputies can be in no doubt as to my views and strong feelings.  We regularly express these views at meetings of the General Assembly where Ireland has consistently supported the efforts of the United Nations to enable the people of Namibia to exercise their right to self-determination and independence without delay and has long deplored the obstructive attitude of South Africa which has no legal rights in Namibia.</P>
    <P>Our vote on the credentials issue was intended to promote the respect of UN procedures in the interest of all and the objective of universality of membership at the United Nations&mdash;a view which is shared by the great majority of European democracies including all of the other member states of the Community who voted in the same way as Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our abstention on the substantive resolution on Namibia was due primarly to the fact that the text of a resolution which we could otherwise have supported included an expression of explicit support for armed struggle in Namibia and a related call on member states and other bodies to supply military assistance. In a statement to the General Assembly, the Irish delegate made this point and emphasised that in our view the efforts of the international community should be channelled through the United Nations so as to achieve peace and justice for the Namibian people with the minimum of suffering; a final effort should therefore be made to reach a negotiated settlement.  He made it clear that we supported the general objectives of the resolution (which contained 20 paragraphs in all) and added that Ireland would support firm action by the Security Council if South Africa continued to maintain its intransigent position and denied any longer to the people of Namibia the self-determination and independence to which they were entitled in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for Stage 1 of the East Waterford Water Supply Scheme which involves the development of the Clodagh River as a source of <Col N="2633" /> water supply for the East Waterford area are at present under consideration in my Department.  I cannot yet say when I will be in a position to convey a decision on their proposals to the local authority.</P>
      <P>The development of the Mahon River as a source of supply will form a further stage of the scheme and I understand that the local authority are presently in the process of acquiring water rights to enable them to abstract the required quantities of water from the river.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement on his meeting with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations of 16 May 1979 in relation to differential rents and related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>At their request, I met a deputation from the National Association of Tenants' Organisations on 16 May last in connection with the 1979 national rent and sales schemes.  I informed the deputation that the changes <Col N="2634" /> in the schemes introduced as and from 1 March 1979 could not now be altered. Reports from local authorities indicated that the vast majority of tenants had accepted the changes in the rent scheme and that those whose income was such as to justify increases had been paying increased rents.</P>
      <P>I advised the association that it was inherent in the system of differential renting, that while tenants with low incomes must not be called upon to pay rents they cannot afford at the same time while the costs of providing, maintaining and managing local authority housing estates continue to rise, tenants who enjoy increasing incomes must be prepared to bear a fair share of these increased costs by periodic adjustments of their rents.</P>
      <P>I confirmed to the deputation that there was no question of the Government withdrawing from NATO the recognition of their right to negotiate on behalf of local authority tenants and that full and meaningful negotiations with NATO will take place on any reasonable submissions which the association might make in connection with the review of the schemes for 1980.  Written confirmation to this effect was sent by me to NATO on 17 May 1979.</P>

I have no information as to whether or not applications will be made for any of these houses.  As the Deputy is aware from my reply to recent questions on the same subject there is at present no legal obligation on builders providing new houses for sale to obtain CRVs.  All applications were determined on the basis of the standard criteria used in the assessment of reasonable value.  The houses on this estate varied as to type and price&mdash;widely differing prices being charged for identical houses&mdash;so it is not surprising that some would be awarded CRVs while others were refused.</P>

      <P>This is primarily a matter for each local authority and, no doubt, they are taking all practicable steps in this regard.  On 5 July 1979 my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising them of the EEC policy designed to reduce consumption of oil in the Community.  Each local authority was asked to undertake an immediate review of its situation and advise my Department within the next month of the measures it proposed to take in this regard and the estimated economies resulting therefrom.  In this connection their attention was directed to some obvious conservation measures, such as: limiting space heating to 18º C; boiler servicing; proper maintenance and tuning of vehicles etc.</P>

      <P>The assessment of the motor vehicle excise duty payable in the case of a particular mechanically-propelled vehicle is a matter for the licensing authority concerned in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.  The Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952 as amended, provides that where such a vehicle is constructed or adapted for use and used for the conveyance of goods or burden of any other description in the course of trade or business (including agriculture and the performance by a local or public authority of its functions) the motor vehicle excise duty payable must be assessed at the rates appropriate to &ldquo;goods&rdquo; vehicles.  From inquiries made with Roscommon County Council it has been established that the motor vehicle referred to by the Deputy was properly classified as a &ldquo;goods&rdquo; vehicle for the purpose of the assessment of the motor vehicle excise duty payable, primarily because of its use.  Matters relating to the payment of VAT on a particular motor vehicle are appropriate for determination by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Under the measures decided by the <Col N="2650" /> European Council last December to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member states participating in the European Monetary System, loans of up to £225 million per year from the European Investment Bank and the New Community Borrowing and Lending Instrument are being made available on special conditions to Ireland over a five-year period.  Interest on these loans, which are to be concentrated on but not restricted to the financing of selected infrastructure projects and programmes is to be subsidised at a rate of 3 per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the European Council's decision last December an accelerated programme of project submissions to the EIB was initiated in my Department in co-operation with both the other Departments concerned and State-sponsored bodies.  Already loans amounting to £53 million have been signed with the bank by my Department and State-sponsored bodies this year. Further loans amounting to about £49 million are expected to be signed later this month.  The remaining projects are being assessed as a priority by the bank with a view to sufficient loans being signed over the coming months to enable us to achieve the 1979 borrowing target required for us to avail of the full capitalised interest subsidies of £45 million in respect of the current year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the bank must apply its own banking criteria in an independent manner to the projects submitted.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to furnish a list of the projects which have not yet been signed.</P>
      <P>I can, however, give details of the loans signed to date, as follows: ESB Aghada generating station, £10 million; Global loan to the Industrial Credit Company for small firms, £5 million; National telephones development, £18 million; National forestry development, £15 million; Water supply and sewerage schemes in Shannon area, £5 million. The details of the further loan signings due later this month will be publicised in a Departmental press release on the signing of the contracts.</P>

      <P>The Government's economic targets for 1979 included growth in national output of 6½ per cent.  Economic growth this year will be below this target because of the much higher than anticipated oil price rise and because of the damage caused by industrial disputes.  I made it clear in my Budget speech that the targets, including that for national output, were not forecasts of what would happen without real effort on anyone's part but that their achievement depended upon a coherent communal effort.  In view of the circumstances I have outlined, the best that can be hoped for this year is a growth rate of about 5 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In its monetary policy for 1979 the Central Bank has provided for an increase in bank lending to the private sector of 18 per cent.  As the increase in personal lending has been limited to 10 per cent, there is scope for an increase of about 20 per cent in productive lending.  Lending to the agricultural sector is included in the productive lending category to which the Central Bank has traditionally given priority in its lending advice to the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit guideline was formulated with regard to national economic objectives <Col N="2652" /> including the promotion of a high and stable level of economic growth.  The Central Bank was satisfied that an 18 per cent increase would be adequate to accommodate the reasonable demands of the private sector.  Furthermore, in the context of our membership of the EMS, credit policy this year seeks to ensure that the growth in domestic credit will be consistent with the protection of the exchange rate and the maintenance of our external reserves at an adequate level.</P>
    <P>The growth in bank credit to the private sector in recent months has, allowing for exceptional factors, been well above a trend consistent with the 18 per cent annual guideline appropriate for achievement of national economic objectives. I am advised by the Central Bank therefore that a significant moderation in the rate of expansion of total credit to the private sector, some 20 per cent of which is accounted for by lending to agriculture, will be required over the remainder of the year.</P>

      <P>The remaining £1,263 million represents expenditure on Central Fund Services, Supply Services and issues for capital purposes under various Acts and is generally in line with the budget forecasts apart from a temporary shortfall in expenditure due to the recent postal dispute.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a <Col N="2653" /> statement concerning the import excess of £1 billion in the year ended May 1979 together with the forecast by the Central Bank of a balance of payments deficit of £380 million for 1979 compared to an estimated deficit of £133 million for 1978 and the action proposed to meet this serious situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">

      <P>In the 12 months to May 1979 merchandise imports increased by £843 million, compared with the 12 months ending May 1978.  Of this increase £624 million, or approximately three-quarters, was accounted for by materials for further production and producers' capital goods.  Producers capital goods showed the biggest proportionate increase by far, being up by over 40 per cent in value.  The increase in industrial exports was strong but the performance of agricultural exports reflected supply constraints arising from considerable cattle disposals in earlier years and delayed marketing of cattle as a result of a late spring.</P>
      <P>The large increase in imports of investment goods will widen the productive base of the economy and contribute to further industrial expansion, particularly on the export front, and to job creation.  The growth in imports of materials for further production is partly accounted for by the increase in industrial exports and partly by the increase in personal consumption over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth in the import excess underlines the need to maintain, and if possible improve, our competitiveness on home and export markets and to give maximum support to the Guaranteed Irish campaign.  The action being taken by the Central Bank in regard to its credit guidelines and the upwards adjustment in interest rates should have a beneficial impact on the balance of payments deficit.  It was pointed out in the White Paper &ldquo;National Development 1977-80&rdquo; that the current deficit in the balance of payments could be expected to increase with fast economic growth and that continuous monitoring of the external situation would be necessary so that corrective action could be undertaken <Col N="2654" /> if developments proved more adverse than anticipated.</P>

The Deputy may wish to know, however, that the total labour and materials cost of installing a solar energy or other fixed heating system by a VAT registered contractor would normally be liable to VAT at the effective rate of 3 per cent regardless of the rates applying to the materials used.</P>
      <P>The 3 per cent rate would not apply if the cost of materials supplied exceeded two-thirds of the total price of the work. In such cases the 20 per cent rate would apply.</P>

      <P>Milk sold for human consumption need not be pasteurised in all cases.  Unpasteurised milk may be sold in areas in which Special Designation Orders under the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, are not in force.  In areas where such orders are in force milk sold must either be pasteurised or must meet with stringent standards laid down by the Minister for Agriculture.  Veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture have responsibility to ensure that the pasteurisation process is properly carried out.</P>
      <P>As to the possible dangers to health if non-pasteurised milk is consumed, let me first say that, if milk which is not pasteurised meets with the requirements of the Minister for Agriculture, it is not a source of danger to health.  Raw milk which does not measure up to these requirements is a serious threat to human health.  If a person consumes raw milk he or she has a good chance of contracting brucellosis, non-respiratory tuberculosis or enteric diseases.</P>
      <P>Brucellosis particularly can be most disabling and have long-term effects. The incidence of brucellosis is on the increase and statistics show that there is a distinct relationship between the consumption of raw milk and cases of the disease.  Approximately 35 per cent of all milk sold in Ireland is consumed raw.  Of this only about 3.6 per cent is actually sold for human consumption, the remaining 31.4 per cent being consumed on the farm or by its neighbours.</P>

      <Col N="2659" /> In the long term the solution to the problem lies in the eradication of disease from the herds, a policy which is being pursued by the Department of Agriculture.  In the shorter term the problem can best be dealt with by a combination of extending Special Designation Orders over the entire country and health education.  Statutorily the initiative in seeking such orders rests with the local sanitary authorities and I will continue with my policy of encouraging them to seek such orders.</P>
    <P>The 31.4 per cent consumed on farms represents a much more difficult situation but I am tackling the problem by asking the Health Education Bureau to conduct a campaign aimed at alerting people to the dangers of consuming raw milk.</P>

      <P>The surgeon recommended by the Local Appointments Commission to a post in this hospital, and who was to take up the appointment on 1 July, has not yet done so.  The health board are pressing for an early decision.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties caused by the absence of a surgeon in Cavan Surgical Hospital.  The health board are trying to resolve the situation, but have been unable to obtain a locum surgeon. In the meantime, as I explained in response to parliamentary questions on 30 May 1979&mdash;Volume 314, columns 1744 to 1746&mdash;patients in the Cavan area who need surgical treatment are being referred to hospitals in Monaghan, Navan, Drogheda and Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority, in its recently published Industrial Plan, 1978-82, recognises the need for the encouragement of male employing industry to locate in Castlebar.  In promoting Castlebar the authority will give preference to engineering type industries. In order to facilitate this, a cluster of small advance factory units totalling 15,000 sq. ft. has already been provided by the IDA at Castlebar.  Two of these units have now been allocated to engineering projects that have a combined potential of 27 jobs, virtually all of which will be for men.</P>
