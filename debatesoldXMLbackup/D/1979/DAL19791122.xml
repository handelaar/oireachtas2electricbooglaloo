      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 8, 9 (Resumed), 4, 10 (Resumed), 11, 12 (Votes 10 and 12) and No. 5.  Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. to take Nos. 12 (Votes 10 and 12) and 5 and the order will not be resumed thereafter.  By agreement, it is proposed that in the debate on No. 5 the following time limits will apply to speakers; opening speakers, 20 minutes; Minister, 20 minutes; and other speakers 15 minutes each.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;without debate.  We have been asked to pass recently, with a curtailed debate, the Agricultural Credit Bill, the Garda and Prisons Estimates on the basis that the money was urgently required. I protest about this manner of ordering the Business of the House and asking the House to pass important <Col N="2272" /> debates like that on the Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General on the basis that the money is urgently needed. If we do not agree to give the Estimates we are then accused of withholding money which is urgently wanted.  It reflects very badly on the Government not to order business in a way that will afford adequate debate.  I suggest that that be done in future.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I welcome the Bill.  I have no doubt that the Bill is a move in the right direction.  The proposed cash inflow will be greatly welcomed by the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>It is not clear how much money will be made immediately available to the agricultural community through the ACC.  We had been told that the ceiling on borrowing by the ACC will be raised from £350 million to £600 million but we have no inkling of the amount of cash that will be made available.  In his reply the Minister should give us some idea of the rate of input into the ACC.  I ask that question because the great demand for money is not being met.  The ACC could provide more money if they had the necessary cash inflow.  In his speech the Minister said that he recently authorised the ACC to borrow £25 million. However, I am told that they could have done with £55 million in order to fund the projects on hand.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the grave problems affecting agriculture. The theme that runs through all the contributions is that agriculture is suffering from a lack of confidence.  The farming community are uncertain of the future.  It is alleged that this lack of confidence is accentuated by a lack of credit.  This Bill should enable the ACC to provide more money for our primary industry, an industry which cannot afford to be starved of the necessary cash input.  The development of agriculture is vital to the economy.  Money must be put into agriculture.  For that reason, we welcome this Bill.  The Minister should tell us the amounts involved and how soon they can be allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2277" /> The farming community's lack of confidence has resulted from the lack of credit, especially the lack of credit in the livestock trade.  In his speech the Minister referred to the various uses to which ACC money is put.  The cattle trade is going through a terrible slump at present, much worse that the slumo of 1974.  Money can only be made available to the trade through the ACC as the commercial banks have tightened their credit facilities.  A steady cash flow is necessary for a buoyant market.  Farmers are now selling cattle at a loss because of their need for cash.  The lack of credit is causing many difficulties in agriculture.  If the ACC are given the necessary finance I have no doubt that matters will improve.</P>
    <P>Other factors are responsible for the farming community's lack of confidence. One factor is the uncertainty in regard to the CAP.  We cannot afford to allow this uncertainty to continue.  Our negotiations seem to be dragging.  We do not seem to have the necessary fire which was so evident when Deputy Clinton was Minister for Agriculture.  The Government should try to do something about the uncertainty in regard to the future of CAP.  Yesterday Deputy Clinton clearly illustrated one of the reasons for the present lack of confidence in agriculture.  He related it to the line being taken by the British Government whereby they want to contribute less money to the Community and want to get greater benefits.  One of the means by which they hope to gain greater benefits is by returning to their cheap food policy.  The Minister must be sure that the advantages which we have gained are retained.  It would be a calamity if we were to lose the excellent position which we negotiated and which we have consolidated over the last seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the lack of confidence in agriculture is the uncertainty in regard to taxation proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxation has nothing to do with agricultural <Col N="2278" /> credit as supplied by the ACC.  We have had too much of an agriculture debate on this small Bill, an important one but nevertheless small, dealing with agricultural credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respects I find it impossible to speak on the Bill, which is strictly an agricultural one, without&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have a full scale debate on agriculture on the full Estimate, but this Bill deals merely with agricultural credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely trying to tieup the two, and I shall not dwell on the agricultural points I shall make at any great length.  Therefore, I would plead the indulgence of the Chair and the Minister.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty with regard to taxation creates many problems in that people do not know what the future holds for them.  The sooner we have a definite form of farmer taxation the better, when the farming community will know what to expect, what to budget for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, we cannot discuss farmer taxation on this Bill.  If I allowed the Deputy to do so every other Deputy would want the same concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I have heard a number of other Deputies being given a certain amount of concessions and I was not going to dwell unduly on the matter.</P>
      <P>For the sake of the industry I hope this lack of confidence will be got rid of soon so that we can look forward to the future with optimism.  Unfortunately that is not the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this debate at least one Member of this House has accused the Agricultural Credit Corporation of being partly responsible for the spiralling price of land over the past three or four years. I refute that allegation, because the provision of money for land is not one of the ACC's primary functions.  As can be seen from the Minister's statement, their primary function is to provide money for <Col N="2279" /> livestock and agricultural development.  I believe that some 12 per cent only of the money loaned by the ACC is utilised for the purchase of land and, when it is so allocated it is not for the purchase of any vast tracts of land but merely to give an existing farmer an additional allotment, that allotment being quite small.  For instance, I am told that the maximum amount of money placed on loan by the ACC for land purchase is £40,000.  At present land values one could hardly expect to get more than 20 acres for £40,000 in virtually any part of this country.  Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the ACC have been responsible for the escalating price of agricultural land. Those who have been really responsible in that respect are business and professional people and, for that matter, very big farmers who have got vast amounts of money, people who could also easily obtain credit.  These are the people who have put up the value of land to the level of £3,000 or even £3,500 an acre.  It is unfair to lay the blame on the ACC.  The ACC were given a certain function to perform and they have done so in an excellent manner.  I do not think they can be criticised.  I have never heard responsible members of the farming community or representatives of the recognised farming bodies criticise the ACC unduly.  By and large they are doing an excellent job, the one they set out to do 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here by a number of speakers to the possibility of giving the ACC a licence to operate as a commercial bank, a topic very much in the news over the past week.  We have seen statements in the Press that there are moves afoot to set up a farmers' co-operative bank, and the idea has been mooted that the ACC would be the ideal body to take on such a business project. I have found that within the ACC itself and also amongst knowledgeable people in agriculture this idea is being very well received.  Previously feelers were put out by the ACC with a view to the setting up of such a bank within their own operations. It does not seem to make much sense that we should have a separate farmers' <Col N="2280" /> co-operative bank when the ACC, by getting a licence from the Government, could perform the same function.  I would rather see the matter being dealt with in that way than having a separate farmers' co-operative bank.  The ACC have the personnel and all of the machinery for the setting up and operation of such a bank.  It could be undertaken by them without any expenditure of money because they have the necessary facilities.  Indeed the ACC are to be congratulated on the manner in which they have extended their operations right across the country.  Most sizeable provincial towns nowadays have an ACC office.  I witnessed the opening of two of these offices in my locality in the past year.  They are providing that personal service to the farming community so badly needed. They have in their premises all of the facilities they would need to operate as a commercial bank but are at present being hindered in their operations by a lack of cash flow which they would have, if licensed.  By that I mean that they are not now in a position to issue cheque books, as was pointed out yesterday by Deputy D'Arcy; nor are they in a position to give short-term loans.  All of their loans are given on a long-term basis, rendering the movement of money that much more difficult.  As a result they do not receive the vast amounts of money the commercial banks receive on a short-term basis from people lodging money, people in credit.  The commercial banks utilise this advantage to great effect whereas the ACC are at present being starved of that source of cash.  It seems to be terribly unfair that while the commercial banks can make vast profits the ACC should be stymied in their attempt to go ahead in the same line of business.</P>
    <P>We read in the newspapers yesterday that the former EEC Commissioner for Agriculture, Monsieur Lardinois, who is at present on a visit to this country, advocated that something along those lines should be done here, that there should be a farmers' co-operative banking system, that such a system exists in Holland where it works very successfully.  There does not seem to be any valid reason <Col N="2281" /> that the same cannot be done here, a country which is primarily agricultural. Monsieur Lardinois, in a Press statement, was quoted as saying that there are 1,000 branches of such a farmers' co-operative bank in Holland, providing a tremendous service to the farming community there in general.  The Minister might well investigate the operation of this bank in Holland in order to ascertain if a parallel arrangement could be set up here.</P>
    <P>I read in the Minister's report that the activities of the ACC will be reviewed in, the very near future by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  Perhaps this body would avail of this excellent opportunity to discuss the possibility of giving the ACC a licence to operate as a commercial bank.  Surely if this committee are to have a useful function that is the type of exploratory work that they should endeavour to carry out. I hope that people such as myself can make submissions to them along those lines.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers emphasised that lending rates at the moment are so prohibitive that the growth and development of the agricultural sector is being seriously set back.  There is no doubt that that is true. The ACC lending rates vary from 17½ per cent to 19 per cent, and they are entirely unrealistic for a sector whose income is almost static this year in comparison to last year and previous years.  It should be recognised that the growth in incomes of the farming community is at a stop.  Somebody mentioned that this year the growth in farm incomes will be of the magnitude of 1 per cent whereas the cost of feeding stuffs, fertilisers and other things used by the agricultural sector have been rising at a rate of 20 per cent.  Something will have to be done to give some relief to those who have invested heavily in agriculture. They are being screwed into the ground by these exorbitant interest rates.  It is sad that it is the developers, the people who have borrowed heavily in the best interests of the country to develop their farms, who are being screwed into the <Col N="2282" /> ground by the credit restrictions and the high interest rates.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>There is not enough liaison down the line from the Central Bank to the ordinary man in the street who wishes to borrow the money.  The credit restrictions are very severe, and no bank manager has the discretion to loan more than £2,000 without reference to a higher authority.  That discretion has also been curtailed in the case of the ACC.  The managers at local level know the circumstances and they are in the best position to judge as to who is a good risk and whose project is worthy of support.  Unless that discretion is increased it is a poor outlook for this country that some bureaucrat sitting in an office can decide what an individual farmer should receive.  The men in the field, the local branch manager or the regional manager, are the people who should decide.  I understand that at the moment the discretion limit of the regional manager in the ACC is £20,000 and the discretion limit in the case of the branch manager is something between £7,000 and £10,000.  This is not sufficient, and these people should have a greater discretion. The restrictions are now so strict that these discretion limits were introduced and the borrowers are suffering greatly.  In his reply can the Minister hold out any hope for these progressive farmers who have invested heavily and now find that they cannot make enough money to meet the repayments on their loans?</P>
    <P>Why have we not got a system comparable with other EEC systems where loans at subsidised rates are available for farm development?  Virtually all EEC countries, probably with the exception of Great Britain, have vastly subsidised agricultural loans systems.  For instance, in Germany a farmer can get a loan at a rate as low as 7 per cent.  That is a vast difference to our 17½ per cent to 19 per cent which must militate heavily against expansion in this sector and puts the Irish farmer on an unequal footing with his counterpart in the EEC.  Can the Minister hold out any hope of a change <Col N="2283" /> in our system to allow subsidised interest rates for farm development?  It seems a logical step to take as this is our major industry.  It is reckoned that some 80 per cent of the farms here are not sufficiently developed.  We must do something about this underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>The way to improve matters is to make agricultural loans available at a greatly reduced rate.  I know that a lot of the difficulties in the EEC arose from the fact that years ago they gave out money at an extremely low interest rate, that it is coming back in dribs and drabs and that they have to pay at least 11 per cent to everybody who saves with them. There is an unequal situation there in that their long-term loans are not yielding as much as the rate which they have to pay out.  That obviously creates a difficulty.</P>
    <P>I wished to refer to the agricultural problem a little more but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle put a spoke in the wheel so that it is difficult to broaden the debate as I had wished.  Will the Minister in his reply give some answers to the questions I have posed?  How much money will be released to the ACC other than the £25 million referred to in the Minister's opening statement?  Can the Minister hold out any hope of a subsidised interest rate at a time when credit restrictions are crippling our greatest industry? If these restrictions continue and if the industry continues to suffer it is a bleak outlook for the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Deputies I welcome the Bill, and I am very interested to know how much money will be available to the ACC and also if there is any possibility of lowering the interest rates to farmers.  Everybody knows that this has been a bad year for farmers. They have had a lean year.  Farmers are a bit depressed.  They are worried about the future for cattle.  Many small farmers have just started to develop their farms. If you want to run a small farm efficiently you have to take two cuts of silage off the land.  You must have buildings to house your stock during the winter.  That is where the money comes into it.  Many <Col N="2284" /> small farmers are not getting grants. Everybody knows that.  It is irrelevant to this debate and I will not go into it but it is part and parcel of the need for credit. If a small farmer has his cows out on the land during the winter he cannot take two cuts of silage off it during the summer. He is not getting the proper grants from Brussels.  I will not go into the reason for that.</P>
      <P>The farmer has to get money from the commercial banks or the ACC.  I look on the banks with suspicion when it comes to the question of lending money.  I am associated with the co-operative movement. When we started to develop that movement there was no credit squeeze and there was competition between the banks to lend money.  When the cattle marts started the banks were offering money in every little village to build a cattle mart.  In the West of Ireland we got together, met the Central Bank and asked to have money provided where the marts would be viable.  Money was still lent in places where they were not viable. I was a member of a pig co-operative when the squeeze came and we were in trouble to the amount of £5,000.  When we went to the banks we were told bank policy had changed.  We had to go back to the ACC.  They would not give it to us either.  The banks closed our accounts. We got the Minister to guarantee us and that concern is viable today.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank told the banks to put on the squeeze now, but more than 12 months ago they should have warned them to be careful about lending money. When I see the advertisements about all the money that is available I feel very dicey about them.  When the policy is to put on the squeeze there is no quarter given.  The ACC have been the farmers' friend.  They are very considerate.  If you want money for a viable proposition you will get it from the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmer who is trying to develop is worried about the future of the common agricultural policy.  I have stated time and time again in this House that the EEC is not being run efficiently. What has happened since we entered the EEC is a dangerous policy.  It was grand <Col N="2285" /> to see prices going up but, if they dropped, they would have to drop so far that farmers would be wiped out.  There should have been more control over the EEC budget.</P>
    <P>They are now telling us that there is very little money in the kitty.  Farmers are worried about that.  Cattle and sheep have gone very high in price, but you have to replace them.  At one time a collapse of £10 or £15 in prices would have been considered very serious, but recently there was a collapse of almost £100 in the price of cattle.  There is a terrible fear that something will happen to the CAP.  Countries like us are doing their best, but only a few countries in the EEC are anxious about the CAP.  The vast majority of countries which are not agriculture countries do not want the CAP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We elected a European Parliament and the danger is that it may have too much power and influence.  We have only 15 seats out of 410.  On the Council of Ministers we have one out of nine.  I will not dwell on that any further because if I am ruled out of order that is that.  I have always obeyed the Chair since I came into this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned the interest rates, which are terrible at 18 per cent.  I wonder could money be made available to farmers at a lower interest rate.  Small farmers in particular did not have decent housing for their stock.  I was in a constituency recently in which there are large farmers and I saw big yards which must have been built 15 or 20 years ago.  In my own area small farmers <Col N="2286" /> are trying to put up slatted houses for 30 or 40 cattle.  That type of house costs about £11,000.  That is a big amount of money to a man with a 35-acre farm.  He will get a grant of a couple of thousand pounds and he has to get the rest somewhere.  His only hope is the ACC.  Mention has been made about the possibility of setting up a farming bank.  I would welcome that, but I would not like to see too much competition between it and the ACC.  I would ask the farmers to move slowly and not rush into this.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with giving extra money to the ACC.  I hope it will be used with proper discretion.  If a man has a plan for development the ACC will give him the money but I am worried about the interest rate.  Can anything be done to subsidise the interest rate?  At the moment the commercial banks are not inclined to lend money by order of the Central Bank.  I mentioned the question of the inefficiency of the running of the EEC.  The Central Bank waited until it was too late to say to the commercial banks that they must be careful.  That should have been done 12 months ago and not now when the farmers are having a tough time, when their morale is somewhat low though the situation cannot be said to be as bad as it was in 1974.  Farmers have had a bad year.  I welcome any provision that will mean the making available of more money for farmers, and in this regard I urge the Minister to consider the suggestions that have been made regarding lower interest rates.  Far be it from me to be a prophet of doom, but I always like to point out any weaknesses that I can see in a situation and in this context it can be said that it is not a matter of milk and honey so far as the farmers are concerned this year.  In terms of the weather it has been the worst year for some time but in terms of confidence alone, it is important that the farmers can be assured of a stable situation and they are very anxious now to know whether the guaranteed prices situation they have been enjoying will continue.  I am convinced that a levelling-off period has been reached. Obviously we must not expect prices to continue to increase, but the point is that <Col N="2287" /> in the event of a reduction in prices, a drop of, for instance, £10 at a time when cattle might be cheap, would represent a considerable loss to the farmer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I have availed of the opportunity of pointing out the difficulties being experienced by farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  It is very encouraging to know that the ACC are extending the credit that can be afforded to farmers for the expansion of their business.  As has been pointed out by many speakers, the corporation have expanded their operations very considerably in a relatively short number of years.  They have provided much needed finance and advice to many people during the past ten years.  I am sure that not only everyone here but everyone in the country generally would wish for a continuance of this expansion programme. Apart from the question of lending money and of attracting money into the organisation, much thought should be given by the ACC to the concept of advice and direction to their borrowers. Money is a specialised business.  Many people have failed in business because of failure to manage money properly.  That is why the corporation should give serious consideration to the commercial side of their operations.  The management of money is the business of the commercial banks, and people who borrow from those institutions are kept within the proper guidelines in regard to the management of money and to good business generally.  There is a danger that there could be a breakdown in regard to this aspect of the ACC if there is not built up a proper organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From talking with people engaged in agriculture I find that they are more inclined to borrow from the commercial banks.  Perhaps this is primarily because they have been dealing for longer with these organisations, but there is the impression that in the event of one encountering difficulties, the commercial banks are more flexible, more understanding and more sympathetic.  This is an aspect with which the ACC must come to grips, because there is the impression that the <Col N="2288" /> corporation are inflexible in regard to repayments no matter how difficult a situation a borrower may find himself in. This should not be the case.  This year in particular, when farmers' incomes have dropped drastically, it is rather harsh that there should not be any flexibility on the part of the ACC in regard to repayments. I would make a strong plea for a change in this attitude in respect of anyone who may find himself under great pressure in this difficult year.</P>
    <P>Down through the years the great difficulty in farming related to uncertainty, uncertainty as to prices, markets and so on together with the natural uncertainty of weather.  This situation was responsible largely for the slow development of our agricultural industry, but since our accession to the EEC that whole situation has changed because farmers are being given targets towards which they can work.  For a number of years now they have been in the position of being able to expand their business in the knowledge that they would receive stable prices for their produce.  In that sort of atmosphere there was not an excuse for anyone who might not have done a good job, but unfortunately there is an air of uncertainty creeping back into the industry. From a farming point of view the news of the past few days has been very bad.  We have been hearing of a substantial increase in the co-responsibility levy. Possibly the levy on milk will be increased from .05 per cent to 2 to 3 per cent though I hope that the increase will not be as significant as that.  In addition there are the question marks in relation to the beef and beet market.  This sort of situation spells instability for anyone concerned with the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are not being catered for properly in the EEC forum.  They are being sadly neglected and let down in that market, for their produce seem to be slipping away.  We cannot condone our representatives in the EEC for allowing this to happen.  Instead, we must call on them to secure and consolidate the markets that have been open to us up to now.  We must not allow a situation to arise in which there would be a reduction <Col N="2289" /> in farm incomes, because a downturn in the agricultural industry would be a very serious matter.  As has been said here already, 40 per cent of our people are involved either directly or indirectly in this industry.  The situation will be very serious for people engaged in agriculture and particularly for those in the agricultural machinery industry which I understand is at a standstill.  In the past few months very little has been spent on agricultural machinery and the prospects are bad.  Building in general has suffered and will suffer.  Employment will be affected if there is a downturn in the industry of it uncertainty remains in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The rates of interest payable on loans have been referred to by speakers this morning, and two speakers in particular condemned them.  There is not much anyone can do, because money is a commodity that must be purchased.  It is available at a price.  The only option open to a semi-State body such as the ACC is a lowering of the rates and a restriction of profits.  When rates are so high I do not see why they could not be subsidised in some way or reduced and the loss to the organisation could be made up when the rates fall.  That would not be an impossibility.  It is a great hardship on anybody who has to borrow at the moment and there is a considerable disincentive to borrowing.  Any borrower would have to examine his operations very carefully and consider what would be his return on the money. He would also have to check whether the return could pay even the interest rate. This would not be possible in many instances. Consequently, it might be better not to borrow at the present time, and to delay the investment.  That would be a pity.  Investment in the development of agriculture has been too slow during the years, and it would be a matter of regret if the progress achieved in the past ten years were slowed down or brought to a halt.</P>
    <P>An organisation such as the ACC should have some flexibility in lending rates.  I think they are demanding 18½ <Col N="2290" /> per cent for a term loan.  I do not believe that anyone in their right senses would opt for a term loan at that rate when this interest might be reduced drastically within a year or two.  The only option left to a borrower is short-term borrowing, but this is not the proper approach to borrowing for development.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here that perhaps the ACC might set up their own banking system.  I have not given that much thought.  It is a very professional operation and it cannot happen in the short-term. There are constraints put on the commercial banking system that are penal.  The commercial banks are restrained to lending £57 out of every £100 they have available.  Some 13 per cent of the moneys they have must be kept in cash or in balances with the Central Bank, while a further 13 per cent must be kept in Irish Government exchequer bills.  I do not think that is a proper regulation governing funds which are very urgently needed for industry and particularly for agriculture.  To put a clamp on this type of fund, to direct the banks to keep 43 per cent of funds available for Government sources, is wrong thinking.  The regulation should be examined urgently and changed.</P>
    <P>This regulation is restricting the private sector to 57 per cent of the moneys available.  If we are to have development we cannot have a continuation of this kind of situation.  There should not be a full stop to lending. There should be flexibility with regard to this 43 per cent.  If a farmer can put forward a good case to his bank manager, if he can show him that money is required to increase production, the banking system should be empowered to give some of these funds for that purpose. If we continue with the situation presently existing our development will suffer.  Our banking system has to freeze 43 per cent of its funds.  In Northern Ireland 70 per cent of funds are available to borrowers.  We could make more money available.  Our hands should not be tied so much by Central Bank directions. Until we change the situation we will be short of funds for agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2291" /> It has been a tough year for the farming industry.  The prospects for the lamb industry are poor, and in view of arrangements recently agreed it appears the bottom will fall out of the sheep market.  People who have invested heavily in sheep will lose substantially. There are clouds over the beet industry and the production of cereals and milk. We must give the farming community all the financial help possible.  It was mentioned that we have fallen down badly in providing proper housing for animals, with the result that we are not getting a proper return in the beef industry.  I agree with that view.  The ACC, and the banks, should make loans available, at a subsidised rate of interest, to farmers who are anxious to improve the housing of their livestock.  We are only scratching the surface in this operation and embarking on a programme of proper housing for animals.  Farmers anxious to provide such housing should be given sympathetic consideration when they seek financial assistance.</P>
    <P>The decision to allow unlicensed bulls to roam the countryside again was a retrograde step.  Great efforts were made over the years to improve the quality of our herds&mdash;the fresian breed is an example&mdash;and we are all aware of the increased milk production from cows, something which was necessary to bring us into competition with other EEC countries.  The quality of our beef was also improved by the restrictions on unlicensed bulls but now they are to be lifted. I hope that those animals are used in a limited way.  The lifting of the ban on unlicensed bulls will undo a lot of the great work carried out by farmers and creameries.</P>
    <P>It upset me to learn that there had been a big reduction in the use of lime on our land.  Of course, that arose because of the decision to abolish the subsidy on lime.  As the lime subsidy has been removed the ACC should be encouraged to establish a lime fund to encourage farmers to use more lime, because it is the best form of fertiliser.  Land that is not properly limed will not yield a good return.  Money should also be made <Col N="2292" /> available for drainage.  At this stage of drainage and reclamation work it is the small farmers who are being left behind, because those with big holdings and the big operators have carried out that work. Small farmers about to undertake drainage work on their land should be given all the help possible.  They require capital to improve the quality of their land.  Land is the wealth of this nation, and farmers should be given every encouragement to improve the quality of it. It is the most important item that money could be borrowed for, and because of that money should be made available at a low interest rate for drainage work.  It should be remembered that reclaimed land is slow to mature, but farmers anxious to undertake such work are required to borrow over a number of years at 18½ per cent.  This is asking them to put a big millstone around their necks.  The most vulnerable section of the farming community are being penalised in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>We set the ceiling at £350 million in the Agricultural Credit Act, 1978.  Business was greater than expected and hence we have to increase the ceiling sooner than was predicted two years ago.  That is something everyone welcomes.  I should like to tell Deputy Barry that we are not in favour of subsidising interest rates.  It would be very costly to do that.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that agriculture gets many other forms of assistance from State bodies.  Deputies are fully aware that interest subsidies are contrary to EEC rules of competition. The general question of protecting people like egg producers is primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture. Deputy P. Barry laid a lot of emphasis on this and I intend to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. Barry in his opening contribution and some other Deputies mentioned the farmers co-op bank.  We are all reading a lot about it but nothing definite has come to hand.  There is no conflict with the ACC.  In fact, farmers representatives had discussions with the ACC from time to time about a joint venture.  The Minister is following the proposal for a co-op bank with interest, a good proposal.  It is a valid one but it raises complex issues which would have to be examined by the Minister and also by the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Leary spoke about land purchase.  The ACC are very careful to ensure that loans for land purchase will not push up prices.  That was already mentioned this morning.  Only 15 per cent of their loans in 1978 went for land purchase.  For the last four years the average was 12 per cent.  The maximum loan for land purchase is £50,000. Deputy O'Leary spoke about small farmers. Small farmers get loans for productive purposes at low rates of interest. Deputy O'Leary also spoke about co-operation with the EEC and keeping <Col N="2294" /> abreast with what is happening there. The ACC keep in close touch with developments in the EEC.  They are particularly anxious to help farmers who are taking part in the EEC Farm Modernisation Scheme.  A number of Deputies touched on this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary also spoke about leasing land.  The Minister for Agriculture is examining the whole question of land structures, leasing and so forth.  He will no doubt consider the importance of credit in moving land from aging farmers to younger ones.  This is also a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned flexibility. The ACC enjoy considerable freedom in running their business but they are a very large credit institution. Hence the Minister must ensure that they operate within overall monetary policy.  This explains some of the controls exercised by the Minister.  It may seem unnecessary to come back to the House to increase borrowing limits but we must bear in mind that this very point gives Deputies an opportunity of reviewing the work of the ACC from time to time and making their contributions.  I welcome this and I am sure all Deputies do also.  It is a help to the ACC and to the Deputies who would like to make some comment on the work of the ACC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke about the 1978 Act and fisheries.  The 1978 Act did not give the ACC new lending powers except for fisheries.  It has not been necessary to use those powers because BIM are providing sufficient credit for fisheries. The 1978 Act made it easier for the ACC to take security for loans and they found those facilities very useful.  It saves time in the issuing of loans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned the credit squeeze.  The fact that the Minister recently agreed to the ACC borrowing £25 million abroad shows the Government's appreciation of the importance of investment in agriculture.  The Deputy somewhat exaggerated the restriction on credit to agriculture.  Total advances owing to banks from agriculture increased <Col N="2295" /> from £500 million in February 1979 to £640 million in August 1979.  Deputy Bruton somewhat exaggerated when he spoke about a credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and a few other Deputies mentioned salaries, particularly that of the executive.  This is a matter for the public service.  Deputy Bruton made various suggestions and I will convey his views to the ACC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty spoke quite a lot about extending the advisory services. This matter is being considered by the Minister for Agriculture.  One of the principal functions of the new body, AnCOT, will be to organise a better farm advisory service.  This came very forcibly to me in many of the contributions of the Deputies.  The Deputy also mentioned interest paid on deposits.  The matter is kept under review by the Minister for Finance.  It raises wider issues such as the general level of interest rates in the country.  I am sure all Deputies appreciate that important fact.</P>
    <P>Most of the points raised about the Land Commission are proper to the Minister for Agriculture, who is examining the whole question of land purchase and distribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe spoke of limits on borrowing by the ACC.  As I have already stated in reply to Deputy Bruton, it is good to maintain limits and this gives the House an opportunity of discussing the working of the ACC from time to time.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. Collins spoke about borrowing £25 million abroad.  Some of the money will be borrowed from Germany. Negotiations are still continuing with foreign banks but we do not yet know the countries from which all the £25 million will be borrowed.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy referred to interest rates.  The Minister is very concerned about the high level of interest rates but markets for money these days are highly competitive and one has to pay the going rate.  The Minister and the Central Bank are keeping the situation under constant review.  It would be very costly to subsidise <Col N="2296" /> interest rates and this raises difficulties with the EEC.  The Deputy spoke quite a lot about cheque books issued by the ACC.  This matter is still with the ACC, who are examining the issue, a very complicated one.  One of the big difficulties, for example, is arranging clearance facilities.  The ACC are not yet convinced that the operation of cheque books would be as simple and as profitable as the Deputy implied. However, the matter is under consideration by them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to development loans.  There is no intention of reducing the repayment period, which still remains at 16 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the £25 million being borrowed abroad and said that it should be distributed in a matter of weeks.  I can tell the Deputy that it will be distributed in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I believe I have covered all the points which referred specifically to the Bill.  As Deputies will appreciate, I cannot answer for another Minister.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their support for this Bill.  I will convey some of their suggestions to the Board of the ACC.  I should like to join in the tributes which have been paid to the Directors and staff of the ACC, past and present, who have contributed so much to the success of the ACC.  I can assure Deputies that the ACC are well equipped to cater for the needs of agriculture in the eighties.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> On Second Stage I made the point that it was most inappropriate that the ACC should be subject to the Department of Finance, that it would be more appropriate if they were subject to the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister of State, who was sent in here by the Minister for Finance, who is, apparently, the boss of the corporation, told us that there was no control over small borrowings.  He implied that there was control over large borrowings.  The Minister of State now tells us that there is no control but that they are in close contact with each other.  A child is in close contact with his father and he has to ask his father for any money that he wants.  Apparently there is some sort of similar close contact in this situation.  It emphasises the point that I was making: that the wrong Minister is the father figure, that it should be the Minister for Agriculture.  The House is entitled to know what control the Minister for Finance exercises over the ACC in regard to their borrowings.  That is a fair question and it should be clarified.  There may have been irrelevancy on Second Stage.  If anything is irrelevant at this stage it is how the corporation exercise their borrowing rights.  The Minister should clarify the position before we go any further.</P>

      <P>As regards the money, obviously&mdash; and I cannot see why the Minister does not come out and say it&mdash; the Agricultural Credit Corporation cannot borrow freely abroad without the sanction of the Minister for Finance. That must be a fact; otherwise one could not run a country.  What I am trying to establish is: are they allowed to do so up to a certain limit by the Minister, say £100 million; then go away and, when they have used up that figure, come back to the Minister, or do they go abroad and examine the possibility of borrowing £7 million, £8 million or £11 million from different banks around Europe, coming back to the Minister seeking sanction for each specific one?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is not that control then is it possible for the ACC to borrow in a currency which it might be the opinion of the Minister for Finance and his officials, on the basis of their knowledge of likely prospects in exchange markets, is a bad currency for them in which to be borrowing because it is a currency likely to increase in value thereby ensuring the repayments will exceed the amount received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is no control on the ACC in this matter, is it not possible that they would be making very unwise decisions as to borrowing in particular currencies as against other currencies?  Indeed there has been experience in the past, if I am not mistaken, of the ACC borrowing in Deutschemarks before the Deutschmark rose, and finding that they had to make very substantial repayments far in excess of the amount they actually received because they had borrowed at the wrong time and in the wrong currency.  The Minister tells us now that there is no control on what the ACC may do in this matter.  That seems to me to be a very bad thing because there should be general control as to particular currencies if we are to avoid a recurrence of the unfortunate event I have mentioned, when this country and the ACC lost <Col N="2302" /> because they borrowed in the wrong currency and at the wrong time.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is general control in the matter, as the Minister has said.  If there is merely general control but no specific control, and the ACC may borrow in a way that is against the wishes of the Minister&mdash;up to the limit they have of £600 million&mdash;it seems that if the Minister disagrees with this the only recourse available to him is to sack the board.  Is the Minister saying that his control, in effect, amounts to nothing more than the possible exercise of the threat of sacking the board?  If that is what he is talking about, if that is the control he is exercising, or the weapon he has to use to exercise it, then I believe it is insufficient because of the vagaries of the international exchange market.  As far as foreign borrowing is concerned I believe there must be more specific control, certainly if not at the particular banks from which they borrow&mdash;a matter that could be appropriately left to themselves&mdash;at least as to the amount and denominations of foreign currencies in which they borrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the implications. The ACC should be given the same advantage as every other moneylending institution.  In fact the Minister would do no harm to give them a slight advantage in this.  At the moment they are quoting at a figure of 11 per cent which is a disadvantage.  The banks are quoting from 11 per cent to 13½ per cent, the building societies are quoting higher prices than the ACC.  The ACC are at a disadvantage.  The Minister said that an application has been made but has not been dealt with by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State would clear my mind if he told me what time lapse there has been since the application was made, and how long it has been considered.  It could be considered for a year if it suited the Minister for Finance.  As far as the ACC are concerned the disadvantage they are at in relation to deposits showed its head in July and we are now into November.  It is easy to understand why there is a flow of deposits from the ACC.  I would appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Finance to deal with this question immediately.  We are entitled to have the answer to this question.  We are there to protect the ACC whereas the Minister for Finance has shown that he has no commitment to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy D'Arcy.  Because of the decline in the flow of deposits to the ACC their lendings to farmers this year are no greater than they were last year, whereas other credit institutions have increased to a limit of at least 18 per cent on their lendings to the various sectors for which they were responsible last year.  After all the ACC will have to pay the interest and if the judgment of the board is that they should increase their rate, the Minister should take it as the judgment of competent people who have to bear the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said something very contradictory in answer to my last contribution. The Minister said that the only limit was the limit of £600 million contained in this section on the borrowings of the <Col N="2309" /> ACC, then in answer to subsequent questions he said that the Minister controlled the borrowings of the ACC, and he said at another time that there were constant consultations between the Minister and the ACC, which is an intermediate position between not controlling them and controlling them.  We have three possible answers to one question, which is, to say the least, confusing and not something that one would expect of a Minister in charge of getting this legislation through the House, which is still a responsible legislature.  If the Minister is worthy of the name of Minister he should be able to answer, a question in a consistent fashion.  If the Minister of State is unable to answer, the Minister for Finance should be here.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not been able to give a clear answer to a straight question on this issue.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the answer is that although the Minister does not control the borrowings he controls the giving of state guarantees in respect of borrowings undertaken, so that technically he does not control the borrowings but any borrowings undertaken have the benefit of a guarantee from the State.  When the guarantee is given the Minister has a final and absolute control on the borrowing. The Minister is obliged by law to lay before this House a detailed statement of the guarantees given by the Minister in respect of ACC borrowings.  All we get in the House is a global statement of the amounts guaranteed, which does not coincide in full with the requirements of the Act, but that is another issue.  The answer to the question may be that while the Minister does not control the borrowings he controls the guarantees in respect of the borrowings, which gives him effective control.  If that is the answer the Minister should have been able to give it himself, and it should not have come from the Opposition.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The least we might have expected in return was that the Minister for Finance would come in here and deal with the Committee Stage.  I am not saying that in any patronising way.  I have sympathy for the Minister of State who has been sent in to deal with this Bill section by section, which is outside his office, which is the Office of Public Works. The absurdity of the debate has become apparent.  In the early stages of the debate on the section the Minister told us clearly that the approval of the Minister for Finance for borrowing was not necessary in every case.  In another intervention he told us equally clearly, and with apparent conviction, that the approval <Col N="2311" /> of the Minister is necessary in every case.  I agree with that, because the section we are dealing with says that subject to the approval of the Minister the corporation may raise or borrow up to £600 million.</P>
      <P>If the Minister's approval is necessary to borrow, he may consider the conditions under which money is borrowed. One of the conditions is the rate of interest which may be charged.  Deputy D'Arcy's worry is that the Minister is restricting the corporation with regard to the interest they may pay and, as a result, they are becoming short of money and, as a result, the farmers are suffering. We understand that, in fact, the Minister has refused to allow the corporation to increase their borrowing rates.  He has not stated that but he has adopted the usual ploy of the Minister for Finance by refusing to answer questions, refusing to give them the necessary authority and putting the matter on the long finger.</P>
      <P>That is not good enough, and it is one of the reasons why they have to borrow abroad.  Attractive enough rates of interest are not being given at home.  I regard the turn which this debate has taken as quite serious.  I do not blame the Minister of State, who is a junior Minister in charge of the Office of Public Works.  The man who should be here to deal with the Committee Stage of this Bill, which is being given today to facilitate its early passage, is the Minister for Finance.  Normally Committee Stage would not be taken for a week and the Minister would have a chance of studying the points made on Second Stage and answering them.  It is obvious that the Minister of State is not equipped to answer all the questions which have been asked.  I deplore that.</P>

It is quite obvious that no Government could allow any State body under their control to borrow freely without the sanction of the Minister.  What I set out to establish was whether he gave a blanket approval for a certain amount, or whether each specific borrowing had to be approved by the Minister.  The Minister said they could borrow anything they liked.  It is quite obvious that could not be the case, but he stuck to that point up to ten minutes ago, and now he has changed completely.  We are doing no twisting at all.  We are trying to establish the truth about this, as we are entitled to do, and as it is our duty to do.

      <P>In reply to the Second Reading debate the Minister referred to the questions that had been put to him regarding the subsidisation of various aspects of agriculture.  Deputy Callanan suggested that there should be subsidisation in respect of the erection of sheds, for instance, while Deputy D'Arcy suggested that subsidisation might be used in order to make up the losses that farmers are experiencing in regard to cattle.  I made the same point and referred also to the poultry industry which is in a very serious situation.  We have been told that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister for Agriculture could agree to such subsidisation <Col N="2315" /> because to do so would be in breach of EEC regulations.  However, to accept exchange rate loss risks is a form of subsidisation.  Therefore, if the Government can engage in this activity for the ACC, I fail to see why they cannot subsidise interest rates also.  Consequently, the Minister should reconsider the answers he gave in this connection in replying to the Second Stage debate and say that he will agree now to subsidise interest rates but in a limited number of cases and where there is obvious hardship.  The Minister for Agriculture would be in a much better position to recognise such cases than would any of us here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty said that it would be to the benefit of the cattle industry if farmers did not have to pay 18 or 19 per cent on the money they borrowed and that if rates were lower farmers would be enabled to keep cattle on the land and that this would have the effect of stopping the fall in cattle prices that producers have been experiencing this year.  I fail to see any reason for the Minister not being able to subsidise interest rates in respect of the cattle industry.  The same applies to the poultry industry, an industry which, for a number of reasons, cannot compete with the huge foreign-owned enterprises that are taking an interest in the Irish company, in one case to the extent of 50 per cent.  That is in one of the biggest of the Irish companies.  These outside enterprises have almost virtual control of egg production in the six counties and are sending the eggs down here at the expense of our producers. Irish egg producers will not be able to continue in business after Christmas unless immediate and drastic action is taken to help them in regard to the protection of their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an area, too, where the Minister can help.  It is not sufficient to say that he is prevented from subsidising interest rates because of EEC rules now that he has let it be known that the Government have guaranteed exchequer rate risks in regard to money borrowed abroad by the ACC.  The same can be done in regard to interest rates.  For instance, <Col N="2316" /> in respect of a rate of 17 per cent, the borrower could pay 10 per cent and the Department could pay the remaining 7 per cent.  It is not good enough to hide behind technicalities of this kind.  It would appear that no other country in Europe is as much tied up in red tape as we have been for the past two years. Recently I heard the Minister for Agriculture described as being the most unreasonable man in Ireland when in Ireland but the most reasonable man when abroad arguing with fellow Ministers for Agriculture when he has no difficulty in seeing the point of view of his British, Italian or French counterparts, whereas he is not able to see the point of view of the agricultural industry at home.  Unless some urgent action is taken in regard to this industry, serious damage will be done to the economy as a whole.</P>

If somebody can prove that he is in genuine difficulty and needs to borrow £5,000 from the ACC at the current commercial rate of 17 per cent, he could be subsidised by having to pay only 10 per cent interest with the Government subsidising him to the tune of the additional 7 per cent.</P>

      <P>I welcome very much the new development whereby the Government are to carry to risk of exchange rate losses.  That is a worthwhile development because when there is a shortage of money in the country we have no option but to go elsewhere to borrow.  We must realise that membership of the EMS has not improved our position on the foreign money market.  Previously the ACC or any other Government organisation, as a result of our linkage with sterling, were in a position to go to the London foreign money market and borrow money overnight at very low interest rates, but the fact that that is no longer possible is a serious loss to us.  On many occasions when interest rates were running at up to 14 per cent, we could borrow money overnight in London at 2 or 3 per cent. The change in this situation has created a problem for the ACC.  A word of praise is due to the Minister for guaranteeing to carry the exchange rate risks attaching to the borrowing of this £25 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy Barry in regard to the subsidising of interest rates is very important.  I do not think that the Deputy was referring to an across-the-board type of subsidisation in this regard.  However, those people whose holdings are uneconomic or who have no hope of being able to buy extra land in order to bring their holdings up to viable standards because of the very high interest rates prevailing, should be helped in this respect by way of the subsidisation of those interest rates.  This sort of operation would not cost a huge amount of money because it would relate only to very limited borrowing.  We have had such subsidisation before.  It is necessary to have it again, and in this instance the people who should be involved are the ACC.  With respect to the Department of Finance such an operation would not be one for them.  The ACC are doing a specific job in the sphere of agriculture and, consequently, should be under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture.  Having said that, <Col N="2318" /> but not wishing to sound bitter, I would not wish to see the present incumbent of the office of Minister for Agriculture with that responsibility, having regard to his performance of late.</P>

      <P>It is generally accepted that the growth rate in agriculture will be in the region this year of .5 to 1 per cent whereas we have had a much higher growth rate.  Obviously, then, something serious has happened to bring about such a setback, but it is in the interest of the economy as a whole that the present trend be reversed immediately.  I might remind the Minister that in his party's election manifesto there was a promise to subsidise interest rates for people on uneconomic holdings.  We stated that before.  We had not got around to it but things were different at that time. Nobody expects subsidisation of interest rates across the board.  However, the export of our agricultural produce is important for the nation.  If we reduce the £1,100 million of exports the economy will be in serious difficulties.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not want to prolong the debate as to whether the Minister <Col N="2319" /> said earlier that all borrowing was not subject to approval and that later he said all borrowing is subject to approval.  I refer the Minister to the verbatim report of the debate.  It makes interesting reading.  I do not think it is blurred or interfered with by any interruptions.  It is crystal clear that the Minister who should be here is the Minister for Finance.  It is not treating the House properly to expect all stages of a Bill like this on short notice and not to come to the House himself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry raised the matter of the poultry industry.  This is very important for my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. We have an economy that is based on processing agricultural products&mdash;pigs and poultry including chickens, ducks and turkeys.  The pig industry in Monaghan and Cavan gives valuable employment.  In County Monaghan the poultry industry employs about 800 people and, consequently, it is very important.  Deputy Barry was quite correct in what he said.  The poultry processing industry in County Monaghan is under very heavy pressure from Northern Ireland.  People there are engaging in unfair practices in that they are virtually dumping products on the Irish market to the detriment of the industry in County Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that under this Bill the Minister and the ACC have the necessary powers.  It may be a complex matter but semi-State bodies are there to deal with complex problems and to solve them.  It is not good enough to say that subsidising interest would lead to this, that or the other.  If there are hundreds of jobs at stake in County Monaghan&mdash;I am speaking from memory but I think the number of people employed in the poultry industry in that area is 800&mdash;the House will realise that this is a very important matter.  It should be tackled by the ACC and the Minister for Finance. We are told they are in close contact with each other practically every day; in fact, I have come to the conclusion that there is a Department of Finance tachograph in the ACC.  If that association <Col N="2320" /> prevails it is up to the Minister for Finance to find a solution to the problem that exists in County Monaghan in the poultry trade by making cheap money available, by subsidising interest or by some other form of support.  The time to prevent redundancies is before closures take place.  Deputy Barry has given advance warning about the matter.  He has been approached about it and he has the facts and figures.</P>
    <P>I make this strong appeal on behalf of poultry producers in Monaghan and Cavan for help from the ACC by way of subsidised interest.  It is obvious now that the Minister approves of all loans.  I am sure he has the power to authorise the ACC to make loans available at subsidised rates of interest.  I am asking him to do that instead of leaving it to Fóir Teoranta, the rescue body under the aegis of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, which usually comes into the picture when the cause is lost.  If the Minister for Finance and the ACC assist the poultry industry in Monaghan it will not be necessary for later fire brigade action by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>

The Minister of State said that the Minister for Finance had underwritten an exchange loss guarantee in relation to this loan, but it appears now that the terms are still under negotiation. I want to know in what currency the loan is being borrowed.  Further, I should like the Minister to inform the House&mdash;and this has far-reaching implications for the ACC and other public bodies&mdash;whether we may take it that because of the guarantee of the Minister for Finance to underwrite any exchange loss, any further overseas borrowing by the ACC or by any other State body will contain a similar exchange loss guarantee.</P>

      <P>My remarks about the confusion were justified because the Minister of State is no saying that the Minister does and has to guaranty all borrowings.  Deputy Barry asked him in the course of debate on section 2 if the ACC make their own arrangements to borrow up to certain ceilings or if the arrange a loan on the continent and the seek the sanction of the Minister.  The Minister of State replied that the only time the Minister gives a sanction when there is a specific big borrowing from outside the country.  Now, 45 minutes later, the Minister of State is telling us that the sanction of the Minister is required in all cases.  Perhaps the House now appreciates a little more the reason for the confusion.

The Minister of State has now confirmed that the sanction of the Minister for Finance is required in respect of all borrowings but he has not given an answer to the important question I asked.  The Minister for Finance has undertaken exchange loss guarantee in relation to the loan of £25 million, and correctly so, but, as we are discussing further authorisation to the ACC to borrow up to a certain sum, I should like to know if we can take it that the Minister for Finance will guarantee exchange loss in relation to any further overseas borrowings by the ACC?

      <P>Every Opposition Deputy who contributed to the debate on this Bill spent a lot of time discussing matters relevant to the Department of Agriculture and other Departments rather than confining their remarks to the provisions of the Bill.  I sat for hours listening to the debate and, in replying, I tried to be fair to Deputies who asked for information in relation to the Bill.  I cannot answer questions relating to agriculture or lands.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle on many occasions had to remind Deputies that they were dealing <Col N="2324" /> with questions of agriculture and land rather than the provisions of the Bill.  I did not interrupt Deputies even though I was aware that their remarks were not related to the Bill.  Now, Fine Gael, after they had agreed to give us the Bill, are holding it up on a technicality, on confusion about something that was misinterpreted. I have clarified that matter and answered all the question that were put to me.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is not hiding behind anything.  He has the interests of the farming community at heart.  The introduction of the Bill is a gesture by the Government to the farming community. If the Fine Gael Party want to hold up the granting of permission to the ACC to borrow this £25 million they should tell that to the farming community.  They should tell the farmers that they have spent three days discussing this.  It is difficult for one to keep one's patience in relation to this.  This is a disgrace.

When Second Stage completed one hour ago we could have asked that Committee Stage be taken next Tuesday, which is the normal thing to do.  The histrionics displayed by the Minister of State a few moments ago do not impress me.  That is not a matter for the Minister of State; it is a matter for the Chair.  I accept that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle corrected some speakers whom he felt were wandering outside the scope of the <Col N="2325" /> Bill, but for the last hour we have been endeavouring to get information on matters of finance from the Minister of State.  That is our duty and we are entitled to that information.  If we are to remain here until five o'clock we will get the information which we feel it is the right of Members to have on the record. Any blustering, shouting, attempting to bully or blackmail by the Minister of State by saying that Fine Gael are trying to hold up the farming development of the country does not impress us.  It is the Minister's job to give Members information in relation to Second Stage.

If the House is to be asked to pass this Bill and are told that the Minister has now given a guarantee in relation to large overseas borrowing, and if the House cannot be told whether a similar guarantee will be given by the Department of Finance in relation to any further borrowings which the ACC may make under this Bill, it leaves Deputies disadvantaged in establishing just how costly the ACC overseas borrowings may be and also in establishing in relation to other State bodies who may be borrowing abroad in the future if that similar guarantee will be given to them in respect of exchange law.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Before the Bill leaves the House I should like to say a few words on it.  This party agreed to facilitate the passage of this Bill through the House. Deputy Peter Barry undertook to take all Stages immediately after the Second Stage was disposed of, and we are doing that.  That did not mean that we agreed to allow this Bill to go through the House without proper debate or without proper investigation.  This Bill authorises an increase in the borrowing powers of the ACC from £350 million to £600 million.  The money that is borrowed will be lent to farmers.  Surely this side of the House are entitled to discuss agriculture under this Bill, because the additional £250 million which the ACC are being authorised to borrow will be lent to farmers. The House would be in great dereliction of its duty if it did not express <Col N="2328" /> its views about the various sectors of agriculture in need of more capital and if they did not advise the ACC and the Minister how that money should be lent, to what sectors of the agricultural community it should be lent, and if it did not discuss in general under this Bill agriculture and agricultural policies.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to remain here listening to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance complaining bitterly because agriculture was discussed under the Bill.  I do not care what Minister should be here, but we would not be doing our duty if we did not have that sort of discussion.  I make no apologies to the Minister for contributing to that debate. If a similar Bill was introduced next year, I would also contribute to it on the same lines if I am on this side of the House, which is not at all certain.  The Minister may not like a debate on agriculture as he is a city man and is perhaps not very familiar with it.</P>
      <P>We spent the morning dealing with the technicalities of the financial provisions of the Bill.  Surely that was in order?  The Minister seemed to resent that.  He seemed to think we were probing too deeply into it, that too many people were asking questions.  This morning was taken up, with the exception of the brief flight into poultry, with the technicalities of the Bill in regard to borrowing.  I make no apologies for asking questions about whether or not the Minister's approval is necessary for borrowing.  I believe that the points raised by the other Deputies were also very relevant and close to the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should either order their business in such a way that there can be an ordinary debate on the various Stages of Bills&mdash;that when the Second Stage is dealt with the Committee Stage is taken a week or two afterwards&mdash;or keep their cap on when they come in and ask to be facilitated by the quick passage of Bills through the House and ask that the Committee Stage and subsequent Stages be taken on the same day as the Second Stage.  When that facility is afforded to the Government it means that the Minister may not be as well briefed as he <Col N="2329" /> should be, but he should certainly not become aggressive and accuse the Opposition of being obstructive when they are facilitating the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not want to be misinterpreted.  I welcome question on this matter.  Some Deputies suggested that we should not come back to the House to raise the statutory limit of borrowing and I said in my reply that it gave Deputies an opportunity to raise questions on this and on the working of the ACC and that it might be a bad day's work if that ceased.  That alone gave an indication of my willingness to receive any queries.  It indicates my willingness to help Deputies on all aspects of the workings of the ACC.  It was wrong of the Deputy to misinterpret what I said.  I always try to help Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>D'achtuíodh Acht na dTithe, 1969, mar Acht sealadach toisc go raibh ganntannas géar tithíochta ann ag an am, go háirithe i mBaile Atha Cliath agus i gcuid des na bailte móra eile, agus ceapadh sa tráth sin nach mairfeadh an ganntannas ro-fhada.

Tá cead Seanaid Eireann faighte cheana féin.</P>
    <P>The 1969 Act provides generally that the permission of the housing authority must be obtained for the demolition or change of use of a habitable house in their administrative area.  When determining an application for permission, housing authority must take cognisance of the state of repair of the house to which the application relates and the adequacy of the supply of dwellings in it functional area.  An authority may refuse permission or grant it with or without conditions and may, in granting permission, require the provision of replacement accommodation or a contribution towards the cost of providing it.</P>
    <P>The expectations in 1969 were that the restrictions imposed temporarily by the Act, combined with an increase in the output of new houses and in the number of existing houses being repaired and improved with the aid of Government incentives, would progressively ease the situation to a point where the controls under this Act would no longer be necessary.  However, while housing output has greatly increased since 1969 and a huge number of houses have been preserved and improved with the aid of loans and grants from public funds, the circumstances which gave rise to the introduction of the Act have not entirely disappeared.  I am satisfied that a need still exists for some form of control over the change of use or demolition of habitable houses to facilitate commercial or industrial development which, due to economic factors, can often be financially more rewarding than the retention of houses for residential purposes.</P>
    <P>While statistics furnished to my Department show that the provisions of the Act have been utilised by at least 38 housing authorities, the greater part of the activity has been confined to the Dublin and Cork city areas.  Up to the end of September this year, Dublin Corporation had reached 2,021 applications for permission.  Of these, 886 were <Col N="2331" /> refused and 1,135 were granted subject to conditions.  During the same period, Cork Corporation received 257 applications. Permission was granted in 181 cases, refused in 61 and 15 applications were withdrawn.</P>
    <P>There is a right of appeal to the Minister for the Environment where a housing authority refuses permission or grants it subject to conditions.  Up to 30 September 802 such appeals had been submitted.  Of these, 48 were invalid as they were not received within the statutory period, 585 were determined, 112 were withdrawn, and the remainder were under consideration at that date.</P>
    <P>In November 1977, when a motion proposing the continuance in force of the 1969 Act for a further two years was being debated in the Dáil, the Minister for the Environment indicated that permanent provisions for the type of control exercised under the Act were then being prepared.  The task of making the provisions permanent was being undertaken in the belief that, with some amendments of the terms of the 1969 Act, the new provisions would form a realistic and equitable method of control and that it would be possible to incorporate the revised provisions in the Housing Bill, the preparation of which was well advanced.</P>
    <P>Following the making of the order extending the 1969 Act up to 31 December 1979, the proposals then in draft for making permanent provisions were reconsidered in the light of the debates in the Dáil and the Seanad which preceded the making of the order.  Subsequently, when the proposals for legislation on the subject were considered in consultation with other Departments, attention was drawn to a number of problems to which the proposals could give rise and to associated and conflicting considerations which it would be difficult to reconcile.</P>
    <P>In this context, there was, and is, the argument that the controls may have the effect, in the case of refusal of permission for a change of use from a habitable house to an alternative and more profitable use, of making it difficult, if not impossible, for the owner to maintain <Col N="2332" /> the property economically, as a result of which it may deteriorate rapidly and be lost to the housing stock.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made in this regard about the policy operated in relation to limited areas within their district by some housing authorities under which permissions for change of use of houses in the area are generally refused. This can have the effect of bringing about the steady, and sometimes rapid, deterioration of whole streets of houses, worth retaining on architectural grounds, but which would require a level of expenditure on maintenance and improvement which the income obtainable from lettings as houses and flats would not make economically viable.</P>
    <P>A further consideration which arises is that a refusal of permission cannot ensure that the habitable house retained will be occupied as a dwelling.  Again, where permission is given subject to conditions requiring at least the same amount of habitable accommodation to be provided in the course of redevelopment, the new accommodation may not, in many cases, be a suitable alternative for the persons or families displaced.  In other words, the stock of the type of housing they require will be diminished and the replacement accommodation provided on the site may be too expensive for them.  This point was referred to by Deputy Ruairí Quinn when a similiar Motion was before this House on 7 December 1977.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable, and justifiable, criticism of developers who set out to defeat the objectives of the Act by allowing habitable houses to remain unoccupied, unmaintained and a target for vandals.  They do this on the basis that the restrictions under the Act on redevelopment will no longer apply when the dwellings become unfit for human habitation.  There are provisions in the temporary Act which were intended to enable local authorities to deal with such cases of deliberate dilapidation, but in practice these powers were found to be unworkable.  Attempts by local authorities to enforce the controls were not successful.  This is an unsatisfactory <Col N="2333" /> situation, one which will receive careful attention when proposals for permanent legislation to replace the 1969 Act are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of whether or not provision for compensation should be provided in cases of refusal of permission, either to demolish or change the use of a habitable house. No such provision had been seen as necessary in the temporary Act.  But it has been argued that the absence of such a provision can, in some cases, be inequitable to the owners of property affected. On the other hand, provision for payment of compensation generally could make the operation of the Act unduly costly for local authorities.</P>
    <P>These legal, administrative and functional problems could not, because of their complexity, be resolved without unduly delaying the preparation by my Department, and the consideration by the Dáil and Seanad, of the other aspects of housing legislation which were enacted last August in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979. Rather than hold up these other changes in housing legislation, for some of which there was an urgent need, it was decided to defer a decision on the future of the 1969 Act until the recent Bill had been enacted.</P>
    <P>While I have mentioned a number of factors which might appear to justify allowing the 1969 Act to lapse nevertheless I am satisfied, on balance, that there is a need to provide housing authorities with some positive powers of control over the unwarranted demolition or change of use of sound houses and flats.  To guide me in deciding what form these controls should take in the future I decided that a detailed analysis of the operations under the Act should be carried out by all housing authorities concerned, not only of the results of the grants of permission for either demolition or change of use, but, even more so, of the effects on the houses and the neighbourhoods in respect of which permissions were refused.  I have asked local authorities, particularly those who actively <Col N="2334" /> operate the provisions of the Act, to make this analysis and to inform me of the results.  In the light of the findings of this survey, having regard also to any views or recommendations which Deputies might like to put forward today, I hope in the coming months to decide what policies governing the control by housing authorities of sound existing housing accommodation might most appropriately be adopted.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I recommend to the House that the existing controls should be retained for the further period proposed in the draft order now before the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As the Minister of State has told us, the purpose of the motion before the House is to continue up to 31 December 1981 the provisions of the 1969 Housing Act which make it illegal to demolish habitable houses without the consent of the appropriate housing authority and lays it down that consent may be refused or given subject to conditions. That Act was introduced as a temporary measure, as is clear from the fact that it was to expire two years after its enactment.  Indeed the Minister's opening speech makes it clear that it was regarded as a temporary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very briefly, the history of that 1969 Housing Act is somewhat as follows. The Planning Act, a very comprehensive planning measure, was enacted in 1963. On the day following its enactment the then Minister for Local Government made an order under its provisions exempting a number of activities from the planning provisions of the 1963 Act. One of those activities, strange as it may appear, was the demolition of any building; a person erecting a building was controlled in every way possible by the Planning Act, 1963.  But the Minister, by a stroke of his pen, removed all control from the demolition of buildings on the day after the Planning Bill was enacted.  The result of that was that there was a scandalous demolition of habitable dwellings all over the country but particularly in the city of Dublin and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the <Col N="2335" /> city of Cork.  It was a scandalous abuse of the powers which should never have been given by the Ministerial Order made following the enactment of the Planning Bill.  Immediately it was seen that building speculators were demolishing habitable houses, replacing them with office blocks while there remained an acute shortage of dwellings for people in need of them.  That scandal soon aroused grave concern amongst people all over the country.  The then Government allowed that state of affairs to continue from 1964 until 1969.  The scandal of which I have spoken became so acute at that time and aroused so much indignation in the country that the Government were forced to put an end to it.  The 1969 Housing Act, which we are now extending, was introduced for that specific purpose&mdash;to prevent the demolition of habitable houses and preserve them for the thousands of families in need of housing.  It was a negative measure in the sense that it prevented the demolition of houses but did nothing very much to ensure or to encourage their improvement and preservation.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act of 1969, with which we are now dealing, is being extended for the fourth time since its enactment.  Having considered the matter I believe that the motion this House is now being asked to pass is a reflection on our democratic system of government, is the type of thing that justifies the criticism of the form of government we have and indeed holds it up to ridicule.  This was a temporary measure introduced in 1969 to give the Government of the day and the Minister for Local Government of the day a brief space in which to introduce permanent legislation.  Now we are being asked to extend this negative measure for the fourth time in ten years.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the Minister for the Environment moved a resolution similar to this but assured the House that he had solved the problem and that that was the last occasion on which he would ask for an extension of the 1969 Act.  In the Seanad, the Minister stated that <Col N="2336" /> although he was asking for a two-year extension he would not really want it because he gave an undertaking that an Act which would be introduced in 1978 would solve all the problems.  Now we have the Minister of State saying that the whole thing has been re-thought and that when a Housing Act is drafted some time in the unstated future, when housing policy is being considered, the whole thing will be reconsidered.  We are being asked to extend further this measure up to 31 December 1981 with no assurance whatever that the Minister, if he is still there, will not be asking for a further extension. I am not exaggerating or using extravagant language when I say that that is the sort of thing that brings our system of government into ridicule and justifies people becoming frustrated.</P>
    <P>If the preservation of housing stock was important in 1969 it is even more important now because the cost of building houses has rocketed, according to official statistics, in the second quarter of this year.  That is a very good argument for preserving existing houses if they can be preserved.  There is also another argument for preserving the existing stock of houses and that is the apparent policy of the Government in drastically cutting back on the number of local authority houses being built.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am putting my arguments briefly and I have said all I want to say on the price of houses.</P>
      <P>Fewer local authority houses are being built.  The record shows that the apparent policy of the Government is to cut back on the number of local authority houses being built.  In 1975 8,794 houses were built, in 1976 7,663 houses were built, in 1977 6,333 were built, in 1978 6,073 houses were built and it looks as if there will be fewer than 5,000 completed this year.  It is essential that houses which can be preserved are preserved.  It is also essential, if this capital city is to remain a living city, that houses be preserved and that people be encouraged to live in the city.  The population figures show an overall substantial increase in population throughout the country but the population of Dublin city has fallen by about 24,000 or 25,000 people.  That is a sad state of affairs.  For various reasons people should be encouraged to live in the city, which should be made into a place where they would like to live and where they would be near their work, which would relieve the traffic congestion.  People cannot be expected to live in the city or in any other place unless it is made acceptable to them.  One of the ways in which it could be made acceptable would be to preserve houses that are fit for human habitation and to encourage people to live in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a negative measure in the sense that it stops people knocking down houses but apparently it allows them to let houses fall down.  That is not good enough.  More generous incentives should be offered to encourage people to improve and reconstruct houses.  Improvement grants are available.  Many people think that the Government substantially increased house improvement grants and they think that the Government gave a grant of up to a maximum of £600 to anybody who wished ro renew his house.  Those are not the facts. The Government increased the maximum house improvement grant.  Under the previous Government, £200 was <Col N="2338" /> payable by the State, and £200 by the local authorities.  The Government abolished the £200 payable by the local authorities and replaced it by a grant of £600 which is an increase of one-third.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the cost of reconstruction has doubled and people are worse off in regard to reconstructing and improving their house than they were.  Because the cost of new houses is so very high, it would be good business, good economics, for the Government to increase the maximum reconstruction and improvement grant substantially.  I understand that in Northern Ireland the maximum reconstruction and improvement grant has been of the order of £5,000 for some years&mdash;and this has nothing to do with the troubles there&mdash;to encourage people to preserve and improve their houses.  That is good national economics.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be doing that instead of engaging in this lazy operation of simply preserving the status quo by a continuation of the 1969 Act.  The Minister told us very little about his thinking on housing policy and the preservation of houses in general.  This is a serious matter in the city of Dublin. Members of the corporation know perfectly well that at least 6,000 families are on the housing list awaiting houses in this city.  They are accepted as being people who are living in unacceptable dwellings.  There are thousands of others on the waiting list for a transfer out of flats and inadequate dwellings into proper dwellings.  The Minister should come in here with a statement on housing policy for this city and country instead of continuing this negative measure which does nothing more than preserve the status quo.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is a great case to be made for giving grants of the order of thousands of pounds for the preservation of houses where they can be preserved and where they have a worthwhile life expectancy.  There is no point in talking about hundreds of pounds.  It would be very good economics to preserve the life of those houses by reconstructing, repairing and improving them so that they can house <Col N="2339" /> people for years to come.  That would be a cheaper way of providing houses than building new houses.  Apparently the Government have decided to cut back on local authority houses.  When we get the figures for the next two quarters we will be able to tot them up but, unless there is some miracle towards the end of the year, the figure will be under 5,000 for this year.</P>
    <P>That is my message to the Minister about Dublin city.  He more or less said in his opening statement that the problem we are dealing with is largely a city problem.  In the interests of people who want houses, and also in the interests of the city, dwellings should be preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a lot of regret that I find myself speaking on this motion once again.  I opened my contribution in 1977 with a similar type phrase.  I regret that the Minister of State has been given the rather nasty task of getting this motion through the House yet again and not his senior colleague who carries the ultimate responsibility.  I listened to and read the Minister's speech in this House and in the Seanad some weeks ago.  Having regard to the housing stock, and particularly the portion of the housing stock which is most at risk, all that can be said is that after two-and-a-half years in office the Government are totally and utterly bankrupt of any housing policy designed to preserve and protect the housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will reply that they have increased the grants and introduced energy conservation grants, and that there is unprecedented activity in the housing sector.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has already given an indication of the scale of the increase in the grant for improvement and the scale of house construction costs.  The 1969 Act was forced onto the Statute Book by street protests by the Dublin Housing Action Committee at that time, and by students and others who took to the streets because of the scandal of what was then the destruction of living accommodation in this city, <Col N="2340" /> largely as the result of an unfortunate mistake made by the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney.  It was not an unreasonable mistake.  Certainly the gap which remained open for so long was unreasonable.  I have the highest regard for the contribution Deputy Blaney made as Minister for Local Government in the field of planning, and I would allow him that mistake. He was not finally the person responsible for introducing the 1969 Bill.  It was his colleague, then Deputy Boland.</P>
    <P>We have always known that it was a temporary Act.  It was introduced as such.  I have not read the moving speeches for the renewing of the motion in 1972 and in 1974, but I am sure they are not much different from those made in 1977 and by the Minister today.  A great deal has happened since 1969 in the understanding of how to manage the housing stock in inner city areas.  Effectively we are talking about a few housing authorities, despite the fact that the Minister said 38 housing authorities are operating this.  In real terms we are talking about three or four urban housing authorities, and predominantly Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>If there is a popular appeal and demand in this city at the moment across every spectrum of society and all political parties, it is for the preservation and revitalisation of the inner city.  Only last week yet again <i>The Irish Times</i> carried another story about the collapse of Dublin.  It is a regular journalistic feature to run a piece on the decline and collapse of Dublin.  There are hosts of solutions, proposals and committees making suggestions as to how this decline can be arrested.  Two-and-a-half years after the Minister took office, and nine or ten years after the Bill was introduced, the Minister comes in here and does not put before us one single proposal to replace this temporary measure.  There is the retreat into seeking advice from committees and housing authorities on how this Act is working.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I referred the Minister to a thesis study by Mr. Michael Swanton, <Col N="2341" /> reference No. 57 in UCD Library, on the specific operation of the Act in relation to Cork Corporation and Dublin Corporation. Nothing very much has changed except, perhaps, that this Government are a little more lenient about giving housing permissions on appeal than the previous Government.  But your own Department as recently as this year joined with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in a joint housing conference which is held every two years, the major topic of which was the question of urban renewal and rehabilitation, predominantly of residential residences in the inner city area which are going through a transitional stage.</P>
    <P>At that conference there were some excellent contributions, contributions that were measured, studied and researched, and they came from participants who were practitioners in this country and also from people from abroad.  But I am appalled that there is not as much as a single reference to the possibility of some such rehabilitation programme being formulated by you in the coming few months.  Undoubtedly, the file in the Custom House is full and is more than explicit in regard to the ways in which the objectives of this Act, which yet again is being renewed, could be met directly by positive legislative action.  If there is anything that discredits parliamentary democracy in a society such as ours it is the kind of governmental and ministerial incompetence that is evident now.  Both Dublin and Cork cities are crying out for a creative response from the people who have a democratic mandate to make that response.</P>
    <P>In December of 1977 one could with fairness say to the Minister for the Environment that, as he had been in office for less than five months and not having held previously the brief for the environment, time would be required in order for him to study the problems.  However, you have had your time.  You have had two-and-a-half years and all we have had <Col N="2342" /> in regard to this issue is a miserable and mealymouthed plea for a further two years' extension.  I use the phrase &ldquo;mealymouthed&rdquo; for the reason that your concern in moving this motion and in your reference to the administrative and legal difficulties attached to replacing it with a more positive instrument, is not out of concern for those people who will be rendered homeless or for those people who, though they have housing of a low standard, are at least in a position to pay for it because of the low rents involved.</P>

      <P>The concern is not for those people who happen to be affected by reason of the 1,100 permissions that were granted by Dublin Corporation since the coming into operation of this Act.  Neither is the concern for the property owners in terms of property rights.  Here again we have an example of a classic confrontation&mdash;the rights of property versus the basic human rights of shelter.  Again, predictably, this Government and this Minister come down unashamedly and unabashedly on the side of property.  Who are these property owners who, in many cases, have allowed the houses to fall into disrepair, into a state of dilapidation or who in some cases have provoked this situation deliberately?  Frequently, they are not <Col N="2343" /> the poor defenceless landlords living on restricted and controlled rents and who have a right to an adequate return.  Frequently, the areas of maximum abuse concern property owners who are really financial institutions and banks who have financed the vandalism of this city. There are properties in this city that have been vacant since 1973 but the mortgages and the title deeds of those vacant properties are held by respected members of the banking community and of financial institutions within the banking community.  The Minister's concern is for those people.  There is not a word of concern for the people who live in some of those dilapidated houses but who will be displaced as a result of development works.</P>
      <P>The Minister was fair enough to refer to a contribution I made a couple of years ago when I drew attention to the fact that when a housing permission is granted because of housing stock being increased, invariably the person being moved as a consequence of the demolition of that dwelling is not the person who will occupy the new unit to be built.</P>
      <P>Frequently some of those tenants are rehoused satisfactorily elsewhere, but all too frequently they are manoeuvered and manipulated on to the local authority housing list and subsequently rehoused by the local authority at the expense of the community but to the benefit of the private developer.  What sort of housing policy is that?</P>
      <P>In my contribution of 7 December 1977 I offered a detailed and sustained criticism of the technical and legal functioning of this Act.  In summary of that I should merely like to say that nothing has changed in those two years to invalidate any of that criticism.  This is still a bad piece of legislation.  It is costly and ineffective and adds administrative costs to the Department and ultimately to the people involved in the development of the city of Dublin but does not protect the interests of people living in such residential property, whose plight and whose exploitation were the major causes of forcing this piece of legislation on to the Statute Book in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2344" /> Their situation was made known by way of the street demonstrations of 1967, 1968 and 1969.  That is the sad political fact, and I am appalled that the Minister still seems to be totally ill-informed and persists with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the contribution of the Minister for State in the Seanad when moving this motion there.  He referred significantly to the link between the role of the housing authority in administering this Act and the role of the planning authority in effectively providing for the proper planning and development of the area in which the Act is operational.  I am puzzled at the absence of any such reference in this House by the Minister, but that is the direction in which the policy should be directed.  The legal separation of the responsibility of the local authority as the housing authority on the one hand and as the planning authority on the other hand has brought about most of the bad effects of this defective legislation. My contribution of 1977 went into this aspect in detail.</P>
    <P>In essence we are playing an artificial numbers game in regard to the operation of this Act.  First of all, the 1,113 permissions that were granted with conditions probably in all cases involved the paper exercise of actually increasing the housing stock on that site, the proposal being that under the operation of the 1969 Act the developer was proposing to knock down four or five residential units and replace them with 20 or 30 units.  Two things emerged from that.  First, frequently there has been a long time lapse between the demolition of the existing dwelling units and their replacement.  Some of this time lapse has been deliberate and some has been as a result of the economic crisis in property development in 1975 and 1976.  The other effect has been invariably that because of the construction costs the new units produced under the development were totally outside the economic reach of people who lived there previously.  Therefore, the objective of the plan in holding a particular social mix in an area or maintaining a certain kind of residential content, <Col N="2345" /> perhaps of families with children or families connected with the area, has been shattered because all too frequently the occupants of the new dwellings are transient people who regard their occupancy of a new flat as temporary or use it only for part of the year.  The local authorities with whom the Minister is consulting and the local representatives in the areas would be able to detail that at some length.  I suggest to the Minister that before he makes any final proposals he should consult with the local councillors in Cork and Dublin.  He should also consult with his colleague, Deputy Moore, who has an enormous amount of experience with regard to this matter as leader of the Fianna Fáil group in the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to renew this Act again on the vague promise that the Minister and the Department will come forward in a few months with proposals to replace it.  In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>This is an unsatisfactory situation and one which will receive careful attention when proposals for permanent legislation to replace the 1969 Act are being prepared.</P>
    <P>That is as far as we go.  There is no indication of what might be the parameters of the proposal, no indication of the timetable other than the next few months.  Parliamentary language is quite elastic when it comes to the interpretation of time.  Phrases such as &ldquo;the near future&rdquo;, &ldquo;the immediate future&rdquo; and &ldquo;the next few months&rdquo; are as long as a piece of string so far as this House is concerned. We are left with the situation where yet again an Act that is regarded by the Minister as unsatisfactory is being renewed and extended for the fourth time.  The Minister has no specific proposals to bring to the House despite the fact that two years ago he knew he would have to do this and despite the fact that in drafting the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which we dealt with during the summer there was ample opportunity between then and <Col N="2346" /> now to indicate the outline of the proposals.  Yet again, we are being asked to take on trust the bona fides of this Government in regard to legislation on this matter.  Quite frankly, I do not trust the Minister to perform in this area.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there is no guarantee that the Minister or his senior Minister in the Department may even have responsibility for these matters next January after the now definitely promised reshuffle. If that is the case, will we have to go through the whole nonsense again?  Will we have to wait two years while somebody else reads himself into the job by which time Fianna Fáil may not have any responsibility for implementing the proposal?  Every day there is no action in this area another residential unit disappears. Every day the Minister seeks more consultations, information and advice the inner urban areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick are visibly collapsing for want of a major policy of urban renewal.  There is a crying need for positive, concerted and intelligent actions for which there is an undoubted consensus politically and for which there is a public demand for action without delay.</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister to do something extraordinary.  We are not asking him to re-invent the wheel or to design legislative measures of a unique character where he has to do everything from scratch.  The Minister has the resources of an excellent Department where there is a store of accumulated wisdom going back over the years.  He has also a local authority structure that, if it can sustain the blows he gives it each day, still retains within it the commitment and expertise necessary to implement proposals.</P>
    <P>What I expect and demand from someone who purports to be concerned passionately with the right to shelter and the right to housing&mdash;we hear about this at election times from Fianna Fáil&mdash;are detailed specific proposals for an urban renewal rehabilitation programme that avoids the trap set by the Department of Finance.  Their attitude is that reconstruction grants for housing are a <Col N="2347" /> sieve through which endless amounts of money flow and over which they have no control.  Their view is that the housing stock of 700,000 or 800,000 houses will qualify for such grants, that there is no end to the kind of money that will be involved and, therefore, there is no way they will underwrite grants of £800 or £900 or even the £5,000 grant referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are aware of this. We recognise the difficulty and complexity of government, something that was absent from the Fianna Fáil manifesto two years ago.  We know the difficulties but we also know the solutions.  In this instance the solution is to separate the unique problem of inner city housing areas from the mass of housing stock around the country, because it is a separate problem.  There is ample room for a scheme of grants to be introduced that would relate to specific urban areas and for those grants to be justified on the grounds of maintaining and developing the stock of housing within the country as a housing provision and, in addition, to have the beneficial planning effect of consolidating inner city communities. That policy can safely be sold to the Minister's own backbenchers who would be claiming for parity in terms of housing reconstruction grants between the city and the country and between the inner city and the suburbs.  The Minister can safely do that if he wishes.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, I do not see any political commitment or political awareness of the necessity to do that or the possibility that it could be done.  I made a brief reference to that possibility when the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was going through the House.  I understood that the Minister took upon himself in that enabling piece of legislation the possibility of creating, by way of order, schemes for rehabilitation, renewal and grant for certain designated areas. My interpretation was not contradicted by the Minister then present.  Within the context of that new legislation the Minister has the legal vehicle for proposing an urban renewal rehabilitation <Col N="2348" /> programme.  There is nothing coming from the Department.  We have heard of vague proposals after consultation with other Government Departments and local authorities.  Regrettably, when the Custom House speak about consultations with local authorities it never means consultations between the political master in the Custom House and the political representatives at local level.  There is a lot of consultation and direction from the Custom House to every local authority but almost all the time local authority members do not know what is passing in circulars.  The last thing is that they should be told.  That is a political problem that requires (a) political recognition of that and (b) political commitment to do something about it.  With those two things in his back pocket the Minister can go to his professional advisers who have all the competence necessary to do the job and ask them to design a programme that will implement that politically.</P>
    <P>Instead, we get classic bureaucratic trench defence positions as evidenced in the following quotation from the Minister's speech, which is good for any kind of holding operation.  The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of whether or not provision for compensation should be provided in cases of refusal of permission either to demolish or change the use of a habitable house.  No such provision had been seen as necessary in the temporary Act.  But it has been argued that the absence of such a provision can, in some cases, be inequitable to the owners of property affected.  On the other hand, provision for payment of compensation generally could make the operation of the Act unduly costly for local authorities.</P>
    <P>These legal, administrative and functional problems could not, because of their complexity, be resolved without unduly delaying the preparation by my Department, and <Col N="2349" /> the consideration by the Dáil and Seanad, of the other aspects of housing legislation which were enacted last August in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned &ldquo;these legal, administrative and functional problems&rdquo;, not political problems, compassionate or emotional problems about making a reality out of the right to shelter, something that we could be proud of.  He told us that the difficulties and the blockages to getting a decent human and compassionate policy off the ground here were &ldquo;legal, administrative and functional problems&rdquo;.  I should like to know who is in charge in the Custom House because the admission in that paragraph, and the admission of failure to produce a housing policy in the last two-and-a-half years, clearly indicates to me that there is no political control in the Custom House.  The Department are on automatic pilot and heading deeply into fog.  The last thing they are going to do is to open up a new Pandora's box where they may have to take political initiative.</P>
    <P>If the Department are on automatic pilot&mdash;there is every evidence that they are&mdash;it is not the political or democratic function of civil servants who are not accountable to take upon themselves policy initiatives.  They have honourably resisted doing that.  It is the job of the Minister of State and, frankly, he is not doing it.  There is not any indication that he proposes to do his job.  There is no indication that (a) he knows what has to be done, (b) he has any sense of what the timetable is or (c) what the ultimate cost might be.</P>
    <P>Next Sunday at my clinic I will meet at least three people who will be directly affected by the non-performance of the objectives of this Act.  They will be seeking housing because they are being evicted by their landlords from property which may be substandard but which they can afford and is in an area they want to live in.  As citizens of this State they are not protected by the provisions <Col N="2350" /> of the 1969 Act.  The only thing I can possibly do for them is to articulate their case and advocate their housing claim to the local authority.  We have already heard from Deputy Fitzpatrick of the poverty of housing statistics on the local authority field that the Minister of State has brought about.  The people I spoke of will be put out of a house, a home and a community because, in the final analysis, when Fianna Fáil are faced with a choice of people versus property one does not have to think, worry, ponder or muse about it because every time property rights come first.  They come first in what the Minister of State said today.</P>
    <P>The misery that is caused by lack of housing, eviction and displacement that spills over into alcoholism, wife-beating. separation and other problems can be reduced if the Minister takes courage and runs the Department as a political Minister with a political commitment to do something about the housing situation. The situation is not improving. Local authority housing figures are down, housing construction costs are up and the Department have already wasted millions stupidly inflating the construction industry with the £1,000 grant, an election gimmick, to such an extent that the cost of replacement of the houses the Department were given permission to demolish is beyond the dreams of anybody involved in housing economics two years ago.  In the time since the Minister took political responsibility for housing the construction cost of new houses has gone from £14,500 to £23,000. Coming from a Government which claims, among other things, to be the party of reality and to consist of people who understand the mixed economy and capitalism, that is some claim to credit. It is some marvellous statement of economic efficiency to be able to say that the cost of housing construction was put up to such an extent so quickly and at the expense of people who are totally at the mercy of an open market economy and who cannot afford to house themselves.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has given any consideration to the establishment of an all-Ireland regional aid authority which would be representative of interests primarily concerned with EEC Regional Aid application, if he will pursue this matter at EEC level and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Government are fully aware of the many concerns and interests in relation to the ERDF common to the whole island of Ireland, which is uniformly eligible for aid under the fund, and it is the policy of the Government to promote the most extensive possible co-ordination in this respect between the two parts of the island. There already exists substantial co-operation, in particular to identify, with the help of EEC-assisted studies, areas on both sides of the Border which require assistance and may be eligible for aid from the fund.  We are at present actively working in the various European instances to ensure that Border areas in <Col N="2356" /> Ireland will benefit under the non-quota section of the fund.</P>
      <P>The Government remain open to any measure which might further co-operation between the two parts of the island in relation to the European Regional Development Fund.  However, any dissociation of authority for the regional fund from the planning function of the Government as a whole could pose serious practical problems and could prove detrimental to the most efficient use of ERDF funds.  Furthermore, the various contacts which we have had with the British Government in relation to general questions of co-operation between the two Governments, have given us no reason to believe that they are prepared to contemplate such a development.</P>
      <P>While I do not consider that the Deputy's suggestion offers any prospect of progress at this time I will continue to bear it in mind in relation to future discussions with the relevant British authorities.</P>

As I see it, the system is working very well.  I do not hold the view that we are not making the best use of demands from the fund and that he might be able to improve the position.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer <Col N="2358" /> the Deputy to the reply I gave to a question on the same subject on 22 November last which was circulated with the Official Report, volume No. 309, columns 1568 to 1575.  In that reply I attempted to give a comprehensive resumé of the work of the Conference, the Seventh Session of which had just ended, and in particular I singled out the hard-core issues which remained unresolved at that stage.  My present reply gives the up-to-date position on these and other issues discussed during the Eighth Session. The information sought by the Deputy is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply and, therefore, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>If I may anticipate Deputy O'Keeffe's supplementary, if anything arises out of the six page reply circulated with the Official Report which he would like to raise with me, I should be glad to answer him.  I refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question last year (volume 309 columns 1568-1575) when I gave a comprehensive summary of the work of the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea up to the end of its Seventh Session. This reply summarises what has taken place since that time.</P>
      <P>Since the Seventh Session which was held last year and before the Eighth Session an inter-sessional meeting, to which all delegations were invited, was held in Geneva from 23 January to 9 February 1979.  Its aim was to facilitate the work of the Eighth Session and discussions therefore were concentrated on provisions relating to arrangements for the exploitation of the deep seabed, definition of the outer limit of the continental shelf and delimitation of maritime boundaries between neighbouring states.  A good basis for further negotiation in some areas was established at this informal meeting and some progress towards tentative agreement was made which was carried forward to the Eighth Session of the Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eighth Session was held in two parts.  The first part took place from 19 March to 27 April 1979 in Geneva and <Col N="2359" /> the second part from 19 July to 24 August 1979 in New York.  Conference discussions continued to be based on the informal composite negotiating text which had been produced at the end of the Sixth Session.  It was the intention of the Conference that if possible substantive negotiations on a draft Convention on the law of the sea would be completed and the text revised at the Eighth Session. However, only a partial revision of the text was in fact achieved.  Copies of the revised text (Informal Composite Negotiating Text/Revision 1) are being placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>When the Eighth Session convened, of those hard-core issues which were discussed during the Seventh Session and which remained unresolved the following were taken up immediately for consideration, namely, the arrangements for the exploitation of the deep seabed&mdash;that is the area outside national jurisdiction&mdash;definition of the outer limits of the continental shelf, delimitation of maritime boundaries between adjacent and opposite states and settlement of disputes thereon.</P>
    <P>In addition the conference also considered marine scientific research, protection and preservation of the marine environment, regime of islands and final clauses.</P>
    <P>There were other issues where compromise texts, which received widespread and substantial support, had already been produced.  Many delegations opposed the reopening of discussion on these matters and they were not discussed further.  In this context I would mention in particular the exclusive economic zone and the question of access by landlocked and geographically disadvantaged states to the living resources thereof.  Discussion of the compromise formula relating thereto which had been produced by the Chairman at the previous session was not resumed and the text was incorporated in the revision.  The texts negotiated on the question of settlement of disputes relating to the exercise of the sovereign rights of the coastal state in the exclusive <Col N="2360" /> economic zone were also considered to command sufficient support to incorporate them in the revised text without further discussion.</P>
    <P>A text on salmon agreed between all the parties concerned either as states of origin or as exploiters of the salmon resources which is satisfactory from our point of view has been included in the revision of the text without the question being debated further at the Eighth Session.</P>
    <P>One of the main concerns of this country at the conference is to have satisfactory provisions on the continental shelf included in the convention, and Ireland has taken a leading role in the negotiations in order to secure an acceptable definition which would give coastal state jurisdiction to the outer edge of the continental margin.  Landlocked and other States with differing interests at the conference seek to limit the extent of the shelf coming within coastal state sovereignty.  Ireland, seeking to allay fears of exaggerated claims by coastal states, put forward a definition which proposed how the outer edge of the continental shelf of a coastal state might be identified.  The Arab Group at the conference continues to support a 200-mile limit to continental shelf jurisdiction and the Soviet Union also has sought an arbitrary cut-off line.  The first part of the Eighth Session concentrated almost exclusively on ways of combining the Irish formula with over-riding cut-off limits.</P>
    <P>It appears that in return for agreement on a definition of the continental margin coastal states must be prepared to share with the international community a certain portion of the revenues earned from exploitation of the resources of the area beyond 200 miles.  Revenue sharing was not extensively negotiated at the Session but new proposals were submitted which were extreme and therefore unhelpful towards achieving a consensus.</P>
    <P>Near the end of the Geneva meeting when support for a revision of the text was growing the Chairman held separate consultations with a number of representative delegations.  As a result thereof a compromise package emerged which <Col N="2361" /> was included in the revision of the text. This provision preserves the concept that the continental shelf of a coastal state is the natural prolongation of its land territory.  It includes the Irish formula for definition of the continental margin and combines it with over-riding cut-off limits of either 350 nm. from baselines or 100 miles from the 2,500 metre isobath.  The revision also provides for a boundary commission to which a coastal state shall submit information on the limits of its continental shelf.  Also revised was the provision on revenue sharing by increasing the maximum revenue sharing figure to 7 per cent of the value or volume of production at the site.</P>
    <P>At the second part of the session much of the discussion relating to the continental shelf centred on the problem of ocean ridges.  There was concern that the provision on the continental shelf should not be used to permit unjustified claims.  Many States feared that coastal states would claim jurisdiction over such ridges, not being true continental shelf, particularly when they made use of the isobath cut-off method.  Despite intensive negotiations an acceptable formulation was not produced and this issue remains to be resolved at the next session.  Other issues relating to the continental shelf also remain to be resolved.  These include the provision on revenue sharing, the role and composition of the boundary commission and a proposal by Sri Lanka which would, because of the special geological circumstances in that area, exempt it from application of the Irish formula.</P>
    <P>Agreement on provision relating to delimitation of maritime areas between neighbouring States is proving to be one of the most intractable issues at the conference. The 1958 convention on the continental shelf provides that in the absence of agreement, and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances, the boundary shall be the median line.  Ireland has always argued that delimitation of maritime areas should be effected in accordance with <Col N="2362" /> equitable principles.  The negotiating text at the conference reflected our position except in so far as it also mentioned the median line as a method of division.  The opposing delegations seek re-enactment of the provision in the 1958 Convention and the negotiations were aimed at reconciling the two views in order to reach agreement on a text which could command substantial and widespread support.  It did not prove possible to reconcile views during the session and no change in the text was proposed by the chairman when revision of the text was being considered.  The issue will be further taken up at the next session.</P>
    <P>A related topic to delimitation is the regime of islands.  The provision as previously included in the negotiating text is to the effect that islands have the same maritime zones as continental territories except certain rocks which have no economic zone or continental shelf and this provision is acceptable to us.  Ireland's concern is to ensure that the role of any island in a delimitation situation would be determined in accordance with equitable principles.  We therefore proposed at the conference a crossreference to the delimitation provisions which would remove any doubt that those provisions should prevail where delimitation is concerned.  This did not receive adequate support in the debate but the whole issue remains subject to further negotiation and is likely to be considered further at the next session.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Seventh Session the Chairman stated that in his view there was overwhelming support for keeping the texts in the informal composite negotiating text, which required coastal state consent for marine scientific research and are therefore acceptable to us, as they stood without proceeding to further substantive modifications.  Some researching states will continue to seek greater freedom for research outside 200 nm.  It appears that this aim will still be pursued by them at the next session and has some prospect of being accepted by the conference.</P>
    <P>There is a very wide measure of agreement on the provisions relating to <Col N="2363" /> protection and preservation of the marine environment.  Discussions took place at the Eighth Session based on outstanding proposals relating to pollution from sea-bed activities, pollution from vessels, special areas, suspension and restriction on institution of proceedings, safeguards with respect to straits used for international navigation and monetary penalties.  Most of these proposals could not be regarded as commanding more widespread and substantial support than the negotiating text and substantive negotiations on protection and preservation of the marine environment can now be considered as virtually completed.  The same applies to the provisions on the development and transfer of marine technology.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the regime for the international sea-bed&mdash;that is the deep sea-bed outside national jurisdiction&mdash;have always proved among the most difficult at the conference.  The most recent issues under discussion in this area related to the financial aspects thereof and considerable progress was made on the question of the payments to be made by a mining operator to the International Seabed Authority.  The moneys thus received are primarily intended to be disbursed in the form of development aid to developing countries and payments should therefore be as generous as possible.  However, payments must not be so onerous as to discourage sea-bed mining.  Progress was also made on certain aspects of the institutional arrangements of the International Seabed Authority, including the inter-relationship of the various organs and decision-making procedures therein. Outstanding issues such as resource policy&mdash;which includes the rate of sea-bed mining and participation by the International Seabed Authority in commodity agreements&mdash;the transfer of technology, which would facilitate participation in sea-bed mining, and a review conference remain to be considered at the next session.</P>
    <P>Final clauses were discussed substantively for the first time at the Eighth Session. Since agreement on many substantive <Col N="2364" /> issues has not yet been reached discussion of such matters as revision, amendment and provisional application could only be of a preliminary nature. Nevertheless considerable work was done in identifying legal and technical difficulties and discussion will resume at the next session.  An issue of major importance to the European Economic Community is the question of its right to participate in the convention.  Therefore the inclusion of a provision therein which would enable the Community to become a party with the member states is essential. This would ensure that treaty obligations regarding matters falling within the competence of the Community can be respected.  Ireland, having the Presidency at that time, intervened on behalf of the Community explaining the need for Community participation and seeking to answer queries and allay the fears of other states in the matter.  A number of states feel that there would be complex technical and legal problems and possible adverse implications from such participation while others have political objections thereto.  Further work remains to be done on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is therefore possible to say that considerable progress towards reaching agreement on the text of a convention representing the view of the overwhelming majority of states has been made. The wide range of technical problems, the extreme diversity of the geographical situation and economic development of the countries of the world and their divergent interests have contributed towards the relatively slow progress to date.  It is hoped that substantial informal negotiations will be completed during the next session and that formal discussion affording delegations the opportunity to place their positions on record will also take place.  The way would then be open for the adoption of what is probably the most comprehensive and complex multilateral convention ever negotiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government have consistently supported the application of Greece for membership of the European Community.  The present situation is that the instruments of accession have been signed and that, following ratification by the existing member states, Greece will become the tenth member state on 1 January 1981.  The Greek Parliament has already ratified the instruments of accession.  Ratification by Ireland will involve the amendment of the European Communities Act, 1972 and the passing by Dáil Éireann of a motion approving the terms of accession.  Deputies will have a full opportunity for debate when these matters come before the House.  I hope that this will be in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the <Col N="2366" /> question, the position is that the treaties governing the European Communities contain no reference to the European Convention on Human Rights, and indeed not all of the founding member states of the European Communities have accepted the right of individual petition under Article 25 of that Convention. It these circumstances, recognition by Greece of Article 25 does not arise in the context of accession.</P>

The entry of Greece should not, therefore, result in any reduction in the level of aid which Ireland receives from the various EEC funds.

As Irish versions of the basic Treaties were prepared, it is appropriate that the Treay of Accession of the Hellenic Republic to the European Communitues, being an amendment to these Treaties, should be published in Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that the agreements recently negotiated in the context of the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations held under the auspices of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) discriminate against the Irish food industry.</P>
      <P>While, as in the case of all such negotiations, concessions were made on all sides, I and my colleagues in Government endeavoured to ensure that any concessions which the Community made in relation to products of interest to Ireland would be as limited as possible. We consider that our efforts were very successful and that the Community concessions in these areas were no more than the minimum necessary to enable the successful conclusion of the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also sought to ensure that the concessions which the Community obtained would be as beneficial as possible to the Irish food industry.  We should benefit by access to the US market for beef and improved access for processed food products to, for example, US, Canada <Col N="2370" /> and Japan.  In addition improved access for Community cheese to the US, Canada and Australia should contribute to the stabilisation of the Community's dairy markets&mdash;to our benefit.</P>
    <P>More generally, increased opportunities now exist for the Community and for Irish agricultural and food industries to export to third country markets.  In this regard the recognition of the Community's right to grant export refunds is an important result of the negotiations.</P>

      <P>As Questions Nos. 12 to 16, inclusive, all relate to the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act, by Czechoslovakia, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take them together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded by these questions to express again publicly the Government's deep concern at the detention of Charter 77 members in Czechoslovakia and at the trial and sentencing of some of them recently.  We believe that this action by the Czechoslovak authorities is inconsistent with their commitments under the Helsinki Final Act by which Czechoslovakia and all the other signatory States solemnly confirmed their respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights and duties in this field.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that on the day after the sentences were passed I deplored both the action of the Czechoslovak authorities in bringing Charter members to trial and the summary nature of the judicial proceedings, in the course of an address to the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our concern at the Czechoslovak action is shared by our partners in the Nine with whom we have consulted closely on developments since members of Charter 77 were arrested at the end of May of this year.  Already following the arrests the Nine made known their views to the <Col N="2373" /> Czechoslovak Government in co-ordinated approaches.  Moreover, after the announcement of the sentences I issued, in my capacity as President in office of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine, a joint statement in which the Nine pointed to the serious implications of the actions of the Czechoslovak Government, and set on record once again the great importance they attach to the full implementation of all aspects of the Final Act.</P>
    <P>In November 1980 the second CSCE follow-up meeting will open in Madrid. This meeting will provide the opportunity to review the extent to which the provisions of the Final Act have been put into effect.  In the run-up to the meeting Ireland and her partners in the Nine will continue to stress the view that respect for the principles of the Final Act and compliance with its provisions cannot fail to have a positive influence on the outcome of the meeting.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Czechoslovakia has a relatively favourable trade balance, from their point of view, with this country and that in the context of EEC negotiations in the trade field we should draw attention to breaches of human rights in Czechoslovakia, because they will be seeking access for increased numbers of products to European markets?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, on the basis of the information available to him, he has satisfied himself that the imprisonment of George Calciu in Romania and Vojtech Srna in Czechoslovakia for religious practice is contrary to the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act of which Ireland.  Romania and Czechoslovakia are signatories; if so, if he will make diplomatic representations on their behalf, if not, why; if he has made representations on behalf of any people similarly imprisoned under the provisions of the Final Act since he took office and, if so, if he will give details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act which was signed by 35 Heads of Government of Europe and North America including Ireland, Romania and Czechoslovakia, in 1975.  The Final Act has two main elements.  First of all, it contains a series of ten principles to guide relations between states, one of which is the principle of respect of human rights and fundamental <Col N="2376" /> freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  It also contains a series of agreed measures designed to improve co-operation between the participating states.  Although the Final Act is not a legal instrument, it is a political commitment which the participating states solemnly reaffirmed at the end of the Belgrade follow-up meeting last year.</P>
      <P>From the outset the Irish Government have attached great importance to the implementation of the Final Act and especially the observance of its human rights principle.  On many occasions, both publicly and privately, we have stressed the view that if the process begun by the Final Act is to be effective it must be based not only on the relaxation of tensions and growing co-operation between states but also on respect of human rights within states.</P>
      <P>Certain individuals have been mentioned whose treatment, according to my information, is contrary to the provisions of the Final Act.  I recognise&mdash;and I believe that the Deputy will accept this&mdash;that inevitably there are limits to the extent to which a country such as ours can make effective representations to other countries with very different social systems on issues which do not involve our own citizens.  However, I can assure him that in consultation with our partners in the European Community we have on numerous occasions made our views known on these issues and the Governments concerned are in no doubt about our concern.  Beyond referring to this clear public position we have taken, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go into detail on other representations which might be made in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a further CSCE follow-up meeting will take place in Madrid next year in order to examine the extent to which the undertakings arising from the Final Act have been carried out and to discuss measures for improving implementation and developing the scope of the co-operation between the participating states.  In the run-up to the Madrid <Col N="2377" /> meeting Ireland will continue to press for full implementation of all aspects of the Final Act and in particular its human rights and related humanitarian provisions.</P>

The Deputy will have received a reply from the Department in which it was clearly stated that with regard to the specific cases of the two gentlemen referred to it appeared from the information available that their treatment was contrary to the Final Act's principles on human rights and fundamental freedoms which includes the right of free expression of a religious belief and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to a similar question on 8 May 1979&mdash;volume 314 columns 24 to 28 of the Official Report&mdash;in which I stated that when agreement on delimitation of the continental shelf between Ireland and Britain could not be reached between the two Governments following lengthy negotiations we proposed to the British that the dispute be submitted to an arbitration tribunal.  The British after some delay agreed that the question of delimitation of the continental shelf be submitted to an independent settlement of disputes procedure under some form of third party settlement of a judicial nature.  There was no agreement in principle or otherwise at any stage to submit the dispute to arbitration.  I want to make this clear to Deputy Kelly.</P>
      <P>We are still in negotiation with the British on the form which the settlement procedure should take.  In the course of the negotiations both sides have considered the different options which might be appropriate in this case.  Our view remains that <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration is the most appropriate form of procedure and we have so indicated to the British. Representatives of our two Governments met in Dublin last September and the British indicated they were still considering our proposal but were not yet in a position to agree to an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration.</P>

    <P>It will be appreciated that agreement <Col N="2381" /> on the form of the third party settlement procedure is a matter of vital concern to both sides which requires very detailed consideration and neither party can force the other to accept any particular procedure.</P>
    <P>We continued to urge the British to agree on the procedure and I would reiterate that I have personally stressed the urgency of the matter to the Minister of State at the British Foreign Office.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister believe me when I say I am very puzzled by the form which his reply has taken?  I have the distinct recollection, both in the job which the Minister of State now holds and as Attorney General for the short time I was there, that we had got so far with the British as to agree that the International Court of Justice would arbitrate this question.  The only outstanding issue between us then was whether it would be the full court or a chamber or panel of the court.  We had formed a view at the stage when I left office, and that was the only matter as far as I can recall that was then outstanding.</P>

      <P>We seem to have gone backwards from there.  I put it to the Minister that, in the parliamentary reply given on 8 May last to which he referred the House, Deputy Lenihan, answering for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, speculated that the reason for the lack of action in the period coming up to 8 May was the British general election and that was why nothing much was happening.  He hoped we could take an immediate initiative to try to get the procedure moving.  He said discussions would be resumed immediately with the new British Government with a view to getting this arbitration procedure moving. That was six months ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a review of Irish involvement in UN peace-keeping operations, the Government naturally keep under review any involvement by our troops in such operations.  Without going into the detail of Tuesday's replies concerning our involvement in UNIFIL, I could perhaps recall for the Deputy that a relative ceasefire obtains in South Lebanon since the beginning of September with a resulting lessening of military activity in the area.  This is not to say, <Col N="2384" /> however, that the situation is satisfactory. The possibility of incidents remains and the <i>de facto</i> forces, supported by Israel, continue to control a strip of territory just north of the border with Israel, thus preventing UNIFIL from establishing control over all the territory covered by its mandate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Question Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated by the Minister of State at my Department during the concluding stage of the Seanad Debate on The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, I propose to ask housing authorities shortly to carry out an assessment of housing needs in their areas during the next five years.  This assessment will take into account census data, including household formation, which will be available in due course, and also the condition of the housing stock.  My Department have made arrangements with An Foras Forbartha for the preparation of a manual which will give detailed guidelines to the authorities for the purpose of the assessment. The preparation of the manual is nearing completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the completion of this assessment, the Government's target of 23,000 <Col N="2385" /> to 27,000 houses per year up to 1980, which was published in the White Paper, <i>Programme for National Development 1978-1981,</i> will stand.  This target exceeds the assessment of 21,000 to 25,000 houses a year up to 1986 which was made independently by the NESC in 1976, and generally supported by assessments made by local authorities in 1976/77.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether in the five-year review which he has announced will be undertaken next year in any case, there will be taken into account the transfer from the private purchase area to the local authority area as a result of the increases in housing prices?  In other words, many people who otherwise would have been buying their own houses are not able to do so because of the escalating house prices.  Is there any plan to right this situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

In view of the Minister's reply to Questions Nos. 22 and 23 and to the early part of his reply to this question to the effect that additional money will be made available to the local authority concerned, can he tell us whether this extra money will be made available during the current year or may we assume that additional moneys will be made available early next year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the Deputy's attention to the low rise mortgage scheme under which subsidised loans are made available to tenants and potential tenants of local authority houses, and also to the house-purchase loans schemes administered by housing authorities which are financed in large measure by State funds advanced to the authorities at an interest rate lower than the rate at which the money is raised by the State.  I would also like to make the point that at the end of June 1979, the major lending agencies had more than 29,000 applications for housing loans on hand.  This is the highest ever recorded total of applications on hands since statistics were first compiled more than ten years ago.

      <P>Will not the Minister accept that the present low rise mortgage loan system is exceptionally limited in its application?  In view of the sharp increase in the cost of houses and the problems of applicants to get money to provide homes, would it not be advisable from the economic point of view to make money available at the same rate as that applying to low rise mortgages to applicants who would qualify for council houses in order to remove them from the housing lists?

Under the council's scheme the repayments in respect of such a house would be about £23 a week over a 30-year period.

Intervention by the Government at this stage, as I have indicated, would not be appropriate.  However, I should like to say that I regard this matter as one of great seriousness.  I would point out that the assessor's report on this found that a general increase of the salary scales for bank officials was not warranted but that additional work had been imposed which, while its impact was transient, nevertheless entailed the payment of compensation.  The Government consider that the action taken by the IBOA is inconsistent with the obligations assumed by trade unions under the current national understanding on pay policy.  The Government support fully the bank management in seeking a solution of the dispute by an arrangement other than that of a permanent and continuing increase in pay, such an increase having been rejected by an independent assessor.</P>

Is he advocating that the Government should say the IBOA are right and give in, or is he saying that he thinks that to pursue this matter within the normal framework of negotiation between the parties on the <Col N="2392" /> basis of the findings of an independent assessor is the correct course?</P>

      <P>Would not the Minister agree that it is very late to talk about normal processes taking their usual course because the action of one of the parties in this dispute is taking effect already?  Does the Minister agree that a closedown of our banking system in the context of our membership of the EMS, with the likelihood that traders will not utilise sterling as a means of exchange, will be even more serious?  A bank closedown is serious in any context but it is even more serious in the context of EMS membership.  Does not the Minister agree that the Government cannot stand aside from the effects of such a dispute? Will he assure the House that in the unfortunately all too likely event of today's talks producing no satisfactory result at the very least there will be a meeting with the parties to see if the worst effects of the dispute can be averted?</P>

If action by the Government would appear to be indicated as something that would bring an end to the situation that we are threatened with, the House may be assured that such action will be taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Estimate under this Vote is required <i>inter alia</i> to defray the legal cost of the tribunal of inquiry into the Whiddy Island disaster.  It could not, of course, have been foreseen that an item of expenditure of this magnitude would arise on the Vote and, therefore, £195,000 extra is being provided in respect of the legal costs of the inquiry.  The Supplementary Estimate is required in advance of the other Finance group Estimates as there are no funds left in the relevant subheads with which to pay out outstanding legal fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that a Supplementary Estimate has already been taken on the Vote for Tourism and Transport providing, <i>inter alia,</i> an extra £461,000 in respect of certain costs of the Whiddy Island inquiry.  Those costs were in respect of accommodation, providing expert witnesses and so on and did not relate to the legal costs of the inquiry.  In addition to what I mentioned, the following extra costs arise: salaries, £180,000; <Col N="2418" /> fees to counsel, £25,000; general law expenses, £7,000 and Law Reform Commission, £6,000.  Apart from the item of fees to counsel these are primarily on the basis of implementing the first phase of the national understanding and, in certain grades, the interim increase of 8½ per cent recommended by the Devlin Review Group and certain other grade increases.</P>

Fees paid to counsel arising from the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Whiddy Island disaster up to end of September 1979 were £28,560.  Fees outstanding at that date amount to £36,680.  It is estimated that the total legal costs of the tribunal arising under this subhead will be of the order of £120,000.  The balance of the additional amount required, the £25,000 that I referred to, arises from increased legal costs as a result of a higher than anticipated number of State cases and increased fee levels.</P>

      <P>I have been asked by the Joint Committee to move the following motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann pursuant to the Order of the Dáil of 17th October, 1979, takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities on Resources for financing the Community Budget, which was laid before the Dáil on 8th November, 1979 and which contains a request for a debate thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second occasion on which the Joint Committee have sought in the life time of this Dáil permission to have a debate on the floor of the House.  On the previous occasion I also had the honour of moving the motion.  There is no comparison between the importance and relevance of this particular item and the <Col N="2420" /> motion on cultural workers which was discussed previously.  The issues are quite clear in relation to this matter. There has been a lot of official report on this matter and a lot of documentation has been made available to Deputies.  I presume that all of the Members in the House are aware of the technical dimension to this complex issue.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee are concerned with the political implications of the budgetary crisis now facing the EEC. The Joint Committee published on 30 May of this year their 47th Report which reviewed the Commission's proposals for financing the activities of the Community into the eighties and beyond that. Some members of the Committee visited Brussels on 4 October.  During that visit we saw a number of people.  The President of the Commission, Mr. Jenkins, and the Commissioner for the Budget Mr. Tugendhat, sought out the members of the Joint Committee.  We had a brief discussion with both of them.  The last meeting of the day was with Commissioner Tugendhat.  The second paragraph of our second report states:</P>
    <P>The discussion with the Commissioner confirms for the Committee the views expressed in the 47th Report and in particular the recommendation it made that advantage be taken of Ireland's Presidency of the Council to seek an early decision on this matter; preliminary decisions which fall to be taken by the Commission in the first half of next year must depend on the resources available after 1981.  The Committee, therefore, repeats and renews the views already expressed.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee, representing all parties, having regard to the shared view of the essentially political nature of the budgetary crisis confronting the Community, are asking that the Minister for Finance, in his capacity as President of the Council of Finance Ministers, take an initiative to try to resolve what we all recognise is a very difficult problem.  We have no illusions about that, about its complexity or about the necessary gestation period that is required in order not only to get a proposal for financing <Col N="2421" /> agreed but also for that proposal to take effect.  It is because of that time lag that action is urgently required.  There is no better country in our view to take action than Ireland, who has a moral right to advocate action on behalf of all the members of the Community.  There is a particular onus on the current President of the Commission and the President State, Ireland, to use that position to try to launch an initiative which will resolve this crisis.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the Community's finances will hit the ceiling of 1 per cent GDP sometime early in 1981. There are no proposals at the moment for increasing the height of that ceiling. There are no political initiatives apparent to us that appear to have the capacity to raise the level of that ceiling.  Consequently, the impact on the budget for the members of the Community could be potentially disastrous.</P>
    <P>The proposals which have as recently as today emanated from Commissioner Gundelach in relation to agriculture have some potentially horrendous implications for Ireland.  If they are implemented in full or in part they could have the effect of virtually destroying the sugar industry here.  I do not believe that any person who is aware of the dimensions of the problem has any illusions about the seriousness of the crisis.</P>
    <P>The first meeting the members of the committee who went to Brussels on 4 October had was with a member of the Commission staff and was in relation to financial aids to dairying being suspended at the end of this year, which many of our members, particularly those from the dairying areas, felt would be a major negative factor in developing the dairying industry here.  It was considered to be such an important issue that we sought for a discussion on it when we went to Brussels.  We realised by 5.30 in the afternoon, having talked to the President and to Commissioner Tugendhat, that the entire CAP appeared to be, as part of the overall budget of the EEC and the Community set on a course of self destruction somewhere in 1981, that that <Col N="2422" /> would have horrendous implications for Ireland and that in contrast our concern with the cessation of financial aid for the dairying sector was a tiny part of a much bigger and deeper problem.</P>
    <P>There has been a great degree of propaganda in Britain, parts of Germany and the Netherlands against the CAP and against the wastefulness of the EEC budget generally.  I believe that the total EEC budget, as a percentage of money spent within the Community, represents about 3 per cent of the expenditure that central governments make within the Nine member states.  It is a very small amount of money in relation to the overall finances of the member states. While it may be small in those terms, the Joint Committee have no illusions about its critical importance to Ireland.  We are major beneficiaries in relation to receipts from the CAP.  While we may have discussions about how that money might be applied by way of direct investment in the first instance and how best the benefits of that money might be internally redistributed by taxation and fiscal policies, that is essentially an internal domestic matter which we should be able to resolve here.</P>
    <P>There is no disagreement by the Joint Committee or by this House about the essential importance of the net revenue receipts which we get through the CAP and through the EEC contribution in the regional and social funds as well. Ireland, in her capacity of holder of the Presidency during the second half of this year and having particular regard to her position as a peripheral state in the Community, has the political responsibility and the moral obligation to advocate mercilessly an increase in Community resources so that the objectives of the Community, which were eloquently and persuasively put forward to the country in 1971 and 1972 during the debates in this House and during the referendum campaign can become a reality.  It is tragic that the facts in relation to the internal distribution of wealth within the Community, since our accession along with Denmark and Britain, do not tally with the aspirations so may pro advocates put forward at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2423" />
      <i>The Economist</i> of 18 August, page 43 gives an index of GDP per head between 1970 and 1978.  The clear pattern of that table of figures suggests in relation to the poorer countries&mdash;Britain, Italy and Ireland&mdash;instead of the gap closing between the rich and the poor centres it has actually been widened.</P>
    <P>One can argue with a certain degree of accuracy that part of the reason for the gap is the high rate of inflation in the economies that I have mentioned and the subsequent effective devaluation of their currencies.  That is as much a symptom of the problem as it is the cause of it.  The Joint Committee now feel that the primary political task of the Tánaiste and his colleagues in Government is to reinforce the argument and the claim that the Community does aspire to increased wealth throughout the member states and to attempt to redistribute it in such a way that the gap closes.  If a political solution is not found to increasing the resources of the EEC, the gap will not only widen dramatically but untold damage will be done to our economy in the interim period.</P>
    <P>If the members of the Joint Committee came back from Brussels that evening with any kind of impression, the overriding impression was that we were facing a crisis the scale of which none of us had been fully aware of prior to that visit.  Perhaps that is as much a condemnation of our capacity to keep ourselves informed as it is of the way in which the present Government have articulated the problem of Community finances.  I hold the view, which is shared by some members of the Committee, that there has been too much concern with the precise nature and structure of the common agricultural policy to the detriment of the larger problem of the EEC budget and EEC financing.</P>
    <P>In his report to the European Parliament, Commissioner Tugendhat was forced to make the observation that there was little or no co-ordination in the capitals of the Nine between the Ministers for Finance and the Ministers for Agriculture.  The constant focusing <Col N="2424" /> on the price levels of agricultural products even to the detriment of structural investment, which is of more interest to us, has obscured the main problem of financing the Community and attempting to make a reality of all the grandiloquent phrases that emanate from meetings of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this topic will be on the agenda at the Dublin Summit. I speak on behalf of myself and the Labour Party when I say that I should like the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government to give the House an assurance that their resolve will not be weakened irrespective of whatever propaganda war is waged by the British Prime Minister and the other members of the Community for their own internal political reasons, such as the German Federal elections next Autumn, the problems in France in relation to the collapse of the Gaullist Centre Alliance and Prime Minister Thatcher's own problems in relation to cutting her public sector borrowing.  We want an assurance that those internal political considerations, backed up by the impressive propaganda machine that all three countries can muster, will not weaken their resolve.  We do not want to see a repetition of the unfortunate and inexcusable reluctant consent by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to a reduction in the regional fund for this year.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the politics of that meeting; we are aware of the pressures of that meeting.  However, as Minister responsible <i>inter alia</i> for our regional development, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development should have been carried screaming from the halls of the council chamber refusing on any account to agree to a reduction in regional aid.  To lamely stand behind the hope that the European Parliament would restore to the fund what the Council of Ministers had cut from it was a political abdication of responsibility and a particular abdication having regard to the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy MacSharry, was in the Chair at the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2425" /> Unless we pound the table harder than the richer nations of the EEC we will not get what the EEC promised us in 1973. The reality at the end of the five-year transitional period for agricultural prices is that the honeymoon is over, irrespective of what form the common agricultural policy takes; and most of the professional farming organisations are aware of that fact.  In terms of its contribution to this country, the regional fund is a joke.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for Finance should reject it. In real terms it is not a serious fund.  The way it is administered effectively buries it as an effective fund.  The social fund has a higher profile and in its funding of many AnCO activities has had more direct incremental effect than any other.</P>
    <P>Between now and Christmas we will be agreeing a motion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Treaty of Accession of the Republic of Greece to the Community.  Within the lifetime of this Dáil it is probable that we will also agree to similar treaties in relation to Spain and Portugal.  The regional and social implications of the membership of those three countries upon the resources of the Community are enormous, so much so that when the Council took the decision to override the recommendation of the Commission on Greece's entry some years ago, our Foreign Minister at that time took out a reservation on that decision, attempting to ensure that the funds would be increased <i>pro rata</i> to accommodate the membership of Greece and the other two countries.  In the view of the Joint Committee, the reality is that there will not be a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the funds, that there will be a net overall reduction.  The inevitable internal capitalist logic of the EEC Community, stripped of the cotton wool wrapping which the Paris Summit gave to it in the early part of the decade, will be exposed for what it is: an open free-trade area in which there will be a continued movement of capital resources and resources from the periphery of poorer areas of the Community to the centre.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Joint Committee I should like to thank the House for taking this debate in a non-partisan spirit, the <Col N="2426" /> spirit in which I speak this afternoon on behalf of that Committee.  The Committee are absolutely unanimous in their sense of horror at the crisis confronting us.  I beseech the Minister, on their behalf, to ensure that a political solution is found to this problem by the exercise of Ireland's Presidency of the Council and our moral claim to some degree of internal redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor within the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the committee for focusing the attention of the House on a potentially serious difficulty facing the financing of the Community budget in future years.  But, before proceeding on that, there are one or two matters arising out of what Deputy Quinn has said with which I should like to deal.  Just for the record, let me point out that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development did not agree to a cut in the regional fund.  I think what the Deputy had in mind was that he agreed to a smaller sum than the Commission had proposed.  In fact it is an increase on the existing fund.  Furthermore, I cannot accept the implied proposition put <Col N="2427" /> forward by Deputy Quinn that the best way to measure the approach of the Government to these matters, including the regional fund, is to have some way of measuring the decibels from pounding the desk.  I do not think that is the way to measure it; the best way to measure it is by results.  I can assure the Deputy that if he measures the performance in regard to results in relation to the regional fund, heretofore or indeed arising out of what is happening this year, he will find that we are getting better results than had been obtained in the past, not necessarily by pounding the desk.  There may be a time for pounding the desk but it is better not to rely on that as the only weapon.  A certain degree of political skill can be brought to bear on these things.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that we are dealing with eight other countries, each with its different line of approach, and there are occasions when perhaps a different kind of approach than pounding the desk will get better results.</P>

      <P>Apart from a small amount of miscellaneous revenue, the Community budget is financed according to the own resources system. This was introduced under a Council decision taken in 1970 and was subsequently accepted by Ireland, the United Kingdom and Denmark in the Treaty of Accession.  The term &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; signifies revenue of a fiscal nature belonging to the Community as of right, as distinct from funds for which they would be dependent on the goodwill of the member states each year.  Own resources cover revenue from the Community's common customs tariff, from agricultural levies and from value-added tax, at a rate not exceeding 1 per cent, applied to a uniform assessment base. While the revenues are collected by the national administrations and in some cases, including Ireland, are channelled through the national exchequers, they are under the direction of the Commission's <Col N="2428" /> services and are subject to detailed inspection by the Community's Court of Auditors.  They are paid over automatically each month to the Commission and are not subject to vote in the national parliaments.  In effect, national administrations act as agents of the Community in the collection of own resources and are accountable to the Commission for the proper operation of the system.  The Commission pays the national administrators a fee to cover the expenses of collection.</P>
      <P>The difficulty regarding the financing of Community expenditure arises because of the finite limit on own resources laid down in the Council's 1970 decision.  Of the own resources, the VAT element is the only part which effectively contains any flexibility and buoyancy.  Revenue from customs duties and agricultural levies is falling in real terms as member states expand their trade within the tariff-free common market and the situation will be further adversely affected by the GATT changes coming into force in 1980.  The Community is, therefore, approaching the 1 per cent ceiling on VAT; the VAT rate in the draft budget for 1980, established by the Council, is 0.76 per cent and is likely to be increased to some extent before the budget is finally adopted.</P>
      <P>The difficulties in regard to the own resources limits are expected to come to a head in connection with the 1981 Budget when the Commission foresees total budgetary expenditure of some 19 billion EUA, compared with expected revenue from existing own resources, including VAT at the full 1 per cent rate, of about 18½ billion EUA.  The Development of the Community is mirrored in the development of its budget and, unless the existing and new Community policies are to be curtailed, it seems essential that agreement be reached as soon as possible on additional financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission discussion document, referred to in the Committee Report, represents the Commission's initial thinking on the question of additional financial resources.  This is a delicate and sensitive issue, especially in the light of the pressures being exerted <Col N="2429" /> by certain member states in regard to the level of Community expenditure, particularly on the common agricultural policy.  It should be borne in mind, however, that a decision to increase the own resources available to the Community would not, of itself, necessarily give rise to additional expenditure; expenditure decisions would still be made annually within the framework of the budgetary mechanism.  The Commission, rightly in my view, decided to issue a discussion document in advance of its formal proposal on new own resources.  I am glad to say that the discussion document accepts unequivocally that new revenues will be needed.</P>
    <P>During the discussion of the document by a Joint Council of Foreign Affairs and Finance Ministers last April, certain member states expressed the view that the 1 per cent VAT ceiling should not be violated.  Ireland's position was, of course, to support the Commission's line.  The Community budget is still modest in size, especially from a macroeconomic point of view.  It still represents only about 0.8 per cent of the Community GDP and approximately 2½ per cent of Community aggregate national expenditure.  This modest size continues to restrain the effective contribution which the budget can make towards solving the Community's major structural problems, in particular the promotion of economic convergence.  It is important, therefore, for the budget to be allowed to expand faster than the growth in existing own resources would permit.  I am pleased to note that the Report of the Joint Committee essentially endorses that view.</P>
    <P>I could not accept the attitude of certain member states that FEOGA expenditure, particularly the guarantee portion, is too high.  The position is that guarantee expenditure, namely expenditure on market support, represents no more than about 1/2 per cent of Community gross domestic product.  This is not a significant level of expenditure. Critics of the common agricultural policy should also bear in mind that a large proportion of the FEOGA allocation <Col N="2430" /> represents the transfer of agricultural expenditure, which otherwise would have to be borne by national exchequers, from the various member states to the Community level. Criticism of the CAP is exaggerated in the case of prices and surpluses: food prices have not risen out of line with other prices and producer prices in the Community are reasonably in line with those in other developed countries.</P>
    <P>The common agricultural policy is the only fully operative policy of the Community and many of the problems associated with it are due to the failure by the Community to develop adequate regional, social and industrial policies. Had these been developed and had the expenditure on the guidance side of FEOGA been kept in reasonable relationship to the total of FEOGA expenditure, then the guarantee financing could have been seen in its proper perspective.  The current Irish Presidency has stressed in the European Parliament that guarantee section expenditure is not governed by the budgetary authorisations but rather by the basic regulations and the market situation.  Any changes in the basic regulations can only be made in accordance with the procedure in the Treaties, that is, by the Council following an opinion from the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Apart from the pressure on own resources from existing expenditure policies, there will be additional demands arising from enlargement of the Community to include Greece, and later Spain and Portugal.  Their accession will, among other things, require the Community to re-examine the functioning of the common agricultural policy with a view to strengthening market support for their agricultural products.  This, in turn, could lead to a sizeable new area of expenditure. Progress in that area should not be at the expense of producers elsewhere in the Community.  The Joint Committee's report refers to agreement in principle on the need for additional own resources in the context of enlargement. While the Council has agreed that, subject to the usual budgetary procedures, appropriate provision would <Col N="2431" /> be made for the needs of the enlarged Community, I am not aware of any commitment by the Council, even in principle, to providing additional own resources.</P>
    <P>As regards how the additional own resources are to be secured, I would see considerable merit in accepting a further tranche of VAT.  The Community VAT base is already harmonised and if the Council were to agree in principle to provide additional VAT own resources, there should be no undue delay in implementing that agreement.  If the revenue were to come from one of the other sources referred to in the Commission's discussion document, namely, cigarette or alcohol duties, a corporation tax, energy tax or income tax, it is not unlikely that there would be a considerably delay in securing the necessary agreement on harmonising the tax base. In so far as member states took a stance in favour of additional own resources at last April's Council meeting, their preference was for an increase in the VAT ceiling.</P>
    <P>I note that the Joint Committee also favour an increase on the VAT side, subject to due regard being built into the own resource system for the taxable capacity of member states.  While there is a strong case to be made for taking account of member states' ability to pay, the indications are that such an approach would not be acceptable to all member states, notwithstanding the fact that this approach received support in a resolution passed in the European Parliament only last week.</P>
    <P>As regards the formal arrangements necessary to secure additional own resources, the position is that under the Treaty provisions the right of initiative resides with the Commission.  On a proposal from the Commission, the Council, after consulting the European Parliament, may recommend appropriate provisions to the member states.  The unanimous decision of member states would be required and, in some cases, new domestic legislation <Col N="2432" /> would also be necessary.  The current Irish Presidency has encouraged the Commission to bring forward their proposal as soon as possible.  So far, however, the Commission have not done so.</P>
    <P>While the question of the financing of the Community budget by an extension of own resources is not yet urgent, the reluctance of certain member states with regard to securing the additional finance is a cause of concern.  However, there is still some time before the size of the Community budget is arbitrarily limited by the available revenues.  We shall, of course, continue to encourage the Commission to bring forward its proposals as soon as possible.  The future effectiveness of the Community's structural policies depends to a large degree on a positive decision on the resources question and we will certainly play our part to secure a positive decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems from this discussion that there are three separate though related problems facing the EEC from the point of view of finance.  First, there is the prospect of the EEC going broke, if not next year certainly by 1981. Secondly, there is the current claim by the UK that their contribution from 1980 onwards will be excessive; and, thirdly, there are the attempts to reduce the size of the farm fund and the assaults on the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.  These are all inter-related. Taking them in reverse order, it is clear that it is in our interests to resist any attempts to alter the basic provisions of the CAP.  We paid the price of our entry into the EEC when we accepted the terms of free trade which resulted in the loss of something in the order of 75,000 industrial jobs.  Fortunately, through the efforts of the IDA and successive Governments attempts were made to offset this loss.  It is in that context that we must consider the corresponding benefits to us through the agricultural sector.  In relation to the EEC every country will have its own balance sheet in relation to the advantages and disadvantages of entry.  Some of these advantages may not be quanitifiable in <Col N="2433" /> monetary terms.  For some country it might add to the umbrella of security provided by the EEC.  Other factors will apply in other countries.  The losses we sustained because of free trade will in many cases have been made up by other member states.  For instance, Germany received huge benefits as a result of industrial free trade.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the motivation of each country it is not acceptable for the nations which have gained to attempt to have their cake and eat it.  If they have gained from free trade it is not acceptable for them to point the finger at countries such as ours which are gaining from agriculture.  We paid the price in industrial jobs in the expectation that we would enjoy the long term benefits which we would derive from an expansion of farm output on the basis of comparative advantage.  That is a major factor to be taken into account in this situation.  In relation to the position adopted by the UK, they are using the present Community problem to blackmail the other member states.  They will effectively veto any necessary changes to permit the Community to be adequately financed unless they secure a reduction in their contribution.  They had their opportunity of renegotiating in 1975 and it was bungled.  The progress of the Community cannot be held up by the British at this stage.  The rules of the game cannot be changed merely because it is their turn to feel the pinch.  I do not accept that they are entitled to impose a veto or to blackmail the other nations, but they are entitled to make their point.  An estimated net contribution in 1980 of over £1,000 million, as against Germany's estimated £730 million, seems to be somewhat unfair.  Having said that, I do not accept their right, with the apparent connivance of the Germans and possibly the French, to veto the development of the entire Community in the matter of adequate overall financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the background to the issues which run concurrently with the overall question of Community financing.  It is clear that the Community is facing a financial crisis.  Quite apart from the attacks <Col N="2434" /> on the farm fund, there will not be adequate moneys to develop properly the regional and social funds.  I have always taken the view that the spirit of the Treaty of Rome has not been implemented. Perhaps they stuck by the letter, but I believe the fundamental spirit of the Treaty of Rome, which suggested that remote areas such as ours should receive sufficient finances to bring up their standard of living, has not been implemented. We are now talking about Community financing virtually to maintain the existing levels of the regional fund.  That is another major reason why we must be very concerned about the problem.  Possibly to a lesser degree, the same thing arises in regard to the social fund.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind that the 1981 estimates prepared in Brussels, apparently do not take into account the additional commitments which will arise from the Second Lomé Convention. They do not take into account the additional burdens which may arise in the context of the accession of Greece.  There will be additional expenditures to be incurred which have not even been taken into account at this stage.  On that basis Ireland's interest is very much at stake. We have had the Presidency of the European Council.  While I accept that the process by which decisions are made in the European Community are labyrinthine, and that is the appropriate word, I suggest that being in the Chair must provide us with opportunities.  This is one of the really basic problems upon which we should try to get some progress before we hand over the Chair.</P>
    <P>Various means have been suggested as to how we might increase the independent own resources of the Community. In the original Commission document of November 1978 there was a discussion on the question of an automatic right to a share of the direct taxation of member states, cigárette and alcohol duties, or a tax on energy.  It seems to me that all of these are not very feasible.  I understand the latest thinking in Brussels is that, because of the fact that these are not harmonised throughout the Community, <Col N="2435" /> this is not the way in which the problem should be tackled.</P>
    <P>The point made by the Minister is the one which must be followed.  From 1980 onwards I understand the Community will be entitled to 1 per cent of all VAT revenue throughout the nine.  The simplest, most direct and most effective measure would be to increase this percentage. I would say to the Minister&mdash;and I am not saying it in any political context&mdash;that there should be some corrective mechanism in regard to the VAT receipts.  It is clear that the receipts from VAT are not an indication of taxable capacity.  For instance, in 1979 it is estimated Ireland will have .68 per cent of community GDP, whereas it is estimated that the VAT figure will be .77 per cent.  I have to confess that I am not clear on the reasoning behind this.  It seems the greatest divergence is in the case of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if a large part of Community funding is to be based on VAT receipts, this must be borne in mind.  The corrective mechanism could arise where the yield of a given VAT percentage is more or less than a certain percentage of GDP.  That is a relatively small factor to be borne in mind.  It is essential at this stage that action be taken, and be taken now.  It is in the interest of the EEC, and it is certainly in the interest of Ireland, that a solution should be found.  I would hope that with the imminence of the Dublin summit some progress will be made in this area.</P>
    <P>The problems about getting a decision through have been mentioned by other speakers.  There is the question of the involvement of the Commission, the opinion of the Parliament, the unanimous decision of the different member states and, in most if not all cases, ratification by the relevant national parliaments.  Inevitably that process must be slow and would take at least 12 months, I would imagine.  We can see therefore the seriousness of the problem.  If a beginning is not made now, the process will not and cannot be completed before the <Col N="2436" /> flashpoint, the actual crisis, is upon us. That is one of the reasons for having this debate today.</P>
    <P>I am here as spokesman on behalf of my own party, and as a member of the Joint Committee, not in any way to criticise the Government.  We want to reinforce them in their determination to have something done about this problem and to highlight the real necessity to have urgent and immediate action taken in that area.  They have the united support of this House in their efforts to have a solution initiated immediately.  If this opportunity is missed, not only will the EEC as a whole suffer in the future, but in particular this nation will be a considerable loser.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said already, the EEC is about to run out of money in 1981.  It is almost as if the Community is in a car heading for a precipice with most of the people involved accelerating instead of putting on the brake.  In two submissions which have been received from national Governments so far in relation to budgetary problems&mdash; from the Italian and the Irish Governments&mdash;to the best of my knowledge the main burden of the submissions was that their countries were not getting enough.  This would imply not a reduction in the overall budget but an increase in it without any concomitant specific commitment to raising money to pay for what is being demanded.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Commission have not put forward any concrete proposals in the matter.  All we have from the Commission is a set of options. We are all familiar with the technique of putting forward sets of options when you are in difficulty.  It is not the Commission's jobs to put forward sets of options but to put forward specific proposals.  To date the Commission have put forward no proposals to deal with the situation. They deserve strong criticism for their failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government and the Joint Committee have indicated that they are in favour in principle of the idea of raising <Col N="2437" /> the 1 per cent limit on the amount of VAT raised in member countries which can be contributed to the EEC.  That is the solution they see at least in the short term for raising more money. Presumably 2 per cent rather than 1 per cent of the VAT raised throughout the Community could be contributed to the EEC.  I have serious reservations about that, speaking personally.  Like all taxes on purchases, VAT is a regressive tax.  In other words, the poorer you are, the more of your income you pay proportionately in VAT or in any other such purchase tax.  That applies not only to individuals but to countries.  Poorer people tend to have to spend more of their total income on their daily necessities, therefore paying more by way of VAT, whereas richer people can afford to put away some of their money and, consequently, not to have to pay VAT on it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, using VAT as a solution to the problem will ensure that because of the very nature of this tax, the poorer one is, the more he will pay by way of taxation.  That is not a system that is in our interest unless, as Deputy O'Keeffe suggested, there is a corrective mechanism; but to my knowledge no one has put forward any concrete suggestion in regard to any such mechanism.  Have the Government worked out any specific proposals on this matter?  I am aware that even as President of the Council of Ministers the Minister cannot put forward such proposals but it is open to our Government to put fairly concrete proposals to the Commission.  This is something they should do immediately. They should put forward specific proposals as to how VAT could be modified, in the event of that being the only way forward, in order to ensure that the poorer people and the poorer countries do not pay proportionately more in terms of VAT.</P>
    <P>The Minister said rather fatalistically that there is no work being done on harmonising the tax basis of other taxes apart from VAT and duty on cigarettes. Therefore, the prospects of introducing a share of corporation tax, income tax, energy tax, alcohol tax and so on as <Col N="2438" /> other means, apart from VAT, of raising money are not good.  The Minister is now President of the Community Council and I should like to hear what he is doing this year to bring about a harmonisation in the other tax bases so that we may not have to rely in the longer term on VAT, regardless of how modified a form it may take in the future.</P>
    <P>The point should be made also that this year the EEC ran out of funds for some of their contracted commitments in respect of the CAP and that Bord Báinne are now in considerable difficulties as a result.  I understand that one of the reasons for this situation was that the supplementary estimate, which should have been approved by the Parliament to allow that money to be made available and to ensure that this financial cash crisis would not occur, was presented too late to be given approval in time to avoid this cash crisis.  I understand that the responsibility for that rests between the Commission and the Council of Ministers, the Council over which Ireland presides.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland must be prepared to be firm in our defence of the CAP, not only in terms of our own national interest but also because this policy makes sense in European terms also.  If we are to have any possibility of having our case accepted, that case must be capable of being defended in European terms.  Ireland will not get anywhere by going along to the Community whining and saying that we must be helped.  We have a good case to make in Community terms.</P>
    <P>I wish to indicate the grounds on which the CAP must be defended and, more important, must be paid for in terms of revenue raised by way of VAT or revenue raised by way of other taxes throughout the Community.  First, we need a common food policy in order to ensure that Europe remains self sufficient, because if Europe is not self sufficient and if we must depend on food imported from the far regions of the world, we would have no guarantee in the event of war breaking out or in the event of the development of a difficult international <Col N="2439" /> situation that those trade routes over which the food would come would remain open and that we would continue to receive food.  Not only, therefore, would such a situation pose a danger for the future but it would weaken our bargaining position in international relations in that, if other countries knew we were not self-sufficient in food, they would be able to turn the screws on us in a way that would not be possible if we remain self-sufficient by reason of having a common food policy.</P>
    <P>What surprises me more than anything else is that Mrs. Thatcher, who is the leader of a Government who are supposed to be the most anti-Soviet Government in Europe, is the person who is crying out for the dismantling of the CAP, that very policy that is giving her country self-sufficiency.  I wonder if she realises that putting Europe in the position of depending on food imported from New Zealand and Australia, and over the longest and most vulnerable trade routes in the world, is to put Europe in a position of vulnerability <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Soviet Union or any other country which might wish to encircle Europe.  Clearly part of the global strategy of other powers is to close up the trade routes, to control the Persian Gulf and other trading routes.</P>
    <P>The point must be made in favour of the CAP that it is in effect a regional policy because the poorer countries tend to be the ones which depend most on agriculture and a common agricultural policy, if it is operated properly, means more for the poorer countries.  The present CAP has that effect, though there are areas in it which require some reform and which I shall deal with later.</P>
    <P>Further, if we scrap the CAP and revert to a national food policy, national governments will be required immediately to raise more taxes to pay for commodities that are now being paid for in Brussels.  Such a change will increase tax immediately in the national countries and would render far more difficult the prospect of economic and monetary union with the result that we would never <Col N="2440" /> be able to bring about the strong Europe that we want.  Therefore, those people in Germany and Britain who are criticising the CAP should take account of all these factors.</P>
    <P>We are told that there are immense surpluses of food in Europe but I should like to point out that even in relation to milk, which is the most surplus commodity of all, we have only a 60-day surplus supply in the Communities and food is essential to survival.  Yet the same Community are saying that we should have a 100-days surplus supply of oil. Do we not need food more than we need oil?</P>
    <P>I should like to analyse where the surpluses are coming from.  Admittedly, 27 per cent of the budget has gone towards supporting the milk market, but Ireland is not causing the milk surplus or the butter mountain.  In the first place, Irish production alone is not even equal to the amount of milk products being imported by Britain from New Zealand.  Indeed, the entire Irish production is less than the quantity of imports to Britain from New Zealand and these New Zealand imports, these imports from outside the Community, must be supported in the same way as our milk products are supported.</P>
    <P>In addition, the vast increase in milk production in overall terms of quantity has been in recent years in Germany and Holland and such countries.  In 1976, for instance, the latest date for which figures are available, 73 per cent of the Community's butter stocks were held in Germany and that was a significant increase on the 66 per cent of the Community's butter stocks which had been held in Germany in the previous year.  Germany and Holland are producing milk that is based on imported supplies of feed in concentrate form and which is costing the Community money in terms of balance of payments, whereas Ireland is producing milk which is based on grass and, consequently, not costing the Community anything.</P>
    <P>In the event of the trade routes to the world being cut off&mdash;and this is the basic rationale for a common agricultural <Col N="2441" /> policy&mdash;the German and the Dutch systems of milk production would collapse overnight because they would not be able to get soya from America to keep it going whereas Irish production of milk could continue because of its dependence only on native resources.  The reason Germany and Holland are able to produce so much milk and to make so many demands on the budget they are now seeking to reduce&mdash;I am speaking now particularly of Germany&mdash;is that they are able to import soya from the United States through Rotterdam and other ports in northern Europe at a far lower price than we can import it and at a lower price than other similar foods could be imported from outside the Community.  Soya was allowed into the EEC without the imposition of a variable levy even though wheat has to bear such a levy.  When GATT was negotiated soya was not a significant item of trade and they forgot to do anything about it. As a result of this anomaly America is able to send large quantities of soya into the EEC and indirectly, this is causing the milk mountain that exists in Europe. If soya from America were treated on the same basis as wheat and other products that are covered by the CAP, we would not have the difficulties we are having with the surplus of milk because the production in Germany and Holland, which is based on imported feedstuffs of this type, would continue no longer.</P>
    <P>The Government must do three things.  First, they must press to get rid of the artificial advantages which the Germans and the Dutch have in the production of milk and which are causing budgetary problems.  Secondly, they must insist that we get an increase in own resources so that the Community can continue to progress.  Thirdly, they must seek other means as a long-term measure of raising this money for the Community apart from VAT because in the long run VAT is a regressive tax.</P>
    <P>The Government hold the Presidency of the EEC.  They have a great opportunity and a great task ahead of them.  I hope the Minister and his colleagues will <Col N="2442" /> be able to live up to their responsibilities in the coming months.</P>

      <P>An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta&mdash;AnCOT for short &mdash;were established by this House to be responsible for advisory and educational services for agriculture. There are many decisions that need to be taken urgently in relation to agricultural advice and education but they cannot be taken because the board established by this House have not been appointed by the Minister.  The necessary legislation was passed by this House in May 1979, but six months later the Minister apparently has not got around to appointing the board.  Such delay is difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>I should like to indicate some of the reasons why I believe it is important that this board be appointed and the necessary decisions taken.  There is a problem at the moment that there are not sufficient places to meet the demand in agricultural colleges.  Decisions must be taken about how extra places are to be provided or if that is not the solution decisions must be made on what other methods are to be devised for providing sufficient agricultural education for those in need of it.  It is clear we cannot make progress in agriculture, particularly in a situation where prices are not as generous as they might otherwise be, unless our farmers are adequately trained and advised.  Therefore, decisions in relation to agricultural education are very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need also to take decisions regarding the advisory services and the promotional opportunities available.  At the moment these services are very demoralised.  Decisions like this can be taken only by An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta but that board have not been appointed.  There is also the need to ensure that we avail of EEC aid which has been available to us for many years <Col N="2443" /> on a generous scale but which, unfortunately, we have not availed of to any significant degree.  This aid could be used for the provision of a socio-economic advisory service which would advise farmers in relation to retirement, signing over their farms and so on.  Again, such decisions can be taken only if An Chomhairle come into existence.</P>
    <P>We have had a long delay in coming to the position we reached last May when at last a Bill was enacted into law. There have been reports for the past ten or 15 years urging the need for the reorganisation of advisory, educational and research services.  The previous Minister, Deputy Clinton, had got through this House before the general election of 1977 the National Agricultural Authority Act and before the Government changed, just after their defeat in the election, he appointed a board to take up duty as the National Agricultural Authority.  The present Minister came into office and, for reasons which I do not wish to debate on this occasion, decided to scrap the board and to introduce his own Bill.  There was a considerable delay before the new Bill came before the House.  When it eventually appeared I believe the Minister lamented the fact that it was not processed more quickly.  It became law in May 1979.</P>
    <P>At last the Minister had got his way. He had got his Bill on the Statute Book. In view of that one would have expected him to appoint a board and to have told them to get on with the job.  Yet, six months later the board have not been appointed. Frankly, I do not understand how this could have happened.  There are some suggestions that it is because certain people are not being offered enough of a salary.  I do not know if that is true but, if it is, the Minister should say so. Whatever the obstacles, there is no excuse for a delay of six months after the necessary legislation has eventually gone through the House.  There is no excuse for not appointing the board within that time and letting them get on with the job. <Col N="2444" /> I hope the Minister will be able, not to give us a convincing explanation, but to announce either the names of the members of the board or that he will appoint the board within a finite time, preferably in the next few days.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss as to why Adjournment time is made available for the extraction of the information Deputy Bruton requires.  In fact, I am quite certain that it is not so required.  Since I am in the House it is no harm to recall the relevant dates that marked the course of this Bill which was introduced on 23 May 1978.  The Second Stage debate began on 26 October of the same year and ended on 15 November.  The Committee Stage began on 21 February and ended on 4 April.  During the Committee Stage there were no less than six divisions and I cannot count the innumerable Opposition filibustering, delaying speeches which we had on Second Stage also.  The Report and Final Stages began and concluded on 26 April.  The time span from the introduction to the passage of the Bill in this House was 11 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Government's fault for not finding time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>From the commencement of the Second Stage to the passage was seven months.  The vast duration of that debate was the direct upshot of the disregard by the Opposition of the need to put this new mechanism going.  As the Deputy observed, this legislation responded correctly to the recommendations of the various reports that had been made on this subject for ten or 15 years, all of which particularised in the way my Bill did, and in the way in which its predecessor did not.  In other words, it ensured the separate status of the research element in agricultural matters and training and advisory service going under AnCOT as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill then proceeded to the Seanad where it spent from 2 to 16 May of this year.  It was signed by the President on 22 May.  On the question of the formation <Col N="2445" /> of the board, set up as it is in accordance with what I believe to be the correct procedures and in conformity with the wishes of the farming organisations and other concerns, the people who had been indicated by the organisations as being their nominees on that board were written to and the last of the replies arrived on 23 August.  It is necessary to say also that consequent on the bringing in of the Bill, certain sections of AnCOT were executed on 20 July, after consultation with farming organisations and so on.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a board of such vital importance as this is not something that should be rushed into.  My Department and I have made all reasonable haste and we have ensured that that haste does not involve any element of foolhardy premature decisions.  The results of such haste would be very dire and long lived. Most of the outstanding matters have been resolved by now.  I should like to mention that during the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Agriculture, the Minister has a certain number of other preoccupations.  That has taken an inordinate amount of the time of the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State.  Despite those difficulties I hope in the next week or two to make a very exhaustive statement on the future of AnCOT.</P>
    <P>I know there have been varying attempts to deal with this by abusive people <Col N="2446" /> on the general council, as late as yesterday, which we need not pay any attention to because one does not properly pay any attention to vulgar abuse.  That type of pointless ballyragging has been taken up by certain Members of the Opposition.  That is very unhelpful and unconstructive.  While it might gratify peculiar instincts of theirs, it is by no means constructive and does not impress anybody.  I strongly recommend that they desist from this type of schoolboy behaviour in the future and try to become accustomed to the fact that their party have departed from participation in government for a couple of years.  It will be a long day before they ever have the sensation of being confronted with the realities and difficulties of implementing Government decisions.</P>

      <P>As a result of the failure of the European Parliament to clear at its recent session the supplementary budget for the Community for 1979, a shortfall has arisen in the guarantee section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  This has led to some delays in payments to traders in respect of export refunds, MCA subsidies and certain market support aids.  Payments for purchases of products into intervention which are met in the first instance from national funds are not, however, affected and neither are payments under the guidance section of FEOGA.  The latter relate to grants under the farm modernisation scheme and the western drainage scheme, headage grants under the disadvantaged areas scheme as well as certain smaller grants under the dairy herds conversion scheme and the non-marketing of milk scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department and the other Departments concerned are in continuous contact with the European Commission about the situation and have urged that the necessary moneys be made available from Community funds to member states at the earliest possible date to meet obligations.  I am hopeful that as a result early action will be taken by the Commission to resolve the difficulties.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 to 348, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I gave a comprehensive progress report on the implementation of the Cross-Border Communications Study for the Derry and Donegal area in the Dáil on 10 May 1979.  This progress report gave the background to the study, the terms of reference, the areas covered and the follow-up to the various recommendations made by the consultants in the report.  It also restated the Government's commitment to cross-Border economic <Col N="2408" /> co-operation and emphasised that the Government have embarked upon speedy implementation of the recommendations contained in the study.  Consistent with the Government's commitment we have been continuing to monitor in detail the implementation of the various measures agreed on.  The detailed recommendations made by the consultants are readily available in the Summary Volume (Volume 1) of the study, a copy of which can be obtained from the Dáil Library.  The following is however the present position in regard to the principal measures envisaged by the consultants for implementation in Donegal with particular emphasis on the area of roads and telecommunications to which the Deputy specifically refers.</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Roads</i></P>
    <P>The programme of implementation approved by the Government in June 1978 provided for the full implementation of the first stage of the road programme for North Donegal recommended by the consultants.  In line with this commitment work is already proceeding on a number of roads in Donegal singled out by the consultants for priority action in their road programme for North Donegal up to 1985.  Early implementation of many of the other recommended road improvement schemes for which planning is at an advanced stage can be expected.</P>
    <P>Road grants allocated for work in the Donegal section of the study area in 1979 amount to £433,900 comprising grants of £265,000 in respect of the Letterkenny/Bridgend Road (N13), £118,900 in respect of the Stranorlar/Letterkenny road (N56) (including Letterkenny bypass and Kilmacrennan Bridge section) and £50,000 for the Lifford bypass.  State expenditure to date in 1979, up to 31/10/1979, amounts to £253,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grants detailed above a general block grant of £781,000 has been allocated to Donegal County Council for 1978 for work on roads other than national roads at the discretion of the council.  No information is <Col N="2409" /> available on expenditure on specific roads by Donegal County Council out of its own resources supplemented by the block grant for works on roads other than national roads.</P>
    <P>In relation to EEC funds I can only give information on the road schemes accepted in 1978 for assistance under ERDF.  These amounted to £423,000 of which we will be in receipt of approximately £127,000.  The routes involved include Bridgend-Pluck Cross (N13) Letterkenny-Kilmacrennan (N56), Strabane-Lifford (N14) and the Letterkenny Through Route.  As I stated on 10 May 1979, there is every reason to believe that future applications in respect of road works in the area will also be favourably considered within the resources of the fund and that the area as a whole will continue to benefit from EEC assistance.</P>
    <P>The following, for convenience, is the detailed position in relation to progress on the roads programme which was given in the reply of 10 May 1979.</P>
    <P>
      <i>County Donegal: Inter-Urban Roads</i>

    <P>
      <i>Letterkenny-Pluck Cross, N. 13,</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>National Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Outline design has been completed, and a detailed ground survey has been carried out to enable the detailed road design to proceed.  At the present rate of progress it is expected that it will be possible for work to begin on the scheme towards the end of 1980.  The design involved a detour from the existing route at Pluck Cross, connecting back at Manorcunningham on the Derry side.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bridgend-Pluck Cross, N. 13,</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>National Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Two remaining sections of this route are included in current improvement programmes:</P>
    <P>(i)  Two miles at Manorcunningham adjoining the Letterkenny-Pluck Cross route;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Newtowncunningham By-Pass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2410" /> Scheme (I)</P>
    <P>Construction on the scheme has commenced; prospects are that it will take a further two years to complete.</P>
    <P>Scheme (II)</P>
    <P>Outline design stage for this scheme has been completed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Letterkenny-Kilmacrennan, N. 56,</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>National Secondary</i>
    </P>
    <P>Detailed design for a one-and-a-half mile section of this route adjoining Letterkenny has been completed.  A scheme of improvement works on the route, south of Kilmacrennan, is in progress, and is nearly completed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Strabane-Lifford, N. 14,</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>National Primary</i>
    </P>
    <P>The proposed through-pass at Lifford has two elements:</P>
    <P>(i)  Strabane-Letterkenny link;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Strabane-Ballybofey link.</P>
    <P>Scheme (I) is at an advanced stage and is well on the way to completion.</P>
    <P>Scheme (II) was not included in the programme drawn up by the consultants but is scheduled in the county programme for the second half of the 1980s.  Detailed design has been completed and land acquisition by CPO confirmed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Urban Through Routes: Letterkenny</i>
    </P>
    <P>A scheme linking the Letterkenny-Pluck Cross and Letterkenny-Kilmacrennan Roads has been in progress since 1977 and it is expected that part of the overall scheme will be opened to traffic during 1979.</P>
    <P>The table attached gives the work position on the road projects recommended in the study.  Pending determination of Exchequer provision for road works in 1980 it is not possible to indicate the extent of activity and expenditure in 1980.</P>
    <P>The Road Development Plan for the 1980s which represents a forward commitment by the Government to an action programme will provide the basis for the road improvement and maintenance <Col N="2411" /> programmes of the road authorities in the next decade.  Due account has been taken in the plan of the study recommendations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2412" /> The study recommendations do not cover the question of sanitary services.</P>

    <P>2.  <i>Telecommunications and Postal Service</i></P>
    <P>(i)  <i>Telecommunications</i></P>
    <P>As indicated previously, the conversion to automatic working of the telephone exchanges in North Donegal is going ahead as part of a £6.5 million development programme for the improvement of telecommunications in the area.  Expenditure to date on projects to improve the telephone service in the area is estimated at £4.6 million of which a total of £1.6 million has been allocated by the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>The Communications Study advocated telecommunications improvements on two fronts:</P>
    <P>(a)  Conversion of telephone exchanges in North Donegal to automatic working;</P>
    <P>(b)  improvement in cross-Border telephone service and the provision of a cross-Border cable link.</P>
    <P>In regard to (a) the Deputy will be aware that the Letterkenny exchange was converted to automatic working on 24 October 1979.  The equipment provided includes a switching and operator centre to serve the greater part of County Donegal which at present includes 57 manual exchanges.</P>
    <P>Work is also proceeding for the conversion of other exchanges and in the coming year the intention is to convert the exchanges at Bridgend, Raphoe, Newtowncunningham, Convoy, Castlefin and Carrigart to automatic working.  A further 38 manual exchanges have been contracted for or are included in the current auto conversion programme.  Most, if not all of these should be converted by the end of 1981. The remaining 12 exchanges will be added to the auto conversion programme as soon as sites for the new exchanges have been acquired.</P>
    <P>Apart from the local cabling schemes the area is served by co-axial link to Sligo.  This route is being augmented by a new 1800 circuit microwave link to Sligo.  It is hoped that this will be in service next year.</P>
    <P>In regard to (b), the reply that I gave <Col N="2413" /> to the Dáil on 10 May indicated that work has commenced on installation of an underground cable between Derry and Bridgend.  This has now been completed and provides Letterkenny subscribers with subscriber trunk dialling to all other exchanges in the country as well as dialling to Belfast, Derry and their immediate surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Postal Services</i></P>
    <P>In relation to the postal services it was indicated in the reply of 10 May 1979 that discussions between the respective postal authorities were continuing on the question of the transportation of mail for the North West through Northern Ireland.  I can now say that agreement has been reached with the Northern Ireland postal authorities to restore the previous routing arrangements which ceased in 1971.  The aim is to restore the service through Northern Ireland early in 1980.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Other areas:</i></P>
    <P>(a)  <i>Public Passenger Transport:</i></P>
    <P>The consultants recommended in the study that financial assistance should be provided to the Lough Swilly Bus Company for the purchase of new vehicles to replace its existing fleet of buses.  The two administrations have been jointly considering the problems regarding the operation of road passenger services in the area served by the Lough Swilly Company.  As indicated in the reply of 10 May 1979, they commissioned a report by industrial consultants costing all aspects of the company's operations which has since come to hand.  A final decision has not yet been taken regarding the recommendation in the cross-Border study but interim measures have been made to ensure the continuity of road passenger services in the area pending a decision on the long-term arrangements for the maintenance of such services.  Consideration of the question of more long-term arrangements is being pursued as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2414" /> (b)  <i>Air Transport:</i></P>
    <P>The consultants recommended in their report joint action with the Northern Ireland authorities to establish a scheduled Dublin/Derry air service for a trial period of three years.  A joint study of the aviation and other technical and operational aspects of the proposed air link has been carried out by the Department of Tourism and Transport and the British Civil Aviation Authority.  The study indicated that a substantial subsidy would be necessary to underwrite the operating cost of the services envisaged by the consultants, at least in the initial period.  No decisions have yet been taken.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Tourism</i></P>
    <P>The consultants recommended in their report the establishment of a tourism association for the Derry/Donegal area, publication of joint promotional literature and other appropriate measures of joint development of tourism as a whole.  In implementation of the recommendation of the consultants a body called the North West Tourism Co-operation Group was set up in August 1979.  The group consists of representatives of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  A number of special projects directly helpful to the development of tourist traffic in the area have been identified for consideration and preparation of a cross-Border tourist brochure is in progress.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>Freight Transport</i></P>
    <P>As indicated in the reply on 10 May 1979, the passing by the Oireachtas of the Road Transport Act, 1978, has considerably amended the legislation governing the operation of freight and transport services and has had the effect of generally liberalising it in the direction recommended by the consultants.</P>
    <P>(e)  <i>Ports</i></P>
    <P>The consultants in their report noted that the new facilities which are planned for Greencastle Harbour could make a significant contribution to the expansion <Col N="2415" /> of employment in the fish processing sector. Work on the improvements, estimated to cost £1.12 million, is expected to begin in 1980 and will take about four years to complete.</P>

      <P>An application in this case for a house improvement grant towards the cost of providing an extension and for a special grant towards the cost of installing a fireplace was received in my Department on 5 June 1979.</P>
      <P>As a new house grant had been paid in 1974-75, the question of a further grant for the extension had to be examined on the basis of the statutory limitations applying to such further grants.  On this basis, overcrowding does not exist and a further grant is not in order.</P>
      <P>The applicant does, however, qualify for a special grant for the installation of a fireplace in a house without one and when the file has been returned to the Department by the inspector, a certificate of approval showing the amount of the grant will be issued.</P>
