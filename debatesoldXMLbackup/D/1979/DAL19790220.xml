      <P>The passenger balance figures are compiled and published monthly from returns received from the airport authorities and from the shipping operators.  Data in respect of movements by sea have been published for months up to October 1978 which is the usual time lag.</P>
      <P>The industrial dispute in Aer Lingus in March-May 1978 caused severe disruption of the statistical recording system within the company.  In addition some further delay has been caused by separate staff problems at the airports.</P>
      <P>The backlog in supply of data is only now being cleared.  Complete information for monthly periods later than February 1978 is not yet available. Every effort is being made to expedite the issue of the outstanding figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No. That would be incorrect. There are staff problems.  This information is collected by the Central Statistics Office from Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta in connection with air traffic movements.  As I explained in the reply, there was an industrial dispute in Aer Lingus in March-May last.  In addition, there is an ongoing dispute at Aer Rianta level which is interfering with the collection of this data.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the only guide we have&mdash;and no one has ever claimed it is an absolutely accurate guide&mdash;as to emigration trends derives from these figures, and the result of the Government's failure to get these figures produced is that we have not got reliable figures&mdash;which I am sure is very welcome to them&mdash;on emigration since February 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is satisfied that the contents of a circular letter of 8 December 1978 to local authorities do not restrict the traditional freedoms of local authorities and their ability to respond sensitively to local needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the upper limit of 10 per cent in increases in rate poundages allowed for 1979 as providing a fair alignment between local authority programmes and national economic <Col N="1442" /> policies for the current year.  Within the upper limit, local authorities are free to determine their overall level of expenditure and their priorities as between their different programmes.  The formula allows local authorities the benefit of all new and increased valuations occurring in their areas and is thus adapted to variations in the pace of development from place to place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the imposition for the first time ever of an upper limit on expenditure in accordance with the circular referred to in the question which says: &ldquo;The Minister has directed that 10 per cent shall be the maximum amount by which the aggregate rate in the £ to be determined by each rating authority in respect of the local financial year 1978-79...&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;...shall exceed the previous year's estimate.&rdquo;  The imposition of that ceiling means, in effect, that the local authorities cannot respond to issues of concern, particularly since the Minister did not say he would be willing to consider exceptional cases.  Is it not a fact that the traditional flexibility these authorities had is no longer there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a fact, because the 10 per cent is to keep it in line with national budgetary policy.  It is not confined solely to 10 per cent.  Because of the buoyancy in local authority areas it can be much higher.  I will give the Deputy the example of his own local authority Dublin Corporation.  Because of buoyancy and State grants, the increase for Dublin Corporation on rates being collected will total 16.6 per cent. Might I point out that for Dublin County Council it will be 17.8 per cent? I should like to say also that this matter was fully debated in December.  On that occasion the Deputy said that he would not be averse to a suggestion that expenditure by local authorities should in some general way find itself in harmony with national economic policy.  He went on to say, &ldquo;I do not believe that local <Col N="1443" /> authorities should have an open-ended honeymoon if they want to go on a spree&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment (a) if he is aware of the extreme dissatisfaction experienced by many purchasers of new houses in suburban estates in the Dublin area due to defects in house construction and unfinished estate amenities; (b) if he will agree that these conditions amount to a severe social grievance; (c) if he considers that the existing planning law and practice provide the State and local authorities with adequate means to redress this grievance; and (d) if not, if he proposes any strengthening of the law in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that problems can arise in regard to defects in house construction in some new housing estates and in the completion of estate amenities.  In so far as house construction is concerned, I would point out that in January 1978 I introduced the structural guarantee scheme for new private houses to meet the problems of structural defects.  The scheme appears to be operating satisfactorily and will be reviewed after two years.  In addition, a new outline specification for new private houses has been issued by my Department and this includes improved insulation standards for all grant-type new houses.  These new provisions are in addition to the existing powers of local authorities under the Planning Acts and local by-laws.  A review of draft building regulations is currently being carried out in my Department and when they come into force will replace existing local authority building by-laws.</P>
      <P>As regards the satisfactory completion of new housing estates, I am not aware that the existing legislation is inadequate. The powers of planning authorities under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to deal with unfinished estates were considerably strengthened in the provisions of the 1976 Act.  The operation of these provisions is kept under review with a view to ascertaining whether amendments are necessary.  To date, there is no indication that changes are required.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for a full reply. Would the Minister accept <Col N="1448" /> that every Deputy who represents a constituency in which there are sprouting suburbs of the kind I mean is met more than once a week with complaints from residents' associations about the delay in completing estate amenities, in finishing roads and in doing what is necessary before the road can be taken in charge, and these grievances sometimes persist for three or four years?</P>

      <P>I accept that Deputies receive these complaints regularly, but the power is vested in the local planning authority to deal with these matters and to ensure that the conditions laid down in a planning permission are carried out. For instance, in the event of a firm of developers failing to get the amenity area into proper order, the local authority are specifically empowered under the 1976 Act to acquire that area and carry out the work themselves, and of course to charge it to the company.</P>

      <P>The definition of a derelict site under the provisions of the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, is restrictive and if a site does not fall within the definition its acquisition under the Act could not be consented to.  The site in question was inspected on a number of occasions and, on the final inspection in August 1978, it was found that because of the dumping of infill rubble it could no longer be considered derelict.  I therefore could not consent to its compulsory acquisition by the corporation.  I understand that the dumping of rubble carried out on the site did not have planning permission and that action was taken by the planning authority under sections 26 and 27 of the Local Government (Planning <Col N="1451" /> and Development) Act, 1976, with a view to effecting a discontinuance of the work.  Legal proceedings followed and the matter is <i>sub-judice.</i>  An application for planning permission for the retention of the use of the land for infilling has been made and is currently being considered by the planning authority.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the serious sense of grievance felt by many persons at the failure of a local authority to enforce planning laws against a party (details supplied) who has been found by the courts to be in breach of the planning laws; and, having regard to the frequency of such incidents in the area in question, if he will consider introducing legislation to amend the Planning Acts to provide aggrieved parties with simpler, cheaper and more expeditious remedies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the planning authority failed to enforce planning legislation in this case nor, so far as I am aware, has the case come before the courts as a planning <Col N="1453" /> issue.  The change of use of the premises was the subject of a reference under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Pending the decision on the reference, enforcement action was not taken by the planning authority.  An Bord Pleanála decided in October 1978 that the change of use was development within the meaning of the Planning Acts and that it was not exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission. I understand that the planning authority on 2 February this year served a warning notice on the owner requiring that the use be discontinued.</P>
      <P>The powers of planning authorities under the provisions of the 1963 Planning Act in relation to planning control were considerably strengthened in the 1976 Act and I do not consider that further legislation is necessary at this stage.  The legislation, of course, is kept under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The contravention of their development plan is a matter for the planning authority subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976 and I have no function in the matter.  I do not consider that, having regard to the rights to property guaranteed by the Constitution, there is any loophole in the provisions of the Planning Acts in relation to payment of compensation in certain cases where planning permission is refused or granted subject to conditions.  While the provisions of the Acts are kept under review I have no immediate proposals for the amendment of the compensation provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share the concern of Dublin Corporation at the manner in which they were forced to accept this contravention, and will the Minister tell the House whether he is prepared to allow all the owners of private open spaces in the city to turn sports clubs into millionaires' clubs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is no reason to think that this should happen.  In relation to the manner in which the planning authority was forced into it, I only read what was in the paper the same as anybody else.  This provision was made in the 1963 Act and in the 1976 Act it was not considered that there was a loophole in it and I do not accept that there is one.  Any planning authority who receive an application for sports grounds such as the one the Deputy refers to must take other issues into consideration, such as whether services are available for the development.  They could also ensure that some open space is left or that there is provision for a road, if it is needed, in whatever development <Col N="1455" /> takes place.  The planning permission could be restricted to take all these factors into account.  It does not follow that every sporting ground in Dublin will now jump in and receive compensation, having been refused planning permission. Compensation has not been given or refused in this case yet because the decision is being appealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that most of the sports grounds in the city can now be turned into housing estates including Lansdowne Road, Dalymount Park and Croke Park, if the associations who own those grounds see fit to exploit their new riches provided by the loophole in this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If as a result of the decision of the planning committee of Dublin Corporation they decided not to grant planning permission and they were subsequently served with a notice for compensation, would his Department regard such a request for extra funds sympathetically? Part of the difficulty in this regard is that the local authority in this case feel that because their funds are fixed and because they cannot overdraw in any current year, they have no option, because they cannot meet the funds for compensation.  Will the Minister clarify the position of local authorities who given the choice between compensation and planning permission, wish to opt for retaining the use of the open space and pay the costs?  Will the Minister indicate the procedures that could be adopted and how Deputy Mitchell who is a member of such a local authority can proceed to petition the Department for extra funds for which they have not budgeted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  At present Galway County Council have 5 water schemes estimated to cost approximately £2.5 million either in progress or getting to construction.  Despite this level of activity which compares favourably with other areas, I am aware that the council has a large programme of other water schemes in planning which it is anxious to get to construction.  I will take due account of this when their high priority schemes, including those required to facilitate group scheme development, are fully planned and approved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the lack of liaison that exists between Department staff and county council staff in the formulation of group water schemes; and if he is further aware of the need for a central group water scheme office in County Galway, staffed by county council officials and by Department officials, to facilitate the promotion <Col N="1460" /> of group water schemes in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  It is the long-standing policy of my Department to seek the maximum possible involvement and co-operation of county councils in all stages of group water schemes.  It is standard practice for copies of documentation relating to the various phases of such schemes to be sent to the relevant local authorities. Furthermore, regular meetings&mdash;usually once a month&mdash;take place between my Department's local inspectors and Galway County Council's liaison officer for group schemes.  The success of group water schemes in County Galway indicates that my Department and Galway County Council have generally cooperated effectively in assisting and advising groups.  I might add for the Deputy's information that it is hoped to have an early meeting between officials of my Department and the county council to discuss the existing arrangements, and the question of the need, if any, for a central office on the lines suggested may then be raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the amount of good work that has been done in County Galway.  Is the Minister aware that it is necessary to have a central office where the Department and the local authority officials can work so that promoters of water schemes can go there for information? At present they are being sent from Billy to Jack and in many cases find it hard to communicate with those in charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that delay is taking place and I am trying to eliminate it.  In order to do this I have already recruited extra staff.  I have the staff in that particular section, in O'Connell Bridge House, working overtime every evening in order to clear the backlog. The main reason for this backlog and the extraordinary amount of work that has accrued in this section is that in 1977, for instance, the number of applications for reconstruction grants was less than 10,000.  This year, 1978, it reached 37,500.  It must be clearly understood that with this sudden swell we needed more staff and that matter has been and is being dealt with.  Efforts are still going on to ensure that these delays will not continue indefinitely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he proposes to make available to the Dáil details of the report <Col N="1467" /> on youth unemployment among school leavers in Dublin, financed by AnCO and the Department of Labour, and which has been in his Department since last year; and the action he proposes to take arising out of the implications of that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The report referred to in the question &ldquo;A Study of Youth Employment in North Central Dublin&rdquo;, the final draft of which became available in late July 1978 was published on 9 December 1978.  Copies of the report are available on request from the Department and from AnCO.  I have also arranged for copies to be available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>I was, of course, well aware of the youth employment situation in North Central Dublin before the report referred to was prepared.</P>
      <P>Young persons in the area can benefit from the various schemes introduced by the Government, such as the employment incentive scheme, environmental improvement schemes, the community youth training programme and the work experience programme aimed at helping young persons find suitable employment or obtain work experience.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise, however, that the problems being experienced in areas such as Dublin inner city call for special measures and policies which are the concern of a number of Departments and Government agencies.  The Government established a high-level inter-departmental committee in July 1978 to examine the problems of the Dublin inner-city area and to make recommendations on measures necessary to deal with the special problems of the area. Copies of the report referred to in the question were made available to the committee who will also consult with statutory bodies operating in the area such as Dublin City Council and the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The Department of Labour are among the Departments represented on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as my own responsibilities are concerned, AnCO's training centre at Beresford Place is located at the heart of the inner-city area.  AnCO also have <Col N="1468" /> two special training units in operation since Autumn 1977 in Henrietta Street and Eccles Street.  The courses conducted at Beresford Place training centre reflect the job opportunities in the inner-city area, but as the survey points out, many of the young unemployed in the inner-city are not able to avail of the training offered.</P>
    <P>In an effort to redress this trend the council of AnCO have expanded their preparatory training programme to include three 24-place training units which will operate at selected locations in the inner-city area, the first of which will be in operation in May 1979.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service has, during the past year, intensified its efforts locally to provide a special service for inner-city residents.  Two placement officers were assigned full time to the district last year and arrangements are afoot to have an NMS clinic operating in the area itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for making copies of the report available to Members subsequent to the tabling of the question and I wish the measures he has mentioned success.  I should like to know if the Minister studied the tragic statistics of deprivation in the report?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that 96.6 per cent of the young people in the area, employed or unemployed, take home less than £30 per week and that some 55.3 per cent of the men who had no jobs at the time of the compiling of the statistics never had a job?  I should like to know if the Minister, in addition to the measures he has outlined, would be good enough to bring the maximum amount of pressure to bear on the IDA to channel into this area every possible job-creation potential that becomes available over the next few years as a special effort in view of the history of neglect in this part of the city?</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputy for his kind comments. I should like to repeat that I did <Col N="1469" /> not have to wait for the report to realise the serious situation that exists there.  As far as the Department are concerned every step possible will be taken.  I mentioned the increased NMS involvement in the area during the past year and at present two placement officers are working full time in the Dublin No. 1 postal district.  There has been intensive canvassing for vacancies and, as a result, there has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of vacancies notified during 1978 as compared with 1977.  The Deputy can rest assured that as far as my Department are concerned all possible steps will be taken to help the area. The Deputy mentioned the IDA but that is for another Minister.  I shall pass the Deputy's comments on to that Minister.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that that report was commissioned during the term of office of the last Government and was directed to get us relevant information on how to deal with the problems of this area, neglected, as Deputy Keating said, for many years? Would the Minister agree that the moral of the report appears to be that short-term job proposals for the area are inadequate and that what is needed is a direction of industry into the area to match with the training centre which was placed there under the last administration? That would ensure that the area at least shared in some of the job expansion taking place.</P>

The report, for some reason, had been allowed to die prior to my taking office.  I should like to tell the Deputy that of the increased vacancies most of them were found to be in the services sector which indicates the inadequacy of manufacturing industry there.  I am fully aware of that fact.  In July 1978 a high level inter-departmental committee were set up and my Department are involved, as are the other economic Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question refers to a speech by the Taoiseach on 21 January 1979.  On that occasion he indicated that one element in a suggested five-year national effort to achieve full employment would be that the manner in which workers would become more involved in the affairs of their firms, as well as the respective roles of public and private involvement in the economy, would need to be the subject of greater understanding and agreement.</P>
      <P>As part of their published policy, the Government are committed to involving employees in company affairs through the promotion of meaningful worker participation in management decisions affecting their working lives.  Towards that end, I have been actively engaged in implementing the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  To date, elections have been concluded in three of the seven State bodies concerned and elections are in progress in two others; elections in the remaining two companies will be held when consultations have been completed.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to encourage the greater involvement of workers in decision-making below board level and towards that end I propose to have a discussion document published early this year, setting out alternative approaches and possible policy options at all levels of decision-making in the enterprise.  I am also considering various initiatives in the area of work organisation.</P>

      <P>Surely it does not accord with the Minister's ambition to rest on the laurels of a previous administration in referring to the Worker Participation Act?  It is almost two years since the Minister took office and he was very vocal in opposition on the advantages of worker participation.

With regard to the second part of his question the discussion document which I said I hoped would be available this year will be a comprehensive document covering the private sector and would be for discussion between all interested parties, hopefully involving them in consultations with a view to how various forms and aspects of worker participation, work councils and work organisations can be considered for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. FitzPatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. FitzPatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, (<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take these three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>I want to say first that I find it most regrettable indeed that industry and the public should have to face the damaging consequences of a strike in an essential public service.  The action is being taken in support of claims for pay increases ranging from 31 per cent to 51 per cent which were being negotiated under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration to which the union concerned is a party and was taken at a time when conciliation discussion had not concluded.  It was open to the union at any time if they were dissatisfied with progress in the negotiations or with the Department's response to their claims to refer the claims to independent arbitration. The union by taking industrial action are contravening these procedures which have been agreed with all the unions in the civil service for dealing with claims of this kind and are also in breach of the Employer-Trade Union National Agreement, 1978.</P>
      <P>The claims are for increases over and above the basic increases provided for in the national agreement and are proper to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.  The basis stated for the claims is that the pay rates of the grades concerned have fallen behind the rates payable in comparable outside employments and do not adequately reflect the duties and responsibilities of the grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> The Department have no wish to underpay their staff and have in fact made substantial offers on the claims but, equally, they must be satisfied on the evidence adduced that pay increases granted are properly supported.  To proceed otherwise would impose unjustified costs on post office users who have to pay for the services and would also be a recipe for general inflation. However, the essential point is that the Department are quite prepared to continue negotiations under agreed procedures at conciliation or, if the union wishes that the issue should be assessed by the independent arbitrator, to accept that assessment.  It is difficult to understand why, if the union are convinced that theirs rather than the Department's assessment of the claims is the right one, they should not agree to refer the issue to independent and impartial arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot condone a breach of the provisions in the national agreement which bind both parties to the maintenance of industrial peace and to the observance of the agreed conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister are most anxious that the pay claims should be settled on an equitable basis but a settlement must be one which is fair to both the staff and the users of the Department's services and also consistent with the Department's position as a supplier of public services to the community.  It has to be one which will ensure the continued use of orderly means of resolving pay claims in the civil service.  A settlement on any other basis would have the most serious consequences and would clearly not be in the interests of the public or, indeed, of the staff.</P>
    <P>I have appealed to the union and the staff to cease their action and pursue their claims in accordance with the procedures which they have agreed should be used for resolving issues of this kind and which are still available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I welcome these amendments. The effect of the two amendments is to increase the penalty of £500 or 12 months' imprisonment or both for offences set out in section 3 of the Bill. These offences are the refusal of a witness to attend or the refusal of that witness to give evidence or the obstruction by that witness or other matters. The maximum penalty provided for that in the Bill as introduced was £500 or 12 months' imprisonment.  The proposal in the amendment is to make it an indictable offence and to increase the maximum penalty to £10,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.  The amendment also changes completely the procedure in regard to the summary offence and writes into the Bill very necessary safeguards in regard to summary offences.</P>
      <P>These amendments represent a triumph for Committee procedure in this House.  They also show how dangerous it is to rush legislation through this House without adequate discussion. When the Bill was introduced it was proposed to have all Stages on the same day.  At the risk of being misrepresented, this side of the House insisted that the Committee Stage debate be held on the following day and we had a very good discussion which resulted in these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It follows from these amendments that whatever Government may be in power should amend the law immediately it appears to be defective and in this regard the law appeared to be defective in 1970.  It is wrong that the law should be left in a defective condition for a long time and not amended until some very emotive incident occurs, such as the disaster in Bantry which has given rise to this amending legislation.  In such an event the Government should not come into the House with amendments to <Col N="1502" /> legislation and seek the passage through the House as a matter of urgency, putting the Opposition&mdash;the watchdogs of the Constitution and of democracy&mdash;in such a position that if they resist they will be told they are striking the Government of the day with the child in their arms, so to speak.  That is a legitimate attitude in regard to these amendments.</P>
    <P>I accept the amendments.  They are necessary and the Bill as introduced would have been very defective without them.  Deputy O'Keeffe, the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, raised the point that the penalties provided in the Bill as introduced were very inadequate.  He pointed out that a fine of £500 or 12 months' imprisonment might very well mean nothing, having regard to the amount of money and the type of person who might be involved in the inquiry. We also pointed out that to have effective penalties the offences would require to be made indictable offences.</P>
    <P>I am glad that amendment No. 2 does exactly what we suggested.  It increases the penalty to £10,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.  My only doubt is whether this is sufficiently high.  I express that doubt because endless millions are involved in the subject-matter of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is very inadvisable to introduce legislation at a time when it is necessary to deal with a specific matter, although it is amending the law in general.  We cannot divorce from our minds the fact that this legislation will be used to deal with a variety of inquiries which may be held long after we have gone, either from this House or permanently.  The Bill will deal in the first place with the disaster in Bantry and my only doubt is whether the penalties are sufficient to deal with the type of obstruction or offence or refusal to give evidence that might be involved. It is a substantial improvement on the penalties provided in the other Bill.  Certainly there will be no question of their being unconstitutional because the offence is made an indictable offence and the large penalties of £10,000 or two years imprisonment can be imposed only on conviction on indictment in one of the superior courts.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision in the Bill as <Col N="1503" /> introduced, which provided that on summary conviction a person could be fined £500 or imprisoned for 12 months, there is a genuine doubt in my mind and in the minds of many other lawyers as to whether the 12 months would stand up if tested in the High Court.  A penalty of 12 months imprisonment might very well remove the offence from the category of minor offences being fit to be tried summarily. At any rate a vast improvement has been effected in the drafting of the section dealing with a summary offence. The section, as drafted originally, merely said that the person shall be guilty of an offence who does a number of things and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.  The amendment in relation to the summary offence, that is an offence that may be tried in a district court says:</P>
    <P>A justice of the District Court shall have jurisdiction to try summarily an offence under this section if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the justice is of opinion that the facts proved or alleged against a defendant charged with such an offence constitute a minor offence fit to be tried summarily,...</P>
    <P>That is a vast improvement and did not appear in the Bill as drafted originally. Obviously now the District Justice will be able to have a look at and take into consideration the entire circumstances of the offence.  He will be entitled to take into account the amount of damage that has been done, the terrible loss of life suffered and the general gravity of the matter being inquired into.  The amendment goes on to say:</P>
    <P>(ii) the Director of Public Prosecutions consents, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the defendant (on being informed by the justice of his right to be tried by a jury) does not object to being tried summarily,</P>
    <P>and, upon conviction under this paragraph, the said defendant shall be <Col N="1504" /> liable to a fine not exceeding £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>That constitutes a vast improvement on the previous subsection which was apparently hurriedly drafted and rushed into this House.  I am satisfied that the larger penalties which may be imposed on indictment are waterproof, bullet-proof and will stand up to the Constitution in every way.  The summary provisions of the section dealing with the offence have been improved enormously because the justice must be satisfied now&mdash;and it is written in in black and white&mdash;that it is a minor offence fit to be tried summarily; the accused must have the option, and be given that option, of being tried by a judge and jury if he wants to be so tried.  It is only when he consents to and accepts the jurisdiction of the minor court that he can be dealt with there.  That is adequate also.  A very good day's work was done in the drafting of this amendment.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to spell out what exactly subparagraph (c) of amendment No. 2 means when it says:</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, shall apply in relation to an offence under this section....</P>
    <P>The only regret I have is that the Minister did not accept my suggestions in regard to another section of the Bill which enables the tribunal to award costs because in my opinion that was not constitutional.  In my opinion the tribunal, in awarding costs, will be administering justice and will be in violation of the relevant Article of the Constitution, and that it will not be saved by Article 37 of the Constitution which says that it is only a limited exercise of judicial function.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcome this amendment.  On Second Stage debate I raised the whole question of the effective deterrent value of a fine of £500.  At that time the Minister conceded that it was an area in respect of which the fine was miserable.  I am glad <Col N="1505" /> to see that the Seanad have come up with this amendment and, as far as my party are concerned, we accept it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to enable the public inquiry get off the ground.  I should like to see this Bill go through today so that the terms of reference of the inquiry can be published without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The first amendment, as I said prematurely, is purely of a drafting nature.  Section 3 of the Bill, as passed by this House, proposed to substitute one subsection only for the existing subsection (2) of section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 inserts two subsections. Consequently the word &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; in line 22 of the Bill has to be changed to the plural, &ldquo;subsections&rdquo;. The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to provide stiffer penalties for offences under section 3 of the Bill.  Section 3 substitutes a new subsection for subsection (2) of section 1 of the 1921 Act.  It creates a number of offences, such as, for example, disobeying a summons of a tribunal to attend as a witness, and prescribes certain penalties for such offences. The Bill, as passed by this House, proposed to make the offences in question minor offences to be tried only in a summary manner, that is to say, by the District Court, with penalties restricted to a maximum fine of £500 or 12 months imprisonment or both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to all parties in respect of the amendments which Deputy Fitzpatrick described as a triumph for the Committee procedure in this House.  I endorse that sentiment. There is no gainsaying that at no time did the Minister for Justice, when introducing the Bill originally in this House, want to rush it through without discussion; quite the contrary.  We wanted to have the matter discussed in a cool and proper fashion.  When he requested me to deal with the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill in the Seanad, in the interim between its passage here in the Dáil and its going to the Seanad the Minister gave this a lot of thought arising out of the contributions made by Deputies Fitzpatrick, <Col N="1506" /> O'Keeffe and Kelly and members of the Labour Party.  As a direct result of those observations and the observations he himself made on the matter we now have the two amendments before the House which the House finds acceptable.  This is altogether a very happy state of legislative affairs.</P>
    <P>The second point that Deputy Fitzpatrick raised was the question of the £10,000 fine on indictment.  He felt that that was still not enough.  I take the view that the two years imprisonment is quite a substantial deterrent on its own.  I agree that in the circumstances we could be dealing with a large oil company whose wealth is limitless to the last gallon of oil that they have in the ground. Here we have a situation where we have individuals, coming before a tribunal in this instance who may never have been before a court, in awe of a situation because they have never come before the full trappings of a court and so on.  It will be found that they are responsible individuals who have not had this experience before.  Apart altogether from the financial deterrent the two years imprisonment is more than adequate if the matter becomes an indictable charge.</P>
    <P>The other point Deputy Fitzpatrick mentions is in relation to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  There is provision in the amendment, in paragraph (c) of the new subsection (2A), for the application of section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  My information is&mdash;and this is an ascertainable fact&mdash;that this is to cater for the summary trial of an accused person who pleads guilty in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to thank the members of the Fine Gael Party and the members of the Labour Party who contributed to the debate on this Bill and endeavoured to make it a better Bill by virtue of their contributions.  It has undoubtedly been to the credit of the House that we can discharge our duties in the manner in which they have been discharged.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick's point that may be in the final analysis this problem should have been dealt with a long time ago and rather than having to come here with a Bill arising out of the dreadful tragedy that <Col N="1507" /> did occur in Whiddy we should have had the legal apparatus there beforehand. But it is a matter of fact that since 1970&mdash;if we are to go into the business of apportioning blame and this debate has been conducted in a very civilised fashion and it is not my function to do so&mdash;there have been a number of Governments.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank both Houses for their co-operation in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make more effective provision for the development in the national interest of the mineral resources of the State.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the Bill provides for:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the vesting in the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of the exclusive right of working minerals,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the granting by the Minister of a lease or licence to any person giving that person the exclusive right to work minerals in respect of which rights are vested in the Minister,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the payment of compensation to persons entitled to any estate or interest in the minerals the mining rights of which are vested in the Minister and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the making of certain amendments to <Col N="1509" /> the Minerals Development Act, 1940 which experience has shown to be desirable as well as a number of repeals in consequence of proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Rights to work mines and minerals being lawfully worked or being planned for working at the date of the initiation of the Bill in the Dáil, that is, 15 December 1978, are specifically excepted from vesting in the Minister on the passing of the Act.  Other exclusions from the scope of the Bill are stone, gravel, sand or clay, and petroleum as defined in the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Basically, the reason for this Bill is that the provisions in the Minerals Development Act, 1940 for the compulsory acquisition of unworked privately-owned minerals are of uncertain legal validity and can no longer be operated with safety.  The House is generally aware of the background to this circumstance.  Briefly, what happened was that in 1970 the discovery of a significant lead/zinc deposit in a prospecting licence area at Nevinstown, County Meath, was announced.  Subsequently, detailed investigations showed that the deposit extended to other townlands and as ownership of the minerals in the area was mixed, including those at Nevinstown which were privately-owned, the then Minister made a Minerals Acquisition Order on 15 March 1971 covering all unworked minerals except, of course, State minerals in the area concerned.  Some few days after the making of the order a third party effected purchase of the surface lands and mineral rights of a farm at Nevinstown within the area of the then known deposit and challenged in the High Court the validity of the acquisition order and the constitutionality of the 1940 Act.</P>
    <P>In a reserved judgement delivered in April 1973 the President of the High Court held that the order was invalid. The then Minister, my immediate predecessor, appealed the High Court's decision but the Supreme Court in a reserved judgement delivered in March 1974 upheld the decision of the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> The grounds in both cases were that the order did not specify with reasonable particularity the nature, situation and extent of the minerals being acquired, which the court held was required under section 14 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940 under which the order was made.  In the circumstances, the court found it unnecessary to rule on other grounds on which the acquisition order had been challenged including whether in section 14&mdash;which makes no reference to the giving of prior notice by the Minister&mdash;there is an implied obligation arising from the requirements of natural justice that such notice be given, the constitutionality of the acquisition provisions under that section and of the provisions for compensation.</P>
    <P>Subsequent advice by counsel, however, was to the effect that the acquisition provisions of section 14 of the 1940 Act, if applied in future, would almost certainly be challenged on grounds of validity and again raise the question of the constitutional validity of the Act.  Accordingly, it is now the position that there are no effective means readily available to secure the development of unworked minerals in private ownership in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>It is desirable in the national interest to ensure that companies doing exploration work here should have reasonable assurance that, if they discover a deposit and produce development plans which are acceptable to the State and other appropriate authorities, they will not be prevented from proceeding with those plans because of legal problems on the ownership issue.  It will be appreciated that any effective remedy to the existing situation must of necessity affect the rights of ownership of property.  It has been necessary to seek an equitable and acceptable way of dealing with this difficult problem and for that reason the Bill has not been an easy one to prepare.</P>
    <P>The Constitution acknowledges the right to private ownership and prohibits any law attempting to abolish this right. It also provides that the exercise of this right ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice and that the State may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of these rights with a <Col N="1511" /> view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>Thus, the solution proposed in the Bill is to vest the exclusive right of working minerals in the Minister.  I am satisfied that the vesting proposal comes within what might be called the Constitutional dispensation to which I have referred and from the economic and practical point of view the exigencies of the common good require, or at least justify, control by the State of all unworked minerals in the State in the manner provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The memorandum circulated with the Bills explains its purpose and that of the various provisions.  Accordingly, in dealing with it now I intend to concentrate only on the principal features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with matters of a preliminary and general nature.  The Bill, when enacted, will be construed with the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 and 1960, which constitute our basic mining laws.  Section 4 provides for a change in the composition of the Mining Board by requiring that henceforth both ordinary members shall be property arbitrators.  Under the existing legislation one of the ordinary members is an officer of the Minister.  In view of the changes being made by the Bill, and in particular changes in the role of the board, it is important that the board should be seen to be an independent body.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the interest of persons under disability or unascertained will be represented in proceedings before the Mining Board or the court.  In the context of the problems associated with the determination of title to minerals ownership and of tracing owners a provision of this nature is seen as highly desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the appointment of assessors to assist the court in any proceedings under the Bill.  This will enable the court to have technical advice readily available to it throughout the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for repeals.  The repeal of section 70 of the 1940 Act ensures that an aggrieved party will have a right of appeal to the High Court on a question of fact as well as of law.  In the <Col N="1512" /> main, the other repeals listed in the Schedule to the Bill are as a consequence of proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains provisions for the vesting of the exclusive right of working minerals in the Minister, subject to a number of exceptions under section 13 which I detailed at the outset, namely, minerals being lawfully worked or where they are planned for working on the date of the initiation of the Bill in Dáil Éireann, which was 15 December 1978.  The Bill specifies the process by which exceptions on these grounds can be formally registered with the Mining Board.  Other exclusions from the scope of the Bill are stone, gravel, sand or clay, and petroleum as defined in the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Section 15 empowers the Minister to apply to the Mining Board to have the registration of minerals as excepted minerals cancelled where it appears to him that they are not being worked. Again, as in the case of section 14, the ultimate jurisdiction of the superior courts is preserved and there is provision for the serving of notice by the Mining Board on such persons as may appear to the board to have an interest in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 16 empowers the Minister to grant a licence to any person to work State minerals, which by definition include exclusive mining rights vested in the Minister under the Bill.  The Minister already has the power to grant a lease in respect of State minerals under Part IV of the 1940 Act.  Subsection (2) of the section is a drafting clarification of the term &ldquo;demise&rdquo;.  Part IV of the 1940 Act refers to a demise of State minerals.  The term &ldquo;State minerals&rdquo; includes, as I have already said, exclusive mining rights over minerals as well as minerals in full State ownership.  The purpose of the subsection is to make it abundantly clear that a &ldquo;demise&rdquo; of minerals includes the grant by lease of a mining right and to remove any verbal ambiguity.  In future cases, therefore, the Minister will have power to grant either a lease or a licence to enable minerals to be worked, depending on whatever instrument is most appropriate to the particular case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> It is also provided in this section that the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may take a participating interest in the working of the minerals and that he may so provide in the conditions attaching to a lease or licence.  This is an enabling provision designed to ensure that the Minister would be in a position to specify State participation as a condition of a lease or licence.  It is not necessary, nor do I think it is desirable, to attempt to formulate the precise policy lines which would apply to State participation.  The State has the duty, in the national interest to ensure that a reasonable and equitable share of the profits from the development of a deposit accrues to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the State must, again in the national interest, have the power to ensure that the development plans are drawn up and implemented in an optimum way.  The extent, if any, to which participation by the State may be desirable for the purpose of achieving one or both of these objectives cannot be determined on a theoretical basis but on the basis of the circumstances peculiar to each individual deposit of minerals.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the giving of prior notice by the Minister where he proposes to work minerals or to grant, or give an undertaking to grant, a lease or licence to work them.  It is also provided in this section that, as far as practicable, individual notice would be given to persons who appear to the Minister to have an estate or interest in the minerals and that such persons will be given a reasonable opportunity of making representations to the Minister in the matter.  Similarly, it is provided that the Minister may refer the representations to the Mining Board and, indeed, must do so where the person making the representations so requires by application to the Minister.  The board's consideration of the representations will take the form of an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the publication of a notice by the Minister where he commences to work or grants a lease or a licence to work any minerals which are State minerals by virtue of this Bill.  The object is to alert those entitled to any estate or interest in the minerals to these <Col N="1514" /> facts.  Compensation claims will be indicative of title and at this point the pattern of ownership will begin to emerge. As in the case of notices under section 17, there is also provision here for individual notices to persons who have claimed to be entitled to any estate or interest in the minerals.</P>
    <P>Part III deals exclusively with the arrangements for compensating those with title to minerals the mining rights of which are vested in the Minister under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 establishes the right to compensation of every person with title to the minerals immediately preceding the date of the enactment of the Bill.  It is envisaged that the compensation will, in the normal way, be related to the commercial potential of the minerals, and will accrue as and when the minerals are being developed.</P>
    <P>Section 20 states that compensation will be paid by the Minister.  This is in line with the position in the 1940 Act relating to compensation for State acquired minerals.  There will be no change in the existing procedure whereby the Minister will recoup compensation payments from the lessee of the minerals.</P>
    <P>It is provided in section 21 that in default of agreement any question arising as to the entitlement of any person to compensation or as to the amount will be settled by the Mining Board.  It is also provided in this section that where the Minister, or the claimant for compensation, is dissatisfied with the board's findings there will be a right to apply to the court to settle the matter.  There is also provision for the revision of an award in the event of a change in circumstances not foreseen at the time of the original award.  I think the reasons for this provision are obvious and further elaboration is hardly necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 22 states the basis for the assessment of compensation, which is to be fair and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Though the section does not place any restriction on the form the compensation should take, it indicates however what would be the usual basis of a compensation award of this kind, namely, that it would be based on such proportion of the net profits arising in consequence of <Col N="1515" /> the working of the minerals as is attributable to the minerals as they existed in their natural condition prior to such working.</P>
    <P>Essentially, this would take account of the pre-extraction value of the minerals in terms of their contribution to the mining operation.  It is further provided that where it appears to the Mining Board or the court that compensation in the form of periodical payments would not of itself be appropriate, then the board or the court may, in their discretion, award compensation in the form of a lump sum payment or partly in that form and partly in the form of periodical payments.</P>
    <P>The scheme of compensation has had to be designed to ensure, on the one hand, that awards will not be such as to frustrate economic mining and, on the other hand, that the owner will receive reasonable and equitable compensation for his minerals.  I am satisfied that the proposals in the Bill make adequate provision for the achievement of these very essential objectives.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals in this Bill will substantially eliminate the difficulties which have arisen with regard to minerals development.  It should enable the State and the mining companies to deal with this in a practical way and in a manner which is equitable for people who have clear title to mineral rights. However, technically, it will not settle the rather complicated position of ownership of mineral rights.  As Deputies will be aware, the legal position is that some mineral rights are clearly owned by the State, some can be legally established as in private ownership, and there is a grey area where ownership cannot be established in a definitive way.</P>
    <P>In an earlier draft of the Bill I had set out to secure clarification of this position by a process of compulsory registration of title.  The scheme I had in mind was that the area of a minerals deposit would be designated as one in respect of which the mineral rights would have to be registered.  Persons claiming to own mineral rights in the area would be given a period of time within which to secure registration of their title and an appeals <Col N="1516" /> procedure was provided for.  These proposals envisaged that, when the period for registration had expired and subject to the results of any consequential appeals, all minerals in the area which had not been registered as privately-owned minerals would automatically become the property of the State.  These proposals were considered by a number of legal experts and the consensus of their opinions was that such a scheme would present very considerable difficulties.  It became clear that if it were to incorporate the safeguards necessary to overcome these difficulties then the improvement on the existing situation would, if any, be marginal.</P>
    <P>I must, of course, accept the views of these legal experts and, for that reason, I decided not to include anything in the Bill dealing with this particular matter.  I should, however, say that I have not abandoned the idea that some further improvement in this direction may be possible and I intend to have the position considered.  While the proposals which I had in mind, or some modification of them, would be a desirable supplement to the provisions of the existing Bill, they are not by any means as important to a resolution of the existing problems as are the provisions of the Bill.  For that reason I felt it was desirable to press ahead with the Bill as now drafted because I am satisfied that it will provide substantial resolution of the difficulties which have existed since the court proceedings to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, therefore, an important measure.  It is largely also a technical measure and it does not provide for, or envisage, any major departure from the existing policy in promotion of minerals exploration and development.  It will continue to be my policy to encourage the widest possible spread of exploration by mining interests and to create a climate where there can be confidence in the future of mining in this country.  The provisions of the Bill are important in this respect.</P>
    <P>There have been calls from certain quarters that the State should adopt a more active role in minerals exploration and development.  It is legitimate to express such views, but the proposition needs to be critically considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> Although I have not reached firm conclusions on this issue, I believe that such a critical examination might identify an appropriate role for the State in this area.  In so far as exploration is concerned, there is, for obvious reasons, a substantial identity of interests between the State and private mining interests. Though this identity of interests is very substantial it is not total and, for this reason, I would not, at least without considerable further examination, rule out the possibility that the State would have a role in relation to exploration.  I would not at this stage rule out the possibility of involvement by a State body at the development stage also but, here again, I am satisfied that this possibility needs a good deal of further study.</P>
    <P>These ideas are at present at a somewhat embryonic stage, because I attached first priority to preparation of the measures contained in the present Bill.  I mention the question of a possible State role because, whatever views one may take about it, I think most of us would agree that it would be unrealistic, and in my view undesirable, to link the problems which this Bill seeks to resolve with ideas about the role of the State in the minerals sector.  I might add that the resolution of the ownership problem is important no matter what role is adopted by the State in exploring for and developing mineral resources.  It is important not only in the overall national interest but also in the interest of individual owners of minerals since the very existence of these minerals may never come to the light of day unless a suitable regime for the carrying out of exploration work can be established.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House as a measure to substantially resolve the difficulties which have arisen in relation to minerals ownership and to act as an incentive towards continuing and committed involvement by mining interests in exploration and development of our mineral resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The party for which I am speaking would agree very willingly with the Minister that the general objective of this Bill is very desirable.  We would agree with him also that the exigencies of the common good must require that the <Col N="1518" /> situation of ownership in regard to minerals be clarified because otherwise the exploration of these minerals and all the national advantages of such exploitation cannot be availed of.  Therefore, there is not any issue arising between us on the general objective of the Bill and on the considerations that have inspired it.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister has built into the Long Title expressions which come from that Article of the Constitution which permits the State to delimit in order to reconcile the rights of such property with the exigencies of the common good.  I agree that this is a matter which requires some regulation by the State.  It is very important that it be wholly within the terms of Article 43, but merely to recite in the Long Title that this is the purpose of the Bill is not ensuring that a court will come to the same conclusion later.  A court may perhaps look at the Long Title but may not necessarily be governed by what the Oireachtas expresses itself as doing.  The court will consider the substance of what is being done.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill and the problems behind it are ones with which this party have every sympathy.  We will not oppose the Bill and we wish it every success.  However, since the matter is so difficult legally it might be wise for me to express some reservations I have as to whether the Minister is proceeding in the right way.  It is not my wish to raise any form of alarm about the Bill; what I intend saying will be something in the nature of submissions by counsel in an Article 26 reference.  In other words, I am trying to put to the Minister the considerations that he may be faced with later in litigation.  It is well to make the remarks at this stage so that the Minister may think about them during the remaining Stages of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem the Minister is trying to resolve arises from two factors, both of which are related.  One of these is the very uncertain ownership situation to which the Minister referred in his speech and which is complicated by the impossibility very often of discovering who is the person to whom mineral rights in respect of a particular piece of land belong, that is, if such rights exist.  In <Col N="1519" /> other words, the uncertainty is at two levels.  Even if the same piece of land has been in single ownership it may be uncertain whether the title includes rights to minerals.  In addition, where the title to the land and the potential title to the minerals rest in two different people it may be impossible to discover who is the person with the potential mineral rights. That person may have gone to Australia or, as is likely, he may be dead and his representatives may be undiscoverable. Consequently, as the Minister says, the situation is very difficult and uncertain. An easy way out, and this is the second consideration, is to employ modes of compulsory acquisition, to employ a compulsory acquisition technique.  That would resolve the problem regardless of who was the owner because if the land is vested in the Minister the question of original entitlement arises only in a secondary way.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessors operated for a long time by means of compulsory acquisition in accordance with the 1940 Act but in the early part of this decade they were confronted with a challenge that was partly constitutional and was partly based on ordinary administrative principles.  That challenge had the effect of invalidating a series of compulsory acquisition orders that had been made in respect of land at Navan.</P>
    <P>Though the Minister opposite is not responsible for this feature, I trust he will take this opportunity of impressing on his colleague, the Minister for Justice, that the decision in the cases of <i>Randles</i> and <i>Roche v. the Minister for Industry and Commerce</i> will be three years old next month but is not yet in print in the Irish Reports.  The other day I had to mention in connection with the <i>McL. v. an Bord Uchtála</i> case that that case is not yet in the Irish Reports.  It is fantastic that a State like ours, which diligently and sedulously reports within a week the most vapid vapouring of a Deputy of this House, be it the Minister, Deputy Desmond, myself or any other, whereby unconsidered trifles are diligently written down, set in type and distributed to the world within seven <Col N="1520" /> days, the considered judgment of the Supreme Court in a matter that is so important that it could cause a constitutional amendment, as was the case seven days ago in this House, or a Bill to regulate minerals ownership is not in print three years later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, five years ago. The McL case is three years old.  It must be humiliating for the Minister and his Department that, when mining experts who come from far fields are given a brief, brochure or nosegay of documents relating to the problems they will find, it will contain two photocopies of photocopies of photocopies of judgements, now five years old, barely legible in places. From my experience that is the form these things take.  It is a shameful situation. It should not be above the resources even of a relatively poor State like ours to put real money into law reporting so that people will know what the law is.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in the House last week, in relation to a constitutional amendment the necessity for which was thought to arise from implications or hints that were dropped in the case of <i>McL v. An Bord Uchtála</i>, that that case, even in the form of a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy, was not available in the House or in the Library.  I had to ask the Library to get it from the State Solicitor's office, although the House was solemnly in conclave debating, not an ordinary Bill but a constitutional amendment to put right matters, because the McL judgement had shown it to be potentially fragile for constitutional reasons.  I am sure the Minister will take that point.  It is funny that it should arise so conspicuously twice within a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been open to the Minister, in trying to resolve the difficulties which arose from the <i>Roche</i> judgments, coupled with the difficulties in regard to uncertainty of title, to go in for wholesale acquisition and vesting of a kind comparable with the vesting which the Land Acts effected.  He would, of course, have then been up against the <Col N="1521" /> possible problem of justifying the wholesale takeover of whatever minerals were in the State that were not owned by the State.  He might have been called upon to justify that measure on constitutional grounds before the courts.</P>
    <P>I understand the uncertainty with which his legal advisers were faced.  If one compares the Fundamental Rights Articles in the Constitution with the continents known in the nineteenth century, just as Africa was then the dark continent, it can fairly be said that Article 43 is the dark article in the Constitution. Nobody knows quite what it means.  It has never been explored.  Phrases from it are copied straight out of papal encyclicals of Pius XI; yet one constitutional expert from another country has said that it resembles provisions in the Constitution of Yugoslavia.  We do not know what it means.  We do not know whether it is entrenching private property on the one hand, or giving a <i>carte blanche</i> to the State on the other. Either meaning can be extracted from the very de Valera-esque formulations which its four sections contain.  Perhaps it was intended to be so.  It would not surprise me.</P>
    <P>The situation is that, although there have been half a dozen cases since 1937 in which Article 43 was material, no counsel in the State could tell the Minister where he stands in regard to compulsory acquisition.  There have been dicta to the effect that there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent the divestment of a piece of individual property.  I cannot believe that the Constitution would be interpreted as forbidding such a thing.  It is thin, unexplored ice and the Minister could give himself a lot of trouble and cause a lot of holdups to economic and mining development if he was to produce a Bill which, when enacted, was shot down.  He could cause himself and others severe financial loss and delay.  It is uncertain what would happen, but it is conceivable that a wholesale acquisition of mining rights by the State, which is not what the Minister is aiming at, might be constitutionally insecure. The Minister may have been wise to keep away from it.</P>
    <P>When this Article comes to be construed more closely the courts may say: <Col N="1522" />&ldquo;(1)  We do not accept that the Oireachtas should be the sole judge of the common good.  We believe that the courts must have some role in saying what the common good requires.  (2) That role, while it must allow a freeranging discretion to the Oireachtas, should be discharged by means of simple criteria.  (3) One such criterion is that we should be allowed to ask has the State, in delimiting private property rights so as to reconcile them with the exigencies of the common good, done more than was necessary?  Has it used too drastic a weapon to achieve this reconciliation? Would something less have sufficed to save the common good and still rescue something of private property rights?&rdquo; These would be working criteria and would not be too far away from the criteria the courts apply in other settings.</P>
    <P>I do not know if anybody has anticipated me in this by way of a written opinion to the Minister, but it is perfectly conceivable that the High Court or the Supreme Court might, in years to come, when considering under Article 43 the constitutionality of an acquisition measure such as a measure to acquire mining rights, approach it along these lines: &ldquo;Is this measure absolutely necessary in its full extent or would something a little more modest have done?  If so, the measure is <i>ultra vires</i> the Oireachtas because it goes beyond what the Constitution permits the Oireachtas to do.  If, on the other hand, the Oireachtas has reasonable grounds for thinking that nothing less than this measure would serve the common good, then we will let it go.  If it is clear that something less would have done and that something might have been rescued for the sphere of private property rights, then we will invalidate the Act.&rdquo;  That is not an impossible line that the courts might adopt.</P>
    <P>Instead of an outright system of acquisition in which the minerals as such would have vested in the Minister, he has chosen the route of vesting in himself the right to &ldquo;work&rdquo; the minerals. The definition section states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;working&rdquo; in relation to minerals, includes digging, searching for, mining, getting, raising, taking, carrying away, treating and converting such <Col N="1523" /> minerals and the sale or other disposal of such minerals and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>I realise that the object of the Minister's advisers is to leave him with an Act which will not exhibit him as expropriating anybody.  He is only giving himself a right to do something, stopping short of total expropriation.  But if one subtracts from the full right of owning minerals the right of working them, as defined in the Bill, what is left?  Is anything left?  Minerals are not something which any other material or immaterial good can be extracted from unless they are worked.  One cannot enjoy the view of minerals.  They do not provide any amenity in life except for what can be got out of the working of them.</P>
    <P>Although I sympathise with the Minister's anxiety to stop short of expropriation I do not think he has succeeded in doing so.  If it had been some other form of property and he was giving himself an exclusive right in regard to some function of that property that might be visibly less than expropriation but where the right he is giving himself is the right to get the stuff and to sell it, or to dispose of it in some other way that may suit him, what is left of the right of the man sitting on top of the land?  What is left of the right of the man who, nominally, is the owner?  Has he any right in regard to the minerals, except the right to be compensated, and would he not have had that same right if the Minister had produced a complete system of acquisition?  I hope I am getting this point across.  Once the Minister gives himself this right, I do not see that anything palpable is left under this Bill other than the right to compensation, and that is a right that the owner, in the ordinary course of events, would have been given even if the Bill proposed to vest in the Minister not only the right to work the minerals but the actual ownership of the minerals.</P>
    <P>After all, what is ownership?  Essentially, it is the right to use the object in any way one likes.  There are many objects that one can use in a variety of ways and the State may be interested only in one or two of them.  For instance, <Col N="1524" /> the State is not interested whether I use my car exclusively for my holidays or for business or even if I leave it in my yard and put chickens in it.  The State is only interested in a limited number of things: for instance, that I insure myself if I drive the car, that I pay a registration fee and also that I obey certain traffic regulations.  Otherwise I can do as I like with the car.  I can strip it down and rebuild it twice a day for all the State cares.  In other words, there are dimensions to my ownership of a motor car with which the State does not purport to interfere or control.  I am not saying this in a hostile or contentious spirit, but I should like to know what is left of the dimensions of ownership in minerals once the Minister has given himself this right to work them, as understood in the definitions sections.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong about this, and I should be glad to know the views of the Minister; but if he is aiming at a Bill that will not amount to expropriation or transferring ownership to himself, I do not think this Bill has succeeded in that object.  The exclusive right of working minerals as defined in the Bill represents an intrusion on private property rights just as severe as a total acquisition of the property.</P>
    <P>There are a few subordinate objections to the provisions in the Bill. Perhaps they do not go to the heart of the Bill but nevertheless I should like to mention them at this stage.  It appears to me that the notices mentioned in sections 17 and 18 do not go far enough.  I know the argument that if you fall over backwards and do too much in regard to giving notice or precautions of this kind the Bill may be worthless, or to use the Minister's own words, &ldquo;the Bill might be only a marginal improvement&rdquo;. However, I do not think the question of notice is treated adequately in sections 17 and 18.  We must not forget that here the Minister is proposing to work minerals that are State minerals or to give an undertaking under section 13 of the 1940 Act to work any such minerals or to grant any such lease or licence, otherwise than in pursuance of such an undertaking.  It is also proposed that the Minister shall publish in two successive weeks in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least one <Col N="1525" /> national daily paper notices that will put on their guard people who may be affected.</P>
    <P>So far as the Minister is aiming to give notice that will amount to a respect for constitutional or natural justice, we can rule out <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> straightaway.  That will not satisfy any requirement of natural or constitutional justice.  There is an authority for this in a case decided by the old Supreme Court in 1935.  It is the case of the <i>Estate of the Earl of Mountcharles; Minister for Industry and Commerce v. Sweeney</i>, 1935.  <i>Irish Reports</i>, page 163.  Oddly enough, this case also arose out of a Minerals Development Act.  It was one where the Land Commission were permitted by an Act to make rules in regard to their own proceedings in respect of acquisitions. The rules that they made for themselves purported to dispense themselves from the necessity of giving notice.  In regard to the acquisition of the mineral ownership in a matter of 2,000 acres in several townlands in County Donegal, all they did was to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>&mdash;I am not sure whether it was for one or two weeks&mdash;a notice of their intentions.</P>
    <P>Chief Justice Kennedy said in connection with this matter:</P>
    <P>Thus the Land Commission purported to give themselves by rule power to determine questions submitted by the Minister behind the backs of the interested parties, without hearing them, without even notice to them, while the very fact of such &ldquo;determination&rdquo; is not brought to their notice unless they happen to be members of that comparatively small and very select class of persons, the regular readers of <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>He said the matters concerned were ones involving:</P>
    <P>rights of specific interest and importance to individuals, some of whom, if not all, are poor men, tenants of poor holding, men moreover unlikely in the course of a lifetime to see a copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Such a procedure is, on the face of it, contrary to the elementary principles of natural justice.  The Oireachtas has given it no sanction <Col N="1526" /> and the rules prescribing it are clearly <i>ultra vires</i> and bad.</P>
    <P>Under our Constitution, even if the Oireachtas had given it sanction, it would still be <i>ultra vires</i> and bad for the same reason.  So far as the adequacy of the notices is concerned, I think we can disregard <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>The other part of the requirement is that the notice should be published in at least one national daily newspaper.  The Minister's statutory obligation would be fulfilled by publishing it, for instance, in a newspaper that circulates much more in Dublin and in the east of the country rather than in other parts of the country, although the paper in question is a national newspaper.  The Minister might ask himself what is the chance that a small farmer of the class Chief Justice Kennedy had in mind in the <i>Mountcharles</i> case would be likely to see a statutory notice on the back pages of the distinguished newspaper I have in mind.  There is very little chance.  I do not read these notices with very much care, and I do not want to trivialise this matter, but I honestly think if the Minister is aiming to put himself constitutionally in the clear in regard to this procedure, the notice envisaged here about publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least one daily newspaper for two weeks running will not do.  It does not bear any reasonable or real relation to the real constitutional problem of justice which is in front of him.</P>
    <P>I realise there is the view expressed, but with doubt, by the President of the High Court in the Bula case on whether notice is required in operations which are purely ministerial.  I should like to say with the greatest respect to the former President of the High Court that I do not agree with him.  At least I will put it this way: I agree with his doubt. He was right to have a doubt about his view.  In the light of some things which the courts have said since 1974, I would be surprised if that point of view were upheld.  While I do not want to cause annoyances or difficulties to him, the Minister would be well advised to look at this notice provision and see whether it could be improved and made more real.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> Apart from the general technique of the Bill there is a second matter which requires to have attention called to it, against the background of the fact that the Minister is trying to avoid being caught by the Constitution, by the legal safeguards people have against overdoses of Government.  The second thing I want to say bears on the way this Bill will operate.  If it goes through as it stands, and it then vests in the Minister the rights described in section 12, the situation will then have been reached that, if the Minister does nothing, if he just simply sits on some of the land in respect of which the right to work it has vested in him, a private owner or somebody who was formerly a private owner of the top soil who subsequently becomes interested in working minerals is excluded from doing so.  Maybe I have read the Bill wrongly but it seems to me that he is excluded from doing so.</P>
    <P>Suppose nobody gets himself registered or establishes a claim to minerals which are excepted under section 13.  Some will, but most of the landowners will not establish a claim such as section 13 envisages.  When the Minister's right vests, if somebody subsequently wants to work minerals which would have been his to work but for this Bill, he will not be able to do so.  He may become interested in mining overnight.  I admit I am putting an extreme case.  He may be an engineer, or he may have a son who is a mining engineer and he may want to exploit what he regards as his own land.  He may regard himself as the owner of the minerals beneath it, except that it is what the Romans called a naked ownership.  It will be only a <i>nuda proprietas</i> because the Minister will have run away with the right to work the mineral.  He will be debarred from doing that.  It is true that he will have missed his chance to get his claim registered&mdash;&mdash; not missed it, because he would not have had a claim anyway because the minerals there would not have been excepted. The Minister is taking away from him something which he may subsequently wish to make use of.  He has no way of making use of it now, unless he applies to the Minister for a lease or a licence to work minerals which are under <Col N="1528" /> his own hall door.  If he does, that comes under section 16.</P>
    <P>Suppose there is somebody in the category I have described, somebody who subsequently realises that but for this Bill he would have had minerals which he would have been entitled to work, or rights which he could have sold to somebody else, his only hope is to come to the Minister and look for a lease or a licence and, in issuing either, the Minister could include a condition giving the Minister the right to take a participating interest in the working of the mineral.  That person will be substantially worse off after the passage of this Bill than he is now.</P>
    <P>We know what the Minister means by participating rights because he told us today:</P>
    <P>The State has the duty, in the national interest, to ensure that a reasonable and equitable share of the profits from the development of a deposit accrues to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Presumably that is a reasonable share over and above the taxation of ordinary profits.  The 10 per cent corporation profits tax which will attach from 1981 under, I must admit, the very beneficial disposition of the Minister about six weeks ago, unless I misinterpreted what he said, will not attach to companies involved in this sort of operation.  Even if it did, that still would not invalidate the point I am trying to make that this operation is leaving somebody in this category who discovers what his true situation is after the enactment of this Bill in a substantially worse position.</P>
    <P>I advance these objections in no hostile spirit.  I am completely in sympathy with what the Minister is trying to do.  The objections are: (1) the negligible difference, the non-existent difference, in substance in conferring on himself an exclusive right to work minerals; (2) the inadequate notice provisions of sections 17 and 18; and, (3) the fact that anyone left behind, so to speak, and who has not established a claim to have excepted minerals will no longer be able to catch up in the race except on very disadvantageous conditions.</P>
    <P>The accumulation of these objections amounts to giving the Bill a character <Col N="1529" /> which might lead a court to say it goes further than the State need have gone in trying to protect the public interest.  I accept completely that the public interest requires that the ownership situation should be stabilised and that mining interests, whether privately or State owned, should be facilitated and allowed to do their work without the threat hanging over them that their work will be frustrated and their investment set at nought by litigation.  It may be from the accumulation of those things that a court will say: &ldquo;The State is going too far.  Something less would have done. Something less would have achieved the objectives the Minister quite rightly is anxious to achieve.  Something which would have been more sparing of private property rights would have achieved them&rdquo;.  The High Court and the Supreme Court have not yet set out the criterion they will use but it seems to me to be the only workable way in sight in the administration of Article 43 in this kind of area.</P>
    <P>What would my alternative have been?  I offer it tentatively because I know how difficult this whole area is.  It would have been a better alternative to do what the Minister adverted to in the second part of his speech and which he said he still has not lost sight of.  It might have been better for him to try to replace what he is doing now with the kind of Bill he mentioned in the second part of his speech and have a system of registration of claims.  Although he did not say this it seems to me&mdash;and I thought this from the moment the Bill was introduced; subsequently I discovered that others have been saying the same thing&mdash;that an easier way to deal with this problem would have been to provide a system whether in the Land Registry, or modelled on the Land Registry, or a separate registry, or something attached to the Mining Board, or attached to the Office of the Circuit Court, under which people could establish that mining was going on on the appointed day, in other words, the day in 1903, or 1923, or whatever the relevant day is, on land which was vested in themselves or their predecessors and the mineral rights were supposed to attach to the State unless the minerals were then being <Col N="1530" /> worked.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulty arise from the fact that nobody knows what was going on in most of these places and it is impossible at this remove in time to establish clearly on behalf of the State that no mining was going on.  It would be more businesslike to reverse the onus of proof.  As an example, it could be modelled on the old section 52 procedure in the Local Registration of Titles Act and somebody could bring a proceeding naming the Minister as the nominal defendant and in the Circuit Court he would try to establish by evidence, which the Circuit Court judge would be entitled to accept or reject that on the relevant day, perhaps 55 or 75 years ago, mining was going on on his land.  I do not need to tell the Minister that an overwhelming majority of landowners would not be able to establish such a thing because it was not happening in most cases.</P>
    <P>For the State to be tripped up by the fact that it cannot establish the negative, when we all know the negative to be the truth in 99 per cent of the cases, is a paltry reason for not pressing ahead with this kind of solution.  It would be reasonable and defensible on constitutional grounds to say &ldquo;We are going to have a system which will operate on a presumption, the presumption being that on a particular day mines were not being worked on this land.  We are going to give every facility; we are going to give wide notice of this provision.  We will advertise it on television in the way that the Department of the Environment urge people to make sure that their vote is registered&rdquo;.  The possible loss of minerals worth millions of pounds is surely worth more to the individual than the casting of his vote.  If we take the trouble to get people to make sure they are on the electoral register I cannot quite see why one might not go to the same kind of trouble in trying to make sure that people look into their family history to see whether they could make a case that they had a right to be excepted from the operation of the State ownership under the Land Acts by reason of mining having been carried on on their lands at a particular time.</P>
    <P>That could be done.  I cannot see any <Col N="1531" /> constitutional difficulty about it.  I do not see why, if we were able to carry out such a system, it would achieve only a marginal improvement.  One would have to give an interval of two or three years before the door closed.  We would have to allow a couple of years for people to research and raise their potential claims on the basis that mining was going on on their lands on the appointed day.  Once the time elapsed, surely everybody's situation would then be clear.  The Land Acts would have been seen to have operated in the way they were designed to operate originally, namely, vesting the mineral rights in the lands which were being bought by the State for the benefit of the then tenants.  I do not see why we should be so apologetic about trying to perfect that for which the Land Acts omitted to provide machinery.  That would be a better way of going about it. It would require an elaborate giving of notice.  This should close any possible doubt on constitutional grounds arising in the case of somebody who, because of some disability, was not able to make the necessary claim but somebody in which case the materials for such a claim were actually there.  I should be amazed if there were more than two or three such cases in the country, two or three cases in which mining was going on sometime in this century, in which the person who might be interested in the ministerial operations would not be in a position to bring his claim within two or three years.  In order to accommodate even those cases I would build into a scheme such as I am suggesting a provision whereby the Minister would be committed to making good by paying compensation the loss in money of anybody who, after the lapse of three years, managed to establish such a claim.</P>
    <P>In case that may seem an eccentric system, I will produce a precedent for it. There may be more than one precedent for it but there is a simple precedent in two Acts passed here in 1959 and 1966&mdash;the Funds of Suitors Acts.  The Funds of Suitors Acts arose in this way. The office of the Registrar of the High Court and of other courts have bank accounts. These bank accounts are the <Col N="1532" /> repositories of funds which are paid into court in the course of litigation.  They all go into the same account.  According as the court orders money to be paid out, it is paid out.  In the bank there is a reserve of money which has been paid by litigants pending the determination of certain proceedings.  The funds have been accumulating in the High Court since 1800.  There was a large sum of money in it by 1959.  Somebody got the idea that it would be a fine thing if this money, most of which was never going to be claimed, could be devoted to some appropriate object.  The specific objects mentioned were the restoration of the King's Inns building, the maintenance of the King's Inns Library, and the building of the Abbey Theatre.  The Abbey Theatre and the Peacock Theatre both benefited from these funds.  The Oireachtas took this money from the fund and directed it to be paid to these objects of national value.  In order to cover itself against the possibility that the descendants or successors of the deceased were going to claim their rights, both these Acts contain sections which put the Minister for Finance under the obligation of making good any deficiency in the fund.  Section 3 of the 1966 Act reads:</P>
    <P>If it happens that the funds of suitors are at any time reduced to a sum not sufficient to meet the demands upon them, the Minister, so as to afford a complete indemnity to suitors for any loss which they might sustain by reason of the passing of this Act, shall advance out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof such sum as he may think necessary, not exceeding £450,000.</P>
    <P>In other words, the State was laying its hands on money which was not its own but it was making provision for restitution from public funds in the unlikely event that people would make claims on those funds.</P>
    <P>I only mentioned that Act to support my suggestion that a presumption that at the given dates under the Land Acts particular lands were not the scene of mining operations could be hermetically sealed from the point of view of the Constitution by a provision that, if anybody <Col N="1533" /> after the expiry of three years turned up and established that at a particular time mining operations were going on on land to which he was entitled, the State would be under an obligation to make that good to him and would be running a minimal risk in so doing.  I suggest that to the Minister and his advisers as a possible alternative or feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Such provision would not be as drastic as what the Minister has in mind but it would make watertight the State's title to about 70 per cent of the minerals in this country.  I understand that that is not quite as good as what he is aiming at because what he wants is to have a whole block of ore bodies of which the right to work is vested in the same person and in which there will not be a poor privately-owned little mineral right in the middle of a State-owned one with the mining company having to negotiate with two people instead of one.  I accept that that is this Minister's object, and we will be a long way on the road to achieving that with a provision such as I am suggesting which would make clear the State's right in regard to 70 per cent or thereabouts of the minerals or potential minerals in this State.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to give the Minister a short list of little drafting points in the Bill which struck me when I was reading through it.  Perhaps he would ask his officials to examine them.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Compensation&rdquo; and contains sections 19, 20, 21 and 22 which deal with mining rights.  Section 19 says:</P>
    <P>A right to compensation under this Act shall vest in every person who was entitled to any estate or interest in minerals immediately before the date on which the mining rights in respect of those minerals vested in the Minister and the said right to compensation shall devolve and may be disposed of accordingly.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;mining rights&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill.  If the Minister is aiming to apply the compensation provisions of Part III to the rights which he proposes to give himself under section 12, then it should be expressed in a different way.  What he is giving himself in section 12 is not described as a mining <Col N="1534" /> right; it is described as the exclusive right of working minerals.  &ldquo;Working minerals&rdquo; in turn is described in section 2 as meaning a collection of a lot of different things of which mining is only one.  The most conspicuous of them is the right of taking away and selling and this is part of the right to work under the Bill which is just as important as mining. It should not be too much to ask that in a short Bill the same right should be referred to by the same phrase, particularly when the references are only two or three pages apart.</P>
    <P>In the 1940 Act there is a thing called an exclusive mining right, and if that is what the Minister intends, then the whole phrase &ldquo;exclusive mining rights&rdquo; should be brought into this Act and made part of it.  Another way out of this, which is probably the easiest way, is to put a bracket in section 12 after the word &ldquo;minerals&rdquo; so that the section would read, &ldquo;The exclusive right of working minerals (which in this Act is called a mining right)...&rdquo; That would cure the matter.  It seems peculiar to be building an Act up around a thing called an exclusive right to work minerals and then to have a compensation part of the Act which talks about compensation for mining rights, an expression which is not elsewhere defined in the Bill, unless I have not noticed it.</P>
    <P>The second small point I want to mention is such a tiny one that it is scarcely worth holding up the house for it.  I see in the second line of the long title the words &ldquo;Management and control&rdquo;.  Those words seem to be an echo of words not in Article 43 but in Article 10 of the Constitution.  This Bill is concerned principally with trying to divest private owners of rights which they now have to work the minerals under their land or to work private minerals, and Article 10, which is apparently being echoed in the long title, does not deal with private rights at all but with the State's rights.  I mention that in case the Minister or his advisers are under the impression that by bringing in an overtone or echo of Article 10 in the long title they are giving the Bill authority which it does not have.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say of drafting bears on section 14.  Again I do not make any point about this beyond <Col N="1535" /> saying that it could be better drafted. Section 14 refers to registration of excepted minerals, but excepted minerals are ones which are described in section 13.  These sections have to be construed as part of the whole Bill but they are self-contained and should stand on their own feet without over-much reference to other sections to explain them.  Section 13 (1) says:</P>
    <P>Section 12 shall not apply to minerals of any description in any land if, at the 15th day of December, 1978, a person was lawfully working or developing a mine for the working of such minerals.</P>
    <P>That subsection as it stands would suggest that the mere fact that mining was going on would except the minerals from the application of this Bill even if registration never took place.  In other words, even somebody who neglects to register his claim to have his minerals treated as excepted, forgets, does not bother, or just to annoy the Minister refuses to apply for registration, would still be able to say.  &ldquo;I am entitled to rely on section 13 (1) as excepting my minerals from the bearing of this Act because my minerals correspond with the description of excepted minerals which this subsection contains.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 13 (2) does not quite mend the matter.  It goes some distance towards doing so but it could be better.  It says:</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of subsection (1) a person shall be deemed to be developing a mine if, on an application under section 14, he proves that before the date mentioned in that subsection he had decided to do so in accordance with plans based upon a comprehensive study indicating a reasonable prospect of commercial development and that his decision stood at the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>That subsection as it stands clearly is intended to be in aid not of someone who is actually carrying out mining, operations but of someone who has not yet started but intends to start.  In other words, the operation of section 13 (2) is to give the benefit of good intentions to <Col N="1536" /> somebody who has not yet started.  It cannot be used in order to explain section 13 (1).  Clearly it is not intended to make the validity of a claim to have excepted minerals dependent on registration. Am I right that subsection (2) is only an extension to give the benefits of good intentions to somebody who has not yet started work?  As the Bill stands, what effect does registration have at all? The fact of working on 15 December 1978 will take the minerals out of the Act if I am to believe section 13.  Section 13 does not say anywhere that in addition to being worked they have to be recognised and registered as being worked or being the subject of good intentions to work.  I make no special point about this, but the Minister and his advisers might look at it.  The drafting there could be better.</P>
    <P>I wish to sum up broadly what I have being saying in the last hour.  We support, agree with and sympathise with the object of this Bill in that it stabilises the ownership situation in Irish minerals so as to permit the exigencies of the common good to be served by allowing us to get ahead quickly with exploiting our natural resources.  We want to see the tens of thousands of secure jobs waiting to be created which the Minister's party promised us in 1977.  We accept that the Minister has a technically difficult job in trying to avoid the constitutional minefield of Article 43 which nobody has ever mapped.  Indeed the people who laid it were those who most neglected the mapping.  In casting the Bill in the form of a Bill to give himself not the property of minerals but the right to work them, the Minister is trying to avoid going the whole hog with acquisition and, therefore, trying to avoid putting into the Bill the potential frailty which that might imply.  My problem is that I do not see much difference between what he is doing and giving himself outright property.  Giving himself the exclusive right to work amounts to the same thing as acquiring the whole property in substance because nothing is left once one subtracts the right to work.</P>
    <P>I pointed out a number of flaws in the Bill for instance, insufficient notice, notice that will not meet the requirements of constitutional justice and <Col N="1537" /> another in regard to it being a fairly tough Bill for people who through ignorance fail to establish their claim under section 13 until it is too late but who afterwards produce material which would entitle them to claim an exception. It might have been better had the Minister done something more modest, if he had gone ahead instead with the registration idea which he mentions in which there would have been a presumption that minerals were not in private ownership but were in State ownership and left it for the people concerned to make their case in respect of the 1903 and 1923 Land Acts, with mining going on at the operative date which would of course operate by vesting the minerals in them.  That would have been a better way to do it.  I also said that that would need to be accompanied by very elaborate notice and by a sort of safety net in the shape of a provision to enable the State to make good the loss of somebody who perhaps through no fault of his own turned up late to establish his claim to ownership.  Subject to these reservations we will not hold the Bill up. I sincerely hope it will be a success and that the weaknesses I have expressed apprehension about will not show up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support the Bill.  However, we regard it as being a very narrowly defined measure of reform and relief.  In matters of this nature, we are all very cautious about future litigation that may arise on the constitutionality of the Bill.  This Bill should nevertheless divert the prospect of further actions against the State on the question of mineral ownership.  That might be a bit optimistic but in so far as the Minister has made a genuine effort to deal with the situation, we support the narrow confines of the Bill.</P>

    <P>I agree with the Minister and with my colleague, Deputy Kelly, that it is absolutely essential that the State should have mineral development statutes which would enable exploitation of our unworked minerals in private ownership to go ahead and that these statutes should be tried and tested.  We only have two Acts and one Bill to be enacted, which have given rise to an enormous amount of litigation, uncertainty and <Col N="1538" /> legislative confusion.  We wish to see effective legislation introduced.  The body of the law so far, the 1940 Act, the 1960 Act and this Bill, is extremely limited.  In many respects we tend to miss a central point in debating the narrow confines of this legislation, that is, the need to come to grips at some stage in our economic and social development with the rigidity of Article 43.  Every time we attempt to come to grips with difficulties such as we are experiencing this evening we revolve around the absolute rigidity of Article 43 relative to private property.  This has been a major inhibiting factor.  In 1979 why have we still not got the political courage to start with the fundamentals? If we clarified our minds in relation to some of the fundamentals we would not find ourselves hopping in and out of constitutionality actions on a litigation merry-go-round as did the former Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lalor.  Deputy Lalor, as a former Minister, found himself before the court trying to explain away the omissions in the 1940 Act.</P>
    <P>In relation to mineral rights and ownership there is a need to up-date the Constitution with specific reference to such rights and obligations and the role of the State.  It would have to be carefully drafted and the majority of public opinion would have to favour it but I submit that if we assessed public opinion we would find a solid body of opinion holding the view that where major finds of minerals are brought to light, even where the exploration was done by private interests, the State has an overriding entitlement in the national interest, irrespective of the degree of work put into it by private interests in these areas, and that the State should be given paramount importance which it does not currently have.</P>
    <P>We should amend the Constitution on perhaps half a dozen fronts, adoption, divorce and major issues.  There is absolute moral cowardice here when it comes to amending the Constitution, but since we are amending the Constitution, there is a need for constitutional amendment, in relation to the working of mineral rights and mineral reserves by private and public interests, possibly a narrow constitutional amendment <Col N="1539" /> because otherwise every landowner in the country would conduct a major campaign. When one sees the tortuous involvement of the State and the tortuous efforts of the State to bring about effective mineral exploitation either by protective legislation such as this, by encouraging private interests, or by buying ourselves into private interests, such as the Bula affair, we have adequate grounds for an effective constitutional amendment.  I am surprised that the Minister, who is highly skilled and highly competent, who has at least as much competence as his predecessor and who has a far bigger majority behind him on a unified party basis if he wishes to push a matter of that nature, did not show more imagination than he has in this narrow cleaning-up operation we are indulging in today.  This is something which has not been debated very much but I submit that there is a strong and growing body of opinion which would favour such a course of action so that we do not have a couple of cowboys picking up millions of pounds because the State wants to get involved&mdash;quite correctly&mdash;and tries to buy its way in. Having done that, even in the case of the particular lands that have given rise to this Bill, the disputation relating to Nevinstown where not even a substantive planning application is made and no development plan is produced apart from a few advertisement in newspapers which are a source of more amusement than anything else, the cost to the State of the uncertainty of this legislation in terms of cash and uncertainty arising from legal defects at all levels has been very considerable.  We must await the next constitutionality action and the next piece of litigation which will probably involve all three Bills to see who will take that action.  There is a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity which has been lessened but not I think entirely eliminated.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's comments on section 16 referring to the taking by the State of a participating interest in the working of minerals and the various methods by which the Minister may provide conditions attached to a lease or a licence.  I support the measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> The Minister has pointed out that he did not want to formulate precise policy lines.  I agree that one must be flexible&mdash;one has no option when one tries to implement legislation of this nature with all its uncertainties and ambiguities&mdash;but nevertheless the Minister has again stressed that point and I thank him for so doing because I very much agree with that provision in section 16.</P>
    <P>I was very much interested in his reference to the prospect in an earlier draft of having the registration process introduced.  What exactly are the &ldquo;considerable difficulties&rdquo; which the legal experts felt would ensue if that system were introduced?  What safeguards do they feel might be necessary to overcome these difficulties?  It is a very interesting area; it has been there for some time and the Minister has elaborated to a degree this evening but the House could legitimately ask for more detail and there is no reason why we should not have it.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the comment by the Minister that he would at least examine and study the possibility of the State having a more active role in minerals exploration and development.  If you watch the gyrations of Tara and Bula and in the light of the solid experience we had in Government I do not think you can tolerate a situation where the State must pick up the tab, provide the legislative framework and do the devil and all.  At the same time, apart from participation involvement which can be very difficult to follow through in the normal process of activity within any Government Department, I do not think the State should be as inactive and as passive as was the case in the past in relation to our very limited experience.  The State should be much more effectively geared for involvement despite the enormous risks and capital investment involved and despite the enormous cost of buying international expertise to enable the State to be so involved.  I think it is in the national interest that the State should itself&mdash;provided one had the constitutional amendment that I favour&mdash;have a more active and dynamic role in minerals exploration and development.</P>
    <P>That is about the only way one can control the situation when major <Col N="1541" /> development comes and people are in a position either through good fortune or native shrewdness to avail of a good option. The State has fundamental rights which need protection.  For that reason I urge the Minister&mdash;admittedly he said that possibility needed a good deal of further study but the Minister is an industrious and active man with a very clear brain&mdash;not to keep these ideas which he outlined in his speech at the embryonic stage because this Bill has cleared the air to some extent.  I accept that, but there is now need to proceed further.  I urge the Minister to consider a serious constitutional amendment.  No doubt 99 per cent of the Irish electorate hold the right of private property in a very special and definite position and will not divest themselves of that fundamental right but there is a solid referendum majority among the 99 per cent who would say, particularly when it comes to valuable national resources: &ldquo;We believe that proper custodial exploration, care and exploitation of these resources should reside within the State in the national interest.&rdquo;  I think an enormous majority of people would give short shrift to any campaign suggesting that we were intruding unduly into the area of private property; that you would create constitutional precedents which would be hard to limit and that all those mad, lunatic socialists would get one foot in the door and then suddenly you would have a State take-over of private property overnight.</P>
    <P>People are mature and sophisticated enough and indeed irate enough in regard to what they have seen even in the recent past to say to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the State: &ldquo;Go ahead.  Bring in that kind of constitutional amendment and it will clarify the position once and for all and we can then proceed.&rdquo;  We should proceed on a joint-venture basis in our mixed economy between the public and private sector with the State having the power and constitutional right of ultimate jurisdiction in this area as far as the national interest is concerned.</P>
    <P>It will be ten or 15 years before that view is enshrined in legislation but I have no doubt that it will come because already one can see elements of doubt in <Col N="1542" /> relation to some legislation.  I do not propose to elaborate on that but it is evident that such is the nature of the exploration, of the interests involved and of the prospects of development that inevitably we will have our constitutional lawyers going through each section with a fine comb.  Undoubtedly the State will find itself once again in a defensive position where, with due respect to all, there is no need for it to be.  The State should not be left in that position and the only answer is a constitutional amendment dealing with that aspect.</P>
    <P>If we can have a constitutional amendment in relation to adoption orders and the Adoption Board and if we should have&mdash;we would if only we had the political courage to do so&mdash;in relation to the question of marriage we can have one in relation to this.  There are other question also&mdash;I will forget about Articles 2 and 3 and Northern Ireland because we may never have the courage to even dream about doing anything of that nature.  There are many things of direct concern to us, namely certain aspects of private property.  For example, the Minister for Agriculture has solid thoughts in relation to land ownership.  When talking about farmers and agricultural structures of land ownership, which would require constitutional amendments, the Minister has come around to that way of thinking and I believe the majority of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party support him.  If such a move is good for the future prospects of agricultural structures here in terms of the limitation of ownership of land it would also be of paramount importance to have constitutional amendments in relation to the ownership, exploration and exploitation of our mineral resources.</P>
    <P>With those reservations I support the Bill.  I sympathise with the section of the Department concerned with minerals because of the prolonged delay&mdash;it took about five years&mdash;to get this legislation out of the way.  They have had to live with it and so did three Ministers, some of them being almost crucified in the process and some learning very bitter lessons.  As far as the Bill deals with the situation to the extent permitted under <Col N="1543" /> the Constitution I welcome it and it will have the support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that the Minister responsible should have been so involved with the question of mining when in opposition.  After reading through the debates that took place during that period and the weighty documents dealing with previous State involvement one must come to the conclusion that legislation was urgently needed to produce a more workable procedure. For that reason the Minister is to be congratulated on getting to grips with this complex question.  The Opposition spokesmen cited a number of reservations and the Minister confirmed that a number of major complex legal situations make the ideal procedure impossible at this stage.  However, he was correct to introduce a Bill that will be recognised as being workable, based on the Minister's experience and knowledge in this area.</P>
      <P>A decision to restructure the mining board is a move in the right direction.  It will give those fortunate enough to discover minerals on their land an independent board to assist them and evaluate their claims.  The board will also give positive advice.  Section 6, which deals with ownership, explains the legal position of individuals.  The capital involved in bringing about any worthwhile return to private enterprise or the State on investment is so great that there is a need to up-date the legal procedure following discoveries.  From experiences to date we know that the situation is very complex. The handling of such matters by the last Government was not good with the result that we have not reaped full benefit from discoveries.  It is likely that we will have other finds and this Bill will help speed up the legal situation involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 deals with technical advice and the need for recognising that there is a great area of technical uncertainty in mining.  For that reason it is important that the most competent advice available should be brought together under a mining board.  It is hoped that we will not now have to depend on other states for the facility to deal with discoveries.  Section <Col N="1544" /> 16 represents a positive move forward in updating our assessment of our potential.  Individuals are being asked to acquaint the mining board of discoveries and after they register them they, and the State, can make a positive assessment.  Section 17 is very reassuring because, naturally, a major question of compensation is involved where there is a discovery.</P>
    <P>The independent or private owner can make representations to the mining board whose experts will listen not alone to the representations on behalf of the Minister but will give a very balanced and fair view of the actual find. They will let the owners feel that the State recognises their position and is prepared to be co-operative to ensure that they will get a fair return and that the State will be in a position to maximise the value in the overall situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with compensation. It is very important to highlight the pre-extraction value.  The value of any discovery can only be assessed when it is in the complete or semi-complete product stage.  This Bill recognises that there must be a clearly defined formula to assess compensation.  This is a very welcome updating of the present situation. It will ensure that the organisation, private company or semi-State company entering mining will be in a viable operation. This is a high risk business.  We can see that our major mining operation at Navan, due to the world situation, is identifying the complication of high capital investment.  By putting forward in this Bill a very balanced situation where hopefully in the future we can maximise the benefit to the State by putting in a workable and positive system of compensation, the Minister has recognised our responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with exploration.  It would be nice if we could afford to press ahead with exploration but this is an extremely costly business and is hard to justify in present circumstances when there is such a demand on Government funds.  If he could I am sure the Minister would like to create a large fund for exploration but because of his many other responsibilities it is at present impossible to do that.  The procedure he adopted in <Col N="1545" /> this Bill, of retaining and increasing his powers and allowing private enterprise to press ahead with explorations, is the correct one.</P>
    <P>During our last major mining discussion the Minister showed a considerable amount of foresight.  He pointed out the wrong direction taken by the previous Administration.  He has brought before this House a very workable Bill and has highlighted a number of areas where he continues to look into the possibilities of maximising mining to the benefit of this country.  He has brought before the House a Bill worthy of support from all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the three Deputies for their support of this Bill and its objectives and for the understanding they showed of the difficulties which have to be overcome in endeavouring to draft a Bill of this kind so that one can be reasonably certain that it will stand up and not be subject to challenge later.  The Bill has taken over 12 months to prepare.  The reason it has taken so long is the degree of care which had to be exercised in endeavouring to ensure that it would be as reasonably free from challenge as one can ever be sure of nowadays in the context of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening speech, the Bill as originally drafted, before it was presented to the House, included a fairly lengthy part on the question of registration of ownership of minerals which on legal advice I subsequently excluded because of the risk, I was advised, of those provisions possibly being found in breach of the Constitution in the form in which they were then expressed&mdash;not a major risk but there was some element of risk&mdash;whereas it was thought that the element of risk in the rest of the Bill was negligible.  It is, I believe, one of the few defects of real substance which has come to light in our Constitution, that if a Bill is referred to the Supreme Court by the President to have it or any part of its provisions examined from the point of view of their constitutional compatibility, and if any part of it, even a subsection, is found to be unconstitutional to whole Bill falls. <Col N="1546" /> That is not, of course, the case if the Bill is signed by the President and enacted.  If some provision is challenged and is found to be unconstitutional, it does not affect the remainder of the Bill. Nonetheless, I did not want to take the risk with the whole Bill, particularly as it seemed as certain as one can reasonably be that the remainder was perfectly constitutional, and is very badly needed.</P>
    <P>Ideally I would like to have included the registration provision.  By no means have I abandoned those provisions.  I was interested in what Deputy Kelly in particular had to say in regard to them.  He took the line that if I had included those provisions, they were possibly less objectionable than some of the provisions I had included and were possibly less open to being upset.  He is at a disadvantage because he did not see the actual draft but there were six or seven senior lawyers in the employment of the State who saw it and were strongly of the opinion that there were certain dangers in relation to it as it then stood.  The legal reservations which were expressed in regard to it by those men were mainly based on the problem, which I consider is to some extent an unavoidable one, that a mere failure to register would result in the loss of property.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out to me that this was an obvious constitutional problem because the excised part of this Bill envisaged a situation where the Minister would pick an area of, say ten square miles which was about to be the subject of a mineral exploration licence and would appoint a day in respect of that ten square miles, or whatever it was, within 12 months of which claims would have to be made to register private ownership of minerals.  In default of a successful private registration&mdash;it was intended to use the vehicle of the Land Registry for this purpose&mdash;having been made within 12 months, plus whatever time was necessary for the Land Registry or the court, as the case may be, to consider the claim, the title of the State to those minerals would become indefeasible.  If the title of the State were not made indefeasible in those circumstances, one is not much beter off than one is at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> On the other hand, if one makes the title of the State indefeasible, even though one gives 12 months or a two year period for claims and for proof of them, one is still running into the problem that simply because somebody did not make a claim he loses his ownership.  The question arises whether in all the circumstances under our Constitution the courts would decide that was reasonable.  Should a man have to establish his right of ownership in a particular way in order to have that right of ownership?  It might be argued this his right of ownership is much deeper and is antecedent to mere registration on a folio, that registration on a folio is only proof of that and that his failure to make a claim would give rise to obvious complaints by those who afterwards felt they were wrongly deprived of what they felt was their property.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty that persons under a disability would be put in a difficult position, because if it can be shown that they were under disability then the State's right, would have to be set aside.  We would be back in the area of doubt again, which is the one thing we want to avoid.  Very frequently it may not be possible to show that the person was under a disability at the time the claim should be made.  That relates particularly to unsoundness of mind.  There were in the past, although it is a decreasing phenomenon now, a great many absentee owners of land, especially in the west, whose opportunity to lodge their claims might not be what one might ideally like to see.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that those difficulties are insoluble.  As I said in my opening speech, I am having them looked at again to see if there are ways they might be overcome or we might get around them while remaining within the provisions of the Constitution.  I am fortified in my efforts by the general support of Deputies Kelly and B. Desmond that some approach of that kind should be made.  I am grateful for that support and their views.  They may not fully apperciate the actual difficulties there are on the ground in trying to overcome these specific problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> I would like now to deal with some of the points that were raised.  Deputy Kelly early in his speech said he felt that the courts would not pay much attention to the Long Title.  I respectfully dispute that.  One of the reasons why the Long Title is so unusually long, thorough and comprehensive and why it quotes within its terms certain phrases, particularly from Article 43 of the Constitution and one other Article, is that the construing of any part of a statute can be done in the light of the Long Title.  We do not any longer have recitals in modern public Acts.  It is less uncommon in private Acts.  If this were an Act in which a recital were appropriate there would be a lengthy recital of these matters before the enacting part of this Bill. The practice has been in the last 50 years to do away with these recitals and to incorporate in the Long Title the kind of things that would have been recited in an earlier age.</P>
    <P>The practice has grown in the last ten years to abbreviate the Long Title as much as possible.  Much of our legislation did not require any very explanatory Long Title.  This Bill does, and that is why the Long Title is so comprehensive. It is of importance to have this.  If the courts might disregard it in trying to construe from a constitutional point of view the provisions of individual sections, it would not be either necessary or appropriate to include the Long Title in the form in which it is.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kelly that the question of our still not having a report after five years of this case, which was decided in the Supreme Court in March 1974 and decided in the High Court in February 1973&mdash;I understand that is not reported either&mdash;is very unsatisfactory. It means that people have to get private copies of judgments of that kind which they should not have to do.  It is always possible that when the official report finally comes it will contain certain amendments that might not be in a private copy which one might obtain. This is quite unsatisfactory.  Deputy Kelly blamed the country for this unsatisfactory situation.  I understand there is an organisation called the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting. They existed in my day as Minister for <Col N="1549" /> Justice and I used to give them money.</P>

      <P>On section 13, Deputy Kelly made the point that if someone was accepted under this section he was not compelled to go along and register his excepted situation or capacity and that there could be a sort of hiatus, that a person was excepted by law and still would not appear on the register of excepted minerals.  That point seems to be covered by section 14 (5) which states:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly raised a point regarding the extent of the difference between expropriation of minerals or mineral rights or the ownership of minerals and the vesting proposal contained in this Bill.  He questioned whether there was any substantial difference between the two.  The vesting proposal here is based on the proposition that it comes within what might be termed the constitutional dispensation provided for in Article 43 concerning the regulation of the exercise of private property rights in the public interest. The ownership of the minerals is not being vested in this Bill and it remains in the possession of the owner until the minerals are being worked, either by the Minister or by somebody to whom he grants a lease or a licence for their working.  The Bill sets out the right to work minerals, irrespective of whether they are owned by the State or privately owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy made the point that an owner might at some period after 15 December 1978 become interested in working minerals and that he should be allowed do so.  There is nothing to stop a technically and financially competent owner of minerals from being considered for a licence or lease to work them under the provisions of this Bill.  However some restriction on the rights of ownership is inevitable.  A balance must be struck between the owner's rights and the need of the public interest to have our mineral <Col N="1553" /> resources explored.</P>
    <P>We may tend to get bogged down by the legalisms of this Bill and the technical difficulties associated with it, finding it difficult to see what was essentially the original reason for legislation of this kind and why it has existed since March 1974.  It was to prevent a recurrence of the kind of situation in the particular case at Nevinstown, County Meath, to which I referred in my opening speech, the facts of which are well known, which potentially could have done great harm to the whole question of mineral exploration in this country had we not made it clear that it was intended to rectify it.  This country could not again afford a situation in which somebody finds minerals, perhaps after considerable expenditure of money, effort and expertise, and then some third party who has no connection whatever, in the first instance, either with the exploration for the minerals or ownership of the land or the minerals, suddenly appears on the scene and dispossesses the exploring party of the right to apply to the Minister for a licence or lease to develop those minerals.</P>
    <P>That is one of the fundamental roots of the problem we face here.  Of course, if this Bill had been passed in 1971, when the original movement inwards by a third party took place, then that activity could have been stopped very rapidly.  The Minister of the day simply could have come along and said &ldquo;All right, you have bought your way in there: you have forced out those who found minerals: but I regard it now as unjust in all the circumstances that you should be given a licence or lease to work minerals even though they are now technically your property.&rdquo;  The great strength of this Bill lies, among other things, in ensuring that that sort of situation can never arise again after the Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I see quite a clear distinction. What surprised me was that both Deputy Kelly and Deputy B. Desmond urged on me that I should take over the minerals <i>simpliciter</i> rather than approach them in what I think is a much fairer way&mdash;not take them over <i>simpliciter</i> but to regulate in the public interest the use that can be made of them.</P>
      <P>Surely, Sir, if you own a house and I offer you the choice of taking your house from you or letting you keep your house but only allowing you use it in certain defined ways, inevitably you would choose to keep your house and use it only in certain defined ways.  In the words of the normal sort of clause one sees in these leases, you could not use it for a factory, some noisy trade or offensive calling of that nature.  That would not be an undue restriction but nonetheless a restriction on your rights of ownership being exercised in the interests of your neighbours or in the public interest.  There is a very clear distinction, and any householder offered that choice would appreciate it instantly. Perhaps Deputy Kelly does not see the distinction that clearly when he advocates that it may be better that we would expropriate the minerals rather than that we should seek to regulate them in the public interest or regulate their use in the public interest.</P>

      <P>We are with the Minister in so far as his objective is concerned. What I am saying is that what he is actually doing, in substance, amounts to expropriation.  The Minister may think that words, whether in the Long Title or <Col N="1555" /> elsewhere, will save it from that judgment. He is actually doing that and the example he gives by reference to what happened in the Bula case proves it, because he is saying he is now going to have power to leave Bula with nothing but a green field into which they can put cattle but with no rights in regard to what is underneath it.</P>

      <P>The question of ownership of minerals, as it arises under the Land Acts, was referred to by <Col N="1556" /> Deputy Kelly.  He seemed to think it was necessary simply to prove that a mine was being worked on whatever date the Act was passed in 1903, 1923 or whenever.  I believe that is not quite the case at all.  The position regarding the ownership of mines and minerals in this country is dependent, first of all, on the question as to whether the purchase of the land was effected prior to the Land Act, 1903, or whether it was purchased under some of the subsequent Land Purchase Acts.  Broadly, it can be said that a purchaser under any of the Land Acts prior to the 1903 Act purchased his holding together with the mines and minerals in it.  However, I do not want that to be taken as an all-embracing statement, because clearly there are particular exceptions here and there.  But, as a general statement of principle, I understand that to be right.  There was a fairly major change of policy in this regard with the passage of the Irish Land Act of 1903 in as much as under that Act the whole estate, as opposed to part of the estate, had to be disposed of by the landlord.  On the vesting of the land in the tenant the tenant did not have the mines and minerals vested in him; they were vested in the Land Commission, except in a number of small specified cases where they did go to the tenant&mdash;they were in the case of repurchased demesnes and I presume that meant that the landlord was, in fact, buying back his own demesne&mdash;or where the vendor was not the owner of the mines or minerals because they were held under some sort of antecedent grant, which would occasionally be the case, or where the mine or quarry was being worked or developed by the vendor at the time of the sale.  The Act uses the phrase &ldquo;on the vesting of any land&rdquo;. That does not necessarily mean the day on which the Act was passed either in 1903 or 1923.  It would be the date of the vesting by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Purchase Acts 1907 and 1909, contain provisions which enable the Land Commission to dispose of mining rights reserved to it under the 1903 Act by lease or otherwise.  All holdings acquired under the Land Act of 1923 and subsequent Acts are, however, invariably now vested in the purchaser <Col N="1557" /> subject to the exclusive right of mining and taking minerals being reserved to the State.  By reason of section 45 of the Land Act 1923 the reservation to the State did not include a mine or quarry which was being worked on the appointed day and it did not apply to stone, gravel, sand or clay.  Otherwise the State became the owner of everything.</P>
    <P>Effectively, therefore, the State is clearly the owner of at least half the mineral rights in this country; one cannot quantify it exactly in terms of percentage.  Clearly at least 10, maybe 15 per cent is in private ownership and the remainder is a grey area.  It is a considerable challenge to try to sort out that uncertainty because it has been an inhibiting factor in regard to mineral exploration here down through the years. It is a task that I intend to continue to try to tackle.  I can say with confidence that, while it still remains something that we have to solve, the urgency in regard to it and the great need for it will not at all be as great when this Bill is enacted. It will take off the pressure but I look forward to coming back here in six or 12 months' time and putting before the House a Bill relating to this whole question of mineral ownership enshrining possibly the setting up of a separate new register in the Land Registry relating to minerals and mineral ownership and discussing it in this House and getting the views of Deputies as to whether it appears to be constitutionally acceptable. It is fair to say that as a result of this debate it seems to be, on all sides, politically acceptable and I am glad to know that and am fortified by that knowledge in my efforts to solve the ultimate problem of mineral ownership here.  However, this Bill goes a long way to solving most of the practical problems even if it does not solve all the academic ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is an enabling measure which supplements the powers and functions of road authorities under existing legislation. At present there is no statutory power whereby the provision or the use of a public road or bridge can be subject to toll charges.  It is public knowledge that interest has been expressed by the private sector in the provision of new road and bridge facilities on a toll basis. It is the Government's policy that, subject to certain primary considerations on which the provisions of this Bill are based, private enterprise should be facilitated in participating with road authorities in the financing, construction, maintenance and operation of suitable projects.  The Bill before the House will accommodate such a development in that it will enable road authorities to enter into agreements with private persons who are prepared to participate in the improvement of our public road system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underlying principle of the Bill is that existing statutory road authorities will continue to be responsible for the provision and maintenance of the public road network, including bridges.  There is no question of bodies setting themselves up to provide and operate toll facilities independently of the road authorities but, as already stated, local authorities will be able to enter into agreements with private entrepreneurs to develop suitable new projects.  The Bill provides that the <Col N="1559" /> function of making toll schemes and decisions to enter into agreements with private interests will be reserved to the elected members of the local authorities concerned.  There are also specific provisions in the Bill to protect the rights and interests of individuals.  Notice of the making of a toll scheme, together with an explanatory statement, must be published in the press; the public will have at least one month to consider the scheme, the explanatory statement and the relevant maps.  A further period of at least two months will be available in which persons may lodge statutory objections. In the event of such objections being lodged, a local inquiry must be held before a decision is taken to proceed with a scheme.  I would emphasise that it will continue to be the responsibility of the road authorities to decide whatever projects might be undertaken under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to detail each section of the Bill, which complements existing road law.  It is an enabling measure which will provide and additional option to road authorities for the financing and operation of particular road facilities, such as major river crossings, which are necessary in the general traffic and transportation interest.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Listening to the very brief introductory speech by the Minister for the Environment in introducing this Bill one would never imagine that we have here a complete innovation.  One would never imagine that the Minister is asking for enabling legislation to depart entirely from the legislation and procedures for the provisions of roads which we have known and enjoyed here over the years. This is, indeed, a very far-reaching Bill and I would have expected a much more elaborate speech from the Minister in introducing it in an effort to convince the House and the country that the Bill is desirable and that it should be enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, the Bill enables road authorities, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, to subject existing roads and bridges to tolls.  There <Col N="1560" /> is no question of the Bill applying only to future roads and bridges which may be constructed for the convenience of the general public.  There is no doubt that the Bill enables any and every road authority, with the consent of the Minister, to introduce toll schemes and to apply them to any road in the country, whether the road be from here to Naas, from here to Cork, from here to Cavan, or any other road.  The road authority, also with the consent of the Minister, may prepare a toll scheme in respect of any bridge and to subject that bridge to the collection of tolls from those who use it.  That is a far-reaching measure.</P>
    <P>The Bill, particularly in section 9, goes on to make provision for entering into agreements with private individuals to enable those private individuals to maintain existing roads and bridges and to collect tolls on them, or to construct new roads and bridges and to collect tolls in respect of them.  That, too, is an extremely far-reaching measure, not one a person would expect from the Minister for the Environment, with about one and a half of the folios the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was talking about before he left the House.</P>
    <P>I protest about the casual manner in which this Bill has been introduced, about the lack of information given to the House on the proposals in it.  As far as the ordinary person is concerned, this Bill simply provides for the collection of road tax by another name.  Before the last general election the Minister and his party undertook to abolish road tax in respect of cars of up to and including 16 horse power.  That was one of the ways they undertook to get the economy going again.  They never said they would substitute road tax by another form of tax, tolls, and that is what this Bill is all about: that is what the various sections enable the Minister for the Environment, in conjunction with road authorities, or <i>vice versa</i>, to do.</P>
    <P>This country is far from having reached the stage when we have adequate roads and when we can go on to have super roads for the people who are prepared to pay for them.  We have a <Col N="1561" /> long way to go before we reach the stage when we will have an adequate road structure which could be said to be acceptable for ordinary traffic.  Until we have reached that stage it is too soon to have a two-tier system for a first class and a second class type of motorist.  I had thought the Minister would have dealt with all these things when introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the knowledge we have of the Government's intention in regard to our road structure and to road transport, this Bill is premature.  One could say that the pre-election Fianna Fáil manifesto has become a book of reference to which we refer now and again when we want to find out the Government's thinking, and in regard to roads the manifesto told us that it is the Government's intention to prepare a major road development plan designed to anticipate the demand of the eighties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I should like the Minister to tell us&mdash;I had thought he would do so when introducing the Bill&mdash;if he and the Government have taken steps to prepare the major road development plan designed to anticipate the demand of the eighties, and is it part of that plan that road users are to be charged tolls?  The Minister has just told me he has taken steps to prepare the road development plan mentioned in the manifesto.  The people of the country, especially those who rejoiced so much when the road tax was abolished, are entitled to be told if it is part of that plan to charge tolls, and if so to what extent.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is in course of preparing the major road plan promised in the manifesto, I take it he has set up some sort of committee, even at inter-departmental level.  We are entitled to know whether the Minister has received an interim report from such a body. Deputies are entitled to get that information.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the present most unsatisfactory system of appeals procedure to determine eligibility for benefits under social welfare legislation, calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to establish a system of independent appeals tribunals to determine all such appeals.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of the Minister reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to examine the appeals procedure in relation to the determination of eligibility for benefits under the social welfare legislation with a view to effecting improvements therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this motion I am endeavouring to highlight the unsatisfactory social welfare appeals system and I am asking the Minister to establish a system that will protect the rights of social welfare recipients by giving them access to an independent appeals tribunal when they consider that their entitlements have not been administered justly.  In this context it is important not only that justice be done but that justice be seen to be done. I am calling on the Minister also to end the blatant discrimination against married women in respect of unemployment benefit in so far as the mere fact of a married woman having a child disqualifies her in practice from receiving unemployment benefit.  I am calling on the Minister to bring increased pressure to bear on his colleagues in Government to speed up the implementation of the EEC directive on equal treatment of men and women in the area of social welfare. The rapid introduction of this directive would remove discrimination such as that practised blatantly against married women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present time span for the introduction of this directive is much too <Col N="1563" /> long in terms of establishing the rights of women in all spheres of Irish society. Surely the directive merits a much greater priority than the six-year limit would appear to indicate.</P>
    <P>In putting forward this motion for an independent appeals tribunal I am not trying to open the floodgates in respect of social welfare, to create a situation in which those who are not entitled to social welfare payments might receive them.  Neither is it the purpose of this motion to protect those who might be defrauding the social welfare system. The purpose of the motion is to protect the rights of social welfare recipients who are being denied a proper appeals system.  These rights are referred to explicitly at paragraph 2.16, page 23 of the White Paper where it is stated that:</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government are aware that in dealing with large bureaucracies, individuals can encounter difficulties in seeking to obtain their rights.  The implementation of modern welfare legislation inevitably involves complicated administrative machinery.  It is essential, therefore, to ensure that, in the administration of existing services and the design of new ones, the need is recognised for the greatest degree of simplicity consistent with proper management and control of the services and that the rights and dignity of the individual are protected.</P>
    <P>Basically that is what I am trying to achieve in this motion.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the Minister appoints deciding officers. A married girl who has a baby and who applies for unemployment benefit finds that her application at her local social welfare exchange is rejected by virtue of the fact that she has a child.  If she appeals the case it will be rejected.  It is this type of case that all of us here hear of so often.  The deciding officers are civil servants from the Department of Social Welfare.  Therefore, the whole system of decisions and appeals regarding social welfare payments rests within the Department.  It is not a good practice to have civil servants policing civil servants but that is the situation in relation to <Col N="1564" /> these appeals because civil servants as appeals officers are adjudicating on decisions that have been made by civil servants in the first place.  In accordance with the provisions of the 1952 Act the decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>One might say that any individual has the right to appeal a decision to the High Court and it may be said that the Minister has the right to refer a decision to the High Court at the request of the chief appeals officer.  However, the 1952 Social Welfare Act contains a &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; clause because it precludes appeals on the issues of disqualification for unemployment benefit and for social welfare benefit.  These are the two issues we are talking about but they are the very ones that are precluded from appeal to the High Court.  That is discriminating against people who are social welfare contributors.  The questions that can be referred to the High Court have no relationship to these issues.  They are merely minor technical details relating to matters of law.  I have endeavoured to have a case challenged but I was precluded from doing so by virtue of the 1952 Act.  The real substance of any appeal is disqualification or the period of disqualification in respect of benefit but since these questions cannot be referred to the High Court we are saying in effect that there is not an independent appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>A large number of appeals are being rejected.  In 1978 alone there were disallowed more than 4,000 appeals for unemployment benefit while the figure in respect of unemployment assistance was more than 1,500.  In respect of disability benefit more than 1,000 appeals were disallowed.  Therefore, in 1978 61 per cent of all appeals in respect of unemployment benefit were rejected.  The corresponding figure in respect of disability benefit was 80 per cent while in respect of unemployment assistance the figure was 55 per cent.  I am not saying that there may not have been justification for these rejections.  It is not my intention to argue in favour of people who may be defrauding the system but we must provide the machinery for appeals to an outside body in respect of the decisions of a civil service Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> The number of cases rejected in 1978 was very high.  There is no provision for further appeal to a higher authority for these thousands of people.  There is a total lack of appreciation of the rights of social welfare recipients.  In many cases the appeals concern benefits that are financed largely by the workers.  The Minister has admitted that the State's contribution to the social welfare scheme is decreasing.  I suspect that the workers and employers are financing this scheme to the extent of about 90 per cent.  Unfortunately the chances of an appeal being successful are increased considerably if a public representative attends on behalf of a constituent who is bringing an appeal.  This perpetuates the myth that a TD is a necessary intermediary in the social welfare system.  This is a dangerous situation.  An independent appeals machinery should function as guarantor of the rights of social welfare recipients.  It should not be a job for a TD since it perpetuates the belief that social welfare is not a social right or entitlement but rather something that can only be had through the intercession of somebody high up in the political field.  If we had proper appeals machinery we would not find TDs in the role of string pullers.  The public would not be under the impression that only a TD can secure someone's entitlement to social welfare.</P>
    <P>The major flaw in the appeals system is in its treatment of women.  The appeals machinery in the Department of Social Welfare enforces the discriminatory attitude that the only place for Irish women is in the home.  This may have been true to a large extent in 1952 when this Act was passed; but this is 1979, 27 years later.  Irish women are demanding their rights to participate fully and equally in Irish society.  This means equal access to employment and social welfare while seeking employment.  Unfortunately, the mentality of the Department of Social Welfare remains rooted in the old fashioned notion that a woman's place is in the home.  Married women with children are being disqualified for unemployment benefit solely on the basis that they have children.  The attitude is that if they have children they are unavailable for work despite the fact that <Col N="1566" /> they may have family and friends willing and able to care for the children during the day or that they may engage baby-sitters or have access to a creche.  These are things the Department of Social Welfare apparently never heard of.  They have not dragged themselves out of the dark ages when women had no rights. The Minister is perpetuating this by putting down this amendment which is sterile and means nothing.</P>
    <P>Without reflecting personally on the Minister, he reminds me of Ron Moody in the film &ldquo;Oliver&rdquo; when he was constantly reviewing the situation.  That should be the signature tune of the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;I am reviewing the situation.  This is another case of a review, a review.  There is only one review: take the machinery away from the Department and set up an independent appeals tribunal.  It is scandalous that this discrimination should exist against married women.  It reflects the snail-like progress Ireland is making in the area of women's rights.</P>
    <P>Equal pay remains a pious aspiration despite the EEC directive of 1976. Women are treated as second class citizens within the context of the taxation system.  Ireland is the only country in the EEC without statutory provision for maternity leave.  Our social system remains a showcase for discrimination against married women.  They have been receiving a low rate of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit. The duration, up to the last budget, was limited to 156 days.  It was more difficult for married women to qualify for unemployment assistance than it was for married men and more difficult for them to apply for increases in benefits in respect of dependants.</P>
    <P>The EEC has been in the forefront of the battle for equal rights in Irish society.  In December 1978 the EEC Council of Social Affairs passed a directive establishing the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  This directive is a logical extension of the EEC's commitment to the principle of equal treatment as regards access to employment, vocational training, promotion, working <Col N="1567" /> conditions and rates of pay.  The articles in the directive are of particular relevance to this motion.  I quote article 4 from the Official Journel of the European Communities:</P>
    <P>The principle of equal treatment means that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on ground of sex either directly, or indirectly by reference in particular to martial or family status, in particular as concerns:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the scope of the schemes and the conditions of access thereto,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the obligation to contribute and the calculation of contributions,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the calculation of benefits including increases due in respect of a spouse and for dependants and the conditions governing the duration and retention of entitlement to benefits.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>We are not meeting this directive.  The important point is that no discrimination is permissible in regard to martial or family status.  The fact that having children disqualifies married women from receiving unemployment benefit is discriminatory.  If we have not got access to the courts here there must be provision for access to the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Article 5 states:</P>
    <P>Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that any laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment are abolished.</P>
    <P>Ireland is showing an obvious case of blatent discrimination against married women.  Article 5 places a responsibility on the Government's shoulders to eliminate this discrimination.</P>
    <P>Article 6 deals with appeals and states:</P>
    <P>Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to pursue their <Col N="1568" /> claims by judicial process, possibly after recourse to other competent authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an obligation to fulfil these articles but he is not doing so.</P>
    <P>A married woman who feels that she is being discriminated against cannot take her appeal to either an independent tribunal or to the High Court even though the directives are there.  The Minister for Social Welfare is ignoring them.  This directive places a responsibility on the Government and the Minister to provide access to the court for women who feel they are being discriminated against by a deciding or appeals officer of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The cost of implementing the full EEC directive has been estimated at £35 million. The member states decided on a term of six years for its implementation. This is excessively long.  It would not cost money to set up an appeals tribunal. If we can afford £28 million to abolish car tax surely we can allocate £17 million for two years and implement the directive.</P>
    <P>The Minister is eliminating the discrimination against married women regarding the length of certain social welfare payments.  I pay tribute to him for his progressive thinking in this regard.  It was a positive move on his part and must be commended.  He has also removed the ban on girl school-leavers receiving unemployment assistance. This was a good move and I admire the Minister for it.  The motion provides the Minister with a golden opportunity to remove a further major area of discrimination and to speed up the implementation of the EEC directive.  Ensuring that married women who felt they were discriminated against had access to the High Court or to an appeal tribunal would meet his obligation under article 6 of the directive, at little or no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There are other examples of injustice under the present appeals system.  Married women are not the only victims of our archaic appeals system which fails to protect the rights of social welfare recipients.  There is the question of disputes over disability benefit.  No doubt <Col N="1569" /> the Minister as a Deputy has come across such cases.  A man has injured his back.  The surgeon says the man has a bad back.  The wording of medical referees is interesting.  They say: &ldquo;is adjudged as not unfit for work&rdquo;.  The appeals officer always accept the decision of the medical referee.  Where a social welfare contributor makes an appeal for disability benefit he must be entitled to appeal against the decision of the appeals officer or the medical referee.  I knew of a case of a man employed by Dublin Corporation who injured his back.  He was told by the medical referee of Dublin Corporation that he could not work with the corporation and he applied for disability benefit.  However, he was declared fit for work even though the medical referee employed by Dublin Corporation, a professor, had declared him unfit for work.  There was a vicious circle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It turned out that it would take four months to get an appointment with the orthopaedic surgeon so that he might write an opinion. We could not see the medical referee for Dublin Corporation and we went back to the medical referee in the Department of Social Welfare.  In the meantime the man almost starved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Doctors have disagreed and patients have suffered very badly, both at the hands of doctors bureaucracy and State bureaucracy.  It is a deplorable situation.  There is another point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, namely, where recipients of unemployment assistance are asked for proof that they have looked for work.  Many people have written to hundreds of employers applying for jobs and often they do not get even an acknowledgment.  How can they show proof that they have applied for a job?  Must they ask the employer for a letter confirming that fact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister credit when he does something to help. Perhaps people applying for assistance should register with the National Manpower Service?  I should like more jobs to be offered to that organisation rather than to other bodies.  The National Manpower Service have a vital role to play. All vacancies should be referred to them. People could get appointments for interviews and that would be proof that they were applying for jobs.  It is not my aim to protect the swindler or the person who is trying to con the Department.  I am trying to help the genuine person <Col N="1571" /> who cannot even get a reply to his application for a job.</P>
      <P>There is also the situation where the employee walks out of a job.  I have seen this happen.  The person can be so intimidated, so frustrated and he can be worked to a pitch of desperation because of harassment by the boss that he walks out in a fit of temper.  A boss can put a man out of employment in a number of ways without firing him; he can make a person's life so impossible that he has no alternative.  Recently I stopped a man from walking out of his job.  He was under intense pressure and he told me his employer was making his life a hell and that he was not sleeping at night.  I asked him to consider getting somebody to talk to his employer, or even to take a week's leave to pull himself together.  If a man walks out under that kind of duress he is deprived of unemployment benefit because the employer will say he has walked out.  That man has no appeal to any body outside the Department of Social Welfare and it is grossly unjust. He is deprived of unemployment benefit for six weeks.  He should have the right to an independent appeals tribunal if he considers he has been treated wrongly by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I do not think an appeal to the High Court is the answer.  That would be both complex and expensive and would not be available to the general public.  It would be beyond their means and I do not think the Minister would like that to happen. We would be making things just as bad.  We have a Rights Commissioner. Surely it should be possible to establish a tribunal on those lines to deal with such matters?  Perhaps it could be composed of trade union officials or someone else. It would not cost £10,000 per year and it could be done quite easily.  Not only would justice be done but it would be seen to be done.  The Rights Commissioner adjudicates on unfair dismissals and he does a good job.  An outside objective body would best serve the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion strikes at the heart of our concept of social welfare.  We must decide if social welfare is a social right or a charitable hand-out from a benevolent state.  The impression is given that it is a <Col N="1572" /> charitable hand-out.  If we consider social welfare as just that, the recipients have no real entitlement to the services. If that is our concept the people should just take what they get and that is how we should talk to them.  An appeals system run exclusively by the Department is quite compatible with such a concept.  No explanation is given to people; all they are told is that they have a right to appeal to an appeals officer and nothing else.  No explanation is given as to why they were rejected.  I have tried several times to get an explanation but I did not succeed.  Is a married woman with a child rejected because she has a child?  If a public representative intervenes on her behalf, or goes with her before the appeals officer, that woman will win her case in many instances&mdash;indeed in too many instances. That is wrong.  I do not think the Minister would like to see that system operating.  He would be opposed to it, and I would like him to be opposed to it.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister's amendment seek to do?  Without reflecting on him personally in any way, what he wants to do is to examine the appeals procedure in relation to the determination of eligibility with a view to effecting improvements. How could you examine that system?  There is only one way of effecting improvements, that is, to take the system away from the Department of Social Welfare.  The only way is to take it away from the civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>When I was pleading to have lay people put on the Medical Council I said it was not right that people who felt they had suffered an injustice and were looking for redress from doctors should have to appeal to a body of doctors.  In the same way, people who feel they have been wronged by the social welfare system should not be forced to appeal to the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not see how the system could be improved except by taking it away from the Department and setting up an appeals tribunal.  If the Minister said he would come back to the Dáil within three months with positive proposals I would support him.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to examine the appeals procedure in relation to the determination of eligibility for benefits under the Social Welfare legislation with a view to effecting improvements therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell's disappointment at my putting down an amendment in these terms should not prevent me from expressing my view that this motion is timely.  Quite recently I had an interesting discussion with the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union about this very matter and my mind was already directed to these issues as a result of that discussion.  I am glad to have this opportunity of teasing out the situation and the issues involved in the House.</P>
      <P>In proposing the amendment I should like to assure Deputies that I am not at all complacent about the present appeals procedure.  The aim should be to preserve what is best in the system while, at the same time, effecting any improvements which may be shown to be necessary or desirable.  The present system has very distinct advantages.  It is relatively speedy; it is inexpensive; it is expert; and it is informal.  It has been in operation for 26 years and, to that extent, it can be said to have stood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that my predecessor, who is a member of the Labour Party and who had full jurisdiction over the Department of Social Welfare, in his four or five years in office did not see fit to make any change in the appeals procedure.  I give him the credit of having examined it.  I am sure he did, but he was persuaded that the existing system despite its imperfections had certain advantages.  Then I have heard this discussion in the Dáil.  The approach should be to see first of all if the present system can be improved and if the imperfections can be removed.  In carrying out an examination of the system.  I receive suggestions from all those who are <Col N="1574" /> interested and concerned, and they are many.

      <P>I understood from the motion and from what the Deputy said that what he had in mind was something along the lines of the employment tribunal which operates at present under the Department of Labour.  That tribunal has three persons with equal voting rights&mdash;a legally qualified chairman and a representative from the trade union and the employer interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast to that, let me give a brief outline of our social welfare system.  I <Col N="1575" /> am empowered by the legislation to appoint appeals officers from the officers of my Department to decide appeals against the decisions of deciding officers and old age pension committees.  It is important to realise that there are two areas from which appeals can emanate&mdash;the deciding officer and the old age pension committee.  One of these appeals officers is designated chief appeals officer and his responsibilities include the distribution of the work and the prompt consideration of appeals. Appeals officers are of a senior grade and normally reach that grade only when they have served a number of years in the Department and have considerable experience of the system.</P>
    <P>They decide appeals on a wide variety of social welfare matters, a very wide spectrum of matters.  The main areas are insurability of employment, whether the employment is insurable, and different questions relating to availability for work, incapacity for work, claimants' means and the various contributions conditions.  In 1978, 18,000 appeals were decided and half of those were decided after an oral hearing and the remaining 50 per cent were decided summarily. At appeal hearings relating to unemployment benefit and assistance, two assessors sit with an appeals officer and these assessors are representative of the insured persons and the employers. In appeals involving medical matters, independent medical assessors are appointed where necessary.</P>
    <P>Let me give some statistics of the way the system is working.  Of 12,500 appeals decided last year, 36 per cent were decided in favour of the appellants.  That is not bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>And 64 per cent against.  The Minister should be positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how that compares with the ordinary courts.  I do not know, but 36 per cent successful appeals is not a bad tribute to any system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-thirds against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that there were 18,000 altogether.  Unfortunately <Col N="1576" /> the remaining 5,500 relate to old age non-contributory pensions and it is not possible to analyse them in the same way because the majority of them are appeals made by social welfare officers against the decision of old age pension committees.</P>
      <P>From the time of its receipt in the appeals' section of my Department an appeal which can be decided summarily is normally disposed of within a couple of weeks.  That is very important.  Oral hearings are usually arranged inside two weeks in the Dublin area and within four weeks elsewhere when they are not dealt with summarily.  That is still within two weeks in Dublin and four weeks elsewhere.  Deputies will agree they are reasonably satisfactory times, and time is of the essence in this matter.  I want to emphasise that aspect of it.  That contrasts with an average delay of seven to eight weeks under the British social security system.  That has to be kept very carefully in mind.</P>
      <P>The employment appeals tribunal in the Department of Labour heard 1,200 cases last year and the cost of those 1,200 cases was about half the cost of our 18,000 cases.  The employment appeals tribunal decides appeals on questions relating to redundancy, minimum notice and unfair dismissal.  The range of activity is nothing like as wide or as complicated as ours.  The problem in the appeals' tribunal is delays.  I am sure the Deputy knows from his contacts with the trade union movement, and others, that this is a very serious matter so far as that tribunal is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that if we were to have the same sort of system in this area as we have in the redundancy area of social welfare, the costs would be enormously greater and we could not attempt to deal with the cases as expeditiously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the same time, if that were the only system which would ensure fairness in so far as the appellants were concerned.  We would have to face that cost.  Cost should not be the final arbiter in this matter but it is certainly an important consideration.</P>
      <P>We should examine whether there is evidence to suggest that some sort of independent tribunal system could deal with the volume of appeals that we have to put through it.  In passing, I might mention that the British appellate machinery for social welfare matters involves independent tribunals and only 22 per cent of appeals are successfull, whereas in our case 36 per cent of appeals are successful.</P>

      <P>It has a bearing on the matter.  The Deputy made a strong case that our system was unfair and that some sort of independent system would be fairer to the appellants.  I am making the case that that is not necessarily so. One cannot dismiss as totally unfair a system which allows 36 per cent of appeals to succeed.</P>
      <P>The question of the principles of natural justice is as good a starting point as any to detail a number of the objections against our appeals system.  There are two principles of natural justice involved. One is the rule against bias which stipulates that no person may be adjudged in his own cause.  The other stipulates that both sides must be fairly held.  The argument put forward by Deputy O'Connell and others is that appeals officers are career officials in my Department and may be likely to uphold the original decision.  Against that, the legislation firmly guarantees the independence of the appeals officer. Therefore, he has no reason to alter his opinion in favour of the Department. There is no way in which the Department can influence his decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The court can accept and decide any appeal on a point of law. The Supreme Court judgement states that the duty is laid upon the appeals officer by the Oireachtas and that he is required to perform it as between parties freely and fairly as becomes anyone who is called upon to decide on matters of right and obligation.  Not alone is it in the law but the Supreme Court has asserted and defined the impartiality and objectivity of the appeals officer.  There can be no doubt that the appeals officer has complete freedom in deciding any case.</P>
      <P>The next question is, do the present arrangements satisfy the other side rule of natural justice?  I want to point out what the legislation confers on the people concerned.  First of all, it confers a right on the appellant to appear in person at an oral hearing or to be represented by a member of his family. Secondly, it confers on the appeals officer the power to permit representation by any other person.  The Deputy himself mentioned that a public representative can attend a hearing.  That is very important because it affords free legal aid to appellants who require it and the Minister for Social Welfare is obliged to bear the expense of that legal aid.  It gives power to an appeals officer to require the attendance of any person at hearings and to hear evidence on oath.  It gives a right to an appellant in unemployment cases to have his appeal heard in the presence of assessors, one from the trade union side and one from the employer's side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that a deciding officer <Col N="1579" /> is not usually present at appeal hearings. That is a practical arrangement as it reduces the administrative costs and avoids delays in the hearing of appeals. Not only have deciding officers other duties to perform but frequently they have regard to medical and social welfare reports in arriving at decisions. If the attendance of all or some of those parties were required, the routine work would become unduly cumbersome.  The documents relevant to the appeal are before the appeals officer who would, in the event of their being challenged as evidence, suspend the hearing pending the attendance of the appropriate departmental official.</P>
    <P>A major criticism of the appeals system, which has been stressed by Deputy O'Connell, is that it is particularly unfair to married women in relation to unemployment benefits.  At this stage, the only thing I can say is that we will have to examine that complaint. It has been voiced here during Question Time.  One aspect of it that needs to be considered is that a high proportion of unemployment benefit appeals are against decisions regarding availability for work, particularly in the case of married women with children.  We would all accept that a number of married women believe they are entitled to unemployment benefit when they have paid stamps for a number of years and it is difficult to persuade them that this other provision has to be operative.  Maybe we can change it, but it is there at the moment and they have to be available to work, and this is where the &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; starts.  Married women claim that they are available but the appeals officers or deciding officers decide on the basis of the facts before them that they are not available.</P>

      <P>The situation is exacerbated by the fact that a lot of married women feel that, having contributed to <Col N="1580" /> the social welfare fund for five or ten years, they should be entitled to this benefit.  I hope that at present appeals officers do conscientiously decide these issues. There is no reason why they should not.  Again to resort to the vernacular, it is no skin off their nose.  It must not be forgotten that we, the Oireachtas, have included this provision that the married women must be available to work.  If we were to take a decision and change that, then the life of the appeals officer or deciding officer would be much simpler, but that is another matter.  The question of being available for work applies not only to married women, it applies right across the board.  It is inherent and an integral part of the whole system.</P>

      <P>It is sometimes suggested that appellants are refused oral hearings.  Of course, appeals may be decided summarily at the discretion of <Col N="1581" /> the appeals officer and some 50 per cent are decided in that way.  I have mentioned that figure earlier.  Those appeals relate to situations where the facts would have been established beyond any reasonable doubt and they come mainly in the areas of means tests and failure to satisfy prescribed contribution conditions. I am informed, and I believe and hope it is true, that no reasonable request for an oral hearing is refused.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly there are people who feel that the informality of the present system does not lend itself to the proper administration of justice.  On the other hand, it is held that the less formal atmosphere is a strong point in its favour. Individual complaints concerning the conduct of appeal hearings are not so very frequent, and this might lead us to the conclusion that the system in general is satisfactory to the majority of appellants. Here again is an aspect which, in the light of this discussion here in the Dáil, we have to consider further.</P>
      <P>There are other areas also which require a hearing.  The first is the provision of information to the claimants concerned. I have been endeavouring to improve the facilities in this area, and many Deputies will be aware that we are making significant progress in recent years towards better information to the general public about the provisions of legislation and the entitlements of the person under the legislation.  We have also made considerable progress in the design of the forms that we use and the information leaflets.  We are trying to make them more readily understandable, to cut out as much jargon and beaucratic language as possible and to make them simple and straightforward. However, there is a point beyond which you cannot go and sometimes you have to have a legalistic phraseology, otherwise you will mislead.  There is still plenty of scope for improving the system of communicating decisions to claimants and an information leaflet on appeal hearings will be of use to the appellants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also become aware recently that some assessors are dissatisfied with their roles at appeal hearings and I am examining the arrangements for summoning assessors to such hearings and the case documentation which is supplied <Col N="1582" /> to them.  It is essential that assessors play a positive role at hearings, and I want to see what we can do to improve their situation and meet the complaints made.</P>
    <P>To replace completely the present system and put in its place an appeals tribunal is one option but I am not attracted to it at this stage.  The present system has the advantage of speed, low cost, expertise and informality and we should not just abandon those advantages. They are important.  The key element in this situation is the volume of these appeals which is 18,000, and with that volume and with so many people depending on the outcome, it is important that we have an effective, expeditious system.  The difficulty is in knowing where to maintain the balance between the fast, inexpensive, informal system on the one hand and the full rights of the appellant being granted on the other hand.  My view, which I have tried to enshrine in the amendment, is that at present at any rate we should stay with the existing system and see what improvements can be made in it and what specific things can be done to meet the more frequent of the complaints made about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke at some length about discrimination against married women.  I have already replied to that when I said that this system is not discriminatory against married women in particular.  If it is a bad system it is bad for everybody.  It is the same system rights across the board.  As a system it cannot be held to be particularly discriminatory against married women. Deputy O'Connell also mentioned that we are moving reasonably rapidly towards the elimination of discrimination against women in the social welfare system.  In 1978 we got rid of the discrimination against single women and widows, and this year we made a start on the married women situation by doubling the length of time available to married women for unemployment benefit.  That is a fairly significant start. The Deputy also accused me of having everything under review.</P>

      <P>Maybe, although there are matters under review on which people would like decisions.  On the other hand, in the 1978 budget and in the 1979 budget we have given effect to a myriad of minor improvements in the administration and implementation of the social welfare system and I will be talking about them on Thursday next when I will be speaking on the budget.  I would like Deputies to acknowledge that there were five or six fairly important provisions in the 1978 budget and there are ten or twelve in this year's budget, all of which go a long way to improving the situation for individuals or small groups and removing anomalies, hardships and imperfections in the administration of the system.</P>
      <P>I am not at all upset that this motion was put down.  It is timely.  It is an area which has been engaging my attention, and the House might accept what I propose in the amendment, namely, that a through examination of the existing system be carried out with a view to effecting improvements in it, in full consultation with all those who have an interest, before we make anything like the sort of major change inherent in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to have the same sort of difficulty with Deputy O'Connell's motion that I have. The motion reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, aware of the present most unsatisfactory system of appeals procedure to determine eligibility for benefits under Social Welfare legislation, calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to establish a system of independent appeals tribunals to determine all such appeals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke to that motion but Deputy O'Connell appeared to speak to a motion suggesting that an independent appeals tribunal machinery should be set up to investigate appeals decision, which is an entirely different thing.  Deputy O'Connell interrupted the Minister to say that he did not mean that there <Col N="1584" /> should be an independent appeals tribunal but that there should be an independent tribunal to appeal against appeals. I do not know how the Deputy expects anybody to come in here to make a contribution to debate a motion when he has an entirely different idea in his mind as to what the motion is about. Over the last few years I and my party have consistently set out an appeals procedure to be used against appeals decisions.  Unfortunately this Government did not implement it.  That is entirely different from saying that the system of social welfare appeal officers working within the Department ought to be removed from the Department and appointed to operate under the auspices of an independent appeals tribunal.  I am at a loss, and doubly so when I find myself in agreement with the Minister.  The Minister seems to have been misled somewhat, as I have been, by the wording in the motion.  I am in agreement with the Minister in his approach to the motion.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, as Deputy O'Connell said and as the Minister conceded that the system needs to be improved. There is no doubt that the time lag that evolves in the assessment of some appeals especially from rural areas is far too great.  The Minister ought to have dealt with the figures that obtain, the state of the backlog, the steps being taken to reduce the backlog, and how the system is being made more efficient. The Minister outlined in detail how the system should operate in theory but he might have told us how it operates in practice.  The theory shows that the system has many checks within it and it is difficult to criticise.  A good case can be made in favour of the present system of appeals officers operating as long as they operate efficiently within that system.  What is wrong is that they are not operating efficiently within the system.  Deputy O'Connell wanted a system whereby the people could go to the courts, although this is not contained in his motion.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Connell checks his contribution he will see that he suggested that people should be able to go either to the courts without cost or to an independent tribunal.  We all agree that there <Col N="1585" /> should be some method whereby if people feel genuinely aggrieved with the decision of the appeals officer they should be able to take their case to another authority.  Some years ago at the initiative of my colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, this party urged the Government of the day to set up an informal all-party committee to investigate the possibility of appointing an ombudsman to investigate grievances against the system of government and decisions within the public area.  That all-party committee met a number of times between 1973 and 1977.</P>
    <P>In the context of some of the committees associated with the House there was an unusual degree of harmony and agreement on that committee.  The committee recommended that an ombudsman system should be set up to operate in a number of areas for the first number of years until such time as he had a proper grasp of things and had an administrative system set up, and then he could be extended into other areas. The committee suggested that one of the first areas that ought to be dealt with by an ombudsman was the social welfare area where people with grievances were appealing against social welfare decisions. Since then the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, have taken no further action to appoint the ombudsman which was recommended by the all-party committee.  If that ombudsman were now in existence we would not need to be here this evening. Instead of arguing as to whether a dissatisfied person should go to the High Court on a point of law or to an independent appeals tribunal on a point of grievance, the ombudsman would be the obvious person to whom they should go.</P>
    <P>Because the appeals system would be contained within the Department of Social Welfare, the very important right of Deputies in this House to ask a question would be removed by the setting up of an independent appeals tribunal.  That is the final democratic check which we are inclined to forget, the right of a constituent to approach his democratic TD to ask for a question to be asked of the Minister either privately or in the House as to why a decision has been delayed or an appeal held up.  That right would be <Col N="1586" /> denied if merely an independent appeals tribunal was set up.  Too often the panacea for all our ills now is the setting up of an independent this, that or the other which would remove from the public the very important right to have their case stated in parliament.  That right is an inherent part of democracy and it would be removed by the setting up of a so-called independent tribunal.  We all know very well that if an independent tribunal was set up for social welfare appeals, the existing appeals officers in the Department of Social Welfare would be taken from the Department and put on the independent appeals tribunal and nobody in this House would have the right to say here to the Minister for Social Welfare, &ldquo;Why are your officers not making a decision in case X Y or Z in Castlebar or Donegal&rdquo;.  Whatever defects there are in the system, one can be sure that if one comes in here and puts pressure on the Minister he will put pressure on his officers to produce results.  The results may not be what one would wish but one accepts that the appeals officers are as fair and impartial as possible.  I also accept that they are hindered to a great extent by the amount of paper work and the backlog of work they have at present.</P>
    <P>The figures that the Minister gave on the decisions given on appeals, that from 36 to 40 per cent of the decisions are actually turned over, is a fair figure and would compare favourably with the courts.  There is no doubt that many appeals are made without justification. Only last night somebody said to me that their middle-aged sister had given up employment and was living with her aged mother who was seeking an increase in pension because of a dependent relative, on the basis that the sister was operating in a full-time capacity as a relative assisting.  On the original application form she showed that her brother who was earning a substantial amount of money was living in the house with them.  Naturally, the case was refused.  But somebody told her to appeal it and somebody else told her to go direct to the Minister.  However, she came to me and I said that quite clearly she was not entitled to this.  She said she knew that but wanted to appeal in any <Col N="1587" /> case and wanted me to write in about it. When you take out of the appeals machinery cases like that where people appeal against decision that are quite clearly fair and form no basis for appeal, the figures compare pretty favourably.</P>
    <P>The real fault is the length of time taken, especially in rural areas according to my colleagues there, to determine appeals. What is then wrong is that if a person is genuinely dissatisfied with a decision on appeal he or she seems to have no higher court to go to.  The higher court that could have been resorted to in the social welfare area and in other areas of public life is the ombudsman but this Government, for whatever reason&mdash; although ostensibly interested in job creation&mdash;have not created one of the most important jobs that could have been set up since the change of Government, that of an ombudsman apart from the system with an administrative team who could send for any file, examine it impartially and see if fair treatment had been given without it costing the aggrieved party a penny and, I suggest, with the experience of other countries, with very good value to the public. Members of Parliament and public representatives generally could have cases referred to him.  This Government have not agreed to the recommendation of the all-party committee on which, if my memory is correct, the present Minister for Finance served as a member and lent his name to the recommendation to appoint an ombudsman.  That is why we are discussing this motion this evening.</P>
    <P>I am told that at present in certain parts of rural Ireland, especially in the 12 western countries, people are being refused unemployment assistance and being encouraged to apply for the supplementary welfare allowance.  They are getting roughly the same money with one very important difference&mdash;they no longer appear on the live register.  The Minister may shake his head but it is time to ascertain exactly whether that is happening or not.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell, a large part of whose contribution was based on the fact that there is not equality of treatment, that the equal rights concept is not respected. <Col N="1588" /> But there is more involved in his motion than merely the equal rights situation. There is the position of people applying for non-contributory widows' pensions and old age pensions, the situation of the aged and of people, male and female, who feel aggrieved by the delays in the system and sometimes by the decisions of appeals officers.  This debate encompasses more than equality of treatment and the attitude of the Government in this regard.  In view of the firm promise in their manifesto, it is shameful that they should now be saying, one-and-a-half years after taking office, that they intend to bring in equality of treatment and equal rights over a period of six or seven years from now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating it to the appeals procedure in that I am pointing out that there is more than equal treatment involved.  There is the question of what is the proper and most efficient method of administering appeals impartially.  One can complain about the absence of equality of treatment&mdash;and I agree&mdash;but when it does not exist it is not fair to blame the appeals officer for the fact that the Legislature of the day had not allowed equality of treatment.  The appeals officer can only take the situation presented to him by the Oireachtas. <Col N="1589" /> What we want to discuss is the operation of an impartial system of appeals.  That is what this motion is about.  We shall have another day&mdash;perhaps several&mdash;to talk about equality of treatment.</P>
      <P>One of the important things is that in the existing system people have the right to go to a Deputy.  It is certainly wrong that the concept should be abroad that a Deputy can get somebody what is or what is not his right.  It is also wrong to remove from the democratic system a person's right to ask his elected representative to raise his case or grievance in his own Parliament.  I object to having that public right removed unless there is at least a similar right to go to an ombudsman, an impartial person outside the system, paid by the State, who can call for the file and carry out an impartial investigation.  I believe that is the solution to the problem that apparently lies behind Deputy O'Connell's motion.  I must say that I took a completely different meaning from his motion because of its wording.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the present appeals procedure is unsatisfactory because of the time lag, the back log, the bureaucracy.  I think the procedure itself would be fair if the person were also allowed to go to someone else if dissatisfied with the appeal.  The ombudsman is the ideal person and if the Minister wants to make a real contribution to improving the social welfare system, rather than conduct a review or make a speech, I urge him to urge his colleagues in Government that the position of ombudsman as recommended by the all-party committee should be set up without delay and that social welfare be one of the first areas which he should be assigned the right to investigate.</P>

      <P>I do not want to cast any aspersions on my colleague, Deputy Boland, but I must also say that the former Taoiseach approved a Private Members' motion in the name of a colleague that there be an ombudsman and we did not see an ombudsman emerge.  I was calling for an ombudsman and they did not come forward with him either.  In 1975 there was a Private Members' motion that the Dáil approve the appointment of an ombudsman.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Call him what you like&mdash;an independent body away from the Department.  Let the Department operate their deciding officer and their appeals procedure in the normal way. We would not slow up the appeals if we adopted this system.  My concern is that there is no court of appeal against the decision of the appeals officer within the Department.  I am not trying to create another massive bureaucracy but some cases cannot be dealt with properly under the present system.  The Act specifically states that there is no right of appeal against the appeals officer in the case of unemployment benefit.  I had a senior counsel look at this section because I wanted to bring a case to court on behalf of a person and the advice given to me was that I could bring every case to court with the exception of that one.</P>
      <P>Section 45 of the Social Welfare Act 1952 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where any question other than a question specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (1) of section <Col N="1591" /> 42 of this Act is referred to an appeals officer&mdash;</P>
    <P>The relevant paragraphs are:</P>
    <P>(a)  in relation to a claim for benefit,</P>
    <P>(b)  as to whether a person is disqualified for benefit.</P>
    <P>(c)  as to the period of any disqualification for benefit,</P>
    <P>Any question, other than those, can be referred to the High Court on a question of law.  That is why I stated that the Minister was misinformed.  I am not blaming him but he did not examine the matter well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a point in my own defence?  The Act is very specific about how a point of law can be taken to the courts under the Act but anybody can go to the courts <i>certiorari</i> about the administration of any piece of public administration.  There is nothing to prevent any citizen who feels he is badly done by by the deciding officer, the appeals officer, the Minister or anybody else, going to the courts and having the matter decided there.</P>

      <P>People seeking disability or unemployment benefits do not have a lot of money and for them to take a case to court would place insuperable obstacles in their way.  My request is simple: let the normal deciding officer decide and the appeals officer give his ruling but where there is dissatisfaction it should be referred to an independent body.  That is not calling for a dismantling of the machinery in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>To an independent appeals body or tribunal.  A person who is held by an appeals officer not to be entitled <Col N="1592" /> to a disability benefit, even though he is suffering from a severe back complaint, is held by the medical referee to be fit for work, although the orthopaedic surgeon feels he is not, has a grievance but he has no appeal against the decision of the appeals officer who held him to be fit for work.  I want an independent body established to consider such appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Only 20 per cent of cases would go before such a tribunal and no extra charge would be imposed on the Department. Not only would justice be done but it would be seen to be done.  It is not a lot to ask.</P>

I seldom call for a division on my motions because it is enough for me to win the Minister around to a way of thinking that will essentially get the essence of what I have in mind accepted.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the question, which it was necessary to divide into a number of parts, is as follows:</P>
      <P> (i)  <i>The procedure involved in tendering for the supply of (A) stationery and (B) printed matter to the Government and Public Service generally: if there is a closed list from which tenders are requested; if so, the frequency with which this list is reviewed</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(A) Stationery: For example, envelopes, carbons, stencils.  All orders for stationery placed by the Stationery Office are based on competitive tendering, tenders being invited from all known <Col N="1485" /> manufacturers.  The list of such firms is kept under continual review and new firms, as they come to be known, are added.</P>
    <P>(B) Printed matter: With the exception of a relatively small number of cases where because of extreme urgency normal contractual procedure must be departed from to ensure delivery, all contracts are based on competitive tendering, tenders being invited from all firms considered capable of carrying out the work in question.  As well, the great majority of term contracts, that is contracts ranging from one to five years' duration, are advertised in the daily press.</P>
    <P>(ii) <i>The criteria for inclusion on the list</i></P>
    <P>The list of firms from whom tenders are sought is based on the information available as to their capability to undertake the work required.</P>
    <P>(iii) <i>If others may apply for inclusion on the list</i></P>
    <P>Yes: the list is reviewed on an ongoing basis and is extended to include any new firm which asks to be included and which satisfies the Stationery Office that its equipment and staff are adequate.</P>
    <P>(iv) <i>The number of firms on the list</i></P>
    <P>The number of firms on the Stationery Office list from which tenders are sought is 84 for printing and 20 for stationery.</P>
    <P>(v) <i>The breakdown by percentage over the last two years of the volume of work per printer allocated in accordance with whatever criteria are used for assigning such tenders</i></P>
    <P>It is not the Stationery Office practice to disclose the names of Government contractors.  Because of the variety of types of printing and binding contracts a breakdown by volume is not possible. However, by value over the two years 1977-78, 90 per cent of the printing work was allocated to a total of 18 firms and the amount per firm ranged from under 0.1 per cent to 29 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> In relation to the remaining 10 per cent, the printing of ballot papers and of the Register of Electors, representing 6 per cent of total expenditure in the period, was assigned to 34 firms, and approximately 4 per cent representing special contracts was spread over a further 18 firms.</P>
