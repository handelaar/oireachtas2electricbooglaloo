    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the significance of the term &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; used on the current census forms and to publicly advise persons filling up the form of appropriate ways in which the form can be completed without accepting such archaic concepts and terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The census is based on the household form and it is necessary to have one person in each household responsible for the completion of the form.  No specific direction is given as to who this person, termed &ldquo;head of household&rdquo;, should be&mdash;this is a matter which is left entirely to each household to decide.  The term is used solely for the purposes of the census and has no deeper significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the assumption on the census form is that the head of the household is a male?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that other persons are required to state their <Col N="392" /> relationship to the head of the household in terms that make it quite clear that a male is the head of a household?  For example, the word &ldquo;wife&rdquo; is used but &ldquo;husband&rdquo; is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is so, but that has been the term used in a number of previous censuses.  It was used as recently as 1977 in the pilot census and the pattern has not been changed down through the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not show a great insensitivity to continue using the term at this stage when the purpose of the question could be equally well served by asking the name of the principal wage or income earner in the household?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be even more ambiguous because in some households there is unfortunately no earner as such.  That would be even more complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain why there is a need for one person to be responsible for filling up the census form?  Is this person liable for prosecution if the census form is not filled up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a requirement that somebody in the household, we take it, the head of the household, is responsible for completing the census form.  This is one of those definitions that we have used in a number of censuses and there has been no trouble.  I cannot understand why the Deputy is getting so excited about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the number of persons temporarily engaged as census enumerators for the forthcoming census; (b)  the number of these who had been previously registered as unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 3,180 persons engaged as temporary part-time enumerators on the 1979 census.  Of this total 196 were registered at their local employment office at the time of their application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard that as a satisfactory response to the unemployment problem considering that here the Government had an opportunity to hand out over 3,000 jobs, even though they are only temporary?  It has now transpired that only about 6 per cent of the people employed were registered as unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I though it was a poor response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister think it a suitable response&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; in view of the fact that when the 1976 census was postponed we were accused of not playing our part in the job creation programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I am disappointed with the number of unemployed people who were taken on to work on the census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure me that anybody who has another job has not been taken on as a temporary part-time enumerator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot assure the Deputy of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House anything about the method by which these 3,000 people were recruited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="394" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This was handled by the Statistics Office.  Responsibility for recruitment was handed to them in order to keep ourselves clear of the allegation of political jobbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made that allegation, but I will now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that allegations have not been made.  In our efforts to make sure that that charge could not be made, I am in here apologising for the fact that not enough people registered as unemployed have been taken on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am not making any allegations because I have not the material to make them.  Is the Minister telling the House that there is something unusual about allowing the Statistics Office to employ their own staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is the normal practice.  Is the Minister saying that otherwise Deputies in his party could put people into these jobs?  That was not the case when we were in government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is nothing unusual about the format followed on this occasion.  One of the factors to be taken into consideration was that in the recruitment of the enumerators the procedures involved preferential treatment for unemployed or otherwise needy persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not then be in a position to assure the House that his positive instructions, which he had no reason to suppose had not been followed, were that people who already had jobs were not to be offered jobs as part-time enumerators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not a positive instruction.  We have to ensure that the census is carried out in a comprehensive and responsible manner.  The difference between us and the Opposition is that we undertook to carry out a census.  We want to make sure it is done properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="395" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that, in the whole of this country, there are not 3,000 people who are not presently employed available with the necessary competence to do this job of distributing and collecting forms? Is he satisfied that the requirement to give preference to the unemployed was met when so few unemployed were in fact used for this purpose?  Is he suggesting that out of 100,000 only 200 have the necessary minimal competence to hand out forms and collect them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that, and the Deputy should not ascribe that sort of view to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister suggesting?  What happened? What went wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems is that for the rural census, which covers about 50 per cent of the enumerators, one of the provisions spelled out is that the person must have a full current driving licence and the use of a motor vehicle to get around in the rural areas.  That covers about 50 per cent of the census. In a way that eliminates a certain number of people who are unemployed and would not have the facility for doing that.  That is one of the factors entering into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Must rural dole drawers have cars.  If I put down a separate question next week, or immediately, asking the Minister if the Central Statistics Office can disclose how many of these persons already have other employment, will he be able to answer that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts down a question I will endeavour to answer it.</P>

      <P>Any company, whether resident or nonresident, is liable to corporation tax on the profits of a trade carried on by it in the State.  If the Deputy has information which indicates that the trading results shown by certain companies do not reflect their true profits from trading, I should be glad if he would furnish it.  The principle of observing secrecy in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers would prevent the Revenue Commissioners from disclosing the tax paid by individual security companies.</P>

      <P>As will be seen from the statement issued by the Government in regard to the agreement in question, if the new income taxation system is to be brought in, the VAT system will be operated without a refund until an amount equal to the amount foregone by the non-operation of the levy is recovered by the Exchequer. The Government have not referred to a system of taxation as single, long term and equitable.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give the exact duration of the period from 1 May 1979 during which the VAT system would operate without a refund, but it is likely that it would last until early 1980.</P>
      <P>The new system of income taxation would operate as from 6 April 1980 and the yield would accrue in course of the income tax year 1980-81.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy meant not the present system of VAT but the one that has been operating until recently, and his recollection of what I said is correct.  Certainly it represents the sense of what I said.  As I have indicated, if the VAT system is to operate in that way from 1 May, it will be for the purpose of recovering for the Exchequer any sum that would otherwise be lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the 2 per cent levy which we understand was suspended pending discussions going ahead now, could the Minister indicate to the House what is the Government's intention as to the first dating of a yield of tax?  What is the Government's objective in this area?  Which year can we expect to see the farming sector begin to pay some form of tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the operation of the levy has neither been abandoned nor suspended. It was due to commence operation on 1 May next.  As indicated there are circumstances in which this might happen. The question of the yield and the amount and the date of the yield that would come from a new system to be devised must obviously await the devising and publication of that system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the amount the Minister is going to get in lieu of the levy, if the levy is dropped in favour of a new form of taxation, and this is going to stop coming in early 1980, what kind of gap between that and the beginning of the new form of taxation does he regard as tolerable, given that any length of gap will mean a shortfall to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that clearly depends on the new system and the yield from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister what kind of gap he would regard as tolerable.  That is a question of asking him his view of what is regarded as acceptable. The answer to that does not depend on what is agreed.  It depends on what his view is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

The position is now that the <Col N="403" /> Minister leaves the House totally ignorant as to what his idea is on when yields may be available to the State from any other system that may be devised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that the question of the yield and the date of the yield and so on is a matter that can only be determined when the system is devised and published.  At least it can only be made available to the House when it is devised and published. I appreciate Deputy O'Leary is concerned with regard to the levy but I note of course that he and his party and his party leader were against the levy and I am consoled by their concern about it now.</P>

How does the Minister propose to fill the gap between the ceasing of the VAT system in early 1980 and that date?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that the intake of family farm transfers requiring current market valuation has more than doubled in the past two years.  Rapidly increasing land prices during the same period have necessitated more detailed treatment of individual cases and this has lengthened the time required to finalise each case.  Priority is given to cases where it is indicated that hardship is involved, for example, pension applicants. The staffing levels are being examined in the Valuation Office.</P>

However, it is not yet clear whether, or when, any proposal for a loan will be presented to the executive board of the bank.  If such a proposal is made it will have to be considered by the executive board of the bank in accordance with the bank's articles <Col N="410" /> of agreement.  So far as the Government's general attitude to loan applications by Chile to international bodies is concerned, I would refer the Deputy to the comprehensive statement made to the House by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, on 15 February 1979, in reply to a question on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that the Central Bank's estimate was made a considerable time ago.  Consequently, the Central Bank could not have been aware of a number of factors of which the Government were aware with the availability of information at the end of the year.  In particular the Central Bank did not take account of the fact that retail sales were buoyant in October and November.  Neither did the Central Bank have the full year's figures for investment. Imports of producer capital goods were up by 30 per cent in value with an estimated volume increase of 20 per cent.  This is a good indicator of the growth rate of investment in plant and machinery.  The volume of cement sales which is a good indicator of the investment in building was up by more than 15 per cent.  This kind of information was not available to the Central Bank when their forecast was made.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that at all. The Deputy is aware that the definitive figures from the CSO do not appear for some years later.  In fact, it was only last year that I received the definitive figures on growth in 1973 which, as the Deputy will recall, he used to boast about although he was responsible for only part of the year.

Will the Minister undertake in view of this discrepancy to issue a public statement which will be signed also by the bank, on the board of which he has nominees, to explain this discrepancy, perhaps in the terms he has used or, if possible, in more detail?</P>

Nobody outside this country of the kind referred to by the Deputy has any difficulty whatever in ascertaining what the position is.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Does the Minister know that VAT on new furniture in Northern Ireland is only 8 per cent?  They get six months interest free in which to pay it. Does he also know that at least a container load a day of second-hand furniture is brought across the Border into the Republic?  Our 20 per cent rate of VAT makes it difficult for furniture manufacturers in Monaghan to compete with new and second-hand furniture being imported from the North.  In the circumstances, will the Minister consider doing something to protect employment in the trade in County Monaghan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed about the period for payment of VAT in the North which, I understand, is three months as against two months here.  Our two-month accounting period was agreed as a compromise between the one-month period which was for turnover and wholesale taxes and the three-month period which was requested by traders on the introduction of VAT. While it operates to the disadvantage of some traders, it operates to the advantage of others, depending on the period of credit which they give.  As regards the difference in rates of VAT, this is true not only in relation to furniture but also in relation to a number of other items. Certain items are more expensive here and certain items are more expensive in the North.  It is one of the unfortunate consequences of partition and one that we have to live with.  As regards the situation of the furniture manufacturers, I appreciate the kinds of difficulties to which the Deputy has referred.  As I have indicated, it would not be possible to deal with the situation without doing <Col N="422" /> the same thing in respect of a large number of other items which would be at least equally entitled to consideration. The cost involved would be so substantial that I cannot contemplate it at the moment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister kindly agreed that the Monaghan furniture manufacturers are under heavy pressure from imports from Northern Ireland.  Surely he is not serious in saying that it would not be possible to deal with furniture without dealing with other items in view of the fact that in his last budget he reduced the VAT on certain equipment from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, apparently without any difficulty.  In view of the danger to employment in this Border county I urge on him strongly that he do the same for furniture as he did for hi-fi equipment in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations, 1979,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on 14 March 1979.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to change the rules governing limited eligibility for health services with effect from 6 April 1979.</P>
      <P>At present, persons with limited eligibility for health services are persons, other than those with medical cards, whose rate of pay or income is within a limit of £3,000 or, in the case of farmers, whose valuation is £60 or less.  There are many exceptions to this definition, however, related to the type of work performed, social welfare insurance status and other factors which have little relevance to a person's ability to pay for health services.</P>
      <P>The health services which are specifically available to those within the present definition of &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;hospital services, both in-patient and out-patient, together with subsidies towards the cost of maintenance in approved private hospitals and homes;</P>
      <P>&mdash;maternity and infant welfare services;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a drug subsidy scheme. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> The effect of the draft regulations now before the Dáil will be to allow benefits within this range to be extended to the entire population.  The delineation of the benefits to be available to each group of the population will be made in separate regulations under section 72 of the Health Act, 1970.  These regulations will not require the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but I think that I should at this stage tell the House of what I intend to include in these regulations, as well as what is dealt with in the draft before the House.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of the two new sets of regulations will be that services will be available for three categories of the population.</P>
    <P>Category I will consist of persons with medical cards who have full eligibility for all health services.  No change is being made in the composition of this category or in its entitlement to health services.  Somewhat less than 40 per cent of the population is in this category.</P>
    <P>Category II will consist of all persons, other than those in Category I, whose income in the year ending 5 April 1979 was less than £5,500.  Persons in this category will be entitled without charge to the full range of &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; services, that is hospital in patient and out-patient services, maternity and infant welfare services and the drug subsidy scheme.  About 45 per cent of the population is in this category.</P>
    <P>Category III will consist of persons whose income in the year ending 5 April 1979 was £5,500 or more.  Persons in this category will be entitled to hospital services on the same basis as for those in Category II except that they will be liable to pay consultants' fees.  They will also be entitled to participate in the drug subsidy scheme.  Somewhat over 15 per cent of the population are in this category.</P>
    <P>In addition to the services which I have described and which will be available specifically to persons within the relevant category, there are services at present available to the entire community without reference to income. These include in particular:</P>
    <P> (1)  immunisation and diagnostic <Col N="457" /> services and hospital treatment for infectious diseases;</P>
    <P>(2)  hospital in-patient and outpatient services for children suffering from mental handicap and mental illness and from a number of other long-term conditions;</P>
    <P>(3)  prescribed medicines without any charge for all persons suffering from a number of long-term diseases and disabilities. </P>
    <P>These services will continue to be available to the entire population.</P>
    <P>These changes in entitlement to health services are being made in association with the introduction of a system of income-related health contributions as provided for in the Health Contributions Act, 1979.  This system, which will operate from 6 April 1979, will change the present system of flat-rate health contributions to one which will be income-related.  The rate of contribution will be 1 per cent of income subject to a maximum contribution of £55.  Persons in Category III will pay the maximum contribution.  Persons in Category II will pay a contribution which will be graded with size of income: the smaller the income, the smaller the contribution. Persons in Category I will not be required to pay any contribution.</P>
    <P>The changes which I now propose to make represent a major extension of entitlement to health services.  At present an income limit of £3,000 operates for purposes of entitlement to hospital services and other &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; services. Under the new arrangements this limit will be abolished.</P>
    <P> (1)  for hospital in-patient and outpatient services, other than consultants' fees;</P>
    <P>(2)  for entitlement to subsidies towards the cost of maintenance in approved private hospitals and homes;</P>
    <P>(3)  for the right to avail of the drug subsidy scheme. </P>
    <P>In future everybody will be able to avail of these services without reference to income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> At the same time the £3,000 limit is being increased to £5,500 for purposes of entitlement to the services of hospital consultants and to maternity and infant welfare services from general practitioners.</P>
    <P>This new limit of £5,500 relates to income for the year ending 5 April 1979. It will apply throughout the following year, that is during the year up to 5 April 1980.  Before that date it will be reviewed having regard to changes in incomes and it will be increased again if circumstances warrant this.</P>
    <P>This limit of £5,500 will also apply to farmers.  In their case income will in most instances be calculated by reference to rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>In the case of a married couple, each of whom has a separate income, the entitlement of each will be assessed separately.  I have given some thought to the question of the entitlement of children in such cases.  I have decided that if each parent, on an individual assessment, is deemed to be in category II, the children will also be eligible for category II services, even though the combined incomes of the two parents may exceed the £5,500 limit.  If, on the other hand, either parent is in category III, the children will also be regarded as being in that category.  To arrange it otherwise would be inequitable in relation to families in which only one parent has an income.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with the medical organisations concerning this limit and its operation.  I had originally proposed that the limit should be fixed at £5,000 but having regard to the increase in average industrial earnings shown in the latest figure available, that is March 1978, and having considered representations which were made at the meetings with congress, I increased the limit to £5,500.  This means that 83 per cent of the population will be within the limit.  In considering this limit it should be borne in mind that eligibility in any year will be based on earnings in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I believe that these arrangements provide the right mix of public and private health care systems for the population <Col N="459" /> having regard to the excellent service provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  As 700,000 people participate in the board's schemes and this number is increasing all the time, it is clear that a large section of the population want to have the option of private care.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the limit chosen&mdash;£5,500 a year&mdash;I would point out that it is a very real improvement on the present figure of £3,000 a year.  Were we to have adjusted that on the traditional basis, it would have become merely £4,500 a year.</P>
    <P>As well as being a major extension of eligibility, the changes which I now propose will remove a number of complexities and anomalies which had developed in the present rules of eligibility.  It was necessary to adapt the rules at various times in the past to meet the requirements of changing circumstances. As a result, the criteria of eligibility have become complicated and many people have difficulty in understanding their entitlement.  There is also the fact that the eligibility rules, as originally devised, made a distinction between manual and non-manual workers and between different categories of social welfare insurance.  Whatever justification there may have been for these distinctions in the past, they are now totally irrelevant to the question of ability to pay for health services will be removal will mean that the question of ability to pay for health services will be decided by reference to actual income and this criterion will apply uniformly for the entire population.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that if these anomalies were to be removed some people must lose part of their present entitlement. This is unavoidable if the same criteria of entitlement are to have equal application for everybody.  There is no reason, however, why this loss of entitlement should cause serious problems.  The major part of hospital costs is the charge which may be made by the hospitals.  In some cases this can be a serious burden on an individual but, under the arrangements which I am now introducing, <Col N="460" /> nobody will be forced to meet this charge.  In addition the hardship provisions, under which the chief executive officer of a health board can arrange for the provision of services in any case which would result in hardship, will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>There is also the very important fact that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is revising its scheme of insurance to provide that insurance cover for medical fees will be available to everybody.  For a modest premium any person who wishes to do so will be able to fully insure himself against the risk of any medical expense which might arise during a spell of hospital treatment.  The board will also provide that current restrictions, related, for example, to age or to existing medical conditions, will be waived for a time to enable everybody to avail of this insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The value of voluntary health insurance is clearly seen from the fact that over 700,000 people are now covered by this form of insurance.  What I would like to stress in particular is that voluntary health insurance should not be the prerogative of any one sector of the population but should be capable of being availed of by all.  The revised schemes offer many benefits and choices and I would urge everybody to study what is being offered to see what is available to suit their circumstances and needs.</P>
    <P>As the Members of the House may be aware a similar resolution was moved in the Seanad last Thursday where the new arrangements were welcomed.  This welcome was based primarily on the real improvements which are being made in entitlement to health services.  A number of speakers were also impressed by the link being forged with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and the fact that the new insurance arrangements being offered by the board will complement the public health cover from which nobody need be excluded.</P>
    <P>It can be seen, then, that the changes which I now propose to make will have two important consequences.  In the first place, they involve a major extension of entitlement to health services which will ensure that in the future nobody need <Col N="461" /> fear the financial consequences of serious illness.  In the second place, they will remove the inconsistencies and inequities which have developed in the present rules of entitlement: everybody should be clear on his entitlement and nobody need feel that he is being treated unfairly relative to the rest of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health has a peculiar <i>panache</i> for making that which is tarnished silver appear to have a golden hue.  With that particular talent he can manage to represent a scheme which has inbuilt inequities and new anomalies, in return for abolishing existing anomalies, to be a comprehensive, all embracing one.  We have discussed the changes in the entitlement for health and hospital services several times already in the House.  This is one of the regulations arising on foot of the passage of the Health Contributions Act.  I would have thought that by now the Minister would have desisted from representing this scheme as being comprehensive in nature or uniform in the benefits it gave all sections of the community.  However, in the very last sentence of his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
      <P>......they will remove the inconsistencies and inequities which have developed in the present rules of entitlement: everybody should be clear on his entitlement and nobody need feel that he is being treated unfairly relative to the rest of the community.</P>
      <P>I propose to point out the sections of the community who will feel, and indeed feel already, they are being treated unfairly. Some of them rightly feel they are losing some of their entitlements; others feel they are being asked to pay more for less.  I do not see how anybody, even somebody with the peculiar talent for representing everything as a perfect improvement as the Minister, could represent to those people that they were not being treated unfairly relative to the rest of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is somewhat disappointing that at this stage in the development of our economy we see a change being brought about in the eligibility for hospital services, <Col N="462" /> which still has a relatively low income limit applied to it, and that that scheme should be represented as being comprehensive or all-embracing.  Following complaints voiced in the House, by some representative organisations and indeed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at the fact that there was a £5,000 cut-off on income and that people earning more than that would not have the same eligibility as those earning less, the Minister was moved, with a rather smaller than usual fanfare of trumpets but nonetheless strident attempt at sounding a note of self-congratulation, to announce that he was increasing the limit from £5,000 to £5,500, an increase which must be described as being of a derisory nature at the stage it was introduced, at a time when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were asking the Minister, as an interim step to abolishing the income limit completely, to raise the limit to between £8,000 and £9,000.  Instead of that the Minister raised the income limit in the order of £500 for income-earners and, curiously enough, made no attempt whatsoever to raise the valuation limit in respect of farmers.  Therefore, the strange multiplier peculiar to the Minister for Health in relation to assessment of farmers' incomes, which equated £60 valuation with £5,000 income, has been changed even before it came into operation to one equating a £60 valuation with an income of £5,500. I do not see the equity of that.  If one limit is to be changed then surely all limits must be changed.</P>
    <P>There are several categories which clearly suffer as a result of the scheme. Under the present arrangements all manual workers, irrespective of their income, pay 50p per week and are entitled to full hospital services but under these regulations manual workers earning in excess of £5,500 will be obliged to pay £55 per year, more than twice their present contribution.  In return for that they will get the same services they enjoy at present by with the important exclusion that they will in future be obliged to pay for all consultants' fees in hospitals. They could amount to a considerable cost and the only recourse open to such workers is to insure with the VHI or <Col N="463" /> some other body against that cost.  The Minister suggests that people need not feel they are being treated unfairly, relative to the rest of the community but in fact they are losing a benefit which they have had for years.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of the same negation of the principle that what one has one holds, the Minister has also, in his wisdom, decided to exclude those earning in excess of £5,500 who, as voluntary contributors were covered for hospital services, from that entitlement.  The situation with regard to voluntary contributors was that when there was an income limit in respect of social welfare contributions those who exceeded that limit were allowed an option to continue to make voluntary contributions which gave them a continuation of certain social welfare entitlements.  They were allowed to opt to pay a contribution which covered them for hospital services. A number of such people, when the income limit for social welfare purposes was abolished in 1974, found themselves once again paying social welfare contributions.  Representations were made to the Minister for Health then on the lines that such voluntary contributors should be allowed a continuation of their entitlement to hospital services, irrespective of the income limit at the time, because they had traditionally paid a health contribution when below the income limit and afterwards as voluntary contributors through choice. It was put to the Minister that such people ought to be allowed to continue to pay a health contribution and have an entitlement which they traditionally enjoyed. The Minister recognised the validity of that argument and allowed the continuation of the entitlement for hospital services to those voluntary contributors.</P>
    <P>However, those voluntary contributors, who have been entitled to free hospitalisation services in public wards over the years, if they earn more than £5,500 will no longer be covered for consultants' fees from 1 April.  Again, the Minister said those people need not feel that they are being treated unfairly relative to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> The Minister is consciously and deliberately removing their entitlement to that benefit and I do not see how they can be represented as being treated equitably.  The Minister is creating further inequity in the health service.  I am not sure how our courts would view a situation where people who traditionally had been insured by the State in return for contributions were now being asked to pay an additional sum of money but were being told that they would get less in return for it than they had heretofore.  That applies to voluntary contributors and to manual workers earning in excess of £5,500.  I am not sure if the validity of the Minister's concept of social justice might be challenged in the courts but it would be interesting to see whether our courts would be in agreement with his concept of social justice.</P>
    <P>Many of the voluntary contributors I am speaking of are in the public service, and in the civil service in particular. They will now find themselves getting less cover in return for the payment of an additional sum of money.  It can hardly be stated that they are being treated fairly.  It is well established trade union practice&mdash;I thought this applied also in relation to dealings between the Government, as employers, and civil servants&mdash;that any benefit an employee had he held; his position could not be materially worsened.  When the new health boards were being created in 1970 and certain officers of the former health authorities were being appointed to those eight new boards it was clearly stated that any benefits those officers enjoyed would have to be continued. However, in this situation thousands of people who work in the public service and are entitled to free hospital services, including the cost of consultants, are now to lose their entitlement in relation to the services of consultants.  That is a direct negation of the principle that anybody in the public service could not have his position worsened relative to other persons.  That will also happen in relation to manual workers earning more than £5,500.  That is not acceptable to our party.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate <Col N="465" /> on the Bill dealing with health contributions the Minister introduced a late amendment to deal with the situation where a husband and wife are earning.  It was at that stage that we discovered that both income earners would have to pay a health contribution although the amount of entitlement would not be any greater.  The entitlement to a family where a husband is the sole earner extends to the entire family but in the case where a wife is also working the entitlement will still apply to the family although she must pay a contribution from April.  That family will not be treated fairly and equitably in relation to other families.  We asked the Minister to tell the House the position in relation to a two-income family where one of the earners was being paid in excess of £5,500 and the other less than that amount.  We pointed out that if the children of that family were assigned to the income earner who was being paid less than £5,500 they would be entitled to full hospitalisation cover, including consultants' fees, but if assigned to the other earner who was paid in excess of £5,500 it appeared that they did not have cover for such fees.  As well as being charged twice in the State scheme they had to face the additional burden of having to insure the income earner in excess of £5,500 and the children.  The Minister was upset at the fact that this point was made but, eventually, he conceded, as reported at column 1611 of the Official Report of 21 February 1979:</P>
    <P>I will be making regulations later, before 1 April, which will deal with eligibility.  Those regulations will have to come before this House positively. They will not be the sort of regulations that go by default unless somebody moves to annul them.  I would have to come here and propose these regulations.  At that point Deputies O'Connell and Boland will have ample opportunity to go into the eligibility side of things.  I said to Deputies O'Connell and Boland that as of now I am considering and examining what the situation of children will be in their interests.  I want to make sure that whatever eligibility regulations we apply to children will <Col N="466" /> be to the children's advantage.  Will Deputy O'Connell accept that?</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Connell: Most certainly.</P>
    <P>We will discover soon if Deputy O'Connell accepts what the Minister eventually came up with.  The Minister is now suggesting in his regulations that &ldquo;a person who is without full eligibility shall have limited eligibility for services under this Part&rdquo;.  It does not appear to me that the new regulation specifically deals with the situation of the children in a two-earner family where one person earns in excess of the income limit and the other earns less than it.  This matter is dealt with in the explanatory memorandum but I did not think that anything in an explanatory memorandum formed part of a statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>We are told in the explanatory memorandum that where a husband and wife have separate incomes the eligibility of each will be assessed separately.  I have pointed out how that does not appear to be a fair way of dealing with that family in comparison with the family next door who are a single-earner family. The explanatory memorandum further states that if the income of each is within the limit of £5,500 both they and their children will be eligible for full cover for hospital services.  This means that if the income of each income earner is less than the limit the children will be entitled to full cover, including consultancy charges.  If the income of one of the two earners is over £5,500 not only does he or she not get cover for consultancy services but the children will be denied cover for those consultancy services. The second income earner, who is earning less than the limit, will be told that each earner will be entitled to full cover but the children will be excluded from full cover because one of the earners is over the income limit.</P>
    <P>The position of the children in that family is materially worsened.  On 21 February last the Minister endeavoured to convince Deputy O'Connell that he was examining what the situation of the children would be in their interest.  He said he wanted to make sure that whatever eligibility regulations are applied <Col N="467" /> to children would be to the children's advantage.  I do not know if Deputy O'Connell accepts that but I certainly do not.  The eventual solution the Minister arrived at is clearly not to the advantage of the children in that family.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the situation in relation to farmers in the valuation category from £60 to £66.  I would have thought that, even with a shift upwards in the income limit for income earners, there would have been a comparative upward shift in the valuation limit for farmers to include that section of farmers on a valuation basis if the Minister's multiplier is equal.  That has not been done.  Although the income limit has been increased from £5,000 to £5,500 the valuation limit has not been increased from £60 in resepect of farmers.  It appears as if the farmers in the category from £60 to £66 valuation will not now get full eligibility although on the basis of the previous multiplier those farmers would have had full eligibility.</P>
    <P>There are some pensioners who have two pensions, a contributory old age pension and a pension from their employment to which they have contributed during their working life.  The combination of both those pensions can sometimes put those people within the tax net.  I do not believe that pensioners in that situation should be included in the tax net.  Under the Minister's health scheme that type of pensioner will have to pay the additional charge.  I do not consider that those people are being treated equitably.</P>
    <P>The one saving grace in this entire situation is that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board have rejigged their cover and the level of benefits they are prepared to pay to their members.  A number of people who previously had no need to insure with the VHI, the manual workers over £5,500 and the voluntary contributors over that figure, will now be obliged to contribute to the VHI.  Let us see how the situation of the category who were formerly VHI members has materially improved.  A married couple with two children who were insured with the VHI for private room treatment in a <Col N="468" /> hospital or nursing home and for consultancy charges pay approximately £180 a year.  I can give an example of my own case.  I pay, through a group scheme in the House.  £184.68 per annum to cover my wife, my two children and myself for private room treatment. From the beginning of next week, if I want to retain the same level of cover through the combination of the State's scheme and VHI units under their rejigged system.  I will have to pay the VHI £184.74, an additional 6p.  I will also be obliged to pay £55 a year into the Minister's scheme in return for which I appear to get mythical benefits.  I am giving my own example because it is the one which applies to most people earning over £5,500 who have been insured with the VHI up to now.  Those people will discover, if they want to retain the same cover they have had up to now, that they will be paying the VHI the same premium and also £55 into the State fund which is not allowable against income tax.</P>
    <P>In relation to many people earning over the income limit the benefits which will accrue to them are rather illusory.  It would be better if we looked at this in a realistic way.  Obviously, in an insurance scheme on an income-related basis those who earn more will pay more and will to some extent carry the cover for those who earn less.  This party are not opposed to the concept of an insurance scheme.  We introduced the concept of insurance cover for hospital services many years ago.  This has always been a cornerstone of our health policy.  The principle under which the VHI operate was enunciated by my party in Government many years ago.</P>
    <P>The concept of changing from one inequitable health scheme to another and representing it to be a comprehensive scheme whilst still introducing into it an inadequate income limit does not appear to us to in any way bring about a comprehensive scheme.  Is the Minister claiming that a husband and wife with no children who earn £5,450 per year and who pay less than £55 per year in return for complete hospitalisation cover are not getting a better deal than a family with five or six children where the income <Col N="469" /> is £5,510 per year?  A husband and wife with no children or an individual who earns £1 less than £5,500 per annum will be entitled to complete hospital and consultants' cover whereas a family with five or six children, where the income is £2 in excess of £5,500, will have to pay the same amount of money into the State scheme but will not be covered for consultants' fees.  This is despite the fact that a large family are much more likely to avail of hospital services and to be liable for consultants' fees than an individual.  Is the Minister suggesting that a large family should not feel they are being treated unfairly relative to the rest of the community?</P>
    <P>There should be a comprehensive hospitalisation scheme on an insurance basis, as has now apparently been accepted by the Government.  It should be on an income-related basis.  If the concept of a no-income limit cannot be introduced at present, the reasonable call by the ICTU that the income limit be in the order of £9,000, pending its complete abolition, should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I accept entirely the principle that there should not be any limit and if the Minister wants to propose that to the House I am sure he will get the entire agreement of the House.  Then we could claim&mdash;as the Minister has claimed unfairly&mdash;that we have a full, comprehensive insurance cover for hospital services.  If the Minister is working towards that end I should have thought that the suggestion of the ICTU that the income limit be raised to between £8,000-£9,000 was a reasonable one as an interim measure.</P>
      <P>The increase from £5,000 to £5,500 is of a derisory nature.  Families who are marginally above that income limit receive less entitlement than an individual. Voluntary contributors will have an entitlement that they traditionally enjoyed removed from them if their income is in excess of £5,500.  Manual workers with an income in excess of £5,500 will have an entitlement that they traditionally enjoyed removed from them despite the fact that they will have to pay twice the amount they pay at present. For all of those reasons I want to give notice to the House that we will oppose the introduction of these regulations. We will vote against them.</P>

      <P>Having heard what the Minister and Deputy Boland have said, I am more convinced than ever that there is a need for us to be more courageous and to bring in a full, comprehensive and free hospitalisation scheme.  Anything less is merely papering over the cracks.  It is merely a cosmetic exercise and is not eliminating the inequalities and the areas of discrimination that will exist with the in <Col N="471" /> troduction of these regulations.  Indeed, I can see more and more anomalies arising as time goes by.  There is a point in the Minister's speech which brings this home forcibly.  Within a year the anomalies will become more apparent.</P>
      <P>We are wasting the time of the House and involving the Exchequer in enormous costs because of the administrative obstacles that will be placed in the way of the implementation of this scheme if we decide on this cosmetic operation to tackle the health service.  The Minister has been bold and courageous in many areas and I would have thought he would have taken his courage in his hands and have come forward with a proper comprehensive health scheme.</P>
      <P>Such a scheme was mooted before.  It was argued that the doctors were opposed to it but I do not believe they were.  There was a shadow-boxing exercise in operation at that time but there were no proper, positive constructive proposals before them.  I was close to the scene and was reporting on it regularly and I was convinced that a comprehensive hospitalisation scheme could have been introduced if the Department and the medical profession got down to determined discussions.  Unfortunately that one opportunity was lost and that was a tragedy.</P>
      <P>It has created serious problems for many sections in the community.  I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity in trying to remove the anomalies but I am not too happy with the cosmetic exercise he has put forward in trying to paper over the cracks.  It will create more anomalies and further problems.  Next year we will be wasting the time of the Dáil in tabling parliamentary questions bringing to the Minister's attention the anomalies that have arisen and the serious hardships that have been caused to the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a demand for a full comprehensive hospitalisation scheme.  We should not waste money in trying to operate the scheme at the moment.  It will cost the State an enormous amount in trying to determine eligibility.  There is the fiasco at the moment where the local government <Col N="472" /> union say they will not co-operate in deciding who is eligible while the Medical Union say it is not their problem.  This row is developing because the Minister is not taking his courage in his hands.  He has said that 83 per cent will be covered.  Why do we not go ahead and introduce a comprehensive scheme?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House whether there is any suggestion that the EEC may be telling the Government that only private health insurance is the policy of the EEC?  The more I study this matter the more I am inclined to believe that this may be dictated to us by the EEC.  The Minister's suggestions may have been over-ruled by the EEC and I would like a statement from him to that effect.</P>
    <P>From examining the health services of the EEC countries I have come to the conclusion that private health insurance is becoming the policy of these countries and I am wondering why, because it does not make sense.  People in need of hospital care should not have to worry about the cost and the only way to avoid that worry is to make it free.  This would not eliminate the opportunities for private hospital care, if some people opted for it.  It would not lower the income of doctors or consultants because many people would opt for private hospital care.  If they want to opt for it, they are entitled to do so but in my view we should make available a free hospitalisation service for all and this is not what the Minister is providing.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that we should increase the limit to £9,000.  I am disappointed they have not come out strongly and courageously and said they will not accept less than free hospitalisation for all. They are tinkering with the system. Their sincerity is in doubt.  I would like them to speak out boldly on this one issue.  That is not what they are doing. To set a limit of £8,500 or £9,000, to me is nonsense and is not tackling the problem.  It is creating a two-tier system which is wrong.  I am surprised they are not making their voices heard more loudly on this issue.</P>
    <P>The present limit of £5,500 is completely <Col N="473" /> unrealistic.  It will not solve the problem but will create problems for many people.  We are talking about a limit of £5,500 gross which is completely different from the net income.  People earning £5,500, £70 a week net, will be asked to pay consultants' fees&mdash;up to £50 for an operation for an appendix. Has the Minister set limits on these fees? No.  No one knows what they are.  It is very wrong that we should allow this to happen.  These people will have to bear the burden of hospital fees and consultants' fees, be they medical, surgical or gynaecological.</P>
    <P>It is a serious indictment of us as politicians that we allow it to happen, no matter what Government are in power. Strong forces should be making their voices heard when speaking against this matter.  This limit of £5,500 is not realistic when one realises the amount of income tax being deducted.  I asked the Minister to whose income would the children be attached for the purposes of benefit.  He answered by asking if I did not want the rights of women established and had they not the right to pay?  I replied yes, but what about the children? He said he would see they were fairly treated.  What he is saying is that those children whose parents earn more than £5,500 will pay.  He is saying that the treatment they get, because they are paying for it, will be to their advantage, that they will not be harshly treated.  Is he implying that children whose parents earn less than £5,500 will not get the proper treatment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> I will put on the record how the Minister answered me on this issue.  A very serious question has arisen here.  The Minister said those children would not be treated harshly and that he would see it would be to their advantage.  At column 1611, Volume 311 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I will be making regulations later, before 1 April, which will deal with eligibility.  Those regulations will have to come before this House positively. They will not be the sort of regulations that go by default unless somebody moves to annul them.  I will have to come here and propose these regulations.  At that point Deputies O'Connell and Boland will have ample opportunity to go into the eligibility side of things.  I said to Deputies O'Connell and Boland that as of now I am considering and examining what the situation of children will be in their interests.  I want to make sure that whatever eligibility regulations we apply to children will be to the children's advantage.  Will Deputy O'Connell accept that?</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wants to make sure that whatever eligibility regulations we apply to children will be to their advantage. In a two income family, where one income is over £5,500, is he implying that because those children pay, it will be to their advantage?  If so, he is saying that children of parents under £5,500 income limit, will be getting second-class treatment.  This is a very serious danger. There is always the danger that any person in need of medical care who will not pay consultants' fees may be in danger of not getting the treatment he deserves.</P>

      <P>It will be a very serious distortion of what I am saying if it is suggested that I am condemning consultants, because I am not.  I am saying the Minister is building into this scheme a situation whereby of two people, one would be eligible for free consulting care and the other would have to pay for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the way at the moment with regard to manual workers, they are entitled to it no matter how much they earn.  I said in this House before that there is a danger that if a man with an income under £5,500 applies for a bed, he will get the bed and the consultants' services free but the man earning over £5,500 will have to pay the consultant out of his own pocket.  Human nature being what it is, we should not put a consultant in such a dilemma where he might be tempted to give preference to a person who will pay him directly into his pocket.  The Minister is building this into his scheme and it is a very dangerous situation.  In <Col N="476" /> every profession&mdash;architecture, accountancy, engineering and so on&mdash;there are people who might be inclined to consider monetary reward above all else.  It is not inconceivable that a person might give preference to somebody who is paying him directly, and the Minister has no right to build that into his scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that it would be to the advantage of children.  The Minister is going back on the promise he made me: &ldquo;I want to make sure that whatever eligibility regulations we apply to children will be to the children's advantage. Will Deputy O'Connell accept that?&rdquo; Is what the Minister is now proposing to the children's advantage?  It is not; it is very much against them.  The Minister asked me if I was trying to deprive women of the right to pay in their own right and I said I was not.  It was I who posed this problem which neither the Minister nor his Department had considered.  That is just one anomaly and neither the Minister nor his Department even thought of it.</P>

In a situation where a husband and wife are both earning and the wife is earning under £5,500 per annum and the husband is over that figure, the children will be unfairly treated.  They are discriminated against and that is wrong. Something positive must be done about this.  I would admire the Minister more if, in his reply, he said he was wrong in this, that he gave an assurance to the House and he was now going to honour it. What the Minister is doing at the moment is not to the children's advantage.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the ambiguous statement that it will apply to the 15 per cent who are outside the eligibility limit.  The figure of 15 per cent has been bandied about for a long time.  I have tried on numerous occasions to get some indication from the Department how they arrived at this figure in respect of people who are not entitled to any hospitalisation services under the Health Acts.  I have not been able to get any information about this.  In one part of the Minister's speech he said it was 15 per cent and in another he said it was 17 per cent.  Eighty-three per cent of the population will benefit.  There is an anomaly here.  If we could find out exactly what proportion of the population is involved we might be in a better position to see whether it is worth putting in all these regulations to extend the scheme.  It may be that only 10 per cent or 12 per cent are covered.  I have tried to get the figure from the Department of Health and the health boards, but nobody knows it.  The Minister should clarify what proportion of the population is presently entitled to hospitalisation services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may think he is appeasing a certain group, but consultants would be more than happy to discuss with the Minister the terms for a full free hospitalisation scheme.  They would give it their blessing and fully co-operate in such a scheme.  It is wrong to suggest <Col N="478" /> that they are opposed to it.  When the proposal was first mooted all they asked was that consultation should take place with them.  That is normal trade union practice: if one wants them to operate something, one has consultation with them.  The Minister should think again and stop doing a cosmetic job on the health eligibility scheme.  He should say &ldquo;I have tinkered around with this for long enough.  The administrative costs are enormous and it is not serving the purpose we all want it to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland has stated that his party are in favour of a full free hospitalisation scheme.  The word &ldquo;free&rdquo; is a misnomer because it must be paid for.  The means of paying for it could be open to discussion.  We, in my party, are united in wanting a comprehensive hospitalisation scheme.  With this side of the House united on the issue and the Minister knowing he could win the acceptance of members of his party to the scheme, is there any reason why we cannot extend the insurance or have it by means of direct taxation or a combination of both?  The Department of Health and the health boards would be rid of all the headaches associated with determining eligibility.</P>
    <P>A British executive with a salary of £2,000 or £3,000 a week can come over here and enjoy full free hospitalisation under EEC regulations.  Yet a person with a salary of £5,500 a year gross, or £70 after payment of taxation and other expenses, has to pay consultants' fees. That is a grossly unfair situation.  There is something radically wrong with a system that allows this to happen.  I do not begrudge the British the service, but why are we not entitled to the same benefits?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>There is also the very important fact that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is revising its scheme of insurance to provide that insurance cover for medical fees will be available to everybody.  For a modest premium any person who wishes to do so will be able to fully insure himself against the risk of any medical expenses... The board will also provide that current restrictions, related, for example, <Col N="479" /> to age or to existing medical conditions, will be waived for a time to enable everybody to avail of this insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the conditions will be waived, but he added &ldquo;for a time&rdquo;. That is the crunch&mdash;there is a trick there.  In six months a young man might get a stroke or a heart attack and he might find he will not be covered by VHI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister very courageously came in to help to eliminate some of the anomalies.  I would be afraid that in two years we will have serious anomalies again and we will be wasting the time of the House trying to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I would point out that from April about 20,000 manual workers will lose their rights under the social welfare scheme.  I do not think we have the right so to deprive them.  The VHI scheme will not be the answer.  The problem is getting worse and worse.  The Minister would have the admiration of the public and the support of the House if he took his courage in his hands and introduced a full comprehensive hospitalisation scheme.  That would ease the anxiety of thousands of people.  The Minister is not easing their anxiety by this, he is merely creating more problems and a dangerous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many old age pensioners who have a supplementary pension are being harassed by the Revenue Commissioners for health contributions at the moment. There are hundreds of people in my constituency in this situation, and I have written to the Revenue Commissioners on numerous occasions to have it established that they need not pay the health contribution.  However, in a few days time because of this legislation, they will have to pay the health contribution and this will lower their standard of living again.  This is grossly unfair.  The Minister recognises the plight of these <Col N="482" /> people; he showed his recognition yesterday by making a plea on the radio on their behalf.  The Minister stressed that we as a community must ensure that these people do not suffer unnecessarily and that we must do everything we can for them.  I admire the Minister for doing his best to ensure that these people get their pension entitlements. Can an income limit be written into these regulations?  Can we eliminate these people from the net?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not stop me from appealing on behalf of these people. If the Minister could in some way arrange to eliminate these people from having to pay health contributions, he would win the admiration of my party.  It would be appreciated very much if the Minister could instruct the health boards to consider cases in a certain income bracket for instance.  Will the Minister consider that?</P>
      <P>I do not consider the rateable valuation of a farm as an accurate means of assessing the means of a household.  The rateable valuation is not comparable to the £5,500 earnings of the average industrial worker.  There is a great disparity between the two.  Will the Minister when replying tell me how he decides that a rateable valuation is equivalent to the £5,500 income of the average worker?  The Minister's answer might enlighten me, as I am puzzled as to how one can be related to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister give me some indication as to what it would cost the State to provide the drugs subsidy scheme under these regulations?  Has the Department worked out the cost?  I wish to know how it will operate so as to be in a better position to assess the value of the scheme in terms of what it will cost the State and so on.  When the Minister talks about providing beds under this scheme he talks about it costing so much per <Col N="483" /> day or per week in a teaching hospital or a local health board hospital.  When we put down questions in relation to the cost of a public bed in a teaching hospital we get an inaccurate figure in reply.  The cost of the bed is given at an inflated value.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would not be within his rights in discussing the costs involved in hospital beds.  It does not arise here.  It arose on previous Bills and legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises in relation to the free hospitalisation and treatment for those earning under £5,500 per year and free beds for those over £5,500 per year. About 20,000 manual workers are being deprived of their rights under this.  They will be told that in return they will get the benefit of the drugs subsidy scheme. I would like to know what this scheme will cost the State and what the State will have to pay out for hospital beds for those who are presently not entitled to them.  In computing that cost we will have to know the cost per hospital bed in a teaching hospital.  In reply to Parliamentary Questions we have been given a grossly inflated figure which does not relate solely to the cost of a hospital bed, but includes the cost of out-patient services in a hospital.  In working out the percentage of the population that will avail of hospital beds during a year I must work out the cost, and to do that I must know these figures. I am not deviating from the subject of these regulations in discussing this; I am relating my contribution very closely to what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the VHI <Col N="484" /> provides an excellent service but it falls far short of what it should provide.  It does not provide adequately for the public.  It is wrong to think that when we opt for the VHI we are getting a perfect service.  The VHI is a very costly system. It is not fair to ask a person with a low salary of about £70 per week to pay out a big slice of his income to cover himself and his family under VHI.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that these people do not have to bear the burden of paying for hospitalisation.  To ask them to pay for it is grossly wrong.  There are 20,000 people who enjoyed this benefit up to now and who are now being deprived of it.  I am firmly convinced they have a case in law against the Minister and against the Department of Health.  I will be very anxious to see a test case being taken to establish their rights.  Have the Minister's Department considered the legal implications of what they are doing?  Is he satisfied members of the public have no case in law against him? It is important to mention that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said these arrangments provide the right mix of public and private health care systems. These regulations, placing as they do a serious burden on this section of the community, are not a proper mix.  They are an unbalanced mix.  They will not solve our problems. They are merely covering over the cracks.  They are creating problems for us in a year's, two years' or three years' time.  I would have great admiration for the Minister if he said in his reply this is the first step on the road to free hospitilisation and he hopes to come back to the Dáil in a year or two years and extend it to the entire population. We and the community would then have something to look forward to.  The Congress of Trade Unions would say it had their blessing if they knew it would not continue at this level but would embrace the entire population in, say, two years?  None of us would then be critical of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is my own fault, but the Deputies who have spoken seem to be under a misapprehension as to exactly what is involved in these regulations.  In <Col N="485" /> order to be helpful to the House I described what the combined effect of this regulation and other regulations which have been made or will be made will be.  In fact, all that is involved in this regulation is the extension of hospital services to the entire population.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland indicated that he will vote against this regulation.  He would be very foolish to do that.  I am probably not acting very cleverly politically in pointing this out to him but, if he leads the Fine Gael Party into the division lobbies against a regulation which does no more than extend free hospitilisation to the entire population, he will not be doing his party a very good service.  It will not redound to his party's credit in the futu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for that gratuitous advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just putting it straight to the Deputy.  This regulation simply extends eligibility for hospital services to the entire population.  No matter what Opposition Deputies may say, no matter what carping criticism they may devise, no matter what anomalies they may attempt to see, that is a major step forward in our health services.  All those people who up to now have looked with fear and trepidation at the bill they are likely to get for a stay in hospital will have that fear and trepidation removed from them.  I do not think all those people will thank either Deputy Boland or Deputy O'Connell if they oppose this regulation, whatever else they may do about the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now, in all the health services the greatest single burden that could be placed on any individual was the cost of a stay in hospital.  Deputies understand and admit that openly.  There are other costs in the health services which people are worried about and against which they endeavour to protect themselves but, above all others, the one fear people had was the cost of a hospital bill arising out of a serious illness.  Deputies who have spoken have chosen deliberately to ignore that a major step forward is being taken here by the passing of this regulation. <Col N="486" /> As I say, they would be very foolish politically, and in every other way, if they opposed the passing of this regulation through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were raised by Deputy O'Connell.  The first I should like to deal with is the question of farmers.  The question of the £60 valuation being equivalent to the cut-off point for limit or eligibility goes back over many years.  In my recollection the original limit of £50 set in the 1954 legislation was increased to £60 poor law valuation around 1965 or 1966. That is the traditional figure of eligibility for limited eligibility services.  Up to now it was equated with £3,000.  That would give you a multiplier of £50.  If you equate £3,000 at £60 valuation, that automatically gives you a multiplier of £50.</P>
    <P>Following through in the existing traditional practice, we are equating the £60 poor law valuation with the £5,500 limit, which gives you a multiplier of £93 per £1 valuation.  It is the intention that the £60 valuation would be equated each year to the increased limit for eligibility of Category II.  All we are doing there really is following on with the existing traditional relationship.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also raised the question of pensioners.  It is my intention to look sympathetically at the position of pensioners, particularly those on low pensions.  Deputy Boland and Deputy O'Connell both made play about the question of children and their eligibility. What I am proposing is very fair and in the interests of children.  If there is a two-income family, say a husband and wife with incomes, it could be argued that you should take the combined effect of those incomes to decide the children's eligibility.  Almost invariably the combined incomes would be over £5,500 and, therefore, the children would not be eligible.</P>
    <P>What I am saying in effect is that even though there are two incomes, as long as they are both under £5,500, the children qualify for Category II eligibility.  If there are two incomes and one of them is over £5,500 the children go into Category III.  That is a perfectly fair line of demarcation.  We are including it in the arrangements now and, as the <Col N="487" /> scheme develops, it can be looked at at any stage.  To get the scheme under way, it is a reasonable line to draw at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell was worried about the percentage of the population to which I have been referring more or less continually in all the discussions which have being going on over the past six months or so.  These are the best estimates we can make.  Most statisticians would agree with them.  They are pretty accurate.  Somewhere around 83 per cent to 85 per cent of the population will now be covered between Categories I and II. I do not think there is any argument about that figure.  Most statisticians and those who study those matters will agree that is the right percentage.</P>
    <P>I want again to recommend this regulation to the House.  It is the last step in a long process, which has being going on for over 12 months, in trying to bring about a major comprehensive improvement in our health services.  When the whole scheme comes into operation on 6 April we will have moved very far forward if not all the way in ensuring that nobody in our population need be denied any medical attention which he or she needs because of inability to pay for it.  Taking the whole lot together&mdash;the general medical services, the hospital eligibility provisions and the voluntary health insurance schemes&mdash;we will have provided a very comprehensive system of health care for our entire population.</P>
    <P>I was trying to be helpful to Deputy O'Connell in answering questions about the voluntary health insurance schemes. I want to emphasise that it is not my function to lay down the conditions of the different health schemes.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board are independent in the exercise of their functions and I think everybody in the House agrees that they have discharged those functions very efficiently and very well; they have provided a wonderful service, an increasingly improving service for our people since they came into operation. What conditions they choose to lay down and the type of schemes they decide to devise are entirely matters for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> They have been at great pains&mdash;and I want to pay tribute to them&mdash;to dovetail their new series of schemes in with these new regulations which we are providing. It is because of that they have made a number of special provisions.  One of those is the provision in regard to exempted illnesses and the age limit.  There are others of that sort.</P>
    <P>In order to get as many people as possible into the voluntary health insurance scheme, the board propose in addition to the very attractive schemes which they now have, to waive for a limited period a number of limitations which have applied up to now.  In a sense it is a recruitment drive with these special incentives. What the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are offering is a very desirable and important thing.  My understanding of the position is that anybody who joins now in this limited period when these limitations have been waived can remain a member for evermore with those limitations gone so far as he or she is concerned.  Most of the limitations apply to entry and if they are waived for entry that is the end of the matter; one is then a member of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and stays in it for the future.  These are matters which I am answering in an endeavour to be helpful to Deputy O'Connell but they are not, strictly speaking, matters in which I have a say&mdash;they are really matters for the board.  As I understand it, that is what they propose.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to urge everybody in the community, and particularly anybody who is in the role of head of the household&mdash;although I know that phrase was under attack here today&mdash;and who has, as husband or wife, responsibility for a family to direct his or her attention now to what the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are offering, what the schemes are and what the benefits are and to consider seriously joining up in this period which is being set aside for recruitment on very favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>Once again I want to say that this regulation is simply designed to extend free hospitalisation to the entire community. As Deputies know, at present anybody who has over £3,000 per year&mdash;the vast bulk of the population <Col N="489" /> except for a limited number of manual workers&mdash;has to pay the full cost of his hospital bills, the cost of the stay in hospital which is the big element, and consultants' fees.  In the first instance we are making large inroads into that by raising that £3,000 to £5,500.  The vast majority of the community can in future be assured that if they have serious illness their entire hospital costs, including the consultants' fees will be free.  Even that section of the population which is earning over £5,500 will have free hospitalisation.  The main bill, which is the cost of the stay in hospital, will be now covered and it is that bill which has been crippling most people up to now.</P>
    <P>In addition, those earning over £5,500 will now come under the drugs refund scheme.  These are major improvements and they are given effectiveness by this regulation here before us.  If Fine Gael want to vote against that they are welcome to do it but they would be very foolish to do so.</P>

Yet I am concerned to see the new rules published by the VHI which say on the front that they are applicable to registration date or first renewal date or on after 1 April 1979. Those restrictions are set out and they say no benefit is payable for illness or injury arising before the date of registration. This begs the question as to whether someone who is allowed to enter with a restriction waived will find after the date of first renewal that he is no longer covered for that illness.  The VHI have not made that clear in their rules.</P>

      <P>When I moved that progress be reported I was replying to Deputy Fitzpatrick. I explained that subsection (2) (b) of section 9 already covers the point made in the amendment in so far as it provides that an agreement under the section may provide for its duration and for its termination.  It would be reasonable to assume that the duration of an agreement would in the normal course be related to the length of time it would be expected to take in order to redeem the capital invested in a project and to gain a reasonable economic return on that investment.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives all the flexibility needed by the road authorities to determine the most suitable agreement in the case of a particular project.  It can safely be left to the good sense of the elected members of the local authorities concerned to strike the best and fairest balance between the interests of the public to whom they are answerable and any private entrepreneur who may be putting his money at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 9 provides and empowers a road authority to enter into an agreement with another person under which that other person would provide, maintain or construct a toll bridge or road.  He may only maintain such a road or bridge and in return he would be entitled as of right to collect tolls from the users of the road or bridge.  I put forward the point that these contracts are likely <Col N="494" /> to be entered in to only in respect of profitable sites which are almost certain to be winners and which will reap a very profitable harvest for those who enter into contracts and undertake to provide them.  I am concerned that the taxpayer or ratepayer should be protected and that these toll agreements should not operate indefinitely.  Not alone should the local authority or the road authority in entering into them have the right to write in a clause for their termination but it should be obligatory on the road authority to write into these agreements a condition which would bring them to an end when the contractor had been adequately remunerated.</P>
      <P>Experience throughout the world shows that tolls tend to be permanent and continue indefinitely.  There might be some sort of argument for that in the case of toll roads or bridges constructed and operated by road authorities or other public bodies because after construction costs have been repaid the money collected in tolls could be used to relieve people in respect of rates or taxes. That is not so in the case of toll bridges or roads built by private individuals. This House would be doing less than its duty if it did not ensure that these agreements are brought to an end when the contractor has been reasonably compensated for any money expended by him. That is a reasonable approach to the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister relies on section 9 (2) (b) which reads:</P>
      <P>provide for its duration and for its termination or suspension and for matters connected with or incidental or ancillary to or consequent upon the expiration of the agreement or such termination or suspension, and</P>
      <P>That is an enabling provision and does not state that the agreement should contain such a clause.  My amendment seeks to write into this section a provision that the agreement shall contain a clause bringing it to an end when the contractor has been adequately remunerated for the money spent by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make another point in connection with this amendment.  I am told that if interest and capital are <Col N="495" /> charged on tolls it is almost certain that these tolls will continue indefinitely.  I think that only the capital should be repaid by way of a toll and that the interest on the capital should be paid by the State as a charge on what used to be the Road Fund.  That may seem an extraordinary approach to the matter but its purpose is to ensure that the tolls will end quicker than they would otherwise end.  In other words, I am proposing that the State pay a contribution to cover the interest and that the road users would only have to pay a contribution to cover the capital.  In that way the tolls could be ended earlier than they would if the entire servicing of the debt incurred had to be paid by the road users.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I have already explained why his amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>With regard to charges against tolls, thére is nothing to stop the road authority contributing towards the capital cost in their agreements since they are to participate.  It is out of the question for the State to pay interest on capital which may be borrowed by a promoter.  Why should the State be asked to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I should like the Minister to say whether he thinks a bridge or a road should remain subject to a toll indefinitely. We tried to ascertain from the Minister of State at the Department of <Col N="496" /> the Environment whether many applications had been received from contractors for the construction or maintenance of bridges and roads in exchange for tolls. It is hard to get an answer from the Minister of State at Question Time but it appeared that few applications were received.  There was one in Dublin, about which we all know, and there was talk of a by-pass at Naas.  Those are two choice sites, two geese that are certain to produce golden eggs, two transactions which will not expose the operations to any loss.  It is hard to see why the State cannot build the bridge and the by-pass and thereby make a profit.  If the Minister is prepared to authorise local authorities to enter into agreements in respect of a bridge in Dublin city and in respect of the Naas by-pass, this House should impose an obligation on the road authority and the Minister to ensure that these agreements contain clauses terminating them under certain terms and conditions.  The House should retain control of the situation.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the section.  I would ask the Minister to amend the section in accordance with my amendment. If he cannot accept the wording of my amendment, he should introduce an amendment to ensure that the agreements are terminated when the contractors have been adequately remunerated for the money which they have expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that I am satisfied that this is provided for under subsection (2) (b).  It is not my intention to accept the Deputy's amendment. With regard to the point he raised about applications for a toll scheme, &ldquo;applications&rdquo; would not be the correct term.  What I and my colleague, the Minister of State, have said was that interest has been expressed in some areas with local authorities, but the question of an application or serious discussion could not get really under way meaningfully until such time as this legislation is passed and local authorities are enabled to talk about agreements and what should be involved in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interest has been expressed in a number of areas but no application in <Col N="497" /> the strict meaning of the word has been made.  The Deputy seems to select two with a heavy volume of traffic.  Naturally anybody putting up his money is going to look to where he will have a reasonable return.  This is quite understandable and nobody can deny a person the right to negotiate on that basis, but again, the agreement is subject to the approval of the local authority or to their being satisfied.  It is the elected members of the local authority who are involved here and again this has to be approved by the Minister for the Environment. Therefore, the question the Deputy has raised in his amendment is covered. There is provision for doing this.  The elected members of the local authority are involved and there is the appeal of the Minister thereafter.</P>

As a result of what his colleague, the Minister of State, said and what the Minister himself has just said now, we know that while there are no firm applications apparently in respect of roads or bridges which may be tolled, there are a number of inquiries which are serious enough to be accepted by the Minister as showing interest.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated his opposition to this amendment on the grounds that it is redundant or that it can be handled properly by the existing draft legislation and in the final analysis he would rely on the good sense of the local authorities himself anyway. He failed to point out that he would be monitoring the good sense of the local authorities and deciding whether their good sense met his definition of good sense, so that he would have to approve the toll scheme finally.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear him express his views on two things that give me some concern.  Suppose that the local authority display eminent good sense by deciding that they are going to exploit this position between one centre of population, that is, Cork and another centre of population, that is, Dublin, and by virtue of the fact that it happens to be located in the national primary route system they submit a toll scheme for improving that road in part and incorporating a substantial part of the existing public road.  The House will recall that we have established clearly that an existing public road can be designated as a toll road for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of Ministerial approval, unless the purpose of this legislation is to enable the cost of construction and provision of toll roads to be collected from tolls alone, we will be doing a bad day's work.  The intent in Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is to make that principle fairly clear.  One can only argue the case in abstract because we are dealing with a matter that the Minister has insisted on maintaining abstract throughout this debate.  Let us take the extreme example of a local authority who, for whatever reason, decide that they will charge tolls on a continuing basis on a stretch of road improvement <Col N="500" /> which would include part of the existing public road and part of the new facility which they would build. They would use that facility to finance other road activities in the area.</P>
    <P>It is not clear in the legislation and in the matters to which this amendment refers and which would become part of the total section, what the constraints would be other than that the Minister would have the right to approve or sanction. With all due respect to him, the Minister has been extremely unforthcoming in indicating any Government policy in this regard other than that he wants to facilitate local authorities in responding to the private sector.  That is the first question raised by this amendment.</P>
    <P>Is it clearly established now in this House by the Minister, and will he write into the regulations which arise out of section 8 of this Bill, that a toll road facility cannot be used to generate current income after the capital costs have been reasonably defrayed?  In &ldquo;capital costs&rdquo; I would include any risk or profit element that might have been provided. That is at the base of the amendment put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It is only reasonable, if the Minister has a view on this, that he should indicate it to the House.</P>

      <P>Section 4 protects the public or any objector with regard to having a public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite correct in pointing that out to me.  But there are so many provisions in this: the Minister has to approve the toll scheme; the toll scheme has to go on exhibition and be subject to review.  There are three potentially separate inquiries in relation to all of this.  There are various Ministerial approvals.  The public, as such, are protected by the fact that it is a reserve function in many instances. Therefore, the checks and balances are there.  However, there is not a clear indication from the Minister that a toll road should not be used simply to generate revenue.  The fear of Deputy Fitzpatrick&mdash;and it is a fear in which the <Col N="501" /> Labour Party would share&mdash;is that there is nothing explicitly saying that toll roads should not be used to generate revenue.</P>
      <P>The Minister can reasonably infer that the safeguards and checks are contained in the Bill.  But I cannot understand his unwillingness to accept this amendment when he considers that he has introduced this enabling Bill in the House to respond to the private sector and to improve the existing system.  Unless present Fianna Fáil policy has degenerated to a new level, at no stage was anybody on that side of the House suggesting that they were going to charge people for using the public roads system.  That may be in line with current right-wing thinking within the economic circles of Fianna Fáil&mdash;that one charges for everything&mdash;but the Minister at least should indicate his view, if he has one, on the question of toll roads being used to generate revenue after their capital cost, including whatever profit element is agreed, has been recouped.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Not alone does this agreement make it possible to generate revenue after the cost of the road or bridge has been repaid, and after a reasonable profit has been reaped, but it gives power to generate revenue for a private individual, not for the State.  If this was a matter only of generating revenue for the State, while we would not agree with it, at least we would know that if that revenue was collected by that method, it would not have to be collected by some other method.  But what we are doing here is leaving it open to some local authority, some Minister&mdash;perhaps in good faith&mdash;to enter into an open-ended agreement providing the contractor with revenue indefinitely. We are asking that a reasonable precaution be written into the Bill to ensure that that cannot happen.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am now more alarmed than ever.  I am convinced&mdash;and I do not like saying this&mdash;that the Minister either does not understand the section he is asking us to approve or he is trying to put forward a case which cannot be sustained by the section.  The Minister has said repeatedly that is an agreement under section 9 must contain provision for its termination.  That is simply not so. There is nothing in section 9 making it obligatory on a local authority or on the Minister to write a provision into the agreement making its termination obligatory in any event.  It can be an open-ended agreement that may never be terminated if this section is left as it is. Even if they did not go that far, they could write in some harmless provision to terminate it at the option of the contractor which he might never exercise. Either the Minister understands the section <Col N="503" /> or he does not.  If he is saying to the House that an agreement to be entered into under this section must contain a provision for its termination, I must say without doubt that the Minister has not read the section correctly because it need not contain any such provision; it may, but the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo; are very different.</P>

      <P>This question of the termination of an agreement after the capital cost has been recouped raises the whole question of cross-subsidisation. One policy or another should be pursued and clearly indicated in the legislation. In the absence of a national roads plan and a clear policy indication from the Government we must hang on to a piece of enabling legislation certain comments and observations in relation to the question of toll roads.  If the Minister does not have a view on the question of a coordinated programme whereby toll roads would by systematically used to improve the national primary route system and, contrary to such a comprehensive overall planned approach is introducing enabling legislation so that local authorities can produce a toll scheme for a part of their road system, then the question of cross-subsidisation does not arise.  However, the question of the termination of the agreement very definitely arises.  As that matter will be discussed on Report Stage I would be obliged if the Minister would tell the House the role cross-subsidisation will have in the improvement of the primary route system.  How does he see it being <Col N="505" /> facilitated and operated under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to enable road authorities to enter into agreements with companies or bodies to participate in the provision of toll facilities, including the financing of all or part of the cost of a particular toll project.  Participation may also extend to the construction, maintenance and management of toll roads, including bridges or tunnels.  A harbour authority could be party to such an agreement and the decision to enter into such an agreement is reserved to the elected members of a road authority.  The Deputy raised the question of cross-subsidisation, such as the using of revenue from a toll scheme to subsidise any other road works, and I should like to tell him that this is possible if a local authority generate such revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (3) a road authority may, with the consent of the Minister, enter into an agreement with the party or parties to amend an existing scheme.  For example, suppose Westmeath County Council were approached by a consortium of banks about financing a by-pass at Mullingar and decided to use part of the revenue from that toll scheme to finance the Athlone by-pass would they have to go through the entire process again?  A group of local authority members anxious to do something about the road system in their county will not concern themselves with one by-pass but will it be possible under this legislation for a road authority to produce a comprehensive scheme for the county in which as many as six toll road schemes could be included?  Is it the situation that each toll road scheme is a separate entity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Each scheme would be a separate entity.  The Deputy is correct in saying that subsection (3) provides for the use of revenue from one scheme for further works but under section 8 the Minister has the power to make the necessary regulation regarding the use of the revenue concerned.  It will not be possible to have five or six schemes in <Col N="506" /> the one proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not creating a lot of administrative paper work for local authorities?  If one steps outside the major cities one is talking about local authorities with reasonably limited resources.  Am I correct in thinking that the Minister's interpretation is that all local authorities will have to go through the same process for each toll road scheme they propose?  If that is the case is the legislation enabling in the sense that it could be?  The way the legislation has been prepared and presented is designed to facilitate the response from a private individual outside the local government system to come forward with a pet project rather than enabling the private sector to get into financing an existing roads programme.</P>
      <P>Since every local authority have a priority of road schemes I can see great difficulties for a medium-sized authority trying to work this legislation.  There are so many things that must be done that unless substantial advice, direction and assistance&mdash;financial and technical&mdash; come from the Department many managers will advise their councils not to bother with such schemes.  Will the attempt to provide enabling legislation fall flat on its face because we are making it difficult for county engineers and county managers?  I am sure county engineers will want the entire system of roads in their county improved on a systematic basis.  The Minister is putting an unnecessary burden on small local authorities that will have a deterrent effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's contention.  The fact that each scheme will be treated as a separate entity will not prevent them from having further schemes or having two schemes submitted by agreement with the same company at the same time.  That does not impose an almighty extra burden on them in reaching the type of agreement they would be satisfied with, whether it is for one or two schemes.  They will be treated separately when submitted.</P>

      <P>Would the publication of the notices for the public inquiry have to <Col N="507" /> be done separately or could they be done together?  Would the local authority have to take their place in the queue? Could the inquiry take place simultaneously on schemes A to Z or would there have to be a separate inquiry for number 1, another for scheme 2 and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be separate inquiries because the schemes can vary so much.  You could have a road, a bridge or a tunnel.  The schemes can vary so much that they would be done separately.</P>

      <P>How many applications are in the Minister's Department at the moment waiting the allocation of staff from the Custom House?  How many files and applications for decisions from the Custom House or O'Connell Bridge House are in the Department of the Environment at the moment?  The Minister referred to the common sense of local authorities.  Is it not an unreasonable inference to make here that many local authorities, given their experience of trying to get compulsory purchase legislation applications through, will be unnecessarily deterred as a result of the structure of this legislation?  The Minister has come into the House saying that he wants to provide local authorities with enabling legislation.  If a local authority attempt to do this on a systematic basis and come forward with a streamlined proposal, they will have to have each of the components of their toll scheme treated as separate applications.</P>
      <P>I believe the private sector have very little to offer in this regard except finance for schemes which local authorities already have designed and for which they are simply waiting for money from the Custom House.  There is an unnecessary amount of paperwork involved if a local authority want to run three or four schemes at the same time.  I cannot see why some provision cannot be made for this.  Perhaps the Minister might have another look at this between now and Report Stage to see if there is any way in which, under the regulations under section 8, all those could be grouped together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the House when those questions were asked and I read the text afterwards.  The Minister said that those places were mentioned in the House.  Was the Minister of State referring to the fact that Deputy Fitzpatrick, I or anybody else mentioned those locations?  Did he say that those places were mentioned in discussions, formal or informal, which have taken place between local authorities and the Department of the Environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave this information in reply to Deputy Quinn who asked:</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State in a position, without breach of commercial confidentiality, to answer the question, that is, the number of organisations that have specifically contacted the Minister, the number of projects listed and the approximate value of capital?  Surely that information is not confidential.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot give the Deputy the names of the persons who approached my <Col N="509" /> Department.  The position is that a number of locations have been mentioned, such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and the by-pass of Naas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn then asked:</P>
    <P>Can the Minister indicate the number of organisations that have expressed positive interest?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State replied:</P>
    <P>I cannot give the number but quite a number of organisations have approached the Department.</P>
    <P>Does that satisfy the Deputy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not satisfy me at the time and the Minister of State seemed to be so uncomfortable in giving that information that we simply backed off.  It is important to section 9 to find out what volume of interest there is.  If the Minister of State can say that a number of organisations have expressed interest&mdash;I want to say that I am not interested in the names of them and I am not interested in the commercial side of it&mdash;I believe we are entitled to get an indication now from the Minister of how many private sector organisations we are talking of.  It would determine the way in which this enabling legislation should be drafted.</P>
      <P>If there are only three or four private organisations in the country who are interested, and if the locations are quite limited as well, there may be a more efficient way of going about the question of involving private sector finance in the financing of the toll road system.  Can the Minister give the House information in relation to (1) the number of private and professional organisations, (2) the number of specific projects identified without reference to their location and (3) the approximate volume of capital which was indicated as being available for their participation in such toll roads? Is that information available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The secrecy surrounding this Bill becomes more alarming and more difficult to understand as the <Col N="510" /> debate continues.  At Question Time we asked the Minister of State to specify those locations.  As Deputy Quinn said, although he was obviously uncomfortable, he named, under pressure, those places as Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and the Naas by-pass.  The fact that by-pass is mentioned makes me believe that the other locations are bridges.  The extraordinary thing about today's instalment is that, when we asked the Minister to give us some more information about the inquiries he had received and where the proposed roads or bridges are to be constructed, instead of giving that information from his brief he seemed compelled to answer us by reading out information that his Minister of State gave at Question Time, thereby leading me to believe that he was afraid of giving more information or that he wanted to give the minimum information. That is not the proper way to treat the House.  What is the objection to being forthright with the House, of saying that there have been a number of inquiries for a bridge at Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dublin and a by-pass at Naas?  The Minister is being less than frank with the House.</P>
      <P>Why is he rereading something that the Minister of State told the House a few weeks ago?  It seems to be an extraordinary approach.  It appears to me that the Minister is saying that if he had been here he would not have given the House any information but that as it was once given here it is again.  The Minister should make a general statement on the inquiries that were made and on the companies or individuals who expressed an interest.  Another subsection in the Bill provides for security.  It provides that a local authority shall get a bond or something like that from the people concerned. The House is entitled to that kind of information, and I do not understand the Minister's reluctance to give it.</P>

      <P>In order to clarify the matter I read out his reply to the supplementary question.  The second time I referred to the reply of the Minister of State it was in order to clarify a question that Deputy Quinn asked me a few minutes ago.  It was not that I did not want to reply to what was said in the House.  Deputy Fitzpatrick may be right when he said I might not have given as much information as the Minister of State.  Let me reiterate once again that all we have had so far is an expression of interest by companies or people who are interested.  There is no way a local authority can take it a step further until the legislation is passed.  What is the point in asking for the names of people or similar information?  There is nothing to tell other than what I have said, namely, that there has been an expression of interest in different locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously saying that this Bill has been prepared on the basis of vague expressions of interest? We have not been told about the number of organisations and we have no idea of the capital involved, whether it is 5 per cent financing or 95 per cent financing.  In his defence the Minister has said that until the legislation is passed there cannot be anything firmer than an expression of interest.  Are we to take it that on the basis of such a vague expression of interest a senior Department have produced legislation of a substantial nature involving many discussions and that there is no indication of the likely capital there is in the private sector to finance the projects?  That is the inference we must take from the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have no desire to extract commercial information that may be damaging to the parties concerned, including the local authorities.  I <Col N="512" /> am sure Fine Gael have the same view because this matter arises in relation to other areas where the State is involved. There is a clearly established precedent for that in this House and we are not trying to breach it in any way.  However, we are entitled to find out from the Minister more information than he has given. During the drafting of this legislation surely somebody in the Department must have asked how much money the private sector could reasonably be expected to put forward, or were they flying a kite merely to catch the possibility of someone coming in on the project? When the people expressed interest, did they say what kind of percentage financing and what volume of capital was involved?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to find whatever formula of words is necessary to protect the interests he wants to protect.  I realise the commercial confidentiality aspect but surely the Minister is in a position to give the House some indication of the response that has been indicated in terms of money or alternatively if he chooses the other formula, of percentage financing of the six locations mentioned.  If the Minister refuses to give the information that is his prerogative.  However, if he says he cannot give us the information because he does not know, are we to take it that his officials have been working for the past year producing legislation in the hope that the private sector will come in but without any idea of how much money is likely to be there?  If that is the situation, one can reasonably question the Minister's responsibility in directing his officials to produce this legislation when there are many other areas crying out for legislative reform.  On numerous occasions the Minister has told the House that certain matters are &ldquo;under review&rdquo;, &ldquo;are being considered&rdquo; or &ldquo;are in the process of being drafted&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an instance of putting the cart before the horse.  It has been said repeatedly that an interest has been expressed to participate in providing capital for road building but now Deputy Quinn wants me to put a figure on it.  How can I put a figure on something, how can the nitty-gritty of <Col N="513" /> the matter be discussed, when the necessary legislation is not there to allow it to be done?  There is no use in talking hypothetically about how much money is available.  How can people enter into serious discussions when they are told that legislation must be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas to enable them to participate?  We cannot expect people to say that they have £X million available when some of them are not satisfied with the areas in which they would participate.  They cannot do so. They can only be firm in their expression of interest to participate in the financing of certain road buildings.  We will not be able to put a figure on any scheme until this Bill has been passed.  It is ridiculous to talk about £X million without having the necessary legislation.</P>

      <P>This legislation is being produced to facilitate people who would otherwise not respond.  It indicates clearly the kind of participation they would be expected to make.  Is the Minister saying that this legislation will enable someone in the private sector to respond and participate by way of financing and so on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that this legislation makes it possible to get down to meaningful discussions with persons or companies who have given a definite expression that they are prepared to participate in road building.  This Bill enables road authorities to have full and proper discussions on the basis of participation, the cost of any particular proposal, how it should be financed between the two bodies, the private sector <Col N="514" /> and the road authorities, or fully by the private sector.  Until this legislation becomes law that cannot happen.  I do not see why any financier or company should disclose what they would have available at this stage when they do not know where they are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we have got ourselves into an extraordinary situation if he and his advisers think that in the absence of this legislation nobody can be reasonably expected to come forward with a hard-edged proposal?  By &ldquo;hard-edged&rdquo; I mean indicating the percentage of finance or the amount of capital <i>in toto</i> that would be provided.  The House is aware, because reference has been made to it in the past, that we have such a detailed hard-edged proposal, and his Department and the Department of Tourism and Transport are aware of it. The Minister argued that he cannot tell the approximate percentage of participation the private sector are likely to be willing to give, how definite the expressions of interest are in terms of either the volume of capital or the percentage financing, on the grounds that until such time as the terms of the legislation are clearly published and enacted the private sector could not be reasonably expected to respond.  That appears to be totally at variance with the one hard-edged proposal we already have where a particular individual has gone through the whole exercise, costed a capital cost, the interest charges and so on and has come up with an estimate of what the toll charges would necessarily be to earn a return on that expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in saying that the private sector could not possibly anticipate the procedure whereby a scheme would be approved first at local level and subsequently at national level, but any reasonable person knowing how our country works would have one or two models he could follow.  There is no administrative innovation in this legislation. If an entrepreneur who understands local government had employed a retired city and county manager as a consultant, an hour with such a person would have given him a reasonable outline of how the procedure is likely to operate <Col N="515" /> and where the political insurance would be built in&mdash;it is built in here by way of the reserved function to the local members.</P>
    <P>Section 9 covers the procedures to enable the toll scheme to go through.  We are still forced to the conclusion that the Minister has spent a year of his departmental time drafting this legislation and either does not know how much the private sector are likely to put up, or alternatively knows and is not prepared to tell the House.  If he disagrees with that I would ask him either to demolish my argument or to tell the House the extent of the private sector's definite interest in terms of either percentage financing or overall capital.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister or anybody in his Department know if any person who expressed a definite interest mentioned figures at any stage?  The Minister's silence presumably means he does not want to answer.  Perhaps I should rephrase it.  When people expressed a definite interest, obviously that expression of interest was sufficiently strong for the Minister to draft legislation and circulate it to the various governmental offices.  Did anybody in the Department ask them what volume of money they might be talking about?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be argumentative.  I am trying to get some factual information.  I do not think the Minister has answered my question and the record will show that.  By way of parliamentary question and this evening, I have been asking these questions.  All we have had so far is an admission that the private sector have expressed a definite interest and that a number of locations have been mentioned.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick correctly inferred, by the way they were announced they all referred to bridges and the Naas by-pass. Section 9 is one of the key financial sections in this Bill.  This legislation has been drafted to facilitate a response from <Col N="516" /> the private sector.  The Minister said in reply to my question on 14 March at column 1458, Volume 312 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I would repeat that the Government welcome the response from the private sector as to the prospects of capital being invested in suitable toll projects which will help to supplement the amounts being provided in the public capital programme for road and bridge improvements.</P>
      <P>Does anybody know or did anybody ask the approximate amounts that might be made available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat what I have already said.  If you are talking about £X million, you are talking about meaningful discussions and you cannot have these discussions until you are in a position to talk hard business with these people, whether it is the roads authority talking to the private sector or at departmental level.  While we are awaiting this enabling legislation which will provide this facility, why should any proposer in the private sector disclose the amount of money he would have available until he knows where that money will be spent? If the private sector are interested&mdash;and they have expressed an interest&mdash;surely they expect to put up their fair share of the capital, whether it is the total cost or part of the cost?  By this legislation we are enabling them to get involved in this area.  We will be able to build better roads and bridges, faster than in the past by attracting this kind of capital to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As this legislation stands, the private sector have the upper hand in deciding where the money will be spent. They are the people who make the first approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is extraordinary. The Deputy told me, when we were last discussing this Bill, that this legislation would- prevent the private sector in Dublin from participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the private sector must at least be entitled to know where its money is <Col N="517" /> likely to be spent before it shows its hand.  The record will show that the Minister said something in accordance with that.  In relation to the Dublin project, it was the private sector that selected Dublin.  Whether the project goes ahead or not is another matter.  The question of the private sector not showing its hand because it does not know where the money is going does not arise. I suggest to the Minister that that is a red herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister has no indication of the amount of money involved. Perhaps I might be able to prise open a response in this way.  If the private sector does not finance it by 100 per cent but finances it to the extent of anything ranging from 10 per cent to 50 per cent&mdash;the Minister said that the private sector would expect to pay its reasonable share, and God knows what &ldquo;reasonable share&rdquo; is but assuming that it is 50-50&mdash;will the other 50 per cent, which would have to be raised by the local authority, be subject to the public sector borrowing restraints?  That question is at the centre of section 9.  Will it be designated in a separate category for the purposes of capital loans in contrast to the normal capital budget which the Department of the Environment would have for the roads programme?  This is extremely important.  Would it be subject to the constraints that the Department of Finance might introduce at different times and, indeed, to the constraints that are part of the policy of this Government in order to get borrowing down to a certain level?  If that is the case and if the private sector have good bankers&mdash;if they have money to invest in roads they obviously have&mdash;one of the assurances they will look for particularly if it is to be financed over two budgetary periods which for a major road programme is not an unreasonable length of time, is that the capital contribution from the local authority will be reasonably safeguarded and does not come under the axe of the Department of Finance on the grounds that the public sector borrowing requirement for this year is going to be reduced from one percentage of GNP to another.  For that reason it is important that we get some information <Col N="518" /> from the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>If the private sector were financing these facilities 100 per cent and were simply waiting to take their return by way of tolls until such time as the agreement would terminate, we would be dealing with a different kind of private sector involvement to the one that this enabling legislation envisages, which is participation and partial financing.  Could I ask the Minister how much capital has been indicated as possibly being available subject to all the nitty-gritty considerations being worked out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister, in the course of one of his interventions, accused Deputy Quinn of putting the cart before the horse.  One the information available I am forced to the conclusion that the Minister has provided himself with a horse, cart and all for a once-off operation. Either that or he has a lot more information than he is prepared to give us. We all know the amount of time and trouble involved and the amount of toing and froing between the Department of the Environment and the Attorney General's office and between those offices and the parliamentary draftsman's office which is involved in bringing in a Bill.  I find it very difficult to believe that the Minister has gone to all that trouble and proposes putting the Bill on the Statute Book on the off chance that someone in the private sector will provide him with financial assistance to provide these toll bridges.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he gave me the quotation by his colleague, the Minister of State, because I did not appear to remember what he had said.  That may be true.  I asked the Minister for the location of the sites in which the private sector had shown interest.  He kept repeating that that information had been given by his colleague, the Minister of State, but he did not give any more information himself.  It was only because of my statement that the Minister of State gave the limited information that the Minister read in the quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that inquiries were made about Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dublin and the Nass by-pass.  Would the Minister tell us if the inquiries about <Col N="519" /> Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dublin were about bridges over rivers?  If that is so, the interest by the private sector seems to be in bridge construction.  The Nass by-pass has also been included. Has the inquiry in respect of that come from the same source or is it from a different contractor?  These questions should be answered by the Minister.  Section 9(1) makes it possible for an agreement to be entered into with another person for very minimal services&mdash;for example, collecting tolls.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>Aware that the Government's income taxation policies have resulted in wage and salary earners contributing 87 per cent of income taxation;</P>
      <P>Aware that the returns from income tax will increase by one third in this year;</P>
      <P>Aware that the abolition of the Wealth Tax by the Government, together with the virtual abolition of the Capital Gains Tax and the Capital Acquisitions Tax by the Government have caused further inequality in the system;</P>
      <P>Aware that the process of abolishing the food subsidies has increased inflation and added to the injustices of the taxation system; and</P>
      <P>Noting that these regressive policies have resulted in massive demonstrations and work stoppages throughout the country by tens of thousands of wage and salary earners in recent weeks;</P>
      <P>Calls on the Government to&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  provide substantial relief in the Finance Bill 1979 to the PAYE sector,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> (ii)  radically reform the present system of income taxation,</P>
    <P>(iii)  ensure that all sections of the community pay their fair and just share of taxation,</P>
    <P>(iv)  introduce an economically efficient and socially just system of capital and wealth taxation. </P>
    <P>We have tabled this motion with a view to directing the attention of the Government and the House to the totally unjust form of taxation we have had for a considerable number of years.  Our motion calls on the Government to do four things, and I will spell them out.  The first is to provide substantial relief in the Finance Bill 1979 to the PAYE sector. We believe that the Finance Bill, which of necessity must come before the House in a reasonably short time, is the vehicle the Minister for Finance can use as an interim measure for the introduction of some degree of alleviation of the very substantial tax burden that falls on the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>In the period immediately before the budget, the ICTU made a submission to the Government in which they asked that at least £100 million relief would be given to the PAYE sector.  The Minister and the Government saw fit, apparently, to give them relief of £27 million.  This sector, who have no way of escaping even a halfpenny of their tax liabilities, are contributing 87 per cent of the total income tax collected in the State, and on the Minister's figures they will pay approximately one-third more, without any adjustment, in the current year.</P>
    <P>The taxation system here for a long time has been weighted against people who are least able to pay, and that approach has been accelerated by the policies which have been and are being pursued by the Government since they came back to office in June 1977.  It has been said that in our appeals on behalf of the PAYE sector we have concentrated on the farming community, that we have been engaged in farmer bashing.  If one looks at the record of this party, at the pronouncements of our spokesmen over the years, one will find that at all times we have had it as a fundamental principle that the only criterion <Col N="521" /> for the paying of tax is ability to pay. We are not asking that people would be liable for tax by virtue of their occupations, only that they would be liable for taxation according to their incomes, and that there is a direct responsibility on the Government to ensure that every citizen in the State would pay according to his income.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have tried to pull a con-trick on a number of people, particularly the urban dwellers.  At the moment, in the comments of members of their party, particularly prominent members, the Government are trying still to confuse the issue regarding their attempt to impose a 2 per cent levy on farmers.  They were somewhat surprised that this party totally and unequivocally opposed the introduction of that levy because its effect would have been to impose an additional layer of social injustice on the whole tax structure which could be described only as socially unjust.  That levy proposal did not take account of ability of farmers to pay.  The Government were trying to use the levy for application against any farmer, no matter what his circumstances, in order to cushion the effect of not demanding proper income tax returns from wealthier members of the farming community.</P>
    <P>This party are not interested in farmer bashing.  We are interested in social justice, which is one of the most fundamental principles of our party, and we are not selective regarding its application. We are concerned about ability to pay and responsibility in accordance with that responsibility to pay to the Exchequer what is necessary so that the State can maintain its services.</P>
    <P>The most encouraging thing about the recent marches and meetings that have been held to protest against present application of PAYE has been the consistency with which every speaker, whether at meetings or on radio or TV, has stressed that it is not a question of urban versus rural Ireland, not a question of looking for cutbacks in public services, but a question of a fair and equitable collection of the taxes neces <Col N="522" /> sary not only to run the services at their present level, but to improve them substantially. Various speakers have rightly said that if we had a proper and equitable taxation contribution from all sections we could improve our services substantially.  No one could justifiably say that our services do not need improvement. What has been the policy of the present Government with regard to taxation since June 1977?  When we joined with Fine Gael in a Coalition Government we made some attempt to restructure the tax code.  I would not say, nor would anybody else from these benches, that at the end of four-and-a-half years we managed to do so in a really substantial way, but a genuine start was made.  We introduced the wealth tax and for the first time we introduced farmer taxation based on ability to pay. The tax code is the foundation of many of the social injustices that go right through our economic and social system.  The system must be radically changed, not just fiddled with.</P>
    <P>Although this protest focused on PAYE one of the things that has come from it is the knowledge that it is a much wider protest against the kind of society that Fianna Fáil have imposed on the country.  From the early 1930s to the middle 1960s Fianna Fáil could be described as a radical party that got the support because they were believed to be concerned with social justice.  From the middle 1960s on they changed, but not as swiftly, as dramatically or as blatantly, so far as the electorate are concerned, as they did over the last 18 months. How could any Government in a civilised State remove a wealth tax which would affect approximately 5,000 people and give them a gift of £2,000 per year?  To be affected by the wealth tax these people would have had to have a minimum of £850 million.  Last Saturday morning two elderly sisters came down to my clinic in Camden Street.  They were old age pensioners who had worked in a certain confectionery firm in the city for 42 years.  They had contributed towards their old age pension week after week and after 42 years service in that private company they each received the princely pension of £5.40 per week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> The total income of each of them was £21.45 and out of that they have to pay £1.15 every fortnight to the Exchequer. That might seem a trivial sum but in 1979, did anyone ever try to live on £21.45 per week, to pay rent, to pay for food, for light, heating and clothing, and still keep any sense of human dignity? These two ladies had contributed to the building up of the State and had worked for 42 years and this is their position but the Government saw fit to give a gift of £2,000 per year to the 5,000 people who would have been covered by the wealth tax.  The only reason for this inequity, the only justification that was given was that if we did not cater for them they would not invest and produce jobs here and that under the Fianna Fáil grand scheme of what they described as job creation, it was essential that these people be enticed back into the country to provide the jobs.  What jobs have the private sector provided?  By Fianna Fáil's publications, despite their gift of £2,000 plus, the other benefits given through the capital gains tax, and the capital acquisition tax, what Fianna Fáil described as incentives, Fianna Fáil had to cut back on their job expectations from the private sector by no less than 10,000 over a period of three years.  This gift of £2,000 was described as incentives for this category but for a social welfare recipient it would be called a handout.</P>
    <P>How in a civilised community that calls itself Christian could the Government, that removed the wealth tax, remove food subsidies?  The removal of the food subsidies has had little effect on the wealth tax category and it would not be felt by Members of this House and their families, but it has been badly felt by those two ladies that I met at my clinic last Saturday morning and by tens of thousands of others in our society. Short term social welfare recipients were given an increase of 12 per cent in the budget, and long-term recipients were given an increase of 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>The consumer price index recently published shows that, under this Government who got into office to some extent on a commitment and a pledge to bring down prices, and food prices in particular, food prices increased by 18 <Col N="524" /> per cent.  Some people and some organisations talk about State involvement, State grants and State subsidies and condemn them if they are going to people in need or to low or middle income groups.  If we really examine State involvement, State subsidies and State grants, we find that some of the people who are most vocal in condemning them are the greatest beneficiaries.  They are not called grants in many cases.  When given to this class they are called incentives.</P>
    <P>I understand that in 1981 corporation profits tax will be limited to 10 per cent. Before they reap the benefit of that change in our taxation code, is there any obligation on any company or any firm to create jobs?  Massive grants are given by the IDA for job creation.  They are given for factories and equipment and then foreign industries get a 20 years' tax free holiday.  No one is suggesting from these benches that we do not need foreign investment.  Do the Government realise that by the mid-1980s over 60 per cent of Irish manufacturing jobs will be outside Irish control?  They will be controlled by foreign interests.  Unlimited money is being poured out in this direction. We all know we need jobs, but there are other ways of providing jobs and of ensuring that they are Irish jobs under Irish control and that they will contribute to the building up of our commercial and industrial sector.  We could also reap the benefits of many of the social aspects of Irish jobs under Irish control.</P>
    <P>Originally the Minister announced the 2 per cent farm levy.  He was very definite that there would be no change in it.  At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis as announcement was made that there would be a modification in its implementation, that it would not apply to certain produce and certain types of farmers.  I understand that modification would have cost the State approximately £4 million.  On RTE the Minister stated categorically that there would be no further negotiations on the implementation of the 2 per cent levy.  He said there might be a meeting with the farmers the following week where they could state their case, but there would be absolutely no concessions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>He seems to be prone to it, particularly with the press.  I was addressing a Labour Party meeting in Cork when I got a note telling me the meeting between the farming organisations and the Government had taken place and that the farmers' levy had been removed totally.  I was asked had I any comment to make.  I would not comment because I found it difficult to believe, even coming from the Minister for Finance, he would say on the national radio, and that he would tell members of the media, that in no way would there be any further adjustment, or modification, or whatever word the Minister cares to use&mdash;and the next thing we heard was that it was gone.</P>
      <P>I was opposed to that tax and I stated my opposition to it.  I am still opposed to it because it has no element of social justice in it.  It is an attempt by the Government to collect money from the farming community indiscriminately without taking into account what should be the fundamental principle of any Government in collecting taxation, the ability of the person to pay.  They thought they would be able to avoid facing up to their responsibility in relation to those members of the farming community who are able to pay and should be made to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been making other noises suggesting that on 1 May there will be an acceptable form of taxation for the farming community which will ensure that they will pay what he describes as their just contribution to the Exchequer, or that the 2 per cent levy will be reimposed.  When the Minister talks about the reimposition of the 2 per cent levy on farmers if they cannot devise a tax system which will yield what they should pay to the Exchequer, does he mean the 2 per cent levy announced in the budget or the 2 per cent levy modified at the Fianna Fáil gathering in <Col N="526" /> Ballsbridge?  We would not like to misquote him or do him an injustice between now and 1 May.</P>
    <P>The Government should wake up to the fact the 250,000 people approximately who walked through the streets of our cities and towns recently had as their focal point the PAYE system.  That was the issue that sparked it off.  The real issue is much wider.  There is a rejection, a clear shout to this Government from the ordinary people that they do not want the kind of society that the policies of this Government are creating here. They do not want the rich made richer at the expense of the poor and underprivileged. They demand that in this Christian country the Government should start behaving in a fair, just and equitable way towards every section in this community and not behave as they have been behaving; by responding only to organised groups because they have political muscle, as they had out in Ballsbridge over the 2 per cent levy, because they have economic muscle, as have some of the organisations here.  There are other sections in Irish society. Although they apparently have no voice, no political muscle, no organisational muscle, no economic muscle, expression has been given to their views by the tens of thousands of marching feet in the cities and towns of this country on two occasions over the last fortnight.  I believe that was a clear cry from the people to Fianna Fáil to call a halt, that they have had enough.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Government have very considerable electoral debts to pay off to the rich sections in this country.  I believe that there were very well-positioned, well-financed groups&mdash;small but powerful&mdash;who supported this Government in the last electoral campaign; and the Government are using the taxation code, among other things, to pay those sections back.  Even up to now they have been paid back very handsomely indeed.  But at whose expense have they been paid back?  Look at the state of social welfare recipients.  Look at Government policy with regard to the lower and middle income groups.  Read through the Green and the White Papers.  There have been cutbacks in <Col N="527" /> public housing, cutbacks in education and in practically every aspect of local government expenditure.  Every facet of national policy that affects the lower and middle income groups has been cut back.  In fact, it had to be done to allow the Government to pay back the wealthy sections for their support in the last general election.</P>
    <P>Let us make no mistake about it.  The wealth tax was not a popular measure among those small, well-off and very powerful groups here.  It was a most unpopular measure among them.  They saw that the only way it could be abolished was to get a Fianna Fáil Government back who would abolish it.  They have played ball with the Government and the Government have played ball with them. There is no other logic to the situation.  I have thought long and seriously about it. How else could 15 men sit around a table and, after careful and long deliberation, make two decisions: (1) to remove the wealth tax, giving back more than £2 million to a millionaire class; and (2) to cut food subsidies?  Is there any other reasonable explanation for it? The present Minister has tried valiantly to put forward as a reason the need of job creation by the private sector.  I have said before, and I say again, that that myth is exploded by their own published documents.</P>

      <P>What this party are seeking in this motion is that the Government:</P>
      <P> 1.  First, and as an interim measure, provide substantial relief in the Finance Bill, 1979 to the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>2.  Radically reform the present system of income taxation.</P>
      <P>3.  Ensure that all sections of the community pay their fair and just share of taxation.</P>
      <P>4.  Introduce an economically efficient and socially just system of capital and wealth taxation. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anyone say that any of these four demands is unreasonable?  There cannot <Col N="528" /> be another country within the European Community, and probably outside of it, who would not say, if these four demands were read out to them, that such policies had been in operation in their countries for decades.  These just and necessary demands would be the beginnig of the road&mdash;and it will be a long road&mdash;towards the creation of a just and equitable society here.  I knew, even before I read out the demands, that the Minister and other Fianna Fáil speakers would get up and waffle about social partners, consultations and so on. No one is suggesting that the tax code can be radically restructured over night, but something can be done in the immediate future.  Steps can be taken in the Finance Bill, which will come before this House over the next few weeks, to give at least some measure of alleviation to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector are in revolt against two things&mdash;the intolerable burden of taxation being placed on them, and the realisation that there are other sections of this community who are better able to pay and who are not paying their just and fair share of taxation.  The wealth tax, if it were still in operation, would yield in excess of £25 million per year. The food subsidies cost £22 million.  According to an official of the Revenue Commissioners, who probably gave a very conservative estimate, professional people are evading their fair share of income tax up to and probably in excess of £50 million per year.  This comes from a man who is in a position to know or at least to make a reasonably well-educated guess.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that our whole tax code needs to be radically restructured in order to give it even a semblance of social justice and equity. In the forthcoming Finance Bill the Government have the opportunity of taking the first step towards the radical reform that is necessary.  In the interest of social justice and in the name of the people who walked the streets of our cities and towns on two occasions during the past week the Government should avail of that opportunity.  Though focused on the PAYE question the protests were a condemnation of the <Col N="529" /> policy that this Government have been pursuing, the policy of blatantly favouring the rich at the expense of the lower-paid and middle-income groups.  The Government should take what could be their last opportunity to deal with the situation and that opportunity is afforded by the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;takes note of the Government's active and continuing concern for equity in the tax system as evidenced in the Government's actions to date including action to increase substantially the personal tax allowance, raise significantly the farming sector's contribution to the cost of public services and strengthen considerably the campaign against tax evasion,</P>
      <P>&mdash;appreciates that long-standing features of tax code can be changed only over a reasonable period of time, given that the Government's programme of economic and social advance has to continue to be financed, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;welcomes the Government's intention to continue to pursue actively their policy of promoting the maximum degree of equity in the tax system&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment to the motion tabled by members of Labour, it might be useful for me to begin by tracing the actual pattern of developments in taxation generally in recent years.  But, first, I thank Deputy Cluskey for drawing our attention to the opportunity the Government have of doing something about the problem of taxation.  I hope to show the Deputy that we do not need him to draw our attention to the situation.  We have been doing something about it, but I expect that most people would prefer to ask what Deputy Cluskey and his colleagues were doing in this regard when they had a chance to do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the motion refers to the &ldquo;regressive policies&rdquo; of this Government, one would imagine that we have been responsible for massive increases in taxation, particularly for the lower-paid, while the previous Government had been reducing the burden of taxation.  This is of course totally false, being the exact opposite of what has happened.</P>
      <P>At the time the Coalition Government took up office the overall level of taxation in this country, including all forms of taxation, represented about 40 per cent of national income.  By 1976, in their last full year of office, the tax level had shot up to almost 46 per cent of national income.  This was a massive increase, particularly during a time of very low economic growth when real national income was itself growing at a very slow rate.</P>
      <P>We were well aware at that time of the public dissatisfaction which this massive tax hike was causing and, from the beginning, we set out clear and farreaching plans for reducing the tax burden in various ways.  As a result of these plans the overall tax burden is expected this year to represent about 41 per cent of national income, so we have more or less relieved the taxpayers of this additional taxation which was imposed by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>The change effected by the present Government can perhaps be best expressed in actual money terms.  Taxpayers would be paying some £300 million more in tax this year but for the tax changes made by the present Government. The reliefs given by this Government have been widely spread throughout the community, covering income tax, rates, motor vehicle duties, corporate taxes and capital taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognised the dissatisfaction under the Coalition Government with the growing burden of taxation, particularly on the PAYE taxpayers, and we undertook to provide substantial reliefs.  Of course we did not simply adopt a cavalier attitude of giving tax reliefs without worrying about how expenditure could be financed from other sources. We drew up a detailed plan of action designed to get the economy moving again from the stagnant position it had <Col N="531" /> reached under the Coalition.  We saw that the momentum generated by a growing economy would ensure that Government expenditure could be financed without requiring a crippling level of taxation.</P>
    <P>Let me put on record what we have done to date, particularly on the income tax front.  From the outset, we promised the biggest ever increase in personal income tax allowances&mdash;an increase of £200,30 per cent, in the single person's allowance and £630,57 per cent, in the married person's allowance.  This shows that as far back as early 1977 we were already showing practical concern for the difficulties of those paying income tax.  Our record since then shows that we are turning that concern into concrete action.  This commitment was implemented in the 1978 Budget.  In my recent budget further increases were given of £250 for a single person and £500 for a married person.  Thus, in two years we have increased the value of the single person's allowance by 68 per cent and the married person's allowance by 103 per cent.  This is well ahead of the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>It is useful to relate these personal allowances to the level of industrial earnings. Between 1974-75 and 1977-78, the final year in which the previous Government introduced a budget, the value of the allowances fell considerably when compared with the average male industrial wage&mdash;from 21.4 per cent to 16.5 per cent in the case of a single person and from 34.3 per cent to 27.2 per cent in the case of a married person. We have reversed this trend in our two budgets.  On the basis of the estimated present average male industrial wage, the single person's allowance now represents almost 24 per cent and the married person's allowance almost 48 per cent. Not only has the fall been redressed but significant further increases have been made.</P>
    <P>When we look at the proportion of income which is being taken in income tax a similar pattern is evident.  The proportion has fallen considerably since our return to office.  For example, a married person with no children earning the present average male industrial wage would <Col N="532" /> pay only about 16 per cent of his earnings in tax compared with almost 22 per cent in 1976-77.  A married person with two children on the same income level would pay 12.7 per cent of his income in tax at present compared with 16.6 per cent in 1976-77.  These are very significant improvements.</P>
    <P>Two other measures, which show the particular concern which we have for the lower-income groups, are the large increase in social welfare children's allowances this year and the introduction of fully pay-related social insurance contributions. In my recent budget I made provision for an average increase of 28 per cent in expenditure on social welfare children's allowances.  The changeover to pay-related contributions for financing social insurance benefits will bring relief to the lower-paid workers.  The relief will be greater the lower the income level.  Again, concern for the burden on persons of low incomes and on reduced incomes such as pensioners lay behind the Government's action in ending domestic rates.</P>
    <P>If we take account of all these changes which will have effect this year&mdash;the changes in income tax allowances and bands, the increased social welfare children's allowances and the changeover to pay-related social insurance contributions&mdash;it is clear that the Government are making a significant contribution to increasing the take-home pay of all employees, particularly those at the lower end of the scale.  For example, a married person with two children earning £60 per week will have his net income increased by over 6 per cent.  A similar person earning £50 per week will have his net income increased by almost 8 per cent.  These are very substantial increases indeed, by no means excessive in the case of people on those incomes but far removed from the picture painted by Deputy Cluskey and his colleagues of a Government concerned with the rich.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion states that the returns from income tax will increase by one third this year.  This would seem to imply that everybody will be paying one third more in income tax, which indeed was the interpretation which Opposition speakers in the budget debate <Col N="533" /> were trying to put on it.  I will be dealing more specifically tomorrow in my reply to the budget debate with the allegations made by Deputy FitzGerald and others during that debate about the income tax revenue forecasts.  However, I have already indicated, in reply to various parliamentary questions, that the expected percentage increase in receipts from the PAYE sector this year is smaller than that expected from the farmers and other Schedule D taxpayers. I have also mentioned that there are a number of special factors affecting receipts from individual groups within the PAYE sector this year.</P>
    <P>No matter what way people try to misinterpret or distort my budget, there can be no question but that the measures which I introduced will free some 21,000 married and 19,000 other taxpayers completely from tax liability.  In addition, in the case of married taxpayers without children whose liability is not removed completely it will be cut by amounts ranging from £100-£135 a year depending on income.  The effects for married couples with children will be somewhat similar, but here it is also necessary to consider the effects of the changes in Social Welfare children's allowances and the child tax allowances. For those who are not removed completely from tax liability the combined effects of the alterations in the tax and social welfare system will be to benefit married couples by amounts varying upwards from £100 per year in cases where the children qualify for children's allowances.</P>
    <P>In the case of single taxpayers or those widowed without children, most of them will experience a reduction in their liability by varying amounts.  For those of them who are not entitled to any allowance other than the single or widowed person's allowance and whose incomes exceed £7,715 or £7,785, as appropriate, there will be tax increases not exceeding £15 a year.  Moreover, if these taxpayers are entitled to any additional allowances, these income points will be higher.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated my remarks on the steps we have taken to <Col N="534" /> reduce the overall burden of taxation and in particular the burden on PAYE taxpayers.  In addition, we have of course been making strides towards a more equitable distribution of the remaining income tax burden.</P>
    <P>Both budgets introduced by this Government have marked considerable steps forward in the matter of farmers' taxation.  The Government have already publicly committed themselves to devising a system of taxation which will put farmers in a position comparable to other sections of the community. Discussions are being held with the farm organisations and if before 1 May the farm organisations publicly accept a tax system that will bring in a yield from farmers in line with that of other sectors, then the Government will not proceed with the 2 per cent levy on farm produce which was announced in the budget; but the revenue foregone will be recovered by the Exchequer through the VAT system.  The Government's commitment in this area could hardly be more unequivocal.</P>
    <P>Turning to the other self-employed people, my income tax revenue forecast for this year projects an increase in receipts from this sector of a massive 44 per cent.  One reason for this is that the income of this sector tends to fluctuate quite a lot, being far less stable than that of employees, and the small increase in tax receipts from this sector last year is expected to be more than offset this year.  In addition, the intensification of the campaign against tax evasion, which I announced in my budget speech, is expected to show results during this year.  I should of course make it clear that tax evasion is not confined to the self-employed and all categories of tax evaders can anticipate vigorous action by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate, Deputy Horgan said that he failed to see how I was going to tackle tax evasion, apart from appointing extra people to the Revenue Commissioners.  I would remind the House that, in addition to the 500 new posts which I have authorised for the Offices of the Revenue Commissioners, I announced that particular accounts would be examined in depth, <Col N="535" /> where there were indications of evasion, in order to see if the accounts could be reconciled with the state of the business or the life style of the taxpayer.  At present substantial penalties may be imposed in respect of tax evasion.  I also announced in the budget that in future more emphasis will be placed on legal proceedings rather than compromise action. Information about such tax evaders would of course be made public in the case of their being prosecuted through the courts.  In addition, I am examining the possible usefulness of the publication of information concerning the returns of certain classes of taxpayers, without of course disclosing details concerning individual taxpayers.</P>
    <P>As regards the reference in the motion to the abolition of wealth tax, the Government abolished wealth tax because it was a disincentive to investment and enterprise and thereby militated against job creation.  Deputy Cluskey completely overlooked the fact that we had repeatedly stated that the Government were putting a very special effort into job creation in the first year of office which they could control through the introduction of a budget because it would take at least a year for the private sector to perform.  I cannot blame Deputy Cluskey; it is not unfair that he would overlook this, given the rules of debate in this House.  In the budget speech I indicated that this is the year the private sector have to perform fully, the year in which they are being tested. Nobody need try to condemn their performance until we have seen what it is. The indications from last year are very clear, in the form of investment and any other test which can be applied, that the private sector are measuring up; but the real test will not be possible until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>We believe that unemployment is one of the major causes of poverty and inequality and we introduced in 1977 and 1978 a series of measures to boost job creation.  The success of these measures, which included the abolition of wealth tax, is borne out by various economic indicators. As I mentioned in my budget speech last month, 23,533 jobs were created in 1978 under our job creation <Col N="536" /> programme and after allowing for redundancies, the numbers at work are estimated to have increased during that year by 17,000, which was the largest year-on-year increase on record.  I might add that the average annual yield from the wealth tax during the three years of its existence amounted to only £5.3 million. It is very easy to mislead people in regard to the wealth tax, but the abolition of the wealth tax was an important part in the creation of a climate of confidence by this Government.  Deputies know this, as do the public, and they have seen the results in the jobs created, especially for our young people.</P>
    <P>The changes I made in the capital gains tax last year were economically efficient and socially just. Under the capital gains tax code brought in by the Coalition no distinction was made between real gains and paper gains resulting from inflation, which means that a person could be taxed on a purely nominal gain when disposing of an asset whereas in real terms he had made a loss on the disposal.  I remedied this inequity by introducing into the tax code an adjustment for inflation.  I also introduced an arrangement whereby a speculator would be taxed at a higher rate than previously while a genuine shopkeeper, businessman or farmer who had put time, effort and money into improving and expanding his business over a period of perhaps 15 or 20 years would be taxed at much lower rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey talks about wealth tax and capital gains tax as though they were examples of social justice tackling inequity.  I have already dealt with the inequity produced by the wealth tax combined with the other things that Government were doing.  I wonder does Deputy Cluskey still try to justify the application of a wealth tax to Irish people and not to foreigners operating in this country.  I wonder does Deputy Cluskey still try to justify the taxing of people who have spent their lives building their businesses at the same rate as a man who makes a quick profit over a month or two.  We do not approve of that.  If Deputy Cluskey and his party do, let them say so clearly and not be pretending that they are interested in social justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> The main change made by the Government in relation to capital acquisitions tax was the doubling of the threshold for three of the four classes of beneficiaries.  I believe that these thresholds were originally fixed at too low a level.  I also believe that the one threshold which I did not change was fixed at too high a level and I said so at the time.  Again, Deputy Cluskey and the Labour Party may think that it was right to provide, as they did, under the capital acquisitions tax that a wealthy man could dispose of his property.  If it was agricultural property, he could dispose of it in slices worth a £¼ million each, one to his wife, one to whatever number of children he had up to the limit of his assets and pay no capital acquisitions tax.  That may be their idea of social justice but it is not ours.</P>
    <P>The capital acquisitions tax yielded £5 million in 1978 and is expected to yield £6.5 million this year.  In view of that, I find it hard to understand the reference in the motion to its virtual abolition.  As recently as the 13th of this month we discussed food subsidies in this House and I do not intend to go back over all that again although Deputy Cluskey tried to do so.  I would point out once more that food subsidies operate to the benefit of the rich rather than the poor and that the case for introducing the food subsidies was put in this House by the former Taoiseach.  I quoted him at some length when we discussed the matter. The case made was reasonable but he pointed out that the time when we got back to single-digit inflation was the time to start getting rid of food subsidies.  He pointed out the drawbacks of it operating for the benefit of the rich rather than for the poor and that it inhibited job creation.  I agree with what he said; so did the Deputies opposite because they supported him.  The real point in what we are doing is to try to use the money saved on food subsidies this year to help the less well-off and to help job creation, which is the most important way in which to help the less well-off.  As far as we are concerned, we recognised that the time had come to initiate the first stage of a phased and gradual reduction in the subsidies.  The <Col N="538" /> timing of further reductions will always depend on the circumstances of the economy.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare, we are proud of our record despite all the talk, particularly from the Labour Party and Deputy Cluskey.  When Fianna Fáil were in office between 1967 and 1972 and since we came into office in 1977, the real value of the increase in social welfare has been three times greater than under the Coalition.  All the talk about being in favour of the rich and not caring about the poor can be tested against these facts.  We have tackled the problem of taxation on a comprehensive basis. We have tried to tackle income tax under three main heads, easing the overall burden of taxation, particularly the burden placed on the PAYE sector.  I have shown how much we have done in that area as compared with people who now have the nerve to come in with this motion.  We have tackled in a real way the problem of getting an adequate yield from farm taxation and we are mounting a vigorous and unprecedented campaign against tax evasion.  In view of the progress we have made in less than two years, particularly in the light of the actions of the Coalition Government, we have substantially reduced the burden of inflation.  In those circumstances I find it difficult to understand the criticisms of Deputies as set out in the terms of this motion.  A great deal more has to be done before a fully acceptable and fair system of taxation is established, but it is not possible for all the necessary and desirable changes to be made at once while sustaining the Government social and economic programme.  The speed of reform must take account of what can realistically be achieved.  We must ensure that we are not sacrificing the interests of the less well off and the unemployed. They must be catered for in the areas of health, education, social welfare and job creation.  We cannot sacrifice the interests of these areas in a mad scramble to reform the tax system.</P>
    <P>The Government have been very open and frank about their proposals in regard to taxation and other matters.  We believe that the best way of making progress is to engage in wide-ranging <Col N="539" /> and detailed consultations with representatives of the trade union movement, the business community and the farmers. We have at all times been ready to have detailed discussions with representatives of these groups.  Following the Taoiseach's call for a national understanding on wages, taxation, jobs and so on, we met the ICTU and a working party are now examining the wide-ranging issues raised.  At the same time discussions are also taking place at working party level with employers.  As I have already indicated, we are also proceeding with discussions with the farming organisations in regard to taxation. As I said, tax reform is only one aspect of these discussions.  It is very important to view taxation in the wider context of the overall management of the economy, particularly the overall management of the public sector.  This is a complex problem and the level of taxation cannot be dealt with in isolation.  We must have regard for the need to maintain and make advances in social welfare, health, education and job creation, which is the Government's first priority.  This can be done, but it cannot be done simply by cutting taxation without regard for the consequences or by engaging in massive borrowing.  We would not wish our children to remember this Government for the legacy of a national debt with no assets to show for it.</P>
    <P>This Government have been making very strong efforts to ensure that schemes of expenditure which have achieved their original purpose would be reviewed and pruned, and this process has gone on and has shown itself in the Estimates this year, and will continue. Simply to reduce taxation at the expense of impeding social progress or slowing down the growth of the economy because of the State's lack of revenue would not be the right course for this country.</P>
    <P>I would not wish to anticipate the Government's action on foot of various discussions that I have referred to which are being held at present, but I assure the House of the Government's continuing concern about the tax situation and of <Col N="540" /> their anxiety that progress be made as quickly as possible towards a system which will prove suitable to all taxpayers. We wish to achieve in these discussions a common understanding and a sense of direction over time on the many issues which affect the community as a whole, including earnings, taxation, social welfare benefits, employment, growth and inflation.  These issues are both complex and long-standing.  An undue emphasis on short-term solutions and cures cannot be fruitful.  We want to ensure that a common and universal effort is made by all sections, including farmers, to continue the economy along the path on which we have managed to set it since mid-1977, a path marked by rapid growth, substantial increases in employment and a marked reduction in the rate of inflation.  That should be the aim of all sides in this House.  If it is not, it is going to remain the aim of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>As I have said, this is the fifth, sixth or seventh time I have heard this speech from the Minister for <Col N="541" /> Finance in the last 18 months.  It is a justification of Fianna Fáil's stance in reducing, according to the Minister, the level of taxation.  It is a justification for their abolition of the food subsidies and the usual defence for the abolition of the wealth tax.  I will come later on to what I want to say about that.  Despite the fact that in this House a number of times I have explained our attitude to the wealth tax, the Minister continues to misrepresent our position on it.</P>
      <P>If all that the Minister says is correct, if his party have made such a good job of running the country and if the people are as satisfied as he seems to think&mdash;he refers to people outside this House recognising these facts&mdash;why did a quarter of a million people march last Tuesday?  What were they marching about if they thought the system of taxation was as just as the Minister would lead us to believe here tonight?  Is it that they do not believe what the Minister is saying?  Do they believe that the words spoken do not match up to the reality of their pay packets at the end of the week and that they are now worse off than they were before this Government came into office?  I think they believe that the Government are serious when they say they are going to collect 36 per cent more tax from the PAYE payers this year than they did last year.  Is that the reason they took to the streets?  Did they feel that the 87 per cent they are being asked to pay is an unjust burden on them when they see that other sections of the community when asked to make a contribution appear to be able to bully the Government into dropping the proposal against them?  Do they feel that they should have the same rights in this regard?</P>
      <P>I am sorry that you, Sir, shut up Deputy Killilea before he started because I am sure he would have looked for a pair and gone home before now only that he was asked to provide some means of deflecting the attack from the Government by kicking up a row.  You silenced him successfully.</P>

      <P>The Government's amendment to the motion states, and I quote:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;takes note of the Government's active and continuing concern for equity in the tax system as evidenced in the Government's actions to date including action to increase substantially the personal tax allowances, raise significantly the farming sector's contribution to the cost of public services and strengthen considerably the campaign against tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told today that it would raise considerably the farming sector's contribution to the cost of the public services. We endeavoured to find out from the Minister at Question Time today exactly how much he expected them to contribute but he was not able to tell us, nor was he able to tell us when exactly this contribution would be made.  The only thing we know is that the proposal in the budget was for a 2 per cent levy on all farm produce at the point of sale or export.  At the time of the budget, and since, we on this side of the House labelled this as an unjust and unfair tax because it sought to treat all farmers alike whether they were one-cow farmers or 200-cow farmers.  At the time of the Ard-Fheis of the Government party there was considerable protest from members of the farming community and the levy as proposed was modified to the extent that certain goods, such as sheep, were excluded from it and farmers supplying beet to the Tuam sugar factory and certain other categories were relieved of the proposed payment of this tax on 1 May.  The Minister for Finance at the time of making these announcements said that these were the final concessions which he would make and there would be no further relief in the amount of levy to be paid.  Yet within 48 hours &mdash;on Tuesday 28 February&mdash;the farming organisations met with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, and a statement was issued saying that the farming levy would not be imposed on 1 May unless <Col N="543" /> there was public agreement to a system of taxation before that date; that unless there was public agreement by the farming organisations to a system of taxation before that date, they would bring in an equal amount of money, provide just and equitable taxation, or some words to that effect.</P>
    <P>Since then the Minister for Finance has described that document as the most misinterpreted and misquoted in the history of this country.  Yet the whole problem about the document was the comments of the Minister for Agriculture at the press conference.  I have checked all of the papers in this regard, and at that time he was quoted as saying exactly the same thing in each of them.  In <i>The Irish press</i> the Minister for Agriculture was quoted as saying that he was pleased that the farming organisations expressed their willingness to work out an income tax system which would be equitable.  In the <i>Cork Examiner</i> the Minister for Finance was quoted as saying after the meeting that the proposals had evolved from ones put forward by the farming organisations to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and himself and that Deputy Gibbons, who was present with Deputy Colley at the meeting with journalists, was quoted as saying that he was pleased that the farming organisations had expressed a willingness to work out an income tax system that would be equitable.  <i>The Irish Times</i> said that Deputy Colley said he was pleased&mdash;exactly the same as <i>The Irish Press,</i> and the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>If that document was so misinterpreted by the press, as the Minister for Finance now wishes to suppose, how did he sit and allow the Minister for Agriculture, when sitting next to him with the press listening, put that interpretation on it?  If there has been a misinterpretation of this document, if the rest of the population think that the farming community are being allowed to write their own taxation system, then the responsibility for that lies with the Government because they endeavoured to placate the farming community by allowing that interpretation of the meeting to go into the press, that farmers were <Col N="544" /> going to be allowed to work out their own taxation.  It was pointed out to the Minister for Finance at the time that the budget was in the process of being debated in this House, that the Financial Resolutions had been voted on and that to have any one sector of the community appear to dismantle part of that budget in their favour and write their own system of taxation was bound to provoke a backlash from the PAYE sector who, on the estimate of receipts for 1979, would, according to the Government, contribute 36.7 per cent more in income tax this year over last year.  It was bound to provoke that backlash and it did.  If the Government stop to think about it, if they think that discussions with various groups, that appearing now to be chasing tax evaders in a public way, of adopting&mdash;as probably they will do now&mdash;a tough stance with the farmers will placate the PAYE payers at this stage, they were totally wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the Government are talking about tax evasion and chasing people who are allegedly evading tax.  I hope that does not mean ringing up unfortunate small shopkeepers down the country and asking them if the petrol they used going to the match on Sunday was paid out of petty cash or out of their own pockets. That is unfortunate, because those are not the people the Government need to get after.  There are far more blatant forms of tax evasion going on here than that.  If the Government think they can now placate the PAYE sector by their discussions with ICTU, by adopting a hard stance against the farmers, by chasing tax evaders, if they think that will be sufficient, I warn them they are doing grave damage to our economy.  It will be detrimental to our economy also if they do not treat seriously the complaints, the sense of bitterness and the sense of unfairness in the way they are being dealt with, of the 750,000 taxpayers <Col N="545" /> who are the main economic pillar for the support of the services being provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>To talk as the Minister for Finance did a moment ago about equity in the tax system as introduced by them and the unfairness of the Coalition system points to the fact that the Minister for Finance appears to have forgotten that he was the Minister for Finance who raised the level of taxation here to 80 per cent.  He appears to have forgotten also that it was the Coalition Government who made the top rate of taxation payable here 60 per cent and who introduced a 20 per cent band of taxation. Where now is that 20 per cent band which was of direct benefit to the lowest taxpayers?  As a result of the action of the same Minister for Finance, the same Government who seek to pull the wool over the eyes of the ordinary taxpayer that 20 per cent band has been abolished.  This means that every single taxpayer meets a higher band of taxation at a level of £400 less from next Friday week than he does this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> On today's Order Paper Deputy Conlon and I tabled a question asking the Minister for Finance if he was aware that furniture manufacturers in County Monaghan were finding it difficult to compete with imports of second-hand furniture.  We asked the Minister if he would reduce the rate of VAT from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and if the same favourable terms for payment of VAT might be applied here as in Northern Ireland.  In the course of his reply the Minister appeared to appreciate the difficulties which such manufacturers in County Monaghan find themselves in.  However, he could not see his way to help those manufacturers. It is a fact that that industry plays an important part, with the poultry industry, in the economy of County Monaghan.  Those industries provide a lot of employment.  The furniture industry has been built up over the years by small industries and now employs more than <Col N="547" /> 800 people.  That must be regarded as a worthwhile industry.  In common with other Border counties, County Monaghan finds it a lot more difficult to attract industries than inland counties. For that reason it is important that existing industries in the county should not be exposed to unnecessary or unfair competition.  The furniture manufacturing industry is being subjected to unfair competition and under severe pressure and that is why we want the Minister to come to its aid.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that jobs are in danger in that industry because of the unfair competition in trading.  If redundancies occurred on a big scale in it the Minister would be asked by all sides to come to its aid but it is more sensible and practical to protect the industry when it is healthy rather than spend considerable sums of money in trying to rehabilitate it or trying to do a fire brigade job on it when it has been forced into a difficult position.  Due to its geographical situation the industry is open to a lot of pressure from competitors in the UK and Northern Ireland. That pressure is much greater because industries in Northern Ireland and the UK operate under more favourable conditions. For example, in the UK, VAT on new furniture is charged at the rate of 8 per cent.  The Minister and I disagreed today about the terms available for the payment of VAT in the UK but my information is that there is a longer period allowed for the payment of it, interest free, than there is here.  I have been informed that the interest-free period in the UK is six months because no penalties are extracted if the payment is made within six months.  On that basis the effective time for payment of VAT in the UK is six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation here is that if VAT is not paid within two months interest is charged.  As a result of the more favourable terms available in the UK, furniture manufacturers there can make greater profits on the home market and, consequently, export here under better circumstances.  I accept that they are subject to our VAT rate but because of their profit situation at home they can be <Col N="548" /> more competitive.  Another important point is that as new furniture is cheaper in the UK second-hand furniture is much cheaper.  We are all aware that vast quantities of second-hand furniture are being imported here from the UK at very low cost.  That also puts a lot of pressure on the furniture manufacturers. A lot of second-hand furniture is brought through the Monaghan customs check point.  I understand that at least one container load of second-hand furniture is brought through that checkpoint daily.  That furniture is not over-valued and the amount of VAT paid on it is very little, even when it is imported in an orthodox way.  People who live near the Border know that a lot of things which come across the Border do not travel by orthodox roads.  They very often come by circuitous routes; in other words, they are smuggled.  The Monaghan furniture manufacturers have to compete with that.</P>
    <P>Furniture in the UK is subject to VAT at the rate of 8 per cent.  Furniture here is subject to a VAT rate of 20 per cent, more than double the amount of VAT imposed in Northern Ireland.  This means that furniture manufacturers here have to compete with secondhand furniture, imported from abroad, very often for little or nothing, which is subject to only 10 per cent VAT.  This is very unfair to a home industry in a Border county, where we have a number of difficulties. It is quite legitimate for people to import furniture up to £50 value free of tax from Northern Ireland.  It pays them to go the short journey there several times and bring in various items.</P>
    <P>I believe that I am speaking to the converted when I tell the Minister that this industry in Monaghan is under pressure. I am sure I can also speak for the furniture industry in Navan and in other counties.  The Minister in his reply today said that he appreciated the difficulties. What is he doing about it?  I ask him to reduce VAT on Irish made furniture from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  In reply to representations made to him he stated it was not possible to do it, but he did not go that far in his reply today.  I do not believe there is any legal or administrative difficulty in doing that.  In this year's budget VAT on certain luxury <Col N="549" /> equipment was reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  If VAT can be reduced on luxury equipment surely it can be done on furniture.  Furniture is basic equipment in our homes.  We hear many people talking about how well off farmers are.  It is only now that many farmers in my constituency are able to furnish their homes in a modern, comfortable way.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to the representations made to him, said that he could not remove VAT from furniture without removing it from a variety of goods.  I would like him to spell out on what he bases that assertion.  The Monaghan furniture manufacturers have an unanswerable argument that, due to their geographical location they are operating under unfavourable conditions.  They are operating in a Border county where it is difficult to attract industry.  The IDA readily admit that.</P>
    <P>The Minister can compensate the people in that area by treating this industry as substantially a Border industry.  If he says furniture manufacturing is not confined to County Monaghan he will have to admit that, if he takes the town of Navan with Monaghan, a substantial amount of our furniture is manufactured in those two locations.  Navan is also under severe pressure from Northern Ireland furniture.  I have no doubt that an excellent case can be made for giving special attention to this comparatively young industry.  Preventive medicine is better than serious surgery at a later stage.  I am calling for preventive finance from the Department of Finance to ensure that this industry, which has been built up over the years, is given a fair opportunity to operate and a chance to continue to progress and to increase employment.  We know that secondhand furniture is much cheaper in England, Scotland and, presumably, in Northern Ireland.  It is not fair that this furniture should be brought in here and allowed to compete with home-produced furniture. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick indicated, I appreciate some of the difficulties involved for the furniture manufacturers in <Col N="550" /> Monaghan in particular and also in Navan.  However, I do not think that is the whole story.</P>
      <P>First, I should make it clear that when Deputy Fitzpatrick is talking about competition and the 8 per cent rate in the North, he is talking about the rate applied to furniture sold in the North. The rate applied to new furniture sold here is 20 per cent and it is 10 per cent on secondhand furniture.  He also referred to competition from smuggled goods which is a separate problem from the main problem he raised.  There are a few points to which I should like to draw his attention.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seems to think there is no problem about reducing the rate on new furniture manufactured here to 10 per cent.  If that were done it is inevitable that the case for applying the same rate to other household furnishings such as carpets and floor coverings would be irresistible. There would be no logical basis on which it could be resisted on household electrical goods and furnishings generally.  The cost to the Exchequer would be very substantial.  The cost to the Exchequer of reducing the rate of tax on new furniture from 20 per cent to 10 per cent would be of the order of £6 million in a full year and this is just on furniture, not on other items.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information I have.  I should also point out that one of the consequences of lowering the rate to 10 per cent would be that under EEC competition rules this would have to apply to all new furniture, domestic and imported, and this might not be in the best interests of furniture manufacturers in Monaghan or in Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy may be under a misapprehension in regard to an announcement I made in the budget concerning radios and gramophones.  What was done there merely brought these items into line with the standard 20 per cent rate.  The effective rate on the equipment had been substantially less than the 40 per cent which appeared to be the rate.  This was because it was done in the way of a trapped rate of 30 per cent and <Col N="551" /> then 10 per cent at the point of sale.  It is estimated that the effective rate was about 28 per cent on average.  The cost of what was done in regard to radios and gramophones was about £1 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Did that endanger any employment here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done to save employment, not so much at the manufacturing end but at the retailing end.  Prior to 1 March 1979 radios and gramophones were liable to an apparent 40 per cent rate and I have indicated how it was charged&mdash;a trapped rate of 30 per cent and an additional 10 per cent at importation or point of sale.  With effect from 1 March that two-tier charge has been replaced by a single VAT charge of 20 per cent.  Under the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 registered traders without a fixed place of business will be required to pay VAT at the point of importation rather than at the point of sale which is the requirement for VAT registered traders with a fixed place of business.  I cannot say with certainty what will be the consequences but they must be beneficial from the point of view of furniture manufacturers in Monaghan and Meath.  They have complained about competition from VAT registered traders without a fixed place of business who heretofore were able to import furniture and not pay VAT until at the point of sale.  That restriction is now applying as from 1 March and it should be of some assistance to furniture manufacturers.</P>
      <P>It is open to furniture manufacturers in Monaghan, subject to other problems they may have, to export to Northern Ireland and to compete on exactly the same VAT terms in the North as apply to manufacturers and importers there, for instance importers from Britain. They can compete on equal terms and if they do this successfully they can get economies of scale.  I want to stress that they are competing on equal terms so far as VAT is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out that imported <Col N="552" /> secondhand furniture, even if it is smuggled, is caught for VAT unless it is sold privately or by an unregistered trader. With regard to the question of people using their duty-free allowance to bring in furniture, that allowance is confined to non-commercial imports and the maximum for any one item is £52.</P>
    <P>I have been able to do something to alleviate the position.  At this stage I cannot say how valuable or valueless it is, although I am sure it has some value in regard to the restrictions applying from 1 March to traders with no fixed place of business.  To go further and reduce the VAT rate from 20 per cent to 10 per cent inevitably would cost the Exchequer a great deal of money.  Even if it could be confined solely to new furniture, it would cost £6 million but I do not believe it could be so confined and the cost would be very much greater. The consequences for the Exchequer would be great and while I appreciate the difficulties with which the furniture manufacturers in Monaghan are faced, I am afraid that the remedy is not one we can afford.  I know something of the difficulties but I am not satisfied that the situation is quite as difficult as might appear from what Deputy Fitzpatrick said.</P>
    <P>I must point out that while it is true that the VAT rate in the North is lower than here, as I indicated today there are differences that operate both ways.  For example, the items that are zero-rated here are more extensive than they are in the North and a similar argument can be made in the North in relation to VAT.  In practical terms, as of now at any rate I cannot do more to benefit the furniture manufacturers than I have done. However, I am prepared to indicate, as I have done already to them, that I will keep a close eye on the situation to see if an opportunity offers either to improve on what we have been able to do so far or if a real emergency arises to review the situation fundamentally again.</P>

Such clearances form part of the commercial banks' foreign currency cash flow and to the extent that surplus foreign currencies are generated&mdash;that is, receipts are in excess of payments&mdash;they accrue to official external reserves because the banks' holdings of all foreign currencies (including sterling since 18 December 1978) are strictly limited to working balances and external reserves are centralised in the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the Central Bank that <Col N="425" /> there is no evidence to suggest that requiring banks to lodge all negotiable instruments payable outside the State with the Central Bank for clearance would improve on existing arrangements from the point of view of productive management of the external reserves.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank have powers under section 23 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, to require a licensed bank to maintain a specified ratio, or a maximum or a minimum ratio between assets and liabilities.  In practice the system of primary and secondary liquidity ratio requirements operated by the bank was introduced by agreement between them and the licensed banks.  Primary liquid assets comprise the sum of a bank's holdings of notes and coin and balances with the Central Bank (including reserve bonds and statutory deposits), while secondary liquid assets comprise a bank's holdings of Government paper (including Exchequer Bills and rediscounts); relevant resources comprise the sum of a bank's current and deposit accounts and net external liability (adjusted for any exemptions that have been granted by the Central Bank), less balances with and lending to all other licensed banks within the State. The primary liquidity ratio is the ratio of primary liquid assets to relevant resources.  The current minimum prescribed ratio is 13 per cent for Associated Banks, North American Banks, Merchant Banks and Industrial Banks and 10 per cent for the category Other Banks.  The secondary liquidity ratio is the ratio of secondary liquid assets to relevant resources; the current minimum prescribed ratio is 30 per cent for Associated Banks and 10 per cent for all other licensed banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> Section 24 (1) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, provides the same power to make regulations as was contained in section 50 (1) of the Central Bank Act, 1942, which was repealed by the Central Bank Act, 1971.  It provides that the bank may, with the consent of the Minister, make regulations to require banks to make non-interest-bearing deposits with the Central Bank if their assets within the State should fall below a specified proportion of their liabilities within the State.  The power has not been used to date.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have informed me that they consider the liquidity ratio and other powers available to them are adequate to their needs.</P>

      <P>The 37 per cent of the total budget represented by staff costs in 1978 is due to the fact that the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty relies to a significant extent on its own staff in the implementation of its programme at project level.  The main task of the project team staff is to mobilise local organisations and groups in their own areas towards realising their own resources and potential for development. It is estimated that staff costs will increase from 37 per cent to about 42 per cent in respect of the 1979 budget over 1978 expenditure.  This is due mainly to provision having been made in the 1979 budget for the filling of approved posts which were not filled in 1978.</P>

      <P>A number of complaints were received in the prices division of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and were referred to my Department. The position is that a company, licensed to operate a cable television system in the Navan area, increased its rental charges without the approval of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. The matter was taken up with the company and they have confirmed that they have ceased charging at the increased rate and have made the necessary adjustments in cases where subscribers have paid the increased charge.

      <P>Charges for repairs to motor cycle wheels, including punctures, come within the scope of the prices legislation and therefore within the purview of the National Prices Commission. From inquiries made it is understood that, because of the basic design features of motor cycles, repairs to wheels, including puncture repairs, are considerably more difficult and take longer than similar repairs to car wheels. In the circumstances charges tend to be higher.  I understand that, for reasons of safety, many motor cycle dealers deem it necessary to replace a punctured tube rather than repair it, thereby increasing the cost of the service.  In the case of one of the firms referred to by the Deputy it would appear, from an investigation carried out by the prices inspectorate, that a new tube was supplied and that this accounted for more than half of the cost involved.</P>

      <P>The Fire Prevention Council is a corporate body established by the Minister on 20 July 1978 by the Fire Prevention Council (Establishment) Order, 1978 (S.I. No. 206 of 1978) made under section 3 of the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971.  There is no provision either in the order or in the Act which requires that the council's annual report or abstract of accounts be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, it is my intention to arrange to have a copy of the council's abstract of accounts and the auditor's report thereon laid before each House of the Oireachtas when they have been presented to me in due course.</P>
      <P>I might add that the amount which has been provided in the Estimates for my Department in 1979 as a grant towards the Council's expenditure is £30,000.  An equivalent amount is being provided by the Federation of Insurers in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The European Social Fund provides assistance for a wide variety of <Col N="443" /> programmes related to employment, mainly of a vocational training nature, from which young people have benefited considerably.  In addition, however, the fund provides assistance for specific programmes for young people in two general areas of vocational training and of employment promotion.</P>
      <P>The provision governing fund assistance for measures of a vocational training nature has been in operation since 1975, having been introduced under a Council Decision of 22 July 1975, and continued by a Council Decision of 20 December 1977.  The relevant decision covers young people under 25 years who are unemployed or seeking employment, with priority being given to young people seeking employment for the first time.</P>
      <P>In accordance with that decision, fund assistance has been obtained for a number of Irish programmes relating to young people as follows:</P>
      <P>AnCO Community Youth Training Programme; AnCO Career Training Programme;</P>
      <P>Apprentice Training Programme, administered by AnCO and the Department of Education; Programmes organised by various vocational education committees in regional technical colleges, concerned with training in middle level technician and secretarial skills; Pre-employment courses promoted by the Department of Education; and An apprentice re-employment programme administered by the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Fund aids for promotion of employment for young people are relatively new, having been introduced in accordance with a Council Decision of 18 December 1978, and with effect only from 1 January 1979.  They cover certain job creation measures in both the public and private sectors, the main exception being that creation of jobs in central government administrations cannot be subvented.  The European Commission has drawn up draft guidelines for the administration of the new fund <Col N="444" /> aids, but until these guidelines are settled in final form, individual applications for fund assistance relating to programmes of employment promotion cannot be decided on.  It is expected that applications will be considered by the advisory European Social Fund committee early in July and that grants in respect of individual applications will be approved by the Commission shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>Pending the settlement of the guidelines and the consideration of individual applications, the extent of eligibility for fund assistance of Irish schemes cannot be indicated.  However, it is hoped that a number of schemes in respect of which applications have been or are being submitted to the Commission will qualify for fund assistance under the new aids:</P>
    <P>Environmental improvement scheme, administered by the Department of the Environment;</P>
    <P>Temporary youth employment scheme, administered by the Department of Education;</P>
    <P>Employment incentive scheme; and Work experience programme, both administered by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>The question of extension of existing Irish schemes and the introduction of new schemes relating to the promotion of employment for young people which might qualify for Social Fund assistance will be kept under consideration, particularly in the light of experience with current applications for aid and the operation of the guidelines which will be settled by the Commission.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  As the Deputy knows, application by a particular person for a teaching post in a national school is a matter for the board of management of that school and is not one in which my Department have any function.</P>
      <P>The individual referred to by the Deputy should continue to apply for teaching positions according as they are advertised.  The Official Report of 31 January 1979, Volume 311, Columns 111-115, contains a list of posts which were vacant on that date and the Deputy is, no doubt, in a position to supply the individual concerned with particulars of that list.</P>

      <P>There are 79 male primary school inspectors and six female.</P>
      <P>It would entail an inordinate and unjustified amount of research to trace back the actual classes in which an inspector taught in the course of his or her teaching experience.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that all the inspectors who were trained as national school teachers are qualified by virtue of their training to teach in infants' classes.</P>
