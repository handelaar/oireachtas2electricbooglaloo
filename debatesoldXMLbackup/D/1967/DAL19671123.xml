      <P>Before we proceed to the business as ordered, I should like to say a word about the business for the remainder of the session.  In view of the fact that the devaluation decision is likely to be debated next week with the Finance group of Estimates, there might be some problem about finishing in time to enable the Seanad to get a reasonable opportunity to debate the Appropriation Bill.  As I see it at present, excluding today, we would have normally nine sitting days up to and including Thursday, 14th December.  That may not give ample time to complete all our business but certainly if, as I should like to see happening, the Seanad is to have the opportunity of discussing the Appropriation Bill during that week, that is to say, on Wednesday, 13th, and Thursday, 14th, it would be necessary to clear all the Estimates from this House during the week commencing Tuesday, 4th December.  I was wondering whether the Whips could not get together to discuss the programme and to see whether or not it would be desirable to sit extra days or longer hours.</P>

    <Title>Control of Imports (Quota No. 54) (Pneumatic Tyres) Order, 1967 (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of:</P>
    <P>Control of Imports (Quota No. 54) (Pneumatic Tyres) Order, 1967.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce).  </P>
    <Col N="597" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this motion to approve the terms of the Quota Order made by the Minister, he mentioned the fact that discussions with the British Board of Trade were initiated in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of the Free Trade Area Agreement and it was agreed that quota restrictions should be imposed on the importation of tyres from the United Kingdom.  I think everybody in the House agrees that what is vitally important at the moment is that the workers in this factory should know what their position is.  I said last night when Deputy Lenihan, senior, said that the Dunlop Company had three years notice of the advent of free trade and this Quota Order gave them another year in which to put themselves in a competitive position and that thereafter it would be unreasonable to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to meet any problems with which the company might be faced or any problem created by redundancy in the company as a result of the import of foreign tyres, that I demurred from Deputy Lenihan's view and Deputy Lenihan then began to backpedal and eventually fled out of the House and disappeared.  He claimed to have a detailed knowledge which he subsequently said was a general knowledge in detail of the costings of the Dunlop factory and left me under the impression that he wished to add that, with that knowledge, he was in a position to say that it was perfectly easy for the Dunlop factory to make itself competitive and equal to any stringencies arising from a reduced tariff within the 12 months period remaining of this Quota Order.</P>
      <P>My principal concern is to provide men who are working in this factory with some degree of certainty as to what the future holds for them.  I do not think the Minister, so far, has given the kind of undertaking I think he ought to be in a position to give.  In July, a statement was published.  We have before us a very succinct introductory speech in which the Minister presented the Confirmation Order to the House.  I have looked at Article XIX of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement to which the Minister refers.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> (1)  If in the territory of either party&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  an appreciable rise in unemployment in a particular sector of industry or region is caused by a substantial decrease in internal demand for a domestic product, and</P>
    <P>(b)  this decrease in demand is due to an increase in imports from the territory of the other as a result of the reduction, modification or elimination of import duties, protective elements in fiscal charges or quantitative restrictions in accordance with Article I, IV, or VI, </P>
    <P>the former party may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, limit those imports by means of quantitative restrictions to a rate not less than the rate of such imports during any period of twelve months which ended within twelve months of the date on which the restrictions came into force; the restrictions shall not be continued for a period longer than eighteen months, unless the other party agrees.</P>
    <P>That is the proviso which limits the Minister's discretion in regard to this particular Quota Order.  It cannot continue for more than 18 months, that is, until approximately next December, without the express consent of the President of the British Board of Trade.  But the Article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The party applying the restrictions shall, if possible, inform the other before the restrictions come into force.  The latter party may, at any time, propose measures designed to moderate any damaging effects of the restrictions or to assist the former party to overcome its difficulties.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (2) of the Article says:</P>
    <P>Nothwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time after 1 July, 1966, either party considers that the application of Article I, IV or VI to any product would lead to the situation described in paragraph (1) of this article, it may propose and the parties may agree on other measures <Col N="599" /> instead of, or in addition to, the restriction of imports in accordance with that paragraph, including, as may be appropriate, an alternative rate of reduction of the import duty or protective element concerned, provided that any such duty or protective element shall be eliminated not later than 1 July, 1981.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (3) says:</P>
    <P>The parties may agree, in the light of the review for which provision is made in paragraph (5) of Article 1, that the rate at which the remainder of the import duty or protective element shall be reduced in respect of imports of a product from the United Kingdom into Ireland shall be modified and, if necessary, that the period after which the duty or protective element is to be eliminated shall be prolonged, provided that any such duty or protective element shall be eliminated not later than 1 July, 1981.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (4) says:</P>
    <P>Before 1 July, 1975 the parties shall jointly consider whether the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article will continue to be necessary and appropriate to deal thereafter with difficulties of a temporary character and shall agree on such provisions as they may find to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Now, in the White Paper circulated with this Agreement and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in December, 1965, there is an explanatory paragraph designed for the guidance of the House and presumably agreed with the other parties to the Agreement.  That explanatory paragraph appears on page 24 of the White Paper.  Paragraph 68 reads:</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1) of this Article allows, on the initiative of the country concerned, the temporary imposition of quantitative import restrictions where an increase in imports due to the removal of duties or quantitative restrictions causes an appreciable rise in unemployment in a particular sector of industry or region.  Such restrictions may be imposed <Col N="600" /> unilaterally for eighteen months and may be extended by agreement.  Imports of the goods affected cannot be restricted to a level below that which obtained during any period of twelve months which ended within twelve months of the date on which the restrictions came into force.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is this.  It appears to me from reading and studying this Article and the explanatory note which I have read for the House that, in fact, the Article envisages the possibility that if the difficulties such as the Dunlop Company experienced in the recent past should re-arise after the lapse of this Quota Order which we are at present considering it is open to the Minister to open discussions with the British Board of Trade to continue quota restrictions for a further period provided always that such continuation is subject to the over-riding limit that it cannot extend beyond July, 1981.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to Deputy Lenihan and, more especially, to the Minister, that he has a duty and the duty he has is to face the implications of the Article of this Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and indicate to the House now what he proposes to do or what the Government propose to do if difficulties similar to those which arose in the recent past in regard to this industry should arise again.  I want to say to Deputy Lenihan very categorically that I understand the responsibility on the Dunlop company to bring their company up to its maximum level of efficiency has been and is being fully discharged by the management of that company up to the limit of what it was humanly and what it is humanly possible to do.  If Deputy Healy or Deputy Wyse, both experienced Deputies in this constituency, or Deputy Lenihan who says he knows the costings of the company intimately, have any information to the contrary, they ought to give it to the House.  They should tell the House if they think the management of the Dunlop company failed in any particular.  The House is entitled to know.  My information is that they did not.  They have done all that could be done.  If Deputy Lenihan, <Col N="601" /> who is now present, knows anything to the contrary, he has a duty to tell the House because we are being asked to determine what is to be done in respect of the Quota Order provisionally made by the Minister last July.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister if I am correct in believing, as I think I am, that the management of the Dunlop tyre factory in Cork has done all that it is physically possible to do.  If I am correct in believing, as I believe I am correct in believing, that the workers in this factory are as skilled and as diligent as any industrial workers in this country, what does the Minister intend to do, under Article XIX, at the end of the currency of the present Quota Order?  I ask that question on behalf of every employee, junior but more especially senior, the men with family responsibilities, the men who have been working in this firm for 20 or 25 years and who are now faced with the nightmare that they may be declared redundant in their middle age.  I remember, several years ago, speaking as Leader of the Opposition, rebuking the Government on their failure to reassure workers when they were contemplating not only this Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement but the wider agreement involved in joining EEC.  I remember saying to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass: &ldquo;It is not enough shaking your gory locks at the manufacturers; the people who are really vitally concerned are the workers who went into protected industries with the approval of the Irish Government 20, 25 and 30 years ago and who are now middle-aged men with highly specialised skills for which there is not ordinarily any alternative employment.&rdquo; Redundancy payment for such men is no compensation for a life invested in a specialised industry at the urgent request of our own Government.</P>
    <P>I want to renew that representation on behalf of the Dunlop factory and I want to submit to the House and to the Minister that they are entitled to hear from the Minister a categorical reply to the inquiry: &ldquo;What are we going to do next September?&rdquo; Now, I recognise that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is in a somewhat delicate position because the relevant <Col N="602" /> Article of the Trade Agreement says that next September his power to act unilaterally ceases.  After his unilateral action, which we are now discussing, ceases to operate, his action thereafter must be in consultation with and in agreement with the President of the Board of Trade in Britain.  Now, if I correctly interpret the spirit in which this Agreement was entered into, I understand it to mean that the British Government accept the proposition that there are certain specialised industries that have been set up here which might be very harshly affected by the operation of the Agreement without qualification and that they were prepared to admit, I imagine, in the case of commodities like tyres, and possibly unassembled motors cars or such exceptional industries, that exceptional steps were appropriate for their maintenance and the maintenance of employment in them.</P>
    <P>It is wholly wrong, however, in your desire to stimulate further endeavour on the part of the management, to apply the screw to the management by threatening that they may find themselves out in the cold in 12 months time, because, to put it quite crudely, it does not matter a damn to the management. The management are all highly geared men of great experience and ability who can find alternative employment in other big industries.  I am thinking of the man of 50 years of age with a family now at secondary school, who is mobilising his own domestic resources to see if he can put them through university and today, yesterday or tomorrow night, after the children have gone to bed, sits by the fire discussing with his wife: &ldquo;What in the name of God are we going to do if 12 months from today the situation recurs such as existed last July? I may be out of a job and there may be no question of my son and my daughter going to university and completing their education as we had planned for them.  If this is so, ought we to leave them in the secondary school or switch them to the technical school to try to get them trained to earn their living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have said in this House time and time again that we get so involved in <Col N="603" /> such broad generalities talking about the terms of trade agreements and the future prospects of free trade and the winds of change blowing in the world, that we are liable to forget the individual whose whole future, and the whole future of whose family, depends on what we say and do in this House. Now, if one were a member of the Federal Government of the United States and came from the State of Maine, one could be forgiven if one were not familiar with the problems of people in Alabama.  Similarly, if one were a member of the British House of Commons, a member of Parliament coming from Sussex, one would not understand the problems of the Orkney Islands, but we in Ireland are not so divorced from one another that a member from Dublin or Monaghan or anywhere else cannot feel sympathy with the feelings of a parent in Cork.  Our problems are all very much the same.  There is not 50 per cent, 60 per cent or 80 per cent of the Deputies here of 50 years of age who have not got precisely the same problems: how are we going to be able to provide for the children now that the expensive time has come of finishing their education?</P>
    <P>As far as I can understand the terms of the Agreement, the Minister has power to initiate discussions with the British Board of Trade to take such measures as may be requisite to maintain employment at its present or a higher level in the Dunlop factory certainly until 1st July, 1981.  If I am right in that, I am asking the Minister to say categorically to the House, and especially to the workers of Dunlop's who have family responsibilities: &ldquo;As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am going to bring all the pressure I can on the management of Dunlop's to maintain a course of development and improvement in their methods and equipment.  I am going to urge on the trade union representatives of the employees to give 100 per cent co-operation in raising the standards of efficiency in the production of tyres in Cork, but I am going to say to the workers: &lsquo;There is no need to abandon your plans.  If we all work <Col N="604" /> together there are means available to us to say with virtual certainty nobody is going to lose his job as a result of redundancy in Cork this side of 1981.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I see the danger of saying that. I see the danger of that being misinterpreted as a general licence to lie back, to take things easy and to go slow.  I say this for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he is not one of the persons in respect of whom a credibility gap has begun to open in this country.  I would be prepared to say, and I have no sympathy with his general political views, that if he said: &ldquo;I want to make this proposition clear and simple.  I will do my part and I have authority on behalf of the Government to keep this company viable to 1981, provided the other two parties play their part&rdquo;, that is, the management and workers in the Dunlop factory in Cork, but he is bound, in his own defence and to maintain his reputation for credibility, to say at the same time: &ldquo;But I want to make this perfectly clear.  If the management and workers are not going to do their part, they cannot look to me to create a situation in which they are certain of the maintenance of the industry which primarily depends on them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but I do not think I am.  I think the management and the men in Dunlop's have been doing their part.  I have not heard a single Deputy suggest that they have not.  If they continue to do so, I invite the Minister, Deputy Lenihan notwithstanding, to discharge his obligation by giving that carefully measured reassurance which I bespeak from him, and say to Deputy Lenihan, either publicly or in private: &ldquo;Do not open your mouth so wide about matters which you claim to know all about but in fact do not know so much as you think you do.&rdquo;  Such a declaration would be of incalculable value to our neighbours who are working in Cork.  I would like to think we are still a close enough knit society to feel for them, to understand their problems and to be resolute to assist them in their anxiety, whether we come from Cork, Mavo or Monaghan.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="605" />
        <b>(Mr. Colley):</b> For what is involved in this, we have had a relatively protracted debate.  It has been protracted more than it might have been because of some Deputies speaking either without knowledge of the situation, but as though they had a full knowledge, or else deliberately misrepresenting the position.  The first and most blatant misrepresentation, which was dealt with by Deputy Healy but which I want to nail again, was that allegation made by Deputy Murphy from the Labour benches that this order is coming before the House because of some interpretation which he places on the results of the Cork by-election.  I need hardly say that this allegation is without foundation. This is proved by the fact that the order was made last May.  Indeed, if Deputy Murphy did not know that, he quoted from my own opening statement and in this he can see that the quota period commenced on 1st July. But he chose to ignore these facts in order to make the point I have referred to.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies asked for certain information on various questions and I propose to give that now before I deal in more detail with the other points raised.  In regard to a query by Deputy Barrett, I want to tell him that the £3 specific minimum duty imposed on non-UK imports of tyres is regarded as sufficient to reduce or eliminate any danger of excessive imports of such tyres.  I understand it is so regarded by Dunlop's as well as other people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Larkin wanted to know what were the tyre imports in the period from January to June, the first six months of this year.  The total tyre imports during that period amounted to 95,268 tyres, of which 61,543 came from the United Kingdom and 33,725 from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies allege there was undue delay in taking action in this regard and accused me of negligence.  Indeed, Deputy Larkin in particular developed this theme at considerable length.  He seemed to think that by looking at the figures for imports of tyres, it should have been perfectly obvious to me that the situation was becoming dangerous and that I should have acted more quickly. Looking at the figures for imports of tyres is not the whole story at all because, as has been mentioned in the course of the debate, Dunlop's were exporting tyres.  Therefore, the figures for imports in themselves mean nothing.  The real question is the impact of imports and exports and the net position in relation to the home market.  It was quite some time before the warning signals emerged, having regard to these factors.  The only people who could know about this were the management of Dunlop's, not the Minister for Industry and Commerce. When the management in Dunlop's approached me and told me what the position was, I proceeded, as far as it was possible to do so, to take the remedial action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some suggestion that really the credit, if &ldquo;credit&rdquo; is the right word, for the action taken in this case should be given to Deputy Barrett. I do not wish to take anything from Deputy Barrett but I want to point out that the first question Deputy Barrett put down in regard to the volume of <Col N="607" /> imports was on 8th February of this year.  His second question, which concerned redundancies, was on 31st May. That is four days after action had been taken to re-impose the quota.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been some misunderstanding of what I said when introducing this motion.  As I conceded to Deputy Dillon last night, that misunderstanding of the wording was not confined to him but other Deputies seemed to have misunderstood it also. It is in regard to the length of time this order will operate.  I said specifically in the first paragraph on page 2, second last sentence:</P>
    <P>The first quota period was fixed at six months ending on 31st December, 1967.</P>
    <P>Therefore the point which I interjected last night that this was operating for a six months period was, in fact, set out in my introductory statement.  The other matter, and the one which apparently led to confusion, was the statement at the beginning of the second paragraph on page 2 which was to this effect:</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement the period during which such restrictions may be maintained is limited to 18 months unless the other party agrees otherwise.</P>
    <P>It says &ldquo;limited to 18 months&rdquo;; in other words, this is the maximum period available unless the other party agrees.  It does not mean, nor does it say, that the protection being imposed in respect of Dunlop's will last for 18 months.  I am rather hopeful that it will not, because while we do intend to renew the protection for a further six months, all the indications at the moment are that this will be sufficient and that it will not be necessary to have a further period of six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be necessary to continue to exclude tyres not from the United Kingdom, I should imagine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  I shall tell the House a little more about that in a moment.  I want to make it quite clear that this quota was imposed after the fullest consultation with the Dunlop management, and all the information available to me from them is that, while a further six months period of protection is necessary to exhaust the excessive amount of tyres which came in and were in stock when we imposed the protection, as things are going now, it is unlikely that a further period of protection such as this will be needed after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did refer, in the course of the debate and interjections, to what appeared to be the strange position that Dunlop's were exporting tyres and at the same time were suffering from excess imports of tyres.  I cannot tell the House with certainty what the explanation for this is, but the explanation is, I think, this: it is well known and is something that was learned a long time ago that when there is a quota in existence for a considerable time and when it is terminated, the termination is automatically followed by a spree of what might be termed novelty buying. People who have been used for many years to only one type of commodity will, when they get the opportunity to sample other varieties of the same commodity, tend to experiment with these and to buy substantial quantities of these novelty ranges.  This is something that has turned out time after time in respect of many other commodities. In this case the imported tyres which were selling in this country and which led to the difficulties here were selling at a higher price than <Col N="609" /> Dunlop tyres were on sale.  As I say, I cannot say with certainty that what I have said is the explanation for the position, but it is true that the tyres which were being purchased here were higher in price than those of Dunlop's, and it is also true in respect of many other commodities that when quotas were terminated, this spate of what I call novelty buying occurred.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the House last night that one of the effects of the Free Trade Area Agreement was to give to Dunlop's for the first time right of free entry to the British market for their exports, and indeed they have availed of this provision to a very considerable extent.  It may be that some of the things that have been said in this House and outside it are quite unfair to Dunlop's, because to some extent some people appear to have had the impression that they were operating for many years under protection, that they were suddenly caught out when the quota disappeared and that they have made no preparation for free trade. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The fact is that the Dunlop firm embarked some years ago on a programme of modernisation and adaptation for free trade, and in that programme they received a substantial adaptation grant of £167,000 or £187,000.  The total estimated cost of their programme of modernisation and adaptation is £2 million, of which they have already spent approximately £1 million.  This is a long-term programme which was proceeding according to plan, but the plan was upset or interfered with, if you like, not because of the abolition of the quota but because this coincided with a very substantial reduction in the number of motor vehicles sold throughout the world in 1965 and 1966; this reduction in the number of motor vehicles led to over-production of tyres, so that the world market for tyres was extremely difficult and was much more difficult than it had been for a very long time. That coincided with the removal of the quota and it meant that the export opportunities which, perhaps, would have been available to Dunlop's were very much less than they might otherwise have been, though they were exporting in the normal way.  If the <Col N="610" /> market had been as it has been for years, they would have been able to expand their exports very considerably and continue on their programme of adaptation.</P>
    <P>It is also true that as part of their programme of adaptation, they have had very detailed consultations with the trade unions concerned, and they agreed with the unions on a scheme of re-organisation.  This scheme of re-organisation has involved, I understand, a reduction in the work force, which has been agreed by the unions because they recognise it is a question of making Dunlop's as efficient as possible in order to enable them to compete, and that with the work force they had this would not have been possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon in particular spoke as though few people on the Fianna Fáil benches, and particularly the Deputies from Cork, really knew what was going on in Dunlop's.  I want to assure him, as I think I told him last night, that they knew a great deal more about the situation than he did.  He accused the Government, and me, and all the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Cork of bad faith, of concealing from the workers in Dunlop's the fact that this protection was temporary.  He dwelt, at very considerable length and with his usual eloquence, on this point. I tried to point out that he was basing his whole premise on something that was not a fact, but he was so taken with his theme that he did not want to abandon it.  He ignored the situation and carried on.  I want to repeat that what Deputy Dillon said in this regard is not accurate.  On 3rd May of this year I received a letter from Deputy Wyse from which I now want to quote.</P>

      <P>3rd May.  I replied to Deputy Wyse on 31st May, saying:</P>
      <P>I delayed writing to you with regard to the representations which you made on behalf of the Irish Dunlop Co. Ltd. on the question of the imports of tyres.  Certain remedial action was about to be taken but it was important that no prior publicity should be given as it could result in substantial forestalling by importing interests.</P>
      <P>You will have seen the recent announcements regarding the action taken.  This is as follows:</P>
      <P>UK tyres have been brought under quota restrictions with effect from the 27th day; imports can now be effected only under licence; there will be a further announcement shortly regarding the size of the import quota which will be appointed; the minimum duty on tyres made in countries, other than the UK has been increased from 12s. 6d. to £3 per article.  The full position now is:</P>
      <P>UK tyres&mdash;Duty of 45 per cent or 11s. 3d. per article plus a quota restriction.</P>
      <P>Other Country tyres&mdash;Duty of 45 per cent or £3 per article.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that this action will be effective in removing the excessive import pressure on the Irish Dunlop Company.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon would care to have a look at some of the back numbers of the <i>Evening Echo</i> in Cork, he will find that Deputy Wyse had that letter published.</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputy the message since he has not got it yet, <Col N="612" /> but I want to give more evidence in this regard.  I have in front of me two cuttings, one from the <i>Irish Times</i> and one from the <i>Irish Independent</i>, both dated 26th May, 1967.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to confuse the issue by any argument from the Opposition as to that.  The heading of the cutting in the <i>Irish Times</i> is: &ldquo;Colley and Jay agree to import quota on tyres&rdquo;.  The heading of the cutting in the <i>Irish Independent</i> is: &ldquo;Quota to be fixed for tyres&rdquo;.  I want to quote briefly from the cutting in the <i>Irish Times.</i> This summarises something I said at a press conference when I returned from a visit to England.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Under Article 19 of the Free Trade Area Agreement, he said, there was a provision that if either country found that imports from the other were operating in such a way as to seriously damage a particular industry, the agreement could be invoked to enable a quota to be placed on the goods in question for a temporary period so as to enable the industry concerned to try to rectify the position.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The British Government,&rdquo; stated Mr. Colley &ldquo;have agreed to our invoking that article in regard to tyres.  The effect of this is that we will now be imposing a quota on the import of tyres for a temporary period, possibly as long as 18 months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of this, how can Deputy Dillon or anyone else suggest that we concealed in any way from the workers in Dunlop's or the people of Ireland exactly what we were doing?  How can that be suggested?  I suggest to Deputy Dillon that he should examine his conscience in this regard.  Last night I pointed out to him the iniquity of his ways but he persisted, and he cannot now object if I pursue the matter somewhat.  On the basis of the argument he was putting forward, he talked about the fact that we were lowering the standard of public life in what we were doing.  I am putting it to <Col N="613" /> Deputy Dillon that in the face of what I have told him, it is quite clear that the basic premise on which he was operating is not true.  If it is not true, is Deputy Dillon not quite unjustified in lightly talking about what we were doing and saying that we were lowering the standard of public life?  Deputy Dillon is concerned about the standard of public life.</P>

      <P>I am very seriously concerned about it and that is why I object to any lightly-made allegation that the standards in public life are being lowered.  I endeavoured to point out the facts to Deputy Dillon but he persisted, despite that, in making his allegations.  I suggest to him that he was not justified and that the facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at his own statement:</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement the period during which such restrictions may be maintained is limited to eighteen months, unless the other party agrees otherwise.</P>
      <P>Is there not a clear implication that there may be an extension: &ldquo;unless the other party agrees otherwise&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This could apply to any commodity.  It does not apply only to tyres.  This is the provision of Article 19.  I think I have made it clear to the House in relation to tyres, and the quota imposed on tyres, that every effort was made to make it crystal clear to everyone concerned that the protection being applied was temporary and that it was most unlikely that it would extend beyond 18 months.  This is clear from what I have just said and from the fact that Deputy Wyse had this letter published in the <i>Evening Echo.</i> It cannot be alleged that no effort was made to make the position clear to the workers in Dunlop's and the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> Deputy Flanagan talked about the necessity for all of us to buy Irish goods, with which I thoroughly agree. He expressed horror&mdash;I think that would be the word&mdash;at the thought that there were Irish people who were prepared to buy foreign tyres when they were perhaps placing the livelihood of the workers in the Dunlop factory in jeopardy by so doing.  I agree entirely with this sentiment.  I want to let Deputy Flanagan know that in the recent by-election in Cork one gentleman&mdash;I understand he was representing the Labour Party; in fact I think he was a Member of this House&mdash;endeavoured to fan the resentment of the workers in Dunlop's because of the situation which had developed and that he did not have Dunlop tyres on his car.</P>

      <P>My Party was founded on and built up on a policy of protection for Irish industry and because of that policy, we have an Irish industry today that we can go into a free trade era with and depend on because of that policy.  The point I am getting at is that the fact of having to be prepared for free trade is clear to anybody who will open his eyes.  Deputy Donegan has opened his eyes: he accepts this without question.  The Labour Party adopt the attitude: &ldquo;We did not want this agreement; we are not going to have it.&rdquo;  They ignore the facts of the situation but then they say: &ldquo;Why do managements not gear for free trade? Are the workers' livelihoods not at stake and they cannot do anything about this?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is a Free Trade Agreement.  Let us make no mistake about it.  Free trade is what it says.  It means free trade between us and Britain and it provides for a graduated application of free trade as far as our industry is concerned.  The moment there is the slightest difficulty arising as, for instance, in this case of the tyres in Dunlop's, we get a situation where the Fine Gael Party say: &ldquo;This is one of the disadvantages arising from the Free Trade Agreement,&rdquo; and by implication, say: &ldquo;You should not have signed it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think any perusal of the speeches made by Fine Gael Deputies in this debate will show that what I have said is not misrepresenting their attitude.  It is true, as Deputy Barrett says, they also spoke about the question of acting quickly.  I have explained that nobody could know the situation except the management of Dunlop's, because you have to balance their exports against their imports and against their production.  As soon as they notified me, I proceeded to act and it could not have been done faster than it was done, but no action could be taken until I heard from them that the situation was becoming difficult. As regards extending the 18 months period, I have already explained to the House that I am hoping the period will not last longer than 12 months.  I am not giving any undertaking subsequently to that because the situation which may arise in the second six months will be reviewed and whatever the position is then will decide what action may need to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of Deputies on both the Opposition benches in telling us that we have had no benefits from the Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;this was said by both Fine Gael and Labour&mdash; is just not true.  I am not going into agriculture because it has nothing to do with us on this debate, but on the industrial side, as Deputies are aware, in 1966, we had record industrial exports and in this year so far, our industrial <Col N="620" /> exports are up 13 per cent on 1966.  Do they think that the Free Trade Area Agreement had nothing to do with this?  If they do, it would be interesting to know how they explain, because they keep telling us that not alone has it done no good but that it has had a disastrous effect, to the workers in the factories who are creating an enormous increase in exports that the Free Trade Area Agreement has done harm to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to conclude. The point I was making was that right through this debate.  I have had to listen to Deputies on the Fine Gael and Labour benches telling us about the inequities of the Free Trade Area Agreement and pointing out that Dunlop's was an example of this.  I want to repeat that this Agreement has been of enormous benefit, particularly to Irish industry.  If you do not believe that, explain to the people how those spectacular increases, especially <Col N="621" /> in our exports, have come about.  If you can do that, you are better and more effective politicians than I take you for, but either way, it seems to me that the debate has ranged far beyond this Quota Order.  If it has served to highlight some of the effects of the Free Trade Area Agreement, it is all to the good.  If it has, as Deputy Donegan said, operated as a warning to all manufacturers and to all workers, this is a good thing, although it might be misinterpreted how it would, but if it has the effect on our management and on our workers of getting them to realise that unless they gear themselves to free trade, they might find themselves in difficulties, might have redundancy and might have to close down, then it will have done good.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear in this particular case of Dunlop's, that both management and workers were well aware of the dangers of free trade. They co-operated, and are still cooperating, in gearing themselves for free trade, as I explained to the House earlier.  If this is an example to others, it is all to the good, but I do not want the idea to go forth that Dunlop's, either the management side or the worker side, were not prepared for free trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say a few words if I may&mdash;I do not intend to detain the House at all. However, this Vote has to do with the preservation of historic monuments, to some degree at any rate.  I want, with your permission and perhaps with your kind consideration, Sir, to make a very brief reference to a matter of some national importance and to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take it to his heart, as they say.  I refer to the question of the Killymoon Hoard.  This is spelled &ldquo;h-o-a-r-d&rdquo; in case there might be any doubt about the pronunciation and the general terms of the use of English in the House.  This, I may say briefly, is the name given to a treasure discovered over 100 years ago.</P>
      <P>I understand from what I read in the newspapers that it is on a private estate in this country and was discovered by a labourer, I think, in a bog.  It is said to be the oldest example of handworked gold in Western Europe and it has been in this country for a very considerable time.  It has been in private possession and now we are told it is to be sold next week at an auction in Christies.  It is generally accepted by people interested in this thing, archaeologists and anybody interested in matters artistic or the interests of the country, that we should try to keep items of this kind here in Ireland and that we should try to obtain them for the National Museum.  I do not know by what private rights of ownership individuals are entitled to take these historic objects&mdash;in this case I believe it is about 3,000 years old&mdash;and to export them, without by your leave, to another country and sell them there for private profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing is extremely dubious to me, but leaving that aside, I simply want to avail of this opportunity to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should have a word with the Minister for Finance to see if something can be done to ensure that this remarkable collection will not be allowed to go into the possession of some other country. That is all I want to say on this Board of Works Estimate, except to add that from my experience and knowledge of the work of the Board over the past year, it has been satisfactory <Col N="623" /> and I have no complaints about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be extremely brief also and to advert to one or two things that come to my mind. We have had an announcement that the Boyne is to be drained and initially, as is usual in matters of this kind, we have had an announcement from the Board of Works.  That gives us a lot of information.  Very often public representatives and other interested parties are excluded from knowing the details of such a plan until they see it in these documents.  I can understand the administrative and the political difficulties and that it is necessary, when such a plan is produced, that it be produced in detail.</P>
      <P>I should now like to advert to one thing which seems to me to be wrong. The River Mattock is a tributary of the Boyne.  It flows into the Boyne at Old Bridge.  It drains a small area of land which is of importance to the people who live there as it runs through an important part of this area.  Complaints have been made by many farmers that the Mattock is not included as a tributary to be drained and that they are excluded from the main arterial drainage scheme of the Boyne.  I have had representations from farmers in the area.  As this only occurred within the past 48 hours, I have not had time to deal with it, but I should like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is necessary to have another look at this. Failure to drain the River Mattock will exclude the drainage of the land in that particular area when the main arterial drainage of the Boyne is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  In the drainage of the Boyne, if the flow of water is increased&mdash;and the Boyne is a river which has a fast flow with a scouring effect on the drainage that might be carried out on its bed&mdash;in heavy rainfall, there is a problem that has to be faced.  This can be very expensive and it does not seem to have been covered by the hand-out given to various people and members of the <Col N="624" /> Dáil.  Drogheda quays are most important to the people of the town.  Boats tie up within the town three miles from the sea.  These quay walls are of very ancient vintage indeed and there have been cases of road subsidence over the past few years.  Drogheda Harbour Board, when I was a member of it, were considering the danger of serious effects but since that nothing has been done.  I am informed by interested parties in the area that the question of the Drogheda quays is one that would have to be seriously considered by the engineering staff dealing with the Boyne drainage.</P>
    <P>I should also like to advert to something which may or may not happen.  It has to do with Drogheda courthouse and possibly office accommodation for people who might be stationed in Drogheda during the drainage of the Boyne.  We have had a situation in Drogheda where a Circuit Court judge left the courthouse because he regarded it as dangerous and the accommodation inadequate.  Benjamin Whitworth gave Drogheda a town hall and this building, it was thought, might possibly be used as a courthouse.  This is a lovely building and indeed if reconstructed, would be in excellent condition.  But, we in the corporation have had a secret, which is that the Franciscan Fathers were interested in the Whitworth Hall for use as a church.  We bought it for them from the trustees and during the credit squeeze, we bought it on the basis of paying a small sum with regular payments to the trustees.  It has now transpired that the Franciscan Fathers have said that they are prepared to convert the Benjamin Whitworth Hall into a church.  We are paying a large sum per week for the renting of a public dancehall and a function room for use as a courthouse and this, in fact, is also inadequate and not exactly what we need.</P>
    <P>The other project in relation to the courthouse was the reconstruction of the existing courthouse and that the second courthouse, which has been disused for many years, be converted into offices on a lease basis or rented; and it would also serve as consulting rooms for litigants, solicitors and barristers. This was across the corridor from the <Col N="625" /> existing courthouse until the judge refused to use it.  I, as a member of the county council, will bring the situation to the notice of the council and the fact that it was suggested a few years ago that there would be an opportunity to lease accommodation from the Board of Works.  I have no doubt the council will investigate the matter and we may perhaps get in touch with the Parliamentary Secretary.  It would be a good thing if one were to use the courthouse on conversion into offices and perhaps have the other one reconstructed as a courthouse again.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters to which I should like to refer.  One is that for many years in rural Ireland the Board of Works have built almost identical schools, if not in size, in design, and they all have the water tower outside.  The first one looked nice; the second looked nice; and the third looked nice; but by the time you had seen 40 of them, you were fed up looking at them.  The famous one I remember is that one painted duck-egg blue.  It was suggested that certain gentlemen who were imbibing the night before might become ill as they passed it by in the morning.  There has been a breakthrough in my local parish.  We have a different school with central heating, one of the first in any rural area in Ireland.  We have a persistent manager who keeps hammering at the Board of Works and that is why we got this breakthrough.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to have these identical schools in every parish.  We might use our inspiration and alter the appearance of the schools.  I am sure that Mr. Boyd Barrett of the Board of Works knows the accommodation required, how much is necessary for wet clothes, how much teacher accommodation is necessary, how much pupil accommodation, and so on. Within limits, it should be possible to ring the bell of change now so that we will not have identical schools with identical windows and the identical water towers.  To my mind, this is important.  We should aim at preserving our individuality and I do not think it would cost so much to do so.</P>
    <P>There is something which is not in <Col N="626" /> the Parliamentary Secretary's speech on the Estimate about the building of certain regional technical colleges.  A few years ago it was announced that the regional technical colleges, particularly one in Dundalk, would serve boys and girls from Deputy Dillon's and my constituency, and from as far away as Cavan.  Louth County Council considered it seriously and made great efforts, as did Dundalk Urban District Council, in order to satisfy Louth County Vocational Education Committee on sites.  We got a certain distance but there the matter stopped.</P>
    <P>We all know how serious it is. Deputy Dillon spoke earlier of the expenses parents have in educating their children.  The expense element means that a father and mother in Carrickmacross would be unable, if they had to send their son to Dublin, to have him educated as an architect or an engineer because of the cost of lodgings and so on.  Instead, he could be put on a school bus to Dundalk.  I notice that in Bolton Street boys are now coming out with degrees in central heating.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The plain fact is I have a very soft corner in my heart for the Board of Works.  There are some Government Departments which labour over a very wide field, largely anonymously, and if anything goes wrong, rarely if ever is due credit given to the distinguished body of public servants concerned.  One very sensible departure by the Board of Works during the past ten years has been the publication of an annual report entitled <Col N="627" /><i>Oibre</i> and in successive numbers of that publication, there has been a very succinct record of the history of the Board of Works and the kind of work the Board have done throughout the country during the years since they were originally established.</P>
      <P>Now, it is no more than a skeleton story, but I submit that the Parliamentary Secretary should favourably consider the desirability of collecting these articles, when they are completed, and giving them permanent form, possibly not as an exhaustive record of the history of this whole Department of State but as a skeleton on which some future historian might put flesh and blood so that the full story of the work done for the nation by the Board of Works might be made known to the people who pay for it.  If that record is adequately made, a great many critics of the Board of Works will come to realise that most of the money entrusted to their charge has been laid out to the great advantage of the people who entrusted them with their resources.</P>
      <P>There is one item in the annual Estimates which you, Sir, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, will be familiar with but which other Deputies only too frequently forget, that is the provision for appropriations-in-aid. I wish to make a proposal to the Parliamentary Secretary which will stimulate these appropriations-in-aid and at the same time, discharge a most valuable function in protecting what is a very valuable national asset.  Every Department of State have in their possession vast masses of obsolescent files. This applies particularly to the Land Commission but there are other Departments, like Local Government, in which the same criticism would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present a proposal that the Department of Lands should be transferred to Castlebar is being canvassed. This, quite frankly, I believe to be a gimmick: if there is to be a transfer, we shall have two Departments, one in Castlebar and one in Merrion Street. However, that proposal brings into high relief the matter which I wish to mention.  If there is a transfer of that <Col N="628" /> Department in part or in whole to Castlebar, one of the first problems that will arise is the matter of the files.</P>
    <P>There are vast masses of documents in the Land Commission, going back through the last century.  Many of the documents of title go back to the 16th century in this country.  That constitutes a skeleton of the domestic history of the country and I am desperately apprehensive that, in preparation for any change there may be, a decision will be taken in the Department of Lands of an arbitrary character which will say: &ldquo;Look; 20 years is the term of title arising from possession; let us take a decision to destroy all the files more than 20 years old in the Land Commission&rdquo;, and there will ensue a holocaust.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a proposal that the Board of Works set up a central depot and say to every Department of State: &ldquo;Destroy no more files through the incinerator.  If you decide to dispose of all your files 20 years or more old, notify us and send them to us; if they are suitable for destruction, we shall arrange for their sale to paper merchants and thus derive a not inconsequential appropriation-in-aid.  Instead of having them all burned at great cost, we can convert them into a source of revenue for the Board of Works and we can avail of the advice of the Records Office and the Manuscripts Commission and extract from the mass of material you propose to dispose of documents of permanent value, and these, in consultation with the Record Office and the Manuscripts Commission, we will preserve.&rdquo;  But if the Board of Works were to undertake that assignment, what could be realised by the sale of the surplus wastepaper would more than pay any expense that might be involved in ensuring that valuable records were not indiscriminately destroyed as obsolescent or obsolete files.</P>
    <P>I can see at once that experienced administrators may say that this is not a practical proposition, that it would mean that huge pantechnicons would arrive at the Board of Works.  I think that is true in the initial stages but I can see from my own experience that if <Col N="629" /> masses of obsolescent or obsolete files arrive at the Department of Agriculture, a very cursory review would consign them to the wastepaper merchant without extensive examination, whereas files coming from the Department of Local Government or from the Department of Lands would contain a vast mass of material which would serve to repair the lacunae which exist in the Record Office as a result of the disastrous fire of 1922.  I trust, Sir, that you see the relevance of this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to suggest what should be a new division.  He is responsible for ancient monuments. Are our ancient documents not as precious?  Who else is to do it?  One of the problems is that there is nobody responsible.  Am I not entitled to suggest that we should urge the Parliamentary Secretary to accept responsibility for a job for which nobody else is responsible at the present time?  I will not pursue the matter if you think it goes beyond the limits of relevance but there is not anybody responsible, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary will tell you himself that there has come under his attention the destruction of documents, not in the custody of any Government Department, but documents of incalculable value, simply because there was nobody whose business it was to salvage them and they just blew away on the wind and were largely destroyed, though in part recovered by some public-spirited individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is of great urgency, as I think I can illustrate.  I recently found a box of documents in my own house which, to my eyes, were rubbish, and yet I found in the old box, not the original document of title, but a recital from the Record Office going back to the original grant of land in the time of the Tudor Kings to the Earl of Galway and a subsequent grant by the Earl of Galway of a lease of those lands in the early seventeenth century, providing a right <Col N="630" /> of title from the original Tudor grant of the Earl of Galway down to the present day in respect of certain leaseholds. The original document disappeared in the Record Office fire and the interesting thing is that when I was concerned to make these available, I did not find it so easy to find anybody to whom I could say: &ldquo;Do you want these documents?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, I do not want to trespass on your indulgence, if you think it goes beyond the scope of the debate.  My problem is that I do not know what debate I can raise it on.  Yet, it is a matter of the utmost urgency because irretrievable damage may be done unless there is some central agency, which I think should be located in the Board of Works, in consultation with the Manuscripts Commission and the Ancient Monuments Commission, who would undertake the assignment of ensuring that precious material of the social history of this country should not inadvertently perish in the process of destroying obsolete files.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I want to compliment the Board of Works.  I suppose I should compliment the Board of Works and the present Ceann Comhairle's distinguished predecessor, Deputy Hogan, when he was Ceann Comhairle, on the removal of all the lumber out of the hall of Leinster House.  By one sweeping gesture, the Board of Works have converted a doghouse which the front hall of Leinster House used to be into the kind of hall appropriate for the entrance to an Irish Parliament, and I do not think work of that kind should go unnoticed in this House.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that as they proceed to the decoration of the hall, they will recognise the beauty of what they have already done and not spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar.  I certainly will be proud to show the hall of Leinster House to visitors to this country, if it is ultimately made what I hope it will be by decoration suitable to its venerable structure.  But, lest it appear that my affection for the Board of Works is vitiating my judgment in regard to their activities, I have a pejorative word to say now.  It does <Col N="631" /> seem to me to be a strange incongruence that they should show such vision in the hall of Leinster House while they stud the noblest Georgian facade in Dublin with white buttons on which to string electric wires.  I do not underestimate the problem of wiring an old house for electricity.  I have seen some of the wires, a hideous assembly of wires, entering the top window over the front door.  I had hoped that when further wiring fell to be done, a more imaginative approach would be employed. To my horror and dismay, the more imaginative approach was employed, but it was even more hideous than the earlier effort.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary noticed the white buttons?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe this is only a temporary expedient.  Really, it is preposterous that the same body which could deal so handsomely with the hall should proceed to the destruction of the facade.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at the front of the house and to ensure (1) that the white buttons are removed and (2) that the miscellany of lead cables, which he is not responsible for installing there and which have been there for many years, should now be radically dealt with and the electric supply brought into the front of the house underground because this house has the peculiar distinction of having two distinguished facades, one on Leinster lawn and one on Kildare Street.  It is, therefore, not open to us to have recourse to the usual precautions of bringing electric cables into the back of the house.  Both facades are of great architectural merit.  I cannot but believe that power can be brought in by some subterranean device beneath the foundations and then distributed discreetly through the House without wrecking the architectural quality of the structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On another occasion I have mentioned, with admiration, the placards the Board of Works put on ancient <Col N="632" /> monuments they have taken under their care However, I mentioned that, at Jerpoint Abbey, I found a placard which not only declared the identity of the ancient monument but went on to give a short summary of its history. There are dozens of ancient monuments which have been taken under the care of the Board of Works but, beyond a notice that they are under the care of the Board of Works, no other information whatever is available to those of us who visit them.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be quite easy to ask the Commission on Ancient Monuments, or some body of that kind, to prepare an inscription of, say, 100 words in respect of each monument and, as they are prepared and furnished to the Board of Works, they should be suitably engrossed and erected at a place where they would readily be available to visitors interested in the history of the monument concerned.</P>
    <P>The Board of Works are responsible for the provision of embassies.  As I understand the administrative situation, the Department of External Affairs inform the Board of Works that they want an embassy in Lima, Peru, in Paris or in some other place.  The Board of Works, in consultation with the Department of External Affairs, proceed to examine the accommodation and make a recommendation.  We are living in a changing world.  In Victorian times, a country such as Ireland, Switzerland, Denmark or Norway would not have had any Ambassador: we should have had Ministers.</P>
    <P>The diplomatic tradition was that great powers exchanged Ambassadors. Powers which did not claim to be international powers, in the &ldquo;power&rdquo; sense, exchanged Ministers.  Accordingly, the great powers had embassies.  The lesser powers had legations.  A tradition grew up that if you had an embassy you had to have a palatial establishment.  In Victorian days, the maintenance of palatial establishments was not an intolerable burden.  Domestic service was then readily available and these great houses could adequately be maintained.</P>
    <P>In the changing world in which we <Col N="633" /> live, the most expensive commodity today is personal service.  If you have a gargantuan embassy you will require ten to 15 servants to keep it.  No sane person now keeps ten or 15 servants. You do not have butlers and house-keepers and all the retinue that used to be associated with the maintenance of these great establishments.  Yet, in certain cities, we still maintain vast embassies.  Now, there is nothing more depressing or, if I may use so harsh a word, more ridiculous than to visit an embassy of palatial proportions which manifestly is not maintained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am suggesting that when the Department of External Affairs request them to purchase embassy premises, the Board of Works advise them.  When we are purchasing embassy premises, let us not forget that the operation does not end with the purchase of the house.  There is the question of its maintenance.  The Board of Works are responsible for that.  I do not think I am trespassing.  I feel that the Board of Works are the authority advising the Department of External Affairs.  If the Department of External Affairs say: &ldquo;We want an embassy&rdquo;, the Board of Works say: &ldquo;We have premises suitable for an embassy&rdquo;.  I am inviting the Board of Works, in the exercise of their expertise, to say to the Department of External Affairs: &ldquo;But, remember, these premises may be ideal from the point of view of an embassy but do not forget that having an embassy does not end with the acquisition of a lovely premises because lovely premises, inadequately maintained, very rapidly become a diplomatic slum&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> I want to suggest that, in the exercise of their special expertise in the matter of the acquisition of buildings and their maintenance and their furnishing, which is the work of the Board of Works, the Board of Works should say to the Department of External Affairs: &ldquo;The plain fact is that this new situation ought to be recognised. All our Ministers have now become Ambassadors and the same is true of every country in the world.  This old distinction between the embassy and the legation has disappeared.  What we ought to recognise is that a modest establishment for an Irish Ambassador, adequately maintained, is infinitely more impressive than a vast palace which breathes, to any sophisticated visitor, the atmosphere of glossy inadequate maintenance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Suppose I were pressing that these great embassies should better be maintained, I should agree at once that that is a representation which I should address to the Minister for External Affairs and say to him: &ldquo;You ought to increase the allowances.  You ought to extend the staffing.  You ought to provide more money.&rdquo;  I am not saying that.  I am saying that the Board of Works, who are experts in this matter, should make representations as follows to the Department of External Affairs: &ldquo;We advise you to review this whole question.  We advise you that we should sell some of those vast mausoleums, at very considerable profit, and get suitable but more manageable establishments which would eminently be suitable for an Irish Ambassador and which existing financial provision would admirably maintain, whereas the existing places are becoming diplomatic slums.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is a matter which is within the immediate and direct responsibility of the Board of Works. They are the experts and it is their function and duty to advise in regard to this matter.  The time is long past when they should take the initiative in saying within the financial provision the continued establishment and maintenance of these vast buildings is no longer practicable and the correct solution is not to make ambassadorial protio <Col N="635" /> vision in the External Affairs Vote but to let us in the exercise of our expert knowledge acquire more than adequate establishments which will not overtax the available resources for maintenance in a proper style.  Remember it is important that our Ambassadors should live in proper style and the emphasis is not on &ldquo;style&rdquo; but on &ldquo;proper&rdquo;. It should be handsome but not ostentatious.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I want to refer is one which I know causes the Parliamentary Secretary to get cross although it is possibly just as well that for the time being his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Lalor, is filling in for him.  The matter I wish to refer to is the disposal of the spoil of arterial drainage work carried out by the Board of Works.  I do not underestimate the formidable character of this problem.  I know that you cannot have arterial drainage without spoil.  I know also all about the problem that in order to make it possible for the machinery to operate the spoil has to be set back 12 or 15 yards from the verge of the new river bed.  That does not alter the fact that where you are making rock cuttings, and these rock cuttings pass through relatively smallholdings, to deposit huge mountains of rock spoil on a relatively smallholding 12 or 15 yards from the river bed is to impose on the small farmer a very serious burden and it could operate to make his holding almost unworkable.  In any case, it creates an atmosphere of bitter resentment and a deep sense of grievance. You will observe that I distinguish between these mountains of rock spoil and banks of clay spoil.  Banks of clay spoil tend to get absorbed into the general contour of the holding.</P>

      <P>Well, I admit that the blue clay presents a problem, but if you try to solve problems you want to try to be reasonable and on the whole the spoil is there and something has to be done about it.  I do not think it would be beyond the ingenuity of the Agricultural Institute of the Department <Col N="636" /> of Agriculture to help a person who has a pile of blue quag.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to say that if I was Minister for Agriculture in the morning and approached Dr. Tom Walsh and said to him: &ldquo;Turn our boys over to this problem and find a solution as to how this spoil can be incorporated in a smallholding&rdquo;, we might not find the ideal solution but we would find some solution.  However, it is beyond their resources to deal with rock spoil.  I venture to suggest in the old days before big companies like Roadstone established a virtual monopoly in the supply of road material for local authorities, it was possible to go to the local authority and ask the county engineer, in so far as circumstances would allow and the quality of the rock would permit, to use that rock spoil in the vicinity of the place of deposit for the repair of roads.  I do not say that at any time that was a complete solution but it was an immense help to a man who had a deep sense of grievance if the county engineer said: &ldquo;We will take as much of that as we can.  We will not take it all this year, or perhaps even next year, but you can depend on it that whenever a road or a lane is to be repaired I will see that as much of it as possible is carted away and we will not be dominated by economic considerations in using that material in preference to other stone.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> I do not think it unreasonable for the Parliamentary Secretary to say to firms like Roadstone: &ldquo;You are now doing an immensely profitable business and the Oireachtas has determined in its wisdom to endorse the view of the county engineers that in the last analysis the economic considerations became so dominant that they had to decide to close down rock quarries which resulted in a good deal of unemployment in many areas where quarry employment was very valuable. Now the Oireachtas, and the local authorities, are all contributing to the very profitable business you are building up and they have made it possible for you to get into the export business and are you prepared to make some gesture to help us in so far as it is reasonable to tackle this problem of rock spoil?&rdquo; The moment that that proposal is made, I know that the first answer will be: &ldquo;But the quality of the stone is not suitable for our business at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But the answer is a lemon.  Of course, it is not the ideal stone for this purpose.  We all know that in a great many cases it is not roadmaking stone at all and if you were charged with the responsibility of delivering the optimum market to the local authorities for their roadmaking work the kind of stone removed from a rock cutting might be regarded from an engineering point of view as quite unsuitable for roadmaking.  But this kind of problem can be resolved by reasonable men.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture, I was trying to collaborate with Bord na Móna about the possible user of cutaway bog.  I provided the staff to do the job.  After protracted inquiry, I discovered that the problem was that the Department of Finance would not sanction our buying shovels and wheelbarrows because there were shovels and wheelbarrows on the site and Bord na Móna would not allow the employees of the Department of Agriculture to use their wheelbarrows and their spades.  Ultimately, I had to send for the then chairman of Bord na Móna, Dr. Andrews, and say to <Col N="638" /> him: &ldquo;Listen, Tod; is it conceivable that you and I can sit down on two sides of a table and hold up important work because you will not let our fellows use your spades and barrows and the Department of Finance will not allow me to buy duplicate spades and barrows?&rdquo; Of course, in five minutes Tod Andrews and I settled the thing and the work went forward.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should send for the chairman of Roadstone and ask him to bring with him his engineering experts.  He should say to them: &ldquo;If you cannot use the stone as I asked you to do, with all your expertise, you can help me solve my problem, that is, to get the stone off the land where it has been dumped in the course of the drainage operation carried out?&rdquo; If my judgment goes for anything, I believe a firm of that standing, with their expertise, if they are not prepared to say they will take it and use it, will have some suggestion to make to the Parliamentary Secretary as to how it might be disposed of in one way or another.  I suggest it could be that, if suitable machinery were employed to transfer it to an appropriate site, if it were not suitable for the making of main roads, or even of county roads, it might be suitable for the making of by-roads.</P>
    <P>But do not let us underestimate the annoyance, the distress and the irritation that the piling of rock spoil on small holdings gives rise to.  It may be disproportionate that this much time of the House should be taken up with the problems of so few small people.  But it should be the glory of this Oireachtas that there is nobody in this country so insignificant that we are not concerned for his legitimate problems.  I can assure Deputies and the Parliamentary Secretary from an intimate knowledge of smallholders, both in my constituency and around my home, that the deposition of rock spoil on their land, especially in modern circumstances when it has to lie 12 or 15 feet from the river bank, constitutes a very grievous distress to those who have to bear with it.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say about the <Col N="639" /> Board of Works.  I hope the suggestions I have made will be of value to the Parliamentary Secretary, with special reference to the wires and white buttons on the front of Leinster House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that in general the House has not a great deal of complaint about the running of the Office of Public Works for the last 12 months.  Nevertheless, a great many comments of varying kinds have been made, and one of my problems is to know where to begin in replying to them.  Perhaps the best thing to do is to begin with the remarks made by Deputy Harte, since he was the principal speaker for the principal Opposition Party.  As I say, I am pleased that in general his criticisms of our operations for the last 12 months were rather superficial, peripheral, cursory and to some extent a bit inaccurate.</P>
      <P>One of the first points raised by Deputy Harte was the question of the maintenance of drainage schemes. Speaking as the official Board of Works spokesman for Fine Gael, he seemed to me to suggest that it was his opinion and his Party's opinion that the cost of maintenance of drainage schemes should be borne by the State and that local responsibility for this matter should be abandoned.  I do not know whether he meant it to be understood as expressing the official view of the Fine Gael Party.  It would be very interesting to know as to whether or not that is the case.  It would give rise to a situation in which people in many parts of the country, who themselves have been looking for drainage for decades, would be perforce obliged to contribute not only to the carrying out of drainage schemes in other parts of the country but also to the maintenance of such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is unfair that people who live in areas where drainage has been carried out and the people who benefit by that drainage should be asked to carry the burden of maintenance themselves.  I do not accept Deputy Harte's suggestion that this should be loaded on to people who may <Col N="640" /> be up to their ankles in rushes and water themselves, who would be obliged to pay not only for the execution but for the maintenance of drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte also suggested that not a great deal of progress had been made in drainage.  Indeed, he went so far as suggesting there had been a slowing down, that since the great days of the inter-Party Government drainage has been to some degree neglected.  We only have to consider a couple of statistics to explode that suggestion.  Since the beginning of the arterial drainage scheme under the 1945 Act about £20 million has been spent on drainage. More than half of that sum has been spent since 1960.  Therefore, I do not think it is accurate or right to say that there has been any slowing down. Obviously from the figures there has been a great acceleration in arterial drainage and I would hope this would be continued.  I do not suggest that the progress made in the last couple of years, in the stringent financial conditions in which we found ourselves, was as good as I would like to have.  But I would hope in the future progress will not only be maintained but greatly accelerated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte had another remarkable suggestion to make about the manner of execution of drainage schemes.  Deputy Flanagan, when speaking last night, seemed to suggest the same thing.  As the House knows, under the Drainage Acts the only way in which arterial drainage can be done at all is by means of comprehensive drainage schemes carried out in the entire catchment area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way the operation is usually done, but what Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Harte seemed to suggest was that in the many areas throughout the country where there are local drainage problems&mdash; Deputy Flanagan referred to fallen trees and other obstacles of that nature causing flooding in areas as they do all <Col N="641" /> over the country&mdash;the Office of Public Works should go in and do piecemeal jobs.</P>

      <P>No matter how prosperous we are, no matter how much we provide for drainage, whether it be £2 million or £20 million, it would still remain true to say that the correct procedure would be as it is laid down in the Drainage Acts, that is, to plan the drainage catchment by catchment, do the main channel first, as Deputy Dillon says, and then do the tributaries. However no matter how much money you had to spend it would not be wise or profitable to dissipate your available capital in doing little piecemeal jobs like the removal of local obstacles, because usually what happens where such jobs are done&mdash;and some very foolish work has been done under the Act to which Deputy Dillon referred, the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash; you remove the immediate cause of the flooding in a small local area and transfer it somewhere downstream.  You aggravate the problem, and in the absence of any provision for maintenance, as there is no provision for maintenance in such cases, the situation recreates itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would suggest to Deputy Harte that he would look at the provision made for drainage over the past eight or ten years, and then he can tell me whether he can honestly say that the rate of progress is affected by lack of money.  Any fool can say that if they had twice as much money they could do twice as much drainage. That is very simple to say, but there is a progressive increase in the rate at which money is being provided for drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, Deputy O'Leary and <Col N="643" /> several other Deputies mentioned spoil.  I am told that in my absence Deputy Dillon suggested that I get cross when the subject of spoil is mentioned.  I think Deputy Dillon is objective enough to see that with a problem as cussed and damnable as this question of spoil, one can be forgiven for getting a little bit cross about it.  The Office of Public Works, in all cases where there is difficult spoil to be disposed of, have offered it to people like the GAA if they are building embankments around their parks, and they have in fact on several occasions got rid of rock spoil in this way. They offer it to county councils.  It is a very hard seller.  It is like trying to sell a beast at the fair with a bad cough and possibly only three legs. Nobody wants to talk to you when you are trying to get rid of spoil.  It is a thing we do not despair about, although it is not a very encouraging thing to try to manage.  As I say, rock spoil can be used for various things like embankments and sports fields.  It can be used, possibly, for low-grade road-making material.  Then there are more difficult types of spoil, difficult clays of various kinds that cannot be spread over land.</P>

      <P>That is one of the things they are there for, admittedly, but I do know this that they have a system of priorities and one of the things to which they must give high priority is the matter of soil surveys not of spoil samples from drainage schemes but soil surveys of the agricultural land of Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is in progress but it is only in its initial stages.  I should like to see the Agricultural <Col N="644" /> Institute devoting a great deal of attention to this and I know very well I do not have to say this to them; they know it themselves, and possibly I am digressing from our subject.  It may well be they might have some helpful suggestions. In fact I think we ought to ask them.  However, our experience has been that spoil is a very difficult thing to place.  I know, too, that in certain areas of the country it is very ugly to look at apart from the damage it does to small farms, the farms of people who cannot afford the area of land upon which the spoil is deposited.  We are aware of all these things, and it is very easy to point out what difficulty it causes for people especially farmers whose land is effectively put out of action by infertile clay soils.  Speaking from a hunch more than from actual knowledge, I should imagine that in the Boyne scheme the type of spoil ought to be of a kind that would lend itself to spreading on the land.  This is purely speculation on my part.  I would think that a valley so fertile would produce spoil of that kind: I hope it does.  We will have to devote particular attention to the question of spoil in the Boyne because it is one of the most beautiful areas in the country and I should hate to see that area spoiled, as it were, by spoil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of an average run of spoil you get from the river bed.  When there is a weir, it is made of stone.  It was put there in the first place by carting the stone into it. Obviously, it can be taken away in the same way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte mentioned a complaint he had about a sluice on the Swilly.  My information is that all the sluices in this area are working properly.  If there is any one he wants attended or examined, I should be glad if he would let me know about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully, <Col N="645" /> speaking on the question of drainage, expressed anxiety about water supplies and how they will be affected in the Boyne drainage scheme.  The position is that usually water supply schemes are adapted where interference with the normal water supply takes place.  I do not anticipate any great difficulty in this way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully also expressed anxiety about flooding particularly in the town of Drogheda.  The main purpose of drainage is to prevent flooding.  We know it creates a more rapid run-off but I am confident that our engineers give very careful consideration to this in designing the schemes.  This scheme will be on exhibition in a matter of days and Deputy Tully, the local authorities and everyone else in the Boyne catchment area can examine it and we will be very glad to hear observations from all responsible people as to how the scheme affects them and suggestions as to how the scheme could be amended.  All suggestions of that kind will be welcome and carefully considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully also mentioned a matter which might appear to be a small one on superficial examination but, nevertheless, it is important, that is, the provision of shelter for workmen on drainage schemes.  This is normally provided but I want to tell Deputy Tully that we will consider it and try to ensure that adequate protection is available for the men on this and other schemes.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Tully who mentioned the incentive bonus scheme and felt it was in operation only on a small scale.  That is not the case.  In 80 per cent of the drainage schemes the incentive bonus scheme is in operation. The only reason it is not universal is that as yet adequate training staff for its implementation is not available.  It will be in operation in the Boyne scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned a river called the Mattock, a small river in the Boyne catchment which has not been included in the scheme as it is being presented now on exhibition, because the area likely to benefit is very small in relation to its cost.  We will be <Col N="646" /> having another look at it and if Deputy Donegan has any suggestions as to how this very serious obstacle can be overcome we will talk to him about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan spoke of an area called Turloughcor in the Corrib area. This is a small area of 200 or 300 acres of wet land.  It is not at the moment being drained.  What is happening in that case is that the general question of its retention as a bird sanctuary is being considered.  It would not be right for Deputy Donnellan to assume that it is completely scrapped as a potential drainage area.  We were looking at it from the point of view of its preservation as a wild fowl sanctuary.  Deputy Kitt has a question down and possibly I should not anticipate.</P>

      <P>Deputy J. O'Leary spoke about Killarney and about the national parks.  He urged the establishment of a special parks section to deal specifically with national parks. I am glad to tell Deputy J. O'Leary that we are doing that, we are establishing a special parks section because without <Col N="648" /> it it would not be sensible to expect that any positive approach would be made to the development of our national parks.  Deputy J. O'Leary was very rightly concerned with the rather static situation that existed in the great national park in Muckross over a couple of decades I suppose.  I feel myself that it is time that orderly development of this area as a great national park should begin.  In order to handle this job specifically, we are establishing the parks section in the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Deputy J. O'Leary said that a model farm should be retained in Muckross. I am inclined to agree with him because among the things that I would like to see preserved in Killarney, as well as the red deer and the great collection of rare plants and animals that are to be found in the Muckross Park&mdash;some of them, I believe, are unique in the country&mdash;is the very fine herd of Kerry cattle.  Kerry cattle are becoming a rather rare type of cattle and it would be unfortunate if we could not maintain a herd of Kerry cattle in Muckross. I must disagree with Deputy J. O'Leary about the farm yard.  He said there was a magnificent farm yard in Muckross.  I do not agree at all.  I think that the farm yard is picturesque possibly but it certainly is not a good farm yard and thereby probably hangs a tale.  I would think that better farm buildings will have to be provided in Killarney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J. O'Leary also mentioned the position of the Forestry Division in the Muckross Estate.  I think it was the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who felt that he was being a little bit out of order and discussing matters that properly concern the Forestry Division.  My sympathy lay with Deputy O'Leary because the situation in Muckross is that while the Forestry Division have their considerable plantations there, they have them in the National Park for which the Office of Public Works is responsible.  I would like to say to him, and I am glad to say it, that we are co-operating very closely with the Forestry Division and I am confident that any new development, any new planting that will be done by the Forestry Division, will only be done <Col N="649" /> after consultation with the Office of Public Works and in conformity with the plans that will be made for the development of the park by our office.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies made different remarks about the provision of restaurant facilities here in the House. I do not think this is a matter for us. The Board of Works function ends when the diningroom and the facilities are provided.  It is for the House itself to decide the uses that they will be put to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte, in a rather odd way raised the question of shell-pink bathroom suites and I think he also mentioned duck-egg blue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte used a new technique.  It seems to me to be a new technique anyway for, like a man holding a tongs in his hands and handling a very distasteful thing, he quoted, I think, the chairman of the Labour Party speaking at an election meeting in Cork and saying something very heart-rending about the extravagances of Fianna Fáil Ministers and Taoiseachs providing themselves with shell-pink bathroom suites and duck-egg blue bathroom suites while the poor of Cork and West Limerick had to do, I suppose, with other colours or the absence of such facilities.  The only thing to say about that is I think that Deputy Harte should not handle Labour Party lies when he is speaking as the official representative of Fine Gael.  I always thought that Fine Gael could produce their own lies, but it was <Col N="650" /> like the rebirth of Coalition, the wholesale production of dirty little bits.</P>

Now, having failed on this line they are going into the bathroom suite business with the chairman of the Labour Party and as the Taoiseach told the Ard-Fheis and the public and the country&mdash;and it was most regrettable that he had to do this but the blame must lie fairly and squarely with the Chairman of the Labour Party and his retailers the Fine Gael Party&mdash;there is not a vestage of truth in it, good, bad or indifferent.

      <P>I want to deal with the national monuments.  I do not want to delay the House unduly.  One of the main topics that arises under the heading of national monuments concerns the recent question of the Rosc Exhibition and the display of the four monuments in the National Museum. Deputy Flanagan said he was against it and he had something very positive to say.  There is a volume of opinion in relation to disapproval of this undoubtedly. Deputy Flanagan said that there were stones taken out of churches. I made a note of that.  Those were his words.  He said it was the desire, especially of myself and the Office of Public Works, to ransack and rob the sacred places.  That is one opinion.

      <P>The first thing to do in relation to consideration of this question is to try to get the facts and dispose of the smokescreen of distorted truth and misrepresentation which shrouded this question since its beginning. In a series of letters to the press it was almost suggested that round towers, the Rock of Cashel and such monuments were to be put on trolleys and carted off to Dublin forever.  That was the first piece of misrepresentation.  In fact, there were five monuments involved&mdash; two small stones from Clonmacnoise, the Killinaboy Cross, the Carndonagh Cross and the Turoe Stone.  It reminds me of what Churchill said about General de Gaulle during the war: &ldquo;Of the many and grievous crosses I have to bear in this cruel and terrible war, not least is the Cross of Killinaboy&rdquo;. At any rate, those were the five stones which it was proposed to remove. When the Carndonagh Cross was examined, it was discovered that it would be unwise to remove it and our people very properly left it in position.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harte has said here that it was a source of embarrassment to the Donegal County Council.  They had no right at any time to interfere with the Carndonagh Cross.  This was a matter for the Office of Public Works.  At any rate, there was no protest or storm, not even from the National Monuments Advisory Committee and but for the vigilance of the Board of Works in discovering the cross on the side of the road and re-erecting it, it would have been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan suggested last night that the two Clonmacnoise stones have been objects of veneration for thousands of years.  This is very peculiar because a couple of years ago our inspector of national monuments took one of those stones out of a wall where it was used as a building stone. It was carefully restored and installed in the open air museum at Clonmacnoise. Nobody knows how long it had been in the wall or who put it there. Another stone was excavated at the same time.  I know Deputy Flanagan's sanctity is a thing of very high voltage, but I never knew it penetrated the ground before.  He said they were objects of veneration for thousands of years and I have never known Deputy Flanagan to venerate a stone that was under the ground until two years ago, when it was found by our inspector of national monuments, Mr. Le Clerc, who discovered it.  Those two stones are on exhibition, as is the Turoe Stone from Loughrea.  County Galway. Before Deputies come to any conclusion at all about this exhibition of national monuments, I think they should go out to the National Museum next door, have a look at the exhibition for themselves, and remember the hysterical storm that was created.  One of those national monuments, in fact, was in very great danger.  I am referring to the Killinaboy Cross which was being trundled about by inexpert people and it has been trundled about <Col N="655" /> because irresponsible people by kicking up such a row created a farcical situation when the Killinaboy Cross was removed from its site.  They did so in order to prevent its removal.  This is the type of thing that developed as a result.  It was suggested that the Government were removing these architectural relics from their undisturbed original sites.  From what I have said in relation to the Clonmacnoise stones, none of these is being removed from its original undisturbed site.  It is certain they will be returned after the Exhibition.</P>

      <P>Those excavated by Professor O'Kelly will be on permanent exhibition.  I saw Professor O'Kelly on television one night discussing the removal of the soul of Ireland.  This is a rather vague expression. I do not think it is an architectural expression.  It does not sound like it, but those stones which he removed from County Meath will be retained in the Museum.  Professor O'Kelly had the permission of the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>People who have inspected the stones on exhibition in the museum will grasp the idea.  I think it is a good thing that those monuments should have attention directed to them and that carvings of such great beauty as are depicted on the Clonmacnoise stones, recently discovered, should be displayed in public.  I am certain, and absolutely satisfied actually, that because of their very small <Col N="656" /> size they can be displayed with advantage by expert people.  If this can be done the governing interest at all times is the public interest.  I see no reason at all why it should not be done.  I can see several good reasons why it ought to be done.</P>
      <P>The great mass of the people have not the opportunity to go to places like Clonmacnoise.  What is more interesting is that this Exhibition, small and all as it is, shows a progressive development from pre-Christian times to the time when stone-carving was influenced by Scandinavian styles.  This in itself, even for laymen like us, is most interesting and they could not be seen together even by travelling from Loughrea to Clonmacnoise and Killinaboy. When the reasons are sufficiently good, I see no reason why displays of this kind should not be put on.</P>
      <P>There were sensible and wise people who were concerned and worried about the creation of a precedent.  The Commissioners of Public Works act as guardians in the interests of the nation and they have our national monuments in their care and they can and ought to be trusted to decide on the merits of any request in relation to them.  It was suggested frivolously that national monuments could very well be displayed at Beer Festivals, Fleanna Ceoil and celebrations of that kind.  That simply is not a serious suggestion.  It is frivolity and should be treated as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the heavy-handed attack made on the Rosc Exhibition in general was very unfortunate.  The Rosc Exhibition was extremely important to this country.  It was an important international exhibition of art.  It so happened that in my own constituency there was recently established a Córas Tráchtála design centre.  This design centre was established because we suddenly came to realise how poor we were in matters of this kind.  There is no use in saying it any other way.  There is a big gap in our development in this matter of artistic standards and design. It is closely related to the instruction of young people in art.  I think we should be conscious of the need to instruct, especially our young art students and secondary students generally, that at <Col N="657" /> one time we Irish produced works of exquisite beauty, and for historical and other reasons while we excelled in other fields and while we produced writers and poets in extraordinary numbers and of extraordinary quality we were deprived of this means of creativity.  Possibly our creativity was channelled in the other direction.  We can do something about it now.  We have begun to recognise this problem. For that reason the Rosc Exhibition should not have been treated the way it was.  It was a tragedy in my opinion.  In a way it got a lot of publicity, but that it should be treated with such suspicion and contempt and that the organisers of it should be treated with such scorn is a thing that disgraces us again.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to labour the point any more.  I have said all I wanted to say about it.  As usual, Deputies mentioned the question of office accommodation.  This is a perennial problem.  A great many of the offices used by Government Departments in Dublin at present were not built as offices.  They are unsuitable, and in the main, old buildings, completely unsuited to the use they are being put to.  The ideal solution would be that the Government would build offices for themselves but, unfortunately, the capital that would be required for an operation of such enormity is required for other more pressing purposes.  The only alternative is to rent office space at market prices. It has been suggested numbers of times that prices paid by the Office of Public Works for floor space are not competitive. This simply is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> Deputy Dillon mentioned the facade of Leinster House.  I am told the white buttons are purely a temporary arrangement.  I went out to the front to see the white buttons, and, as Deputy Dillon said, they were unsightly. However, they are purely temporary and will be removed when the job is finished.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Dunne referred to the Killymoon Hoard.  Primarily, this is the business of the Department of Education.  The National Museum and the Ulster Museum are interested in purchasing at the auction in order to keep the hoard in the country.  Deputy Dillon mentioned&mdash;I am sorry I was absent temporarily from the House&mdash; our embassies abroad.  They are not all that magnificent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary had better study what I said before dealing with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I had better read it.  One of the problems of the Office of Public Works is to get accommodation at all in foreign cities.  I agree there is no obligation on a country of our size to maintain grandiose establishments abroad but nobody needs to worry unduly about over-lavish spending on embassies. Deputy Flanagan raised a point about additional accommodation for the Land Registry.  The accommodation required should be completed next year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon raised another question about records, especially those of the Land Commission.  I do not know precisely on whose shoulders this responsibility should fall but I agree it is a question worth examining.  Possibly Deputy Dillon and I will have another conversation about it some time.  If important documents should be destroyed because it did not happen to be somebody's business to look after them, it would be a matter to be regretted and if any expedient can be found to prevent that happening it will be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other matters raised by Deputies but I do not wish to detain the House any longer except to say I <Col N="660" /> am grateful to Deputies for what was in the main a constructive debate and to add that if there is anything I have not dealt with either in my opening statement or my reply I will be glad to meet Deputies.</P>

That has the disadvantage that there may be Members of the House who are not as well up in the language as he is and cannot follow it completely.</P>

      <P>The net Estimate for my Department for 1967-68 is £9,030,000 which shows a net decrease of £51,450 on the comparable figure for 1966-67.  The biggest single increase in the subheads of the estimate is £200,000 in respect of contributions to loan charges on local authority housing.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, it is a major objective of the Government's housing policy, as announced in 1964, that an output of 12,000 to 14,000 dwellings a year be achieved by 1970.  Good progress is being made towards this objective.  Almost 11,000 dwellings were completed in 1966-67 and in the first six months of this financial year the total of completions was approximately 5,848 compared with 5,066 in the first six months of 1966-67.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of additional capital by the Government, coinciding with the expansion of activities by the different commercial agencies concerned with the financing of private housing, is reflected in the increased output of both new dwellings and the reconstruction and improvement of existing dwellings.  The estimate of £3,000,000 for private housing grants which shows a decrease on the provision for 1966-67 is expected to be fully expended by 31st March next, which will compare <Col N="665" /> favourably with an expenditure last year of less than £2¾ million in respect of these grants.</P>
    <P>The improvement in output is evident more clearly from the statistics of grants allocated and works commenced. In the six months to 30th September, 3,728 grants were allocated for new dwellings which represents an increase of almost 1,000 over the allocations for the corresponding period last year.  On the basis of these figures, it is estimated that the total number of grants allocated for new houses in the current financial year will exceed 7,000.</P>
    <P>The scheme of increased grants to small farmers and certain other classes for the provision of new houses has now been in operation for nearly four years and is proving to be very successful in helping to satisfy the housing needs in rural areas.  This type of housing is now accounting for approximately 1,000 of the total annual output of new houses.  On the other hand, except in a few areas, housing authorities have not been using the special scheme for the provision of houses for small farmers with a land valuation of under £5 to the extent I would like. The very generous subsidy terms which apply to this scheme provide authorities with an unequalled chance to improve the housing standards of small farmers at a minimum cost to the rates and the applicants, and I am surprised that more use has not been made of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants for new flats and maisonettes in high-rise buildings, which was introduced in the Housing Act, 1966, has begun to stimulate activity.  A total of 140 grants under this heading was approved in the nine months ended 30th September, 1967, and in addition several other large-scale projects are at preliminary stages. Developments of this nature which involve investment in housing by commercial agencies who can easily find other uses for their capital are very welcome and have, in fact, been the subject of discussions earlier this year between my Department and representatives of assurance companies.  In addition to satisfying an urgent need <Col N="666" /> for small dwelling units, these developments also help to conserve valuable building land, with resultant savings on roads and sanitary services.</P>
    <P>The scheme of special grants introduced in 1962 to assist charitable and philanthropic bodies in their work of providing accommodation for elderly persons is also proving very successful. In the period from 1st January to 30th September, 1967, a total of 262 grants were allocated in respect of new dwelling units for the elderly.  The religious orders and other bodies engaged in this type of housing are to be congratulated on their achievements to date.</P>
    <P>The reconstruction of existing houses and the conversion of large houses into smaller dwelling units form an important part of the annual housing programme. A total of 8,601 grants have been approved for this type of work from 1st January to 30th September, 1967, and at the present rate of progress it is expected that the figure for the year will be approximately 12,000 grants.</P>
    <P>The total grants for the period ended 30th September, 1967, include 1,527 approved in respect of essential repairs to houses in rural areas.  This scheme of grants, introduced in 1962, enables the State and county councils to help in the carrying out of essential repairs, where it is clear that the expenditure required to comply with the normal reconstruction standards would not be justified by the probable future life of the houses.  The scheme aims to help those people living in bad housing conditions in isolated areas who are unable to avail themselves of grants and loans towards the erection of new houses and where the housing authorities are unable to give an urgent degree of priority to their rehousing.  I have in mind, particularly, the improvement of housing conditions of elderly persons for the remainder of their life-span.  In this connection the grants are proving to be of immense social value in western areas where the immediate housing needs are a heavy burden on the councils.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the improvement of houses by the installation of private water supplies and sewerage facilities <Col N="667" /> has also regained momentum.  Expenditure up to 30th September in the current financial year on payment of grants amounted to £242,657 and on this basis the sum of £406,000 to be made available for this purpose in 1967-68 should be fully expended.  The number of grants approved to date in the current financial year shows an increase of almost 33 per cent on the figure for the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>Local authorities commenced the erection of 2,475 dwellings in the six months to 30th September, excluding dwellings in the Ballymun scheme, or 1,388 more than in the first six months of 1966-67.  At 30th September the number of new dwellings under construction was 4,174 compared with 3,537 at 30th September, 1966, excluding Ballymun.  This increased activity has been achieved without cutting back on the number of dwellings at earlier stages in the pipeline. Dwellings in tender, in course of planning, and for which sites were available at the end of September amounted in the aggregate to 20,862 compared with 18,066 at the corresponding date in 1966.</P>
    <P>Including the Ballymun scheme, Dublin Corporation report that they had at 30th September last 2,906 dwellings in progress and had completed 915 dwellings since the beginning of April.  Some 386 dwellings were ready to be started, 575 were at tender stage and plans were being prepared for almost 3,000 further dwellings.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on local authority housing by the Corporation rose to nearly £6½ million in 1966-67 as compared with £5 million in 1965-66 and less than £3½ million in 1964-65. Their corresponding estimated capital expenditure for 1967-68 is £7½ million.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing Act, 1966, local authorities are required to make an assessment of the need for housing in their areas.  The results of these assessments which were first requested as far back as May, 1965, have not yet been submitted to my Department by a number of authorities.  I would appeal to Deputies who are members of local <Col N="668" /> authorities to ensure that steps are taken to have the information required supplied as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Having made assessments of housing needs, housing authorities are required to draw up building programmes which will show the objectives of the authorities in regard to both local authority and private housing.  The date for the adoption of these programmes is 31st March next.  I had intended to fix an earlier date but decided to extend it so that newly elected members of local authorities will have an opportunity of fully considering their programmes.</P>
    <P>Housing is now a very big item in financial terms.  The amount of capital provided from public sources for the building and reconstruction of houses has risen from £9.03 million in 1960-61 to an estimated £25 million in the current financial year.  The amount provided for housing in the public capital programme has been growing rapidly and in the current financial year exceeds by a large margin the amount provided for any other capital service.  No Government in this country have, in fact, ever provided so much in the way of capital for building and reconstructing houses.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise here what I have said previously that no housing proposals are held up for lack of money.</P>
    <P>Out of the total capital allocation of £25 million approximately for 1967-68 a sum of £12.5 million was allocated originally to local authority housing.  It was estimated that this allocation of £12.5 million would permit of new houses being started at a rate of about 300 per month during this financial year.  The actual starts have greatly exceeded this figure and in order to maintain progress I am happy to say that it has been agreed to increase the allocation for local authority housing by another £.75 million in 1967-68.</P>
    <P>The allocations of capital which were made provisionally to local authorities for their own housing schemes at the beginning of this financial year to meet commitments then existing are being kept under continuous review and are being adjusted, as required.  An allocation of capital is being made in respect of each new scheme as soon as it is <Col N="669" /> ready to start.  This procedure is proving satisfactory and acceptable to housing authorities generally.</P>
    <P>I am also happy to say that the capital allocation to meet expenditure this year on the special programme of land acquisition in the Dublin area has been increased by a further £1 million. Dublin authorities have now bought or are in the process of buying more than 2,400 acres.  With this land, and the major drainage schemes in prospect, they should be in a position to secure greater stability in land prices in the most effective way&mdash;the provision of adequate sites at competitive prices.  As Deputies are aware, I have had the problem of rising land costs particularly in mind since I became Minister for Local Government.  The subsidy under the Housing Act, 1966, amounting up to £150 per developed building site, is intended as a practical measure to encourage local authorities to acquire and develop land for sale or lease to private individuals or small builders.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can acquire large tracts of land more economically than a small builder can, and they can develop it on a scale which makes the most of modern methods and machinery. I visualise them laying out these schemes to a good standard of amenity and design and in accordance with their development plan objectives.  The capital accruing to them from the sale of the sites can be used so as to provide a growing source of finance for further housing activity.  In this way, I visualise them as housing development agencies and I would like them to take this view of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently working on some individual projects which are designed to secure economies in building costs.  At my request, plans have been prepared for a dwelling which can be provided in two stages.  The first stage will comprise the normal outer structure with the ground floor fully developed of about 624 square feet to give livingroom, scullery, bathroom and two bedrooms.  The second stage will entail the development of the second floor of about 436 square feet, plus storage space, to provide three further rooms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> With the co-operation of Meath County Council arrangements are being made for building two of these dwellings at Dunboyne&mdash;one to the first stage, and one fully developed. When asking for these plans, I wanted a house which initially could be provided cheaply for young people getting married, but which could be added to at a later stage with the aid of grants, without any great financial burden on the occupants, and with the minimum of disturbance.  I hope that the prototypes about to be erected at Dunboyne will help to achieve this objective. When the experimental buildings have been completed it is intended, with the co-operation of the county council, to have the houses available for general inspection and to make details of the plans, costs, etc., available to housing authorities and other interested parties. I commend this idea to housing authorities and speculative builders who should consider incorporating some of these two-stage houses in their housing schemes to provide small houses at low cost which can readily, and relatively cheaply, be converted into larger houses if the demand for additional accommodation arises.</P>
    <P>Progress has also been made by my Department in the evolution of demountable dwellings to solve a long-standing problem which has become increasingly urgent in recent years with the rapid deterioration of old dwellings in locations where a continuing need for permanent new dwellings may not arise.  Numerous efforts had already been made to evolve a satisfactory solution, and quite a number of proposals for temporary or emergency type dwellings have been submitted to my Department in recent years.  These did not in general meet the special requirements in relation to this problem. Arrangements were, therefore, made with technical officers of my Department to prepare a suitable plan.  The aim was to evolve a dwelling type which would be built at the lowest possible cost, would be capable of being moved with a minimum of loss, would give a relatively high standard of weather-proofing and comfort, and would have a reasonably acceptable appearance.  A plan was prepared <Col N="671" /> which largely meets these requirements and, with the co-operation of Kildare County Council, a prototype was built near Newbridge, County Kildare.  The construction is based on a timber frame with asbestos-polystyrene sandwhich infill panels.  The prototype, which could be used for one or two elderly persons, comprised some 267 square feet and cost £620.  Housing authorities have been informed in detail of the outcome of this experiment.</P>
    <P>At the same time I recognised that the Kildare dwelling was only one of a number of possible alternative solutions. Cork County Council, for instance, have produced an acceptable alternative which I have also brought to the notice of housing authorities. In this case, the cost is somewhat higher but construction is more durable and the appearance is more suitable for special locations, where cost is not the primary consideration.  I will, of course, welcome any further suitable alternatives that may be offered and I have so informed housing authorities. Plans for family size dwellings based on the Kildare prototypes have been evolved, and a number of councils are co-operating in the erection of dwellings to these plans on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>During the year I made special examination of procedures connected with the planning and approval of local authority housing schemes.  I decided to emphasise again to local authorities that they did not have to come to my Department for approval to the acquisition by agreement of sites suitable for housing and that only one full submission of documents at outline plan stage was necessary in the normal case.  I decided also that responsibility for the adequacy and accuracy of documents for contract purposes should in future rest with the housing authorities themselves, and my Department now confines its examination of documents submitted for individual schemes to broad principles of policy, cost, design and planning.  I have also made arrangements for regular and frequent consultations between officers of my Department and those of <Col N="672" /> individual housing authorities to speed housing progress generally, and iron out any particular difficulties that may arise in relation to individual proposals.  I need hardly emphasise that in relation to the £7.5 million or so now spent annually by local authorities on private housing loans and grants the controls exercised by my Department are minimal.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Deputies' attention to some recent trends in the running cost of housing.  The percentage of the expenditure on local authority housing met from rents and purchase annuities paid by tenants and tenant purchasers has fallen from 42.1 per cent in 1961-62 to 40.7 per cent in 1966-67.  The percentage met from rates has risen from 27.9 per cent to 28.9 per cent and the percentage met by the subsidy paid by my Department has also increased&mdash;from 27.8 per cent to 28.9 per cent.  Thus, on average, of every pound of running expenses paid by local authorities generally for their housing, approximately 12s. is met by State subsidy and from the rates, and 8s. by the tenant or tenant purchaser.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise, of course, that the figures for particular areas can vary greatly from these, which are based on returns for the whole country.  At its present level, subsidy generally amounts to £80 approximately a year for each local authority house.  On a programme of 4,000 houses a year, the subsidy bill to the Exchequer must therefore rise by about £320,000 a year cumulatively.  Thus in four years the subsidy bill would reach an additional £1.28 million annually in addition to a sum of about £1 million a year from the rates or a total of £2.28 million additional taxation annually.  I mention these figures to illustrate the extent of Government aid for the housing of persons who cannot meet the cost of providing housing accommodation for themselves from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, dealing with the sale by local authorities of their houses, should they decide to draw up purchase schemes, came into force on 30th September.</P>
    <P>The sale terms under the Act are specified in the Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and <Col N="673" /> Management) Regulations, 1967, made by me on 13th April last.  Under the new arrangements, a local authority may, if they wish, make a scheme for the sale of their houses or for any number of them.  The minimum terms of sale which I will be prepared to approve for the purposes of the scheme provide for a discount from the market or replacement value of a house in a built-up area equivalent to two per cent for each year after five during which the tenant has been in occupation, subject to a maximum discount of 30 per cent.  For houses outside built-up areas the figures are three per cent and 45 per cent respectively.  I regard these terms as representing an equitable balance as between the community who provided the house, and the tenant wishing to purchase.  Capital receipts from sales must be used by the authority for the making of housing loans and grants, for the construction of other houses, or for some similar capital purpose, so that there need, in effect, be no net loss to the housing assets of the authority as a result of sales.</P>
    <P>The number of urban local authority houses sold under the provision which section 90 replaces totalled 915 in the year ended 31st March, 1967, and about 2,800 rural cottages were vested in tenants.  These figures compare with 1,432 and 2,673 in the preceding financial year.  The number of private houses financed by loans from local authorities in 1966-67 was about 2,600 compared with about 2,500 in the preceding financial year.  Issues on foot of advances by local authorities have been comparatively low in this financial year, but the build-up of commitments makes it obvious that issues will accelerate rapidly.  At 31st March last, the amount of advances approved was £2.8 million and at 30th September last the figure was £4.2 million.  These figures indicate a plentiful supply of work on hands.  I am keeping the position under close review so as to ensure that capital is equitably distributed as and when required.  I have arranged discussions to this end in my Department between representatives of builders and of the local authorities principally concerned.</P>
    <P>The schemes of supplementary <Col N="674" /> grants operated by local authorities have the same general aim as the loan schemes operated by them, that is, to help persons in the lower income bracket to undertake house purchase. In 1966-67, the number of these grants paid for new houses was 3,400 approximately. For some time, I have been conscious of the frustration amongst many intending house purchasers in the Dublin area due to the restrictive qualification hitherto operated by Dublin County Council in relation to the payment of supplementary new house grants, and I pressed the council to reconsider their policy on this matter. I particularly welcome the recent decision of the council to simplify and extend their grant scheme.  The county is, in fact, one of the areas of greatest demand for housing, and it is particularly appropriate that they should do everything in their power to help the classes referred to in the purchase of their new houses.</P>
    <P>I have for some time been anxious that everyone buying a house should have at his disposal a booklet to help him with information about grants, loans, title, fees, stamp duty, surveys, planning permissions and other details. I have arranged for the issue by my Department of such a booklet which I hope will be of assistance to such persons.</P>
    <P>The provision under Subhead I for a grant-in-aid to An Foras Forbartha relates to the physical planning and the building and construction activities of An Foras.  The roads research activities are financed from the Road Fund and will be referred to later.  The increase of £7,000 in the grant-in-aid arose from the further development of the work of An Foras.</P>
    <P>The financial year to March last was the second full year of operation of An Foras and rapid progress was made in its work programme.  The United Nations have informed me that they are fully satisfied with the progress of this Institute.  The high output and quality of work was achieved with the specialist assistance of United Nations' personnel, with the generous assistance of professional, vocational and other bodies concerned with its activities and <Col N="675" /> through the skill and efforts of its staff. I would like once again to thank the United Nations and the various professional and other bodies for the valuable assistance they have given to An Foras.</P>
    <P>An Foras is proceeding with the preparation of the draft of a new national code of building regulations with the assistance of a working party and several specialist groups.  All sections of the first draft, other than specialised sections on fire precautions, have now been completed and are being studied prior to more general circulation for comment and review. A series of courses and lectures on construction management has been held in various centres throughout the country in association with the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers of Ireland.  An Foras has also provided advice to firms on the installation of costing systems, network analysis and other management matters.  It has also initiated studies on recent developments in contract management, a topic which was highlighted by the Symposium on Technical Documentation organised by An Foras last May.</P>
    <P>At my request, An Foras is undertaking an examination of the advantages of securing a greater measure of rationalisation in the building industry especially housing with particular reference to components including concentration on a more limited range of each type of component.  Another move towards rationalisation was indicated in my announcement in August that the Government had made a decision in favour of dimensional co-ordination. This decision was based on a report and recommendations on the subject by a working party of An Foras and I have asked An Foras to prepare as soon as possible a timetable for the change-over to dimensional co-ordination on a metric basis in conjunction with all the interests concerned and having regard to other developments in the adoption of the metric system.</P>
    <P>An important new development was the initiation of consumer studies in housing, at the request of the House-builders Section of the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied <Col N="676" /> Employers of Ireland.  The Department of Social Science at University College, Dublin, with the aid of grants from An Foras and the Federation has carried out an investigation of housewives' reactions to their houses with a view to providing information to enable designers to design the houses most suited to family requirements.  I think the Federation are to be congratulated on this enlightened approach to house-building.</P>
    <P>Subhead J of the estimate contains the sum of £25,000 for the National Building Advisory Council.  Following a review of the question of duplication as between the work of the Council and of An Foras Forbartha, the Government decided that the Council and An Foras should be merged and negotiations under the auspices of my Department for the merger of the two bodies have now, I am glad to say, reached finality.  Pending completion of the merger arrangements, I appointed additional members from the professions and those directly associated with the building industry, to the Board of An Foras last August.  These appointments will be for a period of one year, initially.</P>
    <P>The contract entered into by the National Building Agency for the Ballymun Housing Scheme provides for the planning, layout, design and construction of 3,021 dwellings over four years.  Delays caused initially by weather conditions and subsequently by labour difficulties, have largely been overcome.  To date, more than 1,650 dwellings have been constructed, of which more than 1,200 have been handed over to the Corporation for occupation.  The House will understand that, notwithstanding adverse comment generated from time to time, there will at any point in time remain a disparity between the number of dwellings completed and the number of dwellings handed over for occupation, because you do not hand over a block of flats in which some or most of the dwellings are completed until the whole block can be handed over, and neither do you hand over completed dwellings until reasonable means of vehicular and pedestrian access are available consistent <Col N="677" /> with the continuance of adjacent building operations.</P>
    <P>The only radical change in the estimated cost of works included in the original contract is the cost of labour. At the moment, it seems that labour will cost about £½ million above the amount of the contract target price. Increased labour costs under this contract are payable only under the normal terms of Price Variation Clause and bonus schemes.  None of the increased labour costs, therefore, can be attributed either to the contractors or to the National Building Agency as contract clients.  The building unions, who were consulted prior to contract, agreed to give their co-operation in this scheme which was initiated to assist the Corporation in a rapid expansion of its housing output, so that a determined co-operative effort could be made to provide some 3,000 additional dwellings of a high standard for persons for whose rehousing the Corporation accepts responsibility.  It was accepted that new building methods and techniques would be used in the project.</P>
    <P>When construction works were finally in full swing, the electricians sought special working conditions and refused to allow the use of electrical harnesses, which are fundamental to the economics of the building method, unless these harnesses were made on the site by skilled men.  In fact, as is the normal practice elsewhere, such contracts for making these simple harnesses had been negotiated with a local electrical firm, but this facility could not be availed of by the contractors. A demand for increased rates for electricians also arose, which at a time when the work on site had been completely disrupted, was conceded after reference to the Joint Industrial Council. Naturally, the several hundred other workers claimed and secured increases and work then resumed at the former level of output.  Indeed, output at times exceeded that level.  The bright outlook of this summer for catching up on all the lost time was again set back in August last when electricians walked out, reputedly in breach of their agreement.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply on 16th November to the debate on the Estimates for my Department, the part which the Shannon Free Airport Development Company might take in industrial development in the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis area is a matter which would need to be related to a decision on particular development centres.  Since no decision has been made regarding development centres, the position of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in relation to them has not been determined.</P>

      <P>It will be some time before the full effects of devaluation, beneficial or otherwise, can be assessed either for the country as a whole or for the export industries at Shannon Airport. Export industries at Shannon Airport and elsewhere should tend to benefit from devaluation though there may be temporary difficulties in some cases.</P>

      <P>The capital cost of the Jumbo jets which is payable in dollars will involve increased sterling payments because of devaluation.  On the other hand, the company's dollar earnings will have a higher sterling value and devaluation in so far as it encourages more Americans to travel to Ireland should increase the company's dollar earnings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this depends on the passenger income growth of Aer Lingus on the routes which they operate.  The fare charged will relate to some extent to the extent of the expenditure in the sterling and non-sterling areas.  Those payments go towards the operation of the Jumbo jets.  The Americans will be able to travel to Ireland at a cheaper rate comparatively if they pay in sterling. On the other hand Aer Lingus will have to pay more for the Jumbo jets and therefore will have to pay back their commercial loans at a higher rate. It would be quite impossible within five days for Aer Lingus to give a specific answer to those questions and it is absurd for Deputies to expect a matter like this to be decided particularly since the fares have not yet been decided.  They are being considered at the meeting.</P>

On the other hand there is a negative to that in the sense that Jumbo jets could cost more.  How on earth could any air company be expected to know the reply in sufficient time?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices obtainable for Irish exports of dairy products to Britain, which is the predominant market, are not directly affected by devaluation but there may be a certain indirect gain arising from the fact that some of the other principal suppliers of dairy produce to that market have not devalued.  In other markets our competitive position has improved in relation to that of countries which have not devalued, but the extent to which we will benefit from this does not depend on considerations of money value alone but will largely be determined by the nature of the import restrictions obtaining in those markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> Most of this country's exports of cattle and beef also go to Britain and here again there may be certain indirect benefit arising from the fact that some of the other suppliers of beef to that market have not devalued.  Our competitive position for beef exports to the US market will be strengthened <i>vis-à-vis</i> supplying countries which have not devalued.  Market prices for cattle and beef in the EEC countries have increased relative to prices here as a result of devaluation but the rate of levy is also liable to increase and, as heretofore, the operation of the Community's import levy system will continue to determine the level of trade.</P>

He is paid to inform this House in so far as questions are legitimate and are permitted by the Chair.  I asked a supplementary question.  Denmark has devalued in the same proportion as Great Britain and New Zealand has devalued rather more than Great Britain, and so we will have a further advantage of more competition in the <Col N="691" /> British market.  In those circumstances, how can the Minister expect the House to believe his answer that certain countries supplying Great Britain have not devalued and that we may therefore expect advantages in our future competitive position with the British market in regard to dairy produce?</P>

      <P>Officers of my Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara had a discussion on 16th November with the local oyster fisherman about the elimination of starfish on the oyster beds.  Remedial measures can best be carried out by the fishermen themselves and they have been fully advised as to how to deal with the problem. Experiments conducted by this Department indicate that the starfish are to be found mainly on the fringes-of the beds and so the problem of their removal is somewhat lessened.</P>

      <P>The organisation was established under legislation passed in this country, Northern Ireland and by the British authorities who provided the capital from which the houses were financed and who have since, in consultation with the Government here, sponsored any legislation required to amend the trust under which the organisation operates.

Even in overcrowded conditions, they would require four rooms. This family consists of a husband and wife, a sister-in-law, who would require a room of her own, and a family of two boys and three girls.

      <P>According to the assessment of housing need submitted by the housing authorities under section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966, there is an accumulated need for 580 private and local authority dwellings in Wexford county, excluding the urban areas.

    <P>NOTES</P>
    <P> (i)  The dates on which firm proposals for these pools were received in the Department range from May, 1962 to August, 1967.  In some cases the proposals now current are in replacement of previous proposals and it would not be feasible to say when exactly the definitive proposal was received.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Swimming pool proposals are kept under review in conjunction with the overall capital requirements of local authorities.  No indication could be given at this stage when any particular proposal might be sanctioned. </P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, having regard to the growing number of defective motor vehicles which are being sold by secondhand car dealers with consequent risk of injury to purchasers of such vehicles, to their passengers and to other road users, he will have expeditious and effective steps taken to prevent the sale of defective motor vehicles; and if he will warn the public against the danger of purchasing defective secondhand cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 gives power for the institution of a scheme of periodic vehicle testing.  However, a piecemeal approach to the problem of defective vehicles by the setting up of a scheme to deal with one facet only of the problem would not be justified.  Section 12 of the Road Traffic Bill, 1966, contains provisions for the spot-checking of vehicles and the results of these checks will be used to determine the aspects of the problem, and their order of priority, to be dealt with under the scheme of periodic vehicle testing.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Road Traffic Bill contains provisions relating to the control of supply of vehicles.  These provisions, when and if enacted, can be extended to apply to the sale of secondhand vehicles if such a course is found to be desirable.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that every person who uses a vehicle on the public roads should be fully alive to the necessity to have his vehicle in a proper roadworthy condition, and it follows that he should take reasonable precautions to ensure that he is purchasing a roadworthy vehicle.  There is a special section in the Rules of the Road concerning vehicle fitness and every driver is required to be aware of this to qualify for his driving licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take cognisance of the fact that, human nature being what it is, most purchasers of secondhand cars will go after what appears to them to be a bargain rather than what is in fact a safe vehicle; and having regard to the simplicity of the procedure under <Col N="707" /> which it will be an offence to sell a car without a certificate of fitness, would the Minister not regard this as a matter of urgent importance?  As things stand at the moment, many serious accidents are happening because people are purchasing grossly unfit cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>People are aware of the fact that it is their responsibility to see that vehicles they put on the roads are in roadworthy condition and I do not think it a desirable thing to place that responsibility on somebody else. In so far as the sale of vehicles is concerned, section 8 of the Road Traffic Bill now before the House contains provisions in this respect and if Deputy Ryan feels there is any way in which these provisions can be improved, he can put down amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree it is almost criminal to allow firms to lead people into buying vehicles which are grossly defective?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an easy thing to stop, but the responsibility is properly placed on the person in charge of a vehicle to ensure that it is in roadworthy condition.</P>

      <P>As to the first part of the question, I would refer to my reply to a series of questions from Deputies, including Deputy L'Estrange, on the 20th June, 1967, on the subject of Road Fund grant allocations.  The total then given for 1967-68 is still the best estimate available.</P>
      <P>The balance remaining in the Fund at the close of any financial year is arrived at by taking account of the opening balance in respect of that year, the receipts of the Fund for that year and the aggregate of issues from the Fund in that year.  On the foregoing basis the balance in the Fund at 31st March, 1967, was £2,618 14s 11d; the figure for 31st March, 1968, is, of course, not yet available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his attention has been drawn to a report (particulars supplied) that neither Ireland's present or predicted population nor volume of traffic could justify an elaborate and expensive system of protected express motorways; and that, with the possible exception of the roads from Dublin to Bray, Naas and Drogheda, nowhere in Ireland is a six lane dual carriageway going to be needed or justified in the next 50 years; whether considerations of this kind have been examined by his Department in relation to the road system in this country; and, if so, what conclusions he has come to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it is not the policy of my Department to encourage road authorities to embark on an over-elaborate and expensive road system which would not be justified by present and predicted population and traffic volumes.  Present and predicted traffic volumes are invariably taken into account in determining the appropriate design standard for each road improvement scheme submitted to my Department by a road authority.  Detailed surveys and studies into various aspects of the road problem have been and are being conducted <Col N="712" /> by my Department, by An Foras Forbartha and by the road authorities. Furthermore the results of these surveys and studies must be considered and refined, where necessary, in the light of the local and regional development plans.</P>

    <P>The Walsh estate, comprising 215 acres in the townlands of Crinnaghtaun East and West, near Cappoquin, was first brought to the notice of the Land Commission in May, 1965, and inquiries were set up in train.  On 25th October, 1966, following a report that the property had been sold, an inspection notice under the Land Act, 1965, was served on the owner.  A few days later it was learned that a contract for the sale of the lands had been entered into on 19th October, 1966.  The property was inspected in November, <Col N="717" /> 1966, and proceedings for compulsory acquisition were instituted in January, 1967.  These proceedings have reached the stage where objections lodged have been adjourned, after a public hearing on 19th July last, with a view to enabling the parties concerned to diccuss a compromise settlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Departments at present using the Revenue Commissioners' computer are the Revenue Commissioners' Office itself, the Department of Education and the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are using the ICT computer to calculate tax liability, to issue notices of assessment and to collect and control income tax, sur-tax, other than PAYE, and corporation profits tax.  The computer is also used to account for employers' remittances under PAYE, as well as general ancillary work under that scheme, and also does accounting work for turnover tax, wholesale tax and dance tax.</P>
      <P>The ICT 1301 is currently being replaced by a Honeywell computer installation, an installation of far greater capacity.  In addition to carrying out the work of the ICT machine, the Honeywell will take on the substantial work involved on the employee side of PAYE, including the calculation of tax-free allowances and the issue of tax-free allowance certificates. This work is being taken over in stages.</P>
      <P>The estimated savings of £37,000 a year in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners from the use of the ICT 1301 computer have been fulfilled.  It is too early to say yet whether the estimated saving of £205,000 a year from the Honeywell installation will be realised but results to date indicate that it will, when the full range of Revenue work has been automated, as planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the question of savings, it should be borne in mind that the <Col N="725" /> computer has enabled work to be done which, without it, could scarcely have been undertaken at all.</P>
    <P>The ICT 1301 is being used to prepare standard pay cards, each month, for the payment of national teachers' salaries.  The estimated saving to the Department of Education is about £2,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The ICT machine is also used by the Meteorological Service in the Department of Transport and Power. Valuable meteorological data, required in airports and other places, which could not be complied under a manual system are produced on the computer. There has been no increase or decrease in staff costs.</P>
    <P>Studies and analyses are in progress with a view to transferring other work to the enlarged computer installation in the Revenue Commissioners' Office. The main Departments concerned at present, apart from those already indicated, are the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture and the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to by the Deputy.  I do not agree that the rate of income tax levied on building societies has in any way retarded their progress.  I should like to emphasise in this regard that, so far as income tax law is concerned, the profits of building societies are chargeable simply at the rate prescribed generally for the year by the Oireachtas.  All the major Irish building societies have voluntarily entered into an administrative arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners which is to last until after next year and under which a society's liability is <Col N="726" /> computed on a special basis.  I should add that, while this is a matter which is due for review in connection with the Budget of 1968, the profits of building societies are exempt from corporation profits tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if in regard to the Government's plans to decentralise Government Departments he will consider setting up a headquarters of a suitable Department in Birr, County Offaly where the State owns extensive lands and property at Crinkle, having special regard to the fact that Birr has the highest rate of unemployment in the county in view of the closing of an important local industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the Government Departments, other than those of Lands and Education, which are likely to be decentralised; and the centres to which they may be transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy in regard to decentralisation was announced by the Taoiseach on 16 November, 1967, and I have nothing to add to that statement at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not feel that when a Deputy puts forward a suggestion of this nature, <Col N="727" /> it should receive careful consideration? If another area in the country where there is a need for development is suggested, and a large amount of property is available for such development, does the Minister not think he might elaborate on Deputy Flanagan's suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's statement indicated that the greatest possible amount of decentralisation of as much of the administration of the commerce and industry of the country is an essential part of the programme of the present Government.  It is quite clear, from that, that if suitable opportunities present themselves for further decentralisation&mdash;and not just of the public service&mdash;they will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of practising certificates to solicitors, and determination of the fees to be charged therefor, are by statute matters for the Incorporated Law Society and I have no function in relation to them.  At present, a solicitor who practises or carries on business in Dublin or within three miles thereof pays an annual fee of £6: elsewhere the fee is only £3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that certain solicitors must have a town agent stems from the Rules of the Superior Courts.  These Rules provide for service of court documents on a solicitor personally or by leaving them at his registered place of business, which must be located within a radial distance of two miles from the Four Courts.  This in effect means that a solicitor practising in Dún Laoghaire or anywhere else outside the two mile radius must have a town agent.  In England, the corresponding Rules provide that documents may be sufficiently served by leaving <Col N="736" /> them at the solicitor's address for service, which may be anywhere within the jurisdiction, or by sending them by registered post to that address.  Adoption of similar rules here would avoid the necessity for town agents.  In this connection, I should mention that service of Circuit and District Court documents by registered post is provided for in section 7 of the Courts Act, 1964, and that service of Land Registry notices by ordinary post is provided for in rules 203 and 204 of the Land Registration Rules, 1966.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with that.  I know these charitable institutions are doing a good job and <Col N="746" /> I do not want to indict them.  However, before a person can appoint an agent to draw his pension, it must be proved that the person is suffering some incapacity. Any pensioner capable of travelling should not have an agent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the good nuns in charge of many of these establishments have been kind enough, the practice has grown up of handing up the pension books and having them act as agents.  It is a practice the old age pensioner follows in good faith. But now it means that if the pensioner desires to leave the institution and visit his relatives by public transport, he has to let the people in charge know by asking for his pension book.  This is wrong inasmuch as the old age pensioner, in order to preserve his dignity, should be in a position to get on the bus to visit his relatives without telling anybody, if he so desires.  I am not saying this against the Minister, but in order to preserve the dignity of the pensioner.  Would it not be better if he could get on the bus without having to go to the reverend mother and ask for his pension book like a small boy?</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into this too deeply, but I do not think any difficulty is being experienced in cases where the book is handed up for safe keeping.  Many of them hand over their books and have no difficulty in repossessing them without describing the purpose for which they are wanted. In any event I think the regulations in these institutions require the inmates to report their absence.</P>

Of those in respect of whom records are available, in the year ended 30th June, 1966, 30 were employed in hotels, 2 in tailoring and 97 in other occupations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental condition for eligibility for free school books is that genuine need for such assistance should exist.  The class of pupils who would qualify for assistance would correspond generally to those whose parents are entitled to the general medical services card.  Headmasters of schools have, however, been given discretion in the selection of the pupils to whom assistance may be given and it is not a requirement that the general medical services card be produced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, this is not a specific requirement of the scheme, but I can understand that headmasters in some cases might have adopted this method of establishing those who are entitled and who are not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would, because if the possession of the medical card is to be the test, then the production of the medical card would be necessary. This would mean that children would have to bring the medical card into the school to be inspected, and we know what would happen after that.  It is a means test.</P>

      <P>I could not support Deputy Tully enough on this.  A medical card may very well be issued because of a certain health condition within the family and might have little or no relation to the other problem.

      <P>As the three convent schools in Killarney are old buildings, and the question of the replacement of two of them has already been raised, I find it necessary to have an investigation made as to whether any re-organisation of the educational facilities for girls in the town is desirable, since the building of new schools now will set a pattern for many years to come.  I have directed that that investigation be completed with all possible speed so that the arrangements for providing the necessary new school accommodation will not be delayed.</P>

    <P>Since the food hygiene regulations were introduced in 1950 there has been a general and continuing improvement in the standard of food hygiene in hotels, restaurants and food stores.

      <P>I have had inquiries made from the Dublin Hospitals Bureau and I understand that a check on their records for the three months August to October last did not disclose any general practice by the Dublin hospitals of giving contradictory information about the availability of beds as suggested in the question. The great majority of the applications made to the Bureau are dealt with promptly and satisfactorily.  In the relatively small proportion of cases in which the Bureau experiences difficulty in finding accommodation the situation described by the Deputy can occasionally arise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>In view of the recent publicity regarding the future position of the Queen's Institute of District Nursing in Ireland I would like to set out for the Deputies' information the background to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in correspondence and have had discussions with the Institute over the past year regarding the future of the services provided by Jubilee Nurses.  I urged the Institute, as strongly as possible, on many occasions, to continue as they had been doing and gave them guarantees of continuing substantial financial support for district nursing associations.  I also <Col N="767" /> gave the Institute guarantees about the superannuation position of the nurses.</P>
    <P>At an extraordinary meeting of the Institute held on 3rd October, 1967, a resolution was passed that, in view of the failure to obtain trainees, the Institute would cease to provide district nursing training courses.  The Council of the Institute promised to write to me about this resolution.  I received the promised letter on 10th November.  In effect, the position is that while the Institute will discontinue providing district nursing training courses, they hope that the local district nursing associations will continue to provide services with their existing nurses.  So far I have had no indication that any appreciable number of local associations contemplate closing and I may mention that there is every likelihood that the Lady Dudley Nurses' Scheme, which employs 33 nurses in the western areas, will continue its activities indefinitely. I sincerely hope that as many of the associations as possible will continue their activities, and for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the pension rights of the Jubilee Nurses, arrangements are in train for the participation by these nurses in the superannuation scheme for the staffs of voluntary hospitals which it is expected will be introduced next year.  The scheme will give the nurses superannuation benefits approximately on a par with those under the local government code.</P>
    <P>Presumably the Deputies' questions regarding the nurses affected by the proposed closure of St. Patrick's Nurses' Home arises from a recent statement by the Irish Nurses' Organisation that they understood that I had not given sanction to Dublin Health Authority to absorb the nurses concerned into the public health services.  I do not know where the organisation got its information and indeed I would have expected them to verify their facts before rushing into public statements which must have caused anxiety to nurses affected.  In fact, I had informed the health authority in a letter of 17th October, 1967, that I had no objection in principle to their taking over the <Col N="768" /> staff concerned.  I could go no further than that in the absence of detailed information about the professional qualifications, age, marital status, etc. of the nurses.  I understand that Dublin Health Authority will submit these details to me shortly.</P>
    <P>The general position is that any of the nurses under 65 years of age who is unmarried or a widow can be taken over in a permanent capacity at her existing salary notwithstanding that she may be over the normal age limit for recruitment.  Any local district association which has to discontinue its activities will find me no less ready to facilitate the absorption of the nurses concerned into the local authority service.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress, I was dealing with some of the exceptional delays that had occurred in the National Building Agency project at Ballymun and I stated that an extra round of wage increases had been secured and work resumed at the former level of output.  This summer <Col N="774" /> the outlook was for catching up on all the loss of time but there was another set back in August last when the electricians walked out.  On this occasion, they were not supported by the decision of the Joint Industrial Council and they resumed work.  Progress again looked promising in September, when about 300 flats should have been ready for occupation by Dublin families.  However, some days before a block of flats was due to be completed for hand-over another delay occurred.  The electrical cables leading into the block were cut through with a hack-saw and the wiring pulled out of the conduit.  This occurrence was investigated by the Gardaí.  The nearly-completely block of flats has now been completed and during the month of October some 366 flats were handed over to the Corporation.</P>
      <P>Despite the delays such as those to which I have referred the contractors have recently informed me that, given a continuance of output at its present level, they are hopeful that the contract can be completed in the four years agreed.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the Ballymun project was approximately £1 million in its first year, £3¼ million last year, and will, it is estimated, be about £3½ million this year.</P>
      <P>I wish well to the tenants and their families in the Ballymun estate.  It is understandable that in a busy building site and in a growing community, difficulties will arise for people living and going about their day-to-day business. Any complaints brought to the Agency's notice by Dublin Corporation, which relate to contract works for which the contractors are responsible, will continue to be investigated and dealt with promptly by the Agency. Complaints which relate to estate management are, of course, the responsibility of Dublin Corporation.  There has been evidence of a sense of responsibility and pride of occupancy by residents in the estate and I look forward to the benefits which this will undoubtedly bring to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recommendation on arrangements for the provisions of the proposed shopping centre at Ballymun was sent from my Department to Dublin Cordoubtedl <Col N="775" /> poration on 26 July last, following negotiations with developers who had expressed an interest in the project.  At the same time it was conveyed to the Corporation that the arrangements for the provision of certain community facilities at the centre, including swimming pool and meeting halls, were being further considered by my Department. The recommendation was that the Corporation should enter into an agreement with particular developers for the building of the shopping centre on the basis of a lease of the site to the developers.  In return, the Corporation would be paid a guaranteed annual ground rent of £21,500 and would in addition share in the profits of the scheme.  The City Council have adopted my recommendations and I understand that arrangements are proceeding for the building of the centre which will include a full range of shopping, offices, licensed premises and other facilities, with suitable parking provision and accommodation for the additional community facilities which are to be added.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have authorised the National Building Agency to enter into negotiations with Messrs. John Sisk &amp; Son, Ltd., Cork, in respect of the provision of 1,800 dwellings at Cork and Messrs. Malachy Burke Ltd., Galway, in respect of 600 dwellings at Limerick.  Letters of Intent have been issued to these groups and accepted by them, on the basis of which the negotiation of the terms of contracts is now proceeding.  The intention is that these houses would be supplemental to the normal housing programme of these authorities.</P>
    <P>The dwellings to be built in Cork will be constructed on the Domus system which has been developed by the Sisk organisation, based on <i>in situ</i> concrete crosswalls, with specially designed floors and spandrils.  The Limerick houses will be built by Messrs. Burke on rationalised traditional building methods.  I have undertaken that the local authorities concerned will be consulted with particular regard to layouts, design, and pricing on the negotiation of the terms of the contracts.  This definitive step marks the culmination of efforts, to <Col N="776" /> evolve special housing projects which will enable the housing authorities to come to grips once and for all with the serious housing problems which still exist in both cities.</P>
    <P>The successful outcome of this project, together with the normal building programmes of the two authorities&mdash; which will themselves go ahead at full speed independently of the project&mdash; should mean the effective elimination within a comparatively short few years of the housing needs of Cork and Limerick cities as presently estimated by the respective housing authorities.</P>
    <P>In order to expedite the start of the project at the earliest possible date, I arranged that moneys will be made available from State sources over the normal 50-year loan period for the project.</P>
    <P>I hope the Limerick contract will be completed within three years and the Cork contract&mdash;which involves a number of dispersed and difficult sites and a volume of housing which requires a substantial increase in services&mdash;in about four to five years.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation of £3.5 million for sanitary services in the current financial year shows an increase on the sum of £3.17 million allocated in 1966-67.  This has enabled a reasonable level of activity to be continued in this sector and has, in particular, ensured that urgent schemes needed to provide services for new housing and industrial development are constructed as required.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area where there was a danger that a shortage of serviced land would create a major problem for house-builders, I arranged that the local authorities would undertake, as a matter of urgency, the provision of sufficient drainage to ensure that house building would not be impeded in the area.  I am glad to say that the local authorities have now on hands a programme under which additional services land will be available within the next six to 18 months.  A longer term drainage programme, the planning of which is being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible, will ensure that adequate serviced land will be available to meet long-term needs.  This <Col N="777" /> programme includes the completion of the Dodder Valley scheme and the Grand Canal scheme and the extension of the existing treatment plant at the Ringsend outfall works.</P>
    <P>A total of £985,000 is provided in Subhead F (1) in respect of State contributions to loan charges incurred by local authorities on Sanitary Services Works for the year 1967-68.  This shows an increase of £73,587, over the amount paid to Sanitary Authorities in 1966-67.</P>
    <P>Subhead F (2) includes a sum of £94,000 in respect of recoupment of supplementary grants for water supply installations to farmers who would have been eligible for the scheme of domestic grants formerly operated by the Department of Agriculture.  This recoupment is designed to ensure that no additional burden will arise on the rates as a result of my Department taking over this scheme.</P>
    <P>When the Government initiated their programme in 1959 for the provision of piped water in rural areas it was intended that the programme would be carried out by a combination of three methods, that is, by the local sanitary authority providing schemes on a regional basis to serve large areas; by individuals providing their own piped systems with the aid of the grants available from my Department and from their local authority; and by a number of neighbours coming together and providing a piped water system to each of their houses on a group basis, again with the aid of the appropriate State and local grants.</P>
    <P>Regional water schemes have already been constructed or are in course of construction at a cost of approximately £9 million.  It is estimated that the total cost of further regional schemes currently at different planning stages throughout the country exceeds £36 million.  It would be unrealistic to expect that a programme of this magnitude could be undertaken in simultaneous operations having regard to all the other demands on available capital resources.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, asked county councils to review their regional schemes so as to identify the more <Col N="778" /> urgent schemes or the more urgent sections of schemes so that these can proceed to construction stage as early as possible having regard to the availability of capital.  I am fully alive to the many benefits which piped water can bring to rural areas and I believe that many areas which it has been proposed should be served by regional schemes could more readily and more economically be provided for by group effort.  County councils have been asked to review the regional schemes and identify those where it can be established that the construction of head works and trunk mains would facilitate the provision of piped water by groups.</P>
    <P>In many countries the need to provide ever increasing quantities of good quality water for domestic and industrial purposes on the one hand, and, on the other, the growing dangers to water sources from pollution by domestic and industrial wastes have led to the setting up of national organisations charged with the task of planning the rational use of water resources.  While this country is not as yet faced with serous shortages of suitable water nor with widespread water pollution problems it seems only prudent to consider what action is required to guard against those contingencies.  I have asked An Foras Forbartha to examine and report to me on what would be the financial and organisational implications of establishing an organisation to record and carry out research into the use of our water resources as a new division within An Foras.</P>
    <P>The number of fires which result in loss of life is a matter of concern. Many of these fires could have been prevented by the observance of proper fire precautions.  During the year, my Department published a booklet entitled &ldquo;Fire Protection Standards&rdquo;. This booklet sets revised recommended standards for fire prevention in all buildings (both new and existing) where a high degree of fire resistance is required.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious that the fullest publicity should be given to these standards and that every person who is responsible for the safety of buildings which provide dormitory accommodation or which house large <Col N="779" /> numbers should be fully aware of the standards and of the necessity to ensure a proper level of safety in such buildings.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the work of the Fire Protection Association of Ireland which was established in 1965 as a result of the co-operation of the Fire Offices Committee of Insurance Companies and my Department.  This Association devotes its entire resources to educating the public in regard to the hazards of fire and in making them aware of the necessity to ensure the observance of proper fire safety precautions. It is worthy of the widest possible support.  I would like to see every industrial and commercial concern in the country and every institution becoming members of this Association.  They could not but profit from doing so.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to be in a position during the year to approve of proposals for the building of a small number of swimming pools. These pools will be in the nature of pilot projects from which experience will be gained for the continuance of the swimming pool programme in future years.  While I am fully alive to the need for promoting a better standard of swimming and life saving in the country and recognise the contribution which adequate swimming pool facilities could make in this regard, I could not justify any large scale resumption of the swimming pool programme for the present because of other community needs, such as housing and essential sanitary services, which must continue to get priority. Local authorities and other interested parties should, however, continue to plan their swimming pool projects so that they will be in a position to go ahead according as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I note that local authorities and other local bodies sponsoring swimming pool projects in different areas have different approaches to their task.  Some bodies put forward their plans, often fairly elaborate ones, and expect the State to find the total of their capital requirements, while others are giving practical expression to their keen interest in <Col N="780" /> furthering their project by raising money locally to meet a portion of the cost.  In a number of areas the amount of money raised locally by voluntary effort has been substantial and I appreciate fully the energy and initiative shown in these areas.  I wish to make it clear now to everyone concerned that, when deciding on which individual pools may have prior claim on whatever capital may be available in the future for this purpose, I shall feel obliged to take into account the extent of local interest shown in the projects, as evidenced by the amount of effort that has been made to secure part of the cost from local sources.</P>
    <P>Implementation of Government policy on itinerants has been somewhat slow to date but I am glad to note that, in addition to the two small serviced sites which have been in operation in Limerick and Kildare counties for the past year, an extensive site which will cater for 39 families, is now available in the Dublin City area.  This, of course, is only a start and considerably more accommodation of this type is an urgent need in the Dublin area.  I understand that other councils have selected sites but that some others who have expressed their willingness say that they are experiencing difficulties in purchasing land for the purpose.</P>
    <P>In this connection I might emphasise that it is open to a local authority to consider whether they should invoke their powers of compulsory purchase in order to provide a proper site in any particular area.  I have recently confirmed, subject to modifications, an Order for compulsory acquisition of sites by Galway County Council.  To some extent, the opposition to the settlement policy which is evident in some places may spring from a lack of understanding of the comprehensive aim of the policy.  There is ample evidence that voluntary social workers are anxious to help in the settlement of itinerants, and in arrangements for education and employment, and I would like to take the opportunity here to pay tribute to the work of the groups engaged in this field.  It is clear, however, that the voluntary helpers and official agencies cannot work effectively until they have a <Col N="781" /> permanent base from which to operate. Hence the importance of the special authorised sites, which the local authorities are expected to provide.</P>

      <P>When I asked your permission to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the Irish contingent in Cyprus, in the light of the tense Greek-Turkish situation, I thought it was a matter which fell to be dealt with by the Department of External Affairs. I forgot then that we do not know where the Minister for External Affairs is.  He is not here and not in the country as far as we can discover. Where in the name of God is he when his presence here is essential?  It is a good guess that he is not in Cyprus. Where is he then?</P>
      <P>Therefore, it falls on the Minister for Defence to deal with this.  We must leave the location of the furtive ambassador-at-large and rely on the Minister we have here to answer our questions on this matter, about which I and many other people are so worried. The newspapers, radio and television have been reporting the increasingly serious situation which has developed in Cyprus between the Greeks and the Turks.  Nobody wants to exaggerate the situation or to cause unnecessary worry&mdash;certainly I do not wish to do so&mdash;about the Irishmen in Cyprus, but one has to be realistic and try to anticipate events to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspapers today make it clear there is a grave danger of a major war in that area.  We hope it does not happen: we hope so most sincerely. Quite apart from the question of our own people being in danger, quite naturally, we wish that there will not be any resort to large-scale armed force between those two conflicting elements, the Greeks and Turks, on this island which has had such a troubled history.  However, the fact is that in Cyprus at the moment there are <Col N="782" /> 500 Irishmen, officers and men of the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>When we agreed to the despatch of the troops to Cyprus, Dáil Éireann understood that the function of the UN detachments there would be to effect a police action, to continue the conditions of armistice which were arrived at some years ago, to dampen down as far as it was possible to do so, by diplomatic and peaceful means, the fiery feelings which we know only too well can be associated with nationalism, and in general, to try to maintain the peace.</P>
    <P>It must be said, of course, that the Irish troops, acting in concert with the troops of other nations under the flag of the UN, have done an admirable job.  It can fairly be claimed that they have been responsible, as it were, for keeping the pot from boiling over, at least until now.  But during the past week, there has been a grave deterioration of relations between the Greeks and the Turks and this fact has been brought home to us by reports which have been appearing daily.  The seriousness of the position has grown daily and this morning the London <i>Times</i> reported that the Greek-Turkish crisis over Cyprus took a sudden turn for the worse last night.  It said that the deterioration followed reports that Turkey had set a time limit for positive Greek action on the peace terms set by Turkey last Friday involving the withdrawal of the Greeks to a station in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned with the question on which the disagreement is about.  That is a question we must look at from a distance and we are not in any position to judge the merits or demerits of the dispute.  We are anxious only for a peaceful solution.  However, the grave danger is, now at this moment, that there may be a conflict. Everybody hopes there will not be.  If that disastrous event occurs, I want to ask the Minister for Defence what will be the position of our men in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>It has been the inevitable fate all through history that the peacemaker, in the heel of the hunt, has suffered most of all.  To be caught in a situation of this sort, an international situation of so difficult a nature as this, is a most <Col N="783" /> unfortunate circumstance.  This is the first time, I think, I have read of actual physical attacks on men of the UN detachment there.  It appears the Canadians were attacked last week and beaten up.  The British have also been interfered with and the British and Canadians have been in consultation.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about our boys there?  I spoke yesterday to a soldier &mdash;I met him in my constituency&mdash;who has been in Cyprus and he said feelingly: &ldquo;What are you doing about the lads in Cyprus?  Are you aware that if anything happens there of a major nature, there is a grave possibility that our men may be in serious trouble.&rdquo;  We do not wish to see a repetition of what happened elsewhere, in the Congo, for instance.  I do not say this will happen in Cyprus, but we must take steps to see that nothing comparable happens.</P>
    <P>When our men were in the Congo, we were told the Minister for External Affairs went there.  We were given to understand that he went to see Tshombe.  He did not do anything of the kind.  Wearing green pants and all, he went to the hospital to shake hands. Leaving that aside, before some of the Deputies came in I was inquiring as to his whereabouts.  We do not know.  As Minister for External Affairs, he should be here and looking after the interests of these men in the trouble spot I speak of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister for Defence is responsible for the Army but I should be entitled to make at least a passing reference to the responsibility which must lie squarely on the Minister for External Affairs, too, because this is not a purely military operation, it embraces international activity in which the entire Government and the entire country and, <i>ergo,</i> the Department of External Affairs are involved.  But, I am too concerned and too anxious about the situation to be diverted or to allow my mind to divert itself in the direction <Col N="784" /> of saying what I would dearly love to say to that gentleman were he present in the House, as I have done on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>I want to know on behalf of the Irish people&mdash;and speaking for the men themselves.  I am sure they would like to have some information&mdash;what steps will the Government take in regard to these troops at this stage?  What steps are open to them?  It seems to me that there is only one logical step.  When a serious war seems to be imminent and, judging by the world news last night, it appeared that way, we have no business there and let us get out of it.  Let us protect the lives of our own men.  I could, if I wished, talk about the fact that the UN have not paid for the services already given by the Irish in this peace-keeping operation but that is beside the point, immaterial, and would be a mean point to make.  We are not concerned about that.  We are concerned about the safety and welfare of our troops.  If there is a quarrel between the two nations and if it has got to the point where nothing will settle it except bloodshed, let it not be Irish blood that will be involved in this distant war because for too long have we seen our people sent to the far ends of the earth to fight foreign wars.</P>
      <P>It is stated in today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> editorial, that the entire UN force there is of such a relatively small, minute nature in terms of numbers that it could not affect the outcome if there were to be a major clash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of taking sides.  Imagine a small group of people not concerned with the thing at all, from different parts of the world, trying to keep the ring for two such fiery antagonists as exist in this case. The situation would be really impossible. While saying that, I am also very conscious of the fact that we are most anxious as a nation to do whatever we can within reason to promote the cause of international peace and to keep the guns from being fired wherever <Col N="785" /> we can throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote the editorial of the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> today's issue:</P>
      <P>... the problems which plague Cyprus have grown instead of diminishing.  Even the risk of war can no longer be dismissed as remote. The military junta which is in control in Greece, having failed to come to terms with the Turks, is in a position of weakness both because of its own nature and the ineptitude it has shown in matters of diplomacy. Turkey realises this and from a position of superior military strength is pressing home this advantage in Cyprus by harassment from the air and threats of invasion.</P>
      <P>As far as one can read, Turkey can mount quite considerable forces for deployment in war, both in the air and in the field, and an invasion of Cyprus could only mean that our people would be in a very serious position.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Government have thought about this at all.  Perhaps the crisis has come too suddenly for its gravity to be fully realised by the Government as yet, but, in any event, there does rest upon the Minister an obligation to tell the House, and through the House, the country and, not least of all, the men in Cyprus and their relatives here just what our plan is if this situation gets completely out of control, and it can so easily develop in this way.  There is nothing.  I suppose, that we can do to prevent it worsening.  If there is anything we can do, our furtive ambassador does not seem to be making any contribution towards it.  The Minister for Defence did go to Cyprus, I know, on one occasion but I do not know what steps he or this Government could take so removed from that island to lessen tensions there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Highly skilled international diplomatists such as the Secretary-General of the UN, U Thant, and many others like him have given of their energies and efforts in this problem but it still seems not to lose momentum; it still seems to be heading towards a deepening and more depressing situation.  The simple question then rests, and I have <Col N="786" /> an obligation to ask it, equal to the Minister's obligation to answer it : what about our men?  What is going to be done about them?  Is it not only right and proper that in a situation of this kind, they should be brought home?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to minimise in any degree the grave situation that exists in Cyprus at the present time.  I am glad Deputy Dunne has raised the question, and I am also glad that he has not asked for a general résumé of the conditions under which this peace-keeping force was first established or to go into the history of how it was established and the general decision that was taken here to send troops to be part and parcel of this force.  But I am well aware of the situation that exists in Cyprus.  We are in daily contact from here with our own battalion in Cyprus and we inquire as to the general situation.  We seek information on the morale and general wellbeing of our troops.  The United Nations Force in Cyprus is commanded by the Force Commander who is the representative there of the United Nations and he has certain instructions from the United Nations in the execution of his duties on the island and the deployment of the Force under his command.</P>
      <P>I might remind the House and Deputy Dunne that the Force was established to keep the peace or to endeavour to keep the peace between the peoples on the island.  It never was intended at any time that the United Nations peace-keeping force should hold the ring between the armed forces of outside nations who might, in their folly, make Cyprus a battleground.</P>
      <P>On several occasions&mdash;not alone now but previously&mdash;Deputy Dunne has asked the whereabouts of the Minister for External Affairs.  The simple answer is that the Minister for External Affairs is at the United Nations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>He is at the very heart of this question.  He is there in constant and very close touch with U Thant and with the Secretariat of the United Nations.  He is well informed of the situation.  Both I and the Government are kept fully informed by the Minister for External Affairs of the situation in Cyprus.  I can tell the House that yesterday evening the Secretary-General of the United Nations made an announcement that he had sent a high ranking official from his Secretariat, Mr. Rolz-Bennett, to the capitals of the countries concerned to make representations in relation to the desire of the United Nations to keep them from making Cyprus a battleground. He is now in Ankara.  So long as the mission upon which these troops are engaged continues, so long as there is a hope of securing an arrangement whereby there will not be a major war and so long as we can convince ourselves that this force in Cyprus is there to keep the peace between the peoples on the island, and that they are in a position to do so, I think it would be very foolish to make a decision to withdraw our troops.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to say also that one of the conditions under which this Dáil agreed to send our troops on this mission was that, in the event of a major conflict, the troops would be withdrawn.  I am not saying they should be withdrawn from the island.  To me, the meaning of the expression is that the Commander of the Force would withdraw his troops to a safe position if, at the time, they happened to be occupying a position in which they stood in real danger of being involved in a major war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, strong diplomatic pressure from all angles is being brought to bear on all parties to keep the peace.  I hope they will succeed in keeping the peace and that we shall not have an all-out major war on the island.  It is included in the general plan in the operation of this Force that the Commander would take the necessary steps to withdraw his troops in the event of a major conflict.  If that occurs, there is a new situation there and the first thing the Government would have to do would be to look <Col N="788" /> at the new situation and make new decisions in relation to the continued presence of an Irish unit or of any Irish troops in this Force.</P>
    <P>I want to allay any fears that may exist in people's minds either in the House or outside it that our troops, at the moment, are in real danger.  I am satisfied myself they are not.  I believe that the peace-keeping operation in Cyprus can be continued in comparative safety for the time being, but the position is continuously under review. Every effort is being made to secure the desired end for which the Force was created.</P>
    <P>As far as I myself am concerned and as far as the Government are concerned, we are naturally very anxious about our troops abroad, but, when a decision is taken to send troops abroad &mdash;let it be on a peace-keeping operation or otherwise&mdash;there is an inherent risk.  Whenever we agree to send our troops abroad on such a mission, it does not matter whether they are in Cyprus, the Congo or wherever else we may be asked to send our troops, the Dáil here gives approval for the operation. It is, therefore, only fit and proper that the matter should be raised here whenever there appears to be a change in the situation that existed when the decisions were taken here to send our troops abroad.</P>
    <P>We are not sitting down on this question.  We are fully informed by the Minister for External Affairs.  At the moment, he is in constant and close touch with the situation there at the Headquarters of the United Nations. I can assure the House that I, as Minister for Defence, will keep the matter under review daily.  We shall have our daily reports from Cyprus and we shall be well informed of any major change in the situation that can occur overnight or at any time.  If the situation deteriorates in a major degree, then we shall not hesitate to take our troops home.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further that can be said on the matter. I think I have been as explicit as I possibly could.  I do not think I have in any way tried to hide the gravity of the situation.  At the same time, it is necessary to be calm in a situation <Col N="789" /> of this kind and to avoid taking hasty decisions.</P>
    <P>Our troops have earned for themselves high merit.  If we were to act quickly, to make a decision before it is time to take troops home, it would create a very bad impression not alone abroad but at home, and even among the troops themselves.  These men volunteered for the service with all goodwill. In their very volunteering, they accept all the grave responsibilities placed upon them&mdash;all the ranks&mdash;in this most important matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne made the point that the United Nations had not honoured their word in relation to payments.  I answered that question today.</P>
