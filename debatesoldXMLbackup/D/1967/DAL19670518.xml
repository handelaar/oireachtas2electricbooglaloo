    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment last night, I had made a strong appeal to the Minister to have regard to the sad predicament of temporary postmen and night telephonists who have been the subject of gross exploitation by various Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs over a long number of years.  I pointed out that were it not for the fact that there is in existence a benevolent fund, the Rowland Hill Trust Fund, many dependants of temporary postmen would be living in abject poverty.  I paid a humble tribute to the noble man who conceived the idea of this benevolent fund through which such great humanitarian work has been done.  I want to pay tribute also to those persons who administer the fund at the present time.  Their resources are of necessity limited and they are confined to payment of about £1 per week to widows and orphans of deceased postmen for a specified period of approximately 20 weeks, after which period the allowance ceases and is subject to review.  Where a case of hardship can be made arising from the curtailment of the allowance, the <Col N="1173" /> trustees of the fund are always very well disposed to continue the allowance.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on our Department of Posts and Telegraphs that we have had to rely on the benevolence of a man like the late Rowland Hill to maintain widows and children of men who gave the best years of their lives to building up the postal service. It is a serious indictment of our lack of regard for the welfare of these people and our abject neglect in not providing postmen with a reasonable pension on retirement.</P>
      <P>I am not enamoured of the suggestion emanating from the Government benches in particular that a gratuity be given to auxiliary and temporary postmen on retirement.  This simply is not good enough.  Very many categories of workers who do comparable work, such as county council road workers and employees of other State services such as Lands and Forestry, will be getting a sick pay scheme and a pension scheme very soon and I appeal to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to take urgent steps to include auxiliary and temporary postmen in these schemes.</P>
      <P>It is sufficient for a boy of little over 14 years of age, who, obviously could not have had secondary education, to pass an examination to become a messenger in the Post Office from which position he can progress to the position of established postman. It is deplorable that temporary postmen who have served for ten, 20, 30 and 40 years, who have the same responsibility and carry out the same functions as established postmen, are not granted an opportunity to become permanent and established.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal that after long service, having done one's work in a very satisfactory and honest manner, one is still categorised as temporary and denied any rights in relation to a decent week's wages or security when it comes to one's retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also mentioned the plight of the night telephonists.  I have indicated <Col N="1174" /> the meagre hourly rates for which these people are expected to work, and that in order to secure a week's wages, these people in many instances must virtually put in two weeks' work.  In one week they have to work 70 or 80 hours in order to take home a wage packet of £9 or £10.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>We now have a Department which is moving rapidly towards the attainment of efficiency.  Efficiency is something which we all appreciate is necessary and desirable in these times, but I feel disposed as a Labour man speaking from these benches to caution the Minister, to ask him to show restraint and to have regard to the repercussions which of necessity arise and which he knows well will arise from the introduction of very costly computers, the application of time and motion study to work and the motorisation of our postal service.  The Minister clearly admits that redundancy will occur. The point I wish to make is that although it may seem economically feasible to do these things, we question whether it is right from a social point of view in a country where there are so many unemployed.  The Minister, in creating efficiency and savings in his Department, will simply be transferring that bill and that burden to the Department of Social Welfare who will be obliged to pay by way of unemployment benefit or the dole substantial amounts over a long period of time, with no prospect of alternative employment for the men concerned.</P>
    <P>These costly devices, especially computers and the like, and, indeed, most of the equipment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, are regrettably manufactured outside this country and must make for a sizeable amount in our balance of payments.  I would appeal to the Minister to have regard to that and to the progress that has been made in Irish industry, especially these ancillary industries relative to telephonic communication, radio and the like, and to see to it that so far as possible all this vast equipment which he is purchasing abroad will be manufactured here.  Even if we have to accept something less but something <Col N="1175" /> which will prove to be a reasonable substitute for the foreign product, this should be done in the interests of our economy and of employment.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would ask the Minister to have particular regard because he will find that the case which I submit in this connection is factual and is probably as much evident throughout the country as it is in my own constituency. I should like to see greater co-operation between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the local authorities in respect of the various work schemes upon which the local authorities are obliged to engage from time to time and which impinge on the work of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I have in mind particularly the case where local authorities are engaged on the provision of footpaths which necessitates the uprooting of telephone poles or the re-alignment of cables.  I have in mind the many road repair and re-alignment works which take place from time to time where again the work of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs must be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Here there is interminable delay before the Department come along to rectify the position, whereby, as a result, say, of the laying of footpaths or of road repair and realignment, telephone poles are often standing in the middle of the new footpath or very much out towards the middle of the new re-aligned roadway.  These obstructions are an obvious danger to the public, sticking out like sore thumbs for a considerable time before the engineering section of the Department is able to get around to their replacement.</P>
    <P>There is a very important aspect of this matter.  There is the question, which is very dear to the Minister's heart, of efficiency and economy.  The public generally, and especially the ratepayers, are often appalled at the situation which arises from the laying of new footpaths and new roadways at great cost: a few weeks or a few months afterwards, depending on the time it takes for the engineering section to get around to the job, these new footpaths or new roadways are torn up <Col N="1176" /> again in order to re-align the telephone poles or relay the cables in question.</P>
    <P>This is also true of the other Departmen for which the Minister has responsibility, the Department of Transport and Power.  Although I appreciate that that Estimate is not before us now, the very same thing applies to the poles carrying electric current. There is a lack of cohesion or co-operation between these two important Departments and the local authorities. There is an obvious duplication of work and waste of money, time and effort.  I am appealing for this kind of co-operation so as to ensure that the works will go on simultaneously, that the poles or the cables in question will be re-aligned in conjunction with the work schemes being carried out by the local authorities and that there will be no necessity in the future to have new work schemes torn up and replaced later on by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is not good enough to say that the Department makes good the amount of money lost to the local authority by such damage to its amenities; the fact is that there is duplication and wastage involved in this whole procedure.</P>
    <P>I found it rather amusing to hear the sentiments expressed here last night, particularly by Deputy Kitt and Deputy Molloy from the West of Ireland, who complained that they as Deputies were not getting a fair deal on Radio Telefís Éireann.  I believe these gentlemen were most probably sent in here to make this kind of protest, in a vain endeavour to soften the attack by the Opposition on the Government Party in relation to their obviously unnecessary interference with this mass media of communication.  It was comical in the extreme to hear them talk as they did because everyone knows that Ministers have been interfering from time to time with both Telefís and Radio Éireann.  Not only have they been interfering but they have been seeking to intimidate the staff of Telefís Éireann to slant certain programmes, and news items in particular, to suit Party political lines.</P>
    <P>I want to avail now of this opportunity of congratulating the staff of <Col N="1177" /> Radio Telefís Éireann for the protest which they rightly made recently against the undue interference of Ministers of State, who, by a phone call, seek to deny the staff of Radio Telefís Éireann the right to project news items in a fair, true and objective manner.  This was particularly evident from the manner in which the Minister for External Affairs cancelled the proposed team visit to Vietnam.  Here, we had the appropriate staff of Radio Telefís Éireann deciding to go to Vietnam in order to project the situation there through Irish eyes for the benefit of the Irish people; we could rely on them to project the truth, to be strictly fair and absolutely impartial. For some unknown reason, this visit was stopped by a mere phone call from a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>We wonder what the Minister was afraid of.  Was he afraid that our Irish television experts might give us the truth rather than the garbled propaganda which filters through to us mainly from American sources?  The ingrained fear of the Irish people at the moment is that there are ominous signs of the creation of a totalitarian regime in this country and all who value our democratic way of life, who have regard for justice, fair play, truth and objectivity, and the high principles of equal rights and opportunities for all have good cause to be perturbed and warned when they see about them this kind of interference by the Government with this important mass medium of communication.</P>
    <P>Despite such organisations as Taca, consortiums of different kinds, interference with the news and Ministers in high places talking about low standards in other high places, Radio Telefís Éireann has been doing a great job of work.  They are worthy of the thanks and gratitude of the Irish people for becoming so efficient on the job so quickly.  We marvel at the expertise displayed by our own Irish men and women in Telefís Éireann in such a relatively short space of time.  I congratulate them most sincerely on the wonderful programmes they project.  The service they provide is greatly valued.  There is, and always <Col N="1178" /> will be, criticism but the glowing praise far outweighs the occasional criticism.</P>
    <P>If left unhindered, if not interfered with by the Government, if the over-powering weight of the heavy hand of the Government is lifted from the authority.  I believe Telefís Éireann will continue to give a great service. It is disconcerting in the extreme to realise that so many of the staff were obliged to protest publicly, signing their names to that protest, about Ministerial interference with their right to do their job in the way in which they have been trained to do it.  It is even more disconcerting to realise that so many of them, who have become so efficient, are giving up in despair and quitting that important service.</P>
    <P>There are some programmes which demonstrate to ordinary people and, indeed, to supporters of the Government Party, that there is a positive political slant from time to time.  This is evident in particular prior to Presidential elections, general elections, by-elections and so on.  We have programmes which purport to show the changing face of Ireland.  These programmes invariably portray progress and prosperity&mdash;the model farm, the progressive industry, the jet planes flying in and out of Shannon or Dublin carrying the millionaires and the industrial tycoons.</P>
    <P>These programmes carefully avoid the seamy side of Irish life.  They avoid like the plague portraying the deep-seated economic <i>malaise</i> which affects our country.  They steer clear of the obvious depression and poverty so evident in so many places.  We never see the cameras focused on the queues of unemployed outside our exchanges. We never see the eye of the camera focused on the sad faces of the thousands of young boys and girls walking up the gangway at Fishguard or Dún Laoghaire.  These programmes are distorted.  They give a completely distorted version of this country.  They are designed to pretend that all is well in our economy, that ours is a land flowing with milk and honey and that prosperity and full employment <Col N="1179" /> abound whereas we all know that the opposite is the truth.</P>
    <P>Instead of the model farm, let us look outside or inside our goals at the present time and we shall see something of the truth of the position of Irish agriculture today. Let us look at our labour exchanges or at our mail-boats and we shall see the plight of our unemployed.  I do not have to advert to the sorry situation in respect of the lack of regard or respect for our sick and our aged.  Radio Telefís Éireann would do a great service to the Irish people if they projected the truth on our screens in respect of the state of affairs in this country.  May I suggest that an apt title for this programme might be to take a few lines from Goldsmith's wonderful poem <i>The Deserted Village</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey, where wealth accumulates and men decay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say much more on this Estimate except, again, to congratulate all our technicians and all those in high places in the Department who are giving an excellent service in respect of Posts and Telegraphs, radio and television.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night and I do not want to elaborate on it now the need to accelerate the provision of telephones in my constituency.  I am heartened by the statement of the Minister that he is now hopeful of clearing up the backlog of arrears.  I indicated some cases in particular in which I felt that priorities should have been given.  I trust that regard will be had to my views in that matter.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say last night that the proposed increase in licence fees will not be applied in this financial year.  However, it does seem to me that the Minister is now committed to an increase in licence fees and, in political terms, I may be right in asserting that what the Minister is simply saying is that there shall be no increase in the licence fees until after the local elections of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my main reasons for intervening in this debate is to draw attention to the telephone service.  During the past year and for several years <Col N="1180" /> past people have been coming to me and asking if I can help them to get a telephone.  In fact, it is one of the principal requests made to me as a Deputy.  I do my best and make recommendations. I receive a letter in reply stating that the service may not be provided for the next six or 12 months. Therefore, I join with other Deputies in asking the Minister to get through this work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy mentioned that he was afraid the Minister was aiming at too much efficiency in his Department by getting computers and other machinery.  I wonder if there is efficiency with regard to telephones.  I should love to see an increase in that efficiency.  I wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary about a telephone for a man who badly needs it for family and business reasons.  I received a reply that service was being provided in that area but only for people who had applied in 1965.  That man's neighbours who applied in 1965 would get a telephone but the man who applied possibly in January, 1966, would not get a telephone at present although service was being provided in the area.  Is that efficiency?  Is it efficiency to send out a gang of men to an area and to say: &ldquo;Connect A, C, F, and so on, but do not connect the others because their applications were received a month late&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, people have to pay a connection fee of £10 which is a new fee in the past few years and then they must pay an advance rental of anything up to three or five years which covers, and more than covers, the actual capital cost of installing the telephone. Take the ESB and consider how they operate.  They work in the opposite way.  They will not connect a particular house in a district unless they have a number of houses there to connect. They make a canvass of all the houses in the area.  The Engineering Branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should take a leaf out of the ESB book and make a canvass in the area to discover the total number of people there who want a telephone. That could be done even by way of a small advertisement in the newspapers. Then that area would be clear.  It would <Col N="1181" /> be a much more efficient way of doing the work than the present method of leaving out a certain number of applicants in an area because their applications were late.  To my mind, that is not efficiency.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and to have a reassessment made of the way this work is carried out.  I have a communication in my pocket in this respect but I think I should not read it now.</P>
    <P>The next problem is that of the provision of telephone kiosks.  There is a great demand for them in rural areas. It saves people a lot of trouble and from having to go three or four miles for a priest, a doctor, a veterinary surgeon, and so on.  Even if telephone kiosks are not a paying proposition, it would be well worth while to provide that amenity, that social service, in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Kilkenny Corporation. I wrote several times to the Minister requesting that kiosks be erected in new building areas but I got very little satisfaction.  Undoubtedly, we got a reply but we were told they would not be an economic proposition.  It is very difficult for these kiosks to be an economic proposition if at night people can use the telephones in them for conversations lasting as long as half an hour. Apparently there is no method of determining how long these calls take. On one ocasion I was waiting to make a phone call at a kiosk which was being used and after ten or 15 minutes the man using the telephone opened the door and said to me: &ldquo;There is another kiosk up the road; would you mind using that one as I am having a conversation here?&rdquo; I would ask the Minister to look into the position of these kiosks in the villages and rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the automatic system has now been extended to Kilkenny. However, there has been an automatic exchange in Callan for some time, but since its installation, I have heard nothing but complaints about it and people have said that over a two or three day period they could not get connections.  The conclusion the people <Col N="1182" /> arrived at was that the equipment was second-hand and was not providing the required service.  No one could expect second-hand equipment to give the service one would expect from modern equipment.</P>
    <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to consider raising the interest rate on Post Office savings.  According to his statement, withdrawals last year were £2 million greater than deposits. An increased interest rate would be an inducement to people to put their money into the Post Office.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of auxiliary postmen, we find that county council workers who have at least 180 working days to their credit in a year are entitled to have that year counted for pension purposes, but yet we have auxiliary postmen working for 52 weeks of the year for years, allowing for holidays, and all they receive at the end of their days is a gratuity. Very often they have to wait a long time before they receive that gratuity. Recently I received requests to contact the Department to ask them to let several of these men have their gratuities.  One man who retired last December had not received his gratuity of some £300 up to last week.  If there was efficiency in the Post Office, one would expect that a man who retired would receive his gratuity within a month at least.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my Party, I can say that it is laid down in our policy that we will make auxiliary postmen pensionable when we become the Government. It is only right that it should be done.  The Minister should adopt this part of our policy, just as the Government have adopted other parts of our policy, and implement it before we get into office.  In regard to permanent postmen, there are only so many vacancies in each area for this grade and a man, if he is not appointed to this grade, could be working for years without being made permanent. A man who has given anything from three to five years full service should be made permanent.</P>
    <P>In regard to the staff in post offices generally, one wonders if their numbers are sufficient.  At times post office <Col N="1183" /> staffs are very rushed and it is difficult to expect them to be civil if they are under pressure.  In business a man cannot be expected to be civil if he is trying to cope with large numbers of people.  I wonder is there anything to prevent old age pensioners, widow pensioners and those drawing children's allowances from having their cheques cashed in banks or in shops. If this were done generally, it would ease the burden on post office staffs and it would save these people journeying to the post office.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann are doing a very good job and providing a very good service but I often wonder why they do not give more home news.  I suppose the reason is that it is too costly to gather it.  Often one would think that one was listening to an international station because of the preponderance of foreign news, instead of to an Irish station.  You may hear some small items of Irish news but the rest will be foreign news.  I know that the foreign news flows in and that a certain amount of money is contributed annually for the provision of this service. Home news is probably more costly to obtain as staff men would have to be sent down the country to get it.  I would ask the Authority to provide a better service in this regard. Let us have the home news first and then any foreign news which is worth having.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I should like to explain to the House the field I intend covering in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary with special responsibility for Posts and Telegraphs.  I propose to deal with matters raised in the debate which related to those sections of the Department for which I have been given responsibility.  The Minister's opening statement came under such headings as postal services, the telegraphic and Telex services, savings, <Col N="1184" /> remittance and agency services, staff and finance.  In so far as the debate was conducted under those headings, I shall endeavour to reply to the points raised.  I would ask the House to bear with my comments and observations as they may be somewhat disjointed because this is the first occasion upon which I have had to deal with an Estimate in this manner.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the manner in which the comments were made during this debate.  It must be said that Deputy Dockrell leading off for the Opposition set a very constructive line.  His comments were most helpful and the over-all pattern of the debate dealing with matters to which I want to refer followed that pattern from Deputy Dockrell.</P>
      <P>Regarding postal services generally, a number of Deputies commented on the dual problem of motorisation and the position of the auxiliary postman. The policy of motorisation in country districts has displaced very short-term auxiliary postmen and this has been the aspect of it which came in for most comment in the debate.  There is quite an amount of misconception and misinformation in this regard.  Some Deputies spoke of how unfair it was to displace auxiliary postmen who had ten, 15 or 20 years service and put them off the road in order to expand the postal service through motorisation. Nothing can be further from the truth.  In fact, very few men who have been employed in this capacity for over three years have had to be displaced. At no stage has any man with over five years service been displaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy last night attacked the Department generally for making no provision for longer hours of work for auxiliary postmen and less patchwork. He suggested it was ridiculous to have men working on a part-time basis of 15 or 20 hours a week and asked what we proposed to do about it.  A short time later he attacked what is the solution to that problem, motorisation. As a rural Deputy, I am well aware of the problems arising as a result of this but over the past few years, following constant pressure for daily deliverv&mdash;the Minister mentioned <Col N="1185" /> this fact&mdash;we now have daily postal delivery to every area and every house in the country.  This was something that had been aimed at over a period.  Now that it has been achieved, the object is to get a more streamlined service and carry out deliveries as economically as possible.  That means motorisation.  Those who have criticised the change-over to motorisation have been prone to criticise the employment of auxiliary postmen on what they describe as &ldquo;a miserable pittance&rdquo;. Those were the words used by Deputy Treacy last night.</P>
    <P>On the same subject Deputy Carter on this side of the House spoke about the economist <i>vis-á-vis</i> the politician and generally justified the idea of taking a second look at the motorisation programme, on the ground that two and two make four from the economist's point of view but that the result is not always the same from the politician's point of view.  No matter what way you look at it, we must accept that two and two make four and, politicians or otherwise, we cannot quarrel with that.  That is the sum total of the argument justifying motorisation rather than the general appeal to keep people in jobs which are not economic either from their point of view or that of the Department.</P>
    <P>The one argument I am very anxious to kill is the idea that we have been putting out long-term men who have given good service over a long period and throwing them on the employment exchange as a result of motorisation. Another thing which surprised me in this connection was that some of the Labour Deputies, Deputies Tully, Kyne and Treacy, had quite a lot to say about this and it is rather remarkable that we in the Department are endeavouring to provide a more secure and rewarding job for the existing postmen by the expansion involved in motorisation and yet those who claim to represent them in this peculiar way are so much opposed to it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that those people have been exploited and that their pay has not been increased or has not followed the pattern of over-all increases obtained by other workers in <Col N="1186" /> the Department.  This is certainly not the case because the auxiliary postmen have had their pay rates increased proportionately whenever postmen got status or other increases.  We have auxiliary postmen all over the country and obviously the thing to do is to attempt to make play with their position and try to establish that they are very poorly paid.  I must accept that in some cases, with the very short hours for which we can afford to employ them, it is natural that their remuneration is not sufficient to keep them and of necessity, they must have other occupations, but I do not think we should be accused of ignoring these people because in relation to over-all increases obtained in other occupations, the remuneration paid to auxiliary postmen has been increased.</P>
    <P>We had a good deal of discussion and comment also on the question of pensions for those who have served over a long time.  Deputy Crotty who is now with us ended his speech on that note, the fact that the only provision we make for them is the granting of a gratuity and that even that is rather slow in coming up.  Up to not too long ago no provision was made for auxiliary or unestablished postmen. However, this situation was changed some time ago and now a gratuity can be paid.  The actual position is that auxiliary part-time postmen are not entitled to a pension under the Superannuation Acts but officers with seven years or more service are paid a gratuity of three-fourths a week's pay for every year's service.  It can be claimed, naturally, that this is a very poor return but I think the regulation governing this is the regulation which applies to unestablished officers in the Civil Service generally.  Any change in this regard would be an over-all change which would need to be introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1960 a means test was applied to this gratuity which we pay to auxiliary postmen but this test was abolished by agreement under the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  I found it difficult, therefore, to listen to Deputy O'Hara last night when he referred to an auxiliary postman in <Col N="1187" /> Foxford who had reached 80 years of age and who has been serving in that particular capacity for about 60 years not being able to get anything which might help him to retire.  If Deputy O'Hara goes further into this, it is quite possible he will find that he may not be fully aware of the situation.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the question of sick pay for auxiliary postmen and the fact that they were being treated in some way differently from others.  It might be just as well to point out that the conditions and the arrangements so far as wage rates and benefits of this nature are concerned are all dealt with through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is very wrong that any Deputy should generally attack the Minister in this regard.  Deputy Treacy described the auxiliary postman grade as being exploited by the Minister.  The facts will show that a scheme of conciliation and arbitration has been in existence for over 80 years.  Pay is settled by negotiation between the officials and the staff, with recourse to arbitration where agreement cannot be reached.  It is utter nonsense, therefore, to speak of the staff being exploited by the Minister in the matter of pay.  It is certainly equally nonsensical, on the other hand, for the public to think of the staff being exploited.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, I would like to correct two other mis-statements made by Deputy Treacy.  He referred to the night telephonists working 80 hours a week.  No night telephonist works 80 hours a week.  What the Deputy obviously had in mind was night and Sunday attendance.  Those officers are employed in small exchanges where there is an insignificant volume of night traffic and where their function could really be described as caretaker operators.  Actually, most of them find it possible to sleep during the course of the night.  The pay for this particular occupation has also been fixed by conciliation and arbitration. I was rather surprised that Deputy Treacy should come into this House and fling an accusation across the floor at the Minister regarding the circumstances surrounding the protest <Col N="1188" /> by the night telephonists last year. This had nothing at all to do with a pay claim.  It was rather surprising to hear this attack from Deputy Treacy in view of the circumstances surrounding that particular dispute.</P>
    <P>One item which was criticised, and it was criticism with which I am inclined to join, was the reference to the uniforms of our postmen.  This is a matter which has been raised in Estimate debates for quite a number of years now.  I hope that we may be able to have something concrete done about it&mdash;I do not want to say in the foreseeable future because that is too vague&mdash;within a reasonably short time. The matter is at present being hammered out, if you like, between my officials and the union officials.  In fact, a uniform in a new design, with improved quality of cloth, in a navy blue colour was submitted to the union for their views some time ago.  The union agreed to the new design which is regarded as an improvement on the old design but they have suggested that they would like to see a further improvement in the quality of the cloth.</P>
    <P>They also wish consideration to be given to a cloth of a grey colour recently submitted by them.  Those matters are being actively pursued at present. I propose to take a personal interest in this matter with a view to seeing if we can have the thing ironed out if at all possible.  I certainly agree with Deputy Tully when he says that postmen are&mdash;I think the phrase he used was &ldquo;the face&rdquo;&mdash;the public image of the Department.  I certainly agree that that public image is not at all stages quite up to scratch but the union seeking improvements here will find that I personally will be most anxious to meet them in this regard.</P>
    <P>A question was also raised about the quality and colour of the cloth.  Reference was made to the bad fitting and it was said that the trouser lengths were a couple of inches too long.  This can be the case but let me say it should not be the case because the Department have the fullest provision made for issuing the proper type suit and the proper size suit for each individual <Col N="1189" /> postmen who qualifies.  In fact, there is a wide range of sizes.  I was rather surprised to learn the varied range in sizes of suits which we have. In fact, there are stocks in the stores branch of 55 different readymade trousers and 49 different readymade sizes of tunics.  In fact, a far wider range of stock sizes is catered for than in the ordinary readymade commercial market.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, with the wide range, to outfit properly all postmen. The only thing necessary from the point of view of the stores branch is that the form setting out measurements, standards and sizes is properly filled at local level.  As I have said, the postman's appearance is the public image at local level of the Department.  It is something which I propose to follow up to what I hope will be the logical conclusion, that each postman will be properly fitted with whatever type of suit is eventually agreed on.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to remuneration of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  The position in this regard is that, again, it is a matter to be dealt with by conciliation and arbitration and does not call for any comment from me except to say that the pay of sub-postmasters was increased by 31 per cent from 1st February, 1964, with a further seven per cent on 1st July, 1966.  However, questions about over-all pay are dealt with by conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>We also have the question of the five-day week, which was raised by Deputy Tully.  As he knows, this is a problem, again, for conciliation and arbitration but there are various difficulties involved.  He referred to those difficulties and mentioned that some system could surely be worked out whereby postmen would operate on a five-day week.  All general service grades in the Department headquarters, departmental grades, professional engineers, sub-professional engineers in the Engineering Branch, the factory and warehouse grades and male night telephonists are on a five-day week. Agreement was reached at Departmental Council level in 1965 and 1966 to introduce a five-day week for post <Col N="1190" /> office clerks, telephonists and sorters. Schemes providing for such attendances are all agreed upon.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of the female telephonists, but this is also a matter for conciliation.  I am sure the Deputy knows that here the hours of service need to be straightened out clearly before the question of the five-day week is dealt with.  It is understood, and it is obvious from discussions on this matter in other services, that if we have a reduction from a five-and-a-half to a five-day week, the hours outstanding are made up by lengthening the hours of the other five days.  This is one aspect that is not rigidly applicable in the case of the female telephonists.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell mentioned the male night telephonist and said he understood that we had 175 temporary male night telephonists and that it was rather unfair that those people should not have an opportunity of becoming permanent as this job was what he described as &ldquo;a blind alley job&rdquo;.  I should like to point out that while these people are taken on in a temporary capacity, competitions are held regularly for them.  A competition was held in 1965 and again in 1967.  In the 1965 competition, the service necessary for sitting the examination was three years of temporary service, but this was reduced, exceptionally, to two years for the recent 1967 competition so that a greater number of temporary staff would be eligible to compete.  Of 147 temporary male night telephonists employed in the Central Telephone Exchange, 79 were eligible on service grounds to compete in the 1967 competition. The remaining 68 have less than two years service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but as the Deputy is aware, night telephonists' duty is not the most attractive in the business and it is quite obvious that it <Col N="1191" /> appeals to people who, after a certain length of time, find some other type of employment.  I do not think we can hold out against this.  It is not attractive and you must have some other type of employment which falls in with it.  The staff are forever changing.  The system does not provide an opportunity for those who, for one reason or another, are looking for temporary employment.  It seems to me, let me say, that it offers a permanent pensionable career to those who remain in the telephone service if they so wish.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the matter of privacy for people making telephone calls in country sub-offices. He spoke about the absence of facilities which, he said, embarrasses the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress, as the case may be.  The Department provides silence cabinets in all cases if there is room in the post office for them.  There is no reason why, in a post office where there is adequate room, there should not be such a silence cabinet.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick is speaking about a particular subpost office where that facility is not available and where it can be made available, I would welcome hearing from him about it.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to kiosks not being kept in proper condition.  I think Deputies on all sides of the House have a particular responsibility here with regard to vandals.  People speaking about the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are inclined to claim that the Department are always using vandals as an excuse for kiosks, or stamp machines, or various other facilities, under the aegis of the Department not working properly.  I think comments in the House about the conditions in which some kiosks are found reflect not so much on the manner in which our cleaning staff look after them as on the manner in which they are treated.  We should be less critical of the Department and more critical of the offenders in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the Department can be 100 per cent blameless.  There is always the human element.  We have the question of the disinfecting of the mouthpieces and no matter how well <Col N="1192" /> this is done, it can be claimed that it is not done well enough.  We have a service of full-time staff engaged in the cleaning of these kiosks.  In the city centre, they are cleaned daily, and in the outer areas and towns less often, but certainly at least twice weekly.  But then, as against that, we need not even talk about kiosks in the smaller towns because, generally, the normal civic spirit is such in those towns that we do not have that trouble.  The greatest trouble there generally is the question of crooked coins or the kiosk or telephone being out of order.  That can be due to the insertion of crooked coins or to the idea that it might be worked with a washer.  It is generally accepted that our kiosks all over the country are kept in good order, except when in the city we run into the problem of the Department versus vandalism and letter writers are more inclined to blame the Department I am afraid.  We are told that we should know who the vandals are, wait for them and be ready to clean up after them.  Everything possible is done at our end to ensure that the kiosks are properly looked after.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to postmen, auxiliary postmen, sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses being allowed to go for election.  I think Deputy Tully described it as one of his chestnuts, or something like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is quite straightforward.  Civil Servants, as such, are not allowed to go for election.  This is not a regulation specifically laid down by the Post Office; it is a regulation laid down in the normal run of Civil Service administration.  Deputy Kyne asked why not allow the normal run of rural postmen, average postmen, auxiliary postmen, or officials or employees of the Post Office to do so up to a particular level.  But where do you draw the line?  This is a matter not for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. It is specifically a matter beyond our control.  Any employee of the Post Office is officially debarred.  It is not a rule of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Appeals were <Col N="1193" /> also made from this side of the House. Deputy Allen spoke about this, as did Deputies James Tully and Kyne.  I made note of the fact that those three Deputies spoke&mdash;perhaps others did also.  This is one of those problems in relation to which people will ask: &ldquo;In what way does it interfere with the normal run of duties?&rdquo; But the same can be said of the normal run of civil servants and, at this stage, I do not think the regulation can be changed. Reading back-issues of the debates on the Estimates, I know Deputy Tully suggested that perhaps a blind eye might be turned to items such as these. However, we cannot get away from the fact that the regulation is there and we must accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an answer.  Reference was made to savings certificates or the savings services.  A number of Deputies on all sides of the House made reference to the fact that the 3½ per cent rate of interest on savings in the Post Office falls very far short of the rate of interest obtainable from other investments.  One of the facts which has been overlooked completely here is that a deposit in the Post Office savings bank can be withdrawn at any stage and is a type of service which is open to the small investor putting in his money for a short time, collecting the interest on it over that period and withdrawing it whenever he feels like it, at very short notice.  This is not a service available in relation to the other types of investments and returns from investments mentioned here.  This fact has been lost sight of when criticising the new 3½ per cent rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>But no time limit is in operation as far as we are concerned. In fact, this particular savings service is criticised without taking into account that the new rate has been applicable since the beginning of this year only and has not shown any return yet.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Deputy say it.  We have new stamp-vending machines in the larger post offices here in town.  They have been provided as a result of appeals over a length of time.  These are the book stamp-vending machines and it was only some time before Christmas I had the pleasure of writing to Deputy Ryan saying that one of the things he had been talking about for quite a while was being experimented with now and had been introduced into the post offices.  I found him criticising the fact that they had not, so far, been placed outside but have been put inside the post offices, by way of experiment.  I think he should allow a little more time for this experiment to be proved satisfactory before he criticises us from the <Col N="1195" /> point of view of not putting the machines outside.</P>
      <P>Reference by Deputy Ryan to the situation in Rathmines is something I propose having a look at, first of all, to see if what he has said can be substantiated in this regard, and, secondly, to see if anything can be done to overcome the difficulty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan also criticised the system of paying social welfare benefits through the post office.  Certainly, I do not know what the overall criticism of this can be in Dublin city.  Are we to change that system and get back to a system whereby old age pensions and widows' pensions would be sent out weekly from the Department?  An alternative was not suggested.  In any event, it is not actually a matter for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at all.  We provide a service, but it is a service which the Deputy said we should not be providing but he did not suggest how it would be done otherwise.  I presume that would not be a matter for debate on this Estimate.  I think this type of distribution arrangement is quite satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to say that I am against the introduction of a general speed limit.  The section, as it stands at the moment, proposes to give the Minister authority</P>
      <P>To make regulations prescribing, in respect of all public roads, or all public roads with such exceptions as may be specified in the regulations, a speed limit (which shall be known as a general speed limit) for all mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
      <P>The Minister already has under the Act of 1961 very considerable powers to impose speed limits where necessary and he has made regulations providing speed limits in built-up areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> There are two approaches to this section which proposes to introduce a general speed limit.  One school of thought takes the view that this might tend to encourage driving up to a fixed limit; in other words, that it might encourage some people to drive faster than they would normally drive.  The Minister has heard the story of the passenger who said to the rather slow driver when he came into the built-up area: &ldquo;You can now do 30&rdquo;.  One school of thought thinks that if there is a rather high general speed limit fixed people might be encouraged to drive up to that limit.  However, another school of thought takes the view that there is really no necessity for a general speed limit, that outside the built-up areas where speed limits already exist, there is no congestion problem whatever, that the roads are fairly good and are not carrying a very heavy flow of traffic.  As I have already said, sections 44 and 46 of the Act of 1961 seem to give the Minister adequate powers.</P>
    <P>I raise these points on this section to get the Minister's views and to hear from him what speed limit he has in mind as a general speed limit for every road in the country and why he thinks it necessary to introduce such a speed limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this section in principle but I would support some of the points made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  There is a danger that a speed limit which is the maximum also becomes the minimum.  We must learn by experience in other countries.  The experience in Britain has been that the speed limit on the motorways has produced new hazards rather than reduced the old ones.  If there are a considerable number of vehicles travelling on a good main road or motorway, all travelling at the maximum permitted speed of 70 miles an hour, it only needs one slight emergency at the head of the line to produce a chain reaction right down. Nobody can brake sufficiently quickly to avoid a general pile-up.  Therefore, I would not be in favour of high general speed limits because I feel they are more of an incitement to speeding <Col N="1197" /> than the reverse.  The greater the variety of speed at which traffic is moving on the road the better because it means there will be gaps between vehicles.  The real danger arises when vehicles are travelling more or less bumper to bumper at comparatively high speeds.</P>
      <P>There has been some useful experience gained in other countries by the introduction for short periods of fairly low general speed limits.  The periods I am thinking of are, for instance, round about Christmas when there is a lot of celebration going on and when the casualty rate is unusually high. Over a holiday period there is not the same necessity for high speed.  People are only going out for amusement, they are not going on business and not keeping to strict timetables.  They are not keeping appointments as regularly as they would during business hours. There is something to be said for introducing a low general speed limit at periods of heavy traffic density, during holiday periods, at bank holidays. Easter or over Christmas.  I would ask the Minister to look into that very carefully.</P>
      <P>The trouble is that driving on the roads is difficult enough and the less variation in regulation we can have the better.  I have found, driving on the Continent, that it is almost necessary to have a navigator as well as a driver because of the multiplicity of signs giving instructions and information at a rate which a driver cannot assimilate without distracting himself from his main job of controlling his vehicle.  Therefore, I would hope that we would be very careful about introducing a number of different speed limits.  However, I hope the Minister will seriously consider introducing, at certain very dangerous times of the year, a general speed limit, but make it low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not all that keen on speed limits generally because a lot of dangerous driving takes place at low speeds.  However, if it is to be a general speed limit, I would prefer it to be a general speed limit round about 40 m.p.h. over a holiday period because very many people might survive that period who would not otherwise do so. <Col N="1198" /> Even if everybody goes at 40 miles per hour, the chances of a serious accident are very much reduced.  Once we come to the higher speed levels, I am not at all happy that a general speed limit on the main roads of 60, 65 or 70 miles per hour is desirable at all. That tends to make people try to drive up to the speed limit instead of at the normal safe limit they settle for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am doing in this section is taking permission to prescribe speed limits.  There is no decision taken to impose an overall speed limit, nor is there a decision taken as to what this limit should be.  It appears from experience in other countries that the imposition of overall speed limits has desirable effects.  It is generally accepted that a reduction in speed reduces accidents.  It certainly reduces fatalities and serious injuries in accidents. Accidents will continue to occur whether or not we have an overall speed limit, but obviously the likelihood of accidents proving fatal or resulting in very serious injury increases in proportion to the speed at which the vehicles are travelling.</P>
      <P>Investigations have been carried out both in America and in Great Britain. In Great Britain speed limits have been imposed for an experimental period and the Road Research Laboratory has made a study which is summarised in a document entitled Research on Road Safety and published by that laboratory.  I do not intend to quote from it at length but it deals with some of the arguments advanced here and deals quite effectively with them.  The report points out that the practice of vehicles travelling at the same speed is not dangerous in itself, provided the drivers leave sufficient distance between themselves and the vehicles in front of them.  Head to tail accidents are not caused by speed limits but by the fact that few drivers realise how long it takes to stop a vehicle travelling at speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments put forward against this is that it encourages people to drive up to the limit, irrespective of the road or the traffic conditions.  This <Col N="1199" /> is a question of the attitude of mind of the individual, and does not arise directly from the imposition of a speed limit.  It is hard to see why the fact that there is a speed limit at which a person is legally entitled to go should encourage him to drive at a speed in excess of that at which he would drive if the speed limit were not there.  The Road Research Laboratory in Britain found no evidence to suggest that where a speed of 70 mph was imposed the majority of drivers were encouraged to drive up to that limit.</P>
    <P>This experimental speed limit of 70 mph was introduced in Great Britain on 22nd November, 1965, on all roads which were not already subject to lower speed limits, and the conclusions reached as a result of that were to the effect that an overall speed limit, even though it was not universally observed, had a considerable effect in reducing road accidents.  During the first three months of 1966, the reduction in the fatal and serious casualty rate on trunk roads and Class I roads with speed limits of 50 or 70 mph was 13 per cent compared with the same three months in 1965.  On other classes of roads, the reduction was between three and seven per cent.  The slight casualty rate changed in much the same way.  Again, on the motorways, on the M.1 and the M.4 there were statistically significant reductions of about 20 per cent in the injury accident rate during the trial period compared with corresponding periods for earlier years.  There appears to have been no significant increase in the proportion of head to tail accidents on the M.1 since the introduction of the 70 mph speed limit, so the fears which have been expressed are hardly justified.</P>
    <P>I do not visualise imposing a general speed limit straight away or without a great deal of study taking place.  It is highly desirable that before we impose a general speed limit, even on an experimental basis, we should have surveys and studies conducted, and it is my intention to ask An Foras Forbartha to conduct such surveys before any decision is taken to implement this.  I think it is a desirable <Col N="1200" /> power to have and I ask the Dáil to grant it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is another example of giving the Minister a blank cheque when he does not know how he will spend the money.  One would have thought that when the Minister comes into this House and asks for a fairly far-reaching power like this, he would have reached the conclusion that a general speed limit was necessary, and that he would be able to give the House some indication of the speed limit he had in mind.  On the contrary, the Minister comes in here and stands over a section in the Bill which proposes to give him the right to impose general speed limits and at the same time tells us it has not yet been decided to impose speed limits of this kind, nor has he given any consideration as to whether the upper speed limit should be 50, 60 or 70 mph.</P>
      <P>I imagine that when we come to the stage at which we have motorways all over this country, on which it might be possible to drive a car at 90 or 100 mph, these speed limits might be necessary, but we are very far from that state of affairs here yet.  As I said already, outside the built-up areas, the rates of speed are tolerable and the volume of traffic comparatively light. Apparently the fears expressed by Deputy Booth and me that these maximum speed limits might be the minimum speeds have been expressed elsewhere as well as here.  I am afraid I cannot accept that the Minister has made any case for this section, and I am against giving him these very wide powers, especially when he has not come to firm decisions, or even approximate decisions, on how he will use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am with Deputy Fitzpatrick to some extent but I should like to make it perfectly clear that I am in favour of the section generally because I think it gives a power the Minister should very properly have.  I do not know whether it is a matter of which side of the House one is on, but I feel very much happier after what the Minister has just said.  At this stage <Col N="1201" /> if we were to put into the Bill more precise details as to limits and circumstances, we would be introducing an arbitrary decision.  I am quite happy if the matter is kept under review by making certain experiments and judging the results as we go along.  It is a matter of trial and error.</P>
      <P>I wish to reiterate a point I made earlier, that we are dealing with human nature rather than mechanics in this matter.  It is all very well for the Road Research Laboratory in Great Britain to say they find no evidence of this or that and that as long as cars can be a significant distance between one another, nobody will hit anybody else. That is obvious.  The difficulty is that human nature being what it is, traffic tends to pile up.  Unconsciously and unwillingly, one finds oneself creeping up on the car in front and in next to no time you have ten, 12 or 20 cars running nose to tail.  That is a human nature problem which we must keep under review at all times because people react unpredictably to changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>If the Minister proposes, as he has indicated, to go into the question of speed limits in a careful way, trying out this and that and analysing the results, I am perfectly happy.  This section is phrased in the only way it could be phrased at this stage and I am happy with it.  Presumably the regulations the Minister may make under the section will be laid before the House.  I do not know whether they have to be&mdash;I meant to check on it before I rose.  If they are, I think that is a sufficient protection.  It will give us an opportunity, if necessary, of discussing them further when they are made and before they come into effect.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I assume that all the various crops of regulations provided for in the Bill must be laid before the House.  I do not think it is provided for in this Bill but probably it is in the Principal Act.  Not alone will the regulations require to be laid before the House but before they are scheduled or signed by the Minister, they should also be submitted to the motoring organisations in the country&mdash;the two of them&mdash;because <Col N="1202" /> only in that way will they be carefully considered and will Members of the House be alerted, so to speak, and, let us be frank about it, briefed, so that they can deal with the regulations when they come before the House.</P>
      <P>While I still have considerable doubts about the wisdom of giving such wide powers to the Minister, especially when he has no firm idea of how he will use them, I would be a little more at ease if I had an assurance from the Minister that draft regulations would be submitted to the motoring organisations, who represent a considerable body of motorists in the country, before they are signed and laid before the House.  If I had that assurance, it would go a long way to putting my mind at ease in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the description of this section as a blank cheque, I want to say that I do not believe anybody has any real doubt that reduced speeds would very probably result in a reduced accident rate and certainly in a reduced rate of serious casualties.  In other words, it must be agreed that reduced speeds are desirable if reduced speeds can be achieved practically and without creating the other danger to which Deputies have referred.  Any evidence that is available to date seems to show this can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested we should wait until this research has been completed before we even ask for the power to introduce overall speed limits.  I do not think that is a reasonable suggestion.  We have this Bill before the House now; it will take us a considerable time to enact it and we know that reduced speeds are desirable if we can achieve them.  It is, therefore, desirable that this power should be there, if it is found practicable, to introduce speed limits rather than that we should wait until all the research has been completed and then go through all the processes of drafting a new Bill and bringing it in here. This is an urgent matter, but at the same time, I agree the research must take a considerable amount of time. <Col N="1203" /> It is still urgent and if, as I expect, it is shown to be in the best interests of road safety to introduce an overall speed limit, I think we should be able to do that as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Booth said, I appreciate that human nature, being what it is, comes into this but we must face up to the fact that human nature, in the form of people in charge of motors on the roads, will have to be educated and controlled as far as possible.  I indicated already that all these matters will be the subject of full discussions with the organisations concerned, including the motoring organisations.  This is an aspect of the Bill which is particularly appropriate for that and certainly the views of the motoring organisations will be very valuable and will be sought.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree. Accidents resulting from high speed driving are more likely to kill or maim but that does not mean that the fast driver in good conditions is the person responsible for those accidents.  Far too many people suffer from other shortcomings.  Personally, I believe that while one car is probably safe at 70 to 75 mph on a good road, another car is a menace at half that speed.  If that aspect is considered properly, it might help to reduce the number of accidents.  I wish to impress on the Minister&mdash;I do not think I need to&mdash; that if we continue at our present accident rate, it will be only a comparatively short number of years until every person in this country has been involved in a motor accident, considering it from the point of view of the number of people killed and injured on our roads in present circumstances. The entire question must be approached in the manner the Minister <Col N="1204" /> suggests: there will have to be a definite look at it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to organisations.  Here again we run into trouble.  The cross-section of the Irish public represented in this House are perhaps in a better position to speak for what is happening than a particular motoring organisation, which in most cases is following a certain line.  That line is not the one which is going to reduce accidents.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to consider seriously the question of motor lorry traffic.  Without being too critical of it, the practice building up in this country of three, four, five or six lorries, often with trailers attached, driving nose to tail at fairly high speed, making it impossible for ordinary traffic to pass, is one of the biggest causes of accidents I know of.  I understand there is some regulation which can deal with this.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that it be dealt with specifically and that we do not have a continuance of this practice.</P>

      <P>I would like to make one or two comments on the points raised by Deputy Tully.  I am in favour of the Minister having a say in an overall speed limit for the country.  We heard a lot of talk about the motoring organisations.  I am a member of a well-known motoring organisation and, as such, I am absolutely in favour of the introduction by the Minister of an overall speed limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Many cars today are not designed for the high speeds at which they are being driven.  There is no such thing as a reliable car.  Every car is subject to a defect in some part, and it is at high speeds that these faults appear.  No one can guarantee that a car will not break down in some way. It is a well-known fact that the vast majority of fatalities occur in cars driven at high speed.  I do not think anyone will disagree with that.  There should be an overall speed limit of 70 mph.  No one should need to drive faster than that.  If he is in a hurry, he <Col N="1205" /> should leave in plenty of time to get to his destination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that there should be an overall speed limit of 70 mph, which could be reduced to 50 mph at holiday week-ends.  This has had an effect in Britain, where it has been put into operation.</P>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Tully in regard to these big lorries travelling nose to tail.  If there is a regulation there already, the Minister should be able to summon these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fairly well in agreement with the last views expressed. I know an accident involving a fast driver and a slow driver is not necessarily caused by the fast driver. I quite appreciate that.  Plenty of slow drivers may be quite bad drivers and may be the cause of accidents.  Deputy Tully said some vehicles are more suitable for driving at a fast rate than others.  At the same time, if the speed of a fast driver involved in such an accident is controlled, he has a better chance of surviving and a better chance of avoiding a sudden and unexpected emergency.  I believe that an overall speed limit would be a protection for everybody.</P>
      <P>I also appreciate that this problem of a number of heavy lorries, often with trailers attached, proceeding along the road together is a serious one.  It will be possible to deal with that in the manner Deputy Fitzpatrick is so enamoured of, by regulation.</P>

When you get this sort of heavy traffic <Col N="1206" /> on the road from Dublin to Navan&mdash; or, let us be specific, from Dublin to Clonee&mdash;the position becomes impossible.

      <P>I am glad to hear that. I want to be somewhat critical now and say that the present speed limits in some cases extend too far beyond the villages and towns concerned and, in other cases, the signs appear to be erected in the wrong position.  I know of one village, not ten miles from Clonmel, where a speed limit is in operation.  The speed limit zone takes in a relatively straight stretch of road, on which there is a creamery, but fails to take in the main part of the village where there are two public houses on an extremely bad bend.  What authority has the Minister to ensure that, when speed limit signs are being erected, they take in the most important features of the towns and villages concerned?  This is a particularly ridiculous case, and I might say that the village is Ballymacarberry. Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a very important question.  Those of us <Col N="1207" /> in public life have been inundated with requests from residents of towns and villages where there is as yet no speed limit, and where cars career through at any speed they like, where there is an obvious threat to life.  In many of these villages the people are panic stricken.  They have made representations to us.  We have submitted the requests to the Minister's Department. When we raise the matter with the local authority that additional speed limits be applied in certain towns and villages, invariably the reply is that it is a function of the Minister for Local Government and that it is up to him to take the necessary steps to have the speed limits applied.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to say at this stage when he hopes to take upon himself the responsibility of dealing with the multitudinous requests pouring into his Department for the application of speed limits in towns and villages where speed limits are not already imposed.  It is up to the Minister to make the order.  Our pleas are of no avail unless the Minister can indicate when he will review the whole question of speed limits and permit us to have them applied to places where they are desired by the populace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing speed limits were the first attempt and I suppose it was inevitable that there would be some mistakes, some anomalies, some inconsistencies in the manner in which they were applied.  As I have indicated on a number of occasions, a comprehensive review on a county by county basis has been proceeding for some time now and it is fairly well advanced.  It has been completed in a number of counties and it is expected that it will be fully completed by the end of this year.  It is to be hoped that when that review is completed, all these mistakes and anomalies will be rectified and that the built-up zones which were left without speed limits and in which it is now felt that speed limits are required will also be dealt with.  That review is proceeding as rapidly as possible and, as I have said, it is expected that it will be completed by the end of <Col N="1208" /> the year and we hope that these matters that have been causing a lot of worry to all public representatives will be satisfactorily dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to issue a word of warning to the Minister, even though it may be unnecessary. There is not only a safety element involved in these applications for speed limits where they are not at present applied; there is a question of the prestige of a small village.  I have had experience of people coming to me and saying: &ldquo;Why have we not got a speed limit in our area?&rdquo; the main trouble being that another area has got a speed limit and they feel that their area is being downgraded by not having a speed limit.  This is something we have to be careful about because this is not a prestige matter.  I hope the Minister will be guided strictly by the safety element.  If traffic is unnecessarily slowed down, congestion on the roads will increase.  The main purpose of a road is to get traffic moving. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be quite resolute in his review and ensure that speed limits are applied only where safety requires them and will not yield to pressure which is being exerted simply to show that one small village is at least as good as the next one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to intervene here to disabuse Deputy Booth of the idea that there is any question of prestige involved in respect of the representations for which I have been responsible as to the application of speed limits in various towns and villages in my constituency.  Those representations were not made for prestige purposes or because one village was vying with another.  A speed limit is primarily for the purpose of protecting the inhabitants of a town <Col N="1209" /> or village.  Indeed, in some cases, the area concerned might not be regarded as a village.  The inhabitants could rightly take offence at their locality being described as a village.  Many of the places concerned are towns with reasonable populations, certainly more than 1,000.  It is not a question of prestige.  It is a question of taking reasonable precautions for the welfare of the inhabitants and to safeguard them against speedhogs who career through these places at fantastic speeds.</P>
      <P>Let us all agree that speed limits have proved to be a dissuading influence on speedhogs.  When a motorist sees a speed limit sign, it prompts him immediately to take the boot off the accelerator and to exercise restraint and caution.  Where these signs are not seen at the entrance to a village or town the tendency is for motorists to speed through.</P>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister to expedite the erection of additional speed limit signs purely in order to ensure that children are not massacred or the lives are not frightened out of elderly persons by speedhogs.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;by the deletion of subsection (2) and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 24 of the Bill proposes to amend section 46 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which enables the Minister to make special speed limits.  I think these are the type of speed limits that we have been talking about on the last section.  Subsection (2) of section 46 of the Principal Act reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall not make regulations under this section save on the application of the Commissioner or on the application of the road authority concerned and shall not revoke or amend any such regulation save after consultation with the Commissioner and the said road authority.</P>
      <P>Section 24 of this Bill proposes to delete that subsection and to confer on the Minister, through his officers, the right to impose local speed limits or amend existing local speed limits without reference to the Commissioner of the Garda or without reference to the road authority which, normally, would be the local county council or the local urban council.</P>
      <P>On the last section we had reference to speed limit signs which were placed too far from the centre of a town or village.  We had references to sizeable villages and small towns which have not been made the subjects of a speed limit at all.  The Minister is much more likely to get a reasonable and a practical speed limit if he is obliged to consult the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, because if the Commissioner is consulted, he will immediately consult the local superintendent who in turn will consult the local sergeant, and the Minister will get a report on local conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore if the Minister is obliged to consult and listen to the <Col N="1211" /> road authority, he will get the views of the local representatives and in that way local opinion will be sounded, and the Minister will be much better briefed before he fixes a speed limit.  There again he will not be obliged to accept the recommendations of the Garda Síochána or of the local authority, but he will at least have the benefit of the local knowledge which consultation with these people will provide.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a trend running through this Bill to try to concentrate absolute power in the Custom House, or O'Connell Bridge House, or wherever we are operating from at the moment.  That is not a good trend. The provision in subsection (2) of section 46 of the Principal Act is a wise one, and the proposal to delete that subsection is not wise.  My amendment, which I urge the Minister to accept, merely proposes to leave section 46 of the Principal Act as it was, with the deletion later on of the words &ldquo;day and night&rdquo; which I think probably will give a little more elbow room.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say when dealing with this amendment why he considers it necessary to delete subsection (2) and how subsection (2) hindered him or hindered his predecessor. I should like him, from experience over the past six years, to make a case for the deletion of this reasonable subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that in practice section 46 has been widely used to apply 40 mile per hour speed limits on roads contiguous to built-up area speed limit zones, and in some cases to apply 40 mph speed limits to specified zones such as small villages where a 30 mph speed limit was not felt to be appropriate.  This has given rise to an anomaly.  Under section 45 of the 1961 Act, the application of the built-up area speed limits is completely within the discretion of the Minister, whereas under section 46 he may not make regulations to apply special speed limits without application from either the Commissioner of the Garda or the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These 40 mph speed limits which have been applied under section 46 are <Col N="1212" /> not isolated cases.  They are part and parcel of the general pattern of speed limits and as such they must be considered in the light of speed limits generally.  The operation of this subsection (2) has created difficulties.  If the Department considers that special speed limits should apply to a certain road or in a certain area, then either the Commissioner of the Garda or the road authority must be requested to make formal application for it.  It is difficult to expect either of the authorities to apply for a limit with which they may not be in agreement, and if both should refuse, then the Department is placed in an invidious position in that the Department is generally responsible for the speed limits in built-up areas.</P>
    <P>The difficulty arises because the Commissioner is naturally guided in his decision to apply for special speed limits by his local officers, and the road authority again seeks the advice of its technical officers, and widely divergent views may be held by such officers as to the manner of applying speed limits.  In fact, it was as a result of this diversity of opinion between local officers in different parts of the country that we have the anomalies in regard to the speed limits as they were applied in 1963, and it is this that has necessitated the current general review of these limits.  That is the difficulty in regard to these special speed limits, that the Minister or the Department can take no initiative in regard to them under the subsection.  The application must come either from the Commissioner or from the local authority, so that if there is an anomaly as between one area and another, there is nothing under the present law that the Department can do to rectify it and to introduce some consistency into these matters.</P>
    <P>As far as consultation is concerned, there is now a well-established procedure whereby local technical committees representative of both the Garda and the road authorities make recommendations to the Minister as to the actual point on any road where the statutory built-up area speed limit should commence and as to the roads to which a special speed limit <Col N="1213" /> should apply.  These committees' recommendations and all other representations are carefully considered during the general speed limit review that is proceeding at present.  The local technical officers and the Garda are always consulted, so that the question of formal consultation does not really arise, but at the same time, it is surely desirable that there should be somebody in a position to ensure reasonable conformity in the imposition of these regulations throughout the country as a whole.  Where there is a wide diversity of opinion among local officers, there is no likelihood of getting this conformity. I think it is the lack of conformity that has given rise to a lot of dissatisfaction with the present speed limits.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are now getting into Part V which proposes to impose the breathaliser and blood tests.  Section 27 is the section which introduces the breathaliser test and gives the right to a member of the Garda Síochána to stop a motorist and ask him to give a sample of his breath.  I shall reserve what I have to say generally about Part V until I am dealing with my amendment to section 28.  I say that because, although there may be objections to section 27, the evidence which will be procured by the breathaliser really is not very important.  It will not be evidence of impairment of the driver.  It will not be evidence, apparently, which can be tendered in court.  However, it is worth mentioning on this section that this breathaliser test is notoriously inaccurate.  I have been told that, if a motorist is stopped, immediately after having one small whiskey, and a sample of his breath taken, it may well produce the same result as if he were stopped a quarter of an hour or half an hour after having seven or eight whiskeys.  The breathaliser test has proved not to be reliable at all in other countries, particularly the type of breathaliser in general use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section gives the right to a member of the Garda to stop any motorist and take a sample of his breath.  If he refuses to give the sample, he can be fined £20 for the first offence, £50 for the second and £50 or three months in prison for the third.  Subsection (3) provides that a member of the Garda &ldquo;may arrest without warrant a person who has been driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and who, in the opinion ... is committing or has committed an offence under this section&rdquo;.  That subsection is really a little beyond me.  I do not know exactly what it means.  I should like the Minister to tell us.  The only offence I can see is the refusal of the motorist to submit to this test.  If he does not submit to it, subsection (3) (a) gives the garda the right to arrest him.  Suppose the person goes home and goes to bed, can the garda come along and arrest him in his home?  I should like to have the Minister's views generally on this <Col N="1215" /> section.  I shall deal with Part V in more detail when we come to section 28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I have certain misgivings about this breathaliser test which, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, has been proved inaccurate.  It is not a reliable instrument of measurement.  However, I appreciate this will not be a test of a man's sobriety or otherwise.  I, too, await with interest the Minister's comments on this particular means of testing. I should like to know whether, in fact, it is necessary to use the breathaliser at all or whether there is any reason why the garda should not exercise his own judgment, as he does at present.  What really worries me is subsection (3) (b).  There was a considerable amount of discussion on the Second Stage in relation to what happens to a man who knows he has too much drink taken and who climbs into the back seat of a car to sleep it off.  Under this section he could possibly be charged.  It would be his word against that of the garda.</P>
      <P>I should like some clarification of this.  The man is in charge of the car technically, even though he is unfit to drive.  He is sleeping off the effects in the back seat.  How will this affect such a driver?  Many drivers stop at the side of the road when they know they have too much drink taken. Somebody else spoke about the question of evidence if he has not attempted to drive or if he has given the keys to someone or has thrown them away. I should like to hear the Minister on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this section is designed to shock motorists into a greater sense of responsibility towards the public at large it certainly will have the desired result.  Unfortunately, in so doing, it is intended to curtail many of the fundamental rights which the motorist, as a citizen in our society, has up to now enjoyed.  This section contains some very serious stipulations. It will empower any member of the Garda whenever he is of opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically-propelled vehicle in a public place has <Col N="1216" /> consumed intoxicating liquor, to require that person to provide a specimen of his breath by exhaling into an apparatus.  It empowers the garda to stop any individual motorist and to force him, whether drunk or sober, to go through this kind of a test. We should be very careful before we place that kind of power in the hands of any man.</P>
      <P>The possibility of the unfair or discriminatory administration of this section is something the House should guard against.  It is bad enough to be stopped and asked to exhale into this kind of apparatus, which is of very doubtful accuracy, according to the sentiments expressed here today, but there is much worse to follow.  There are also the stipulations in this Bill that samples of blood may be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  There is also the urine test&mdash;other sections, admittedly&mdash;but, in my opinion, these are very serious inroads into the fundamental rights of our people.  While none of us condones drunken driving, and while we want to assist the Minister in every way in putting it down with a firm hand, at the same time, we must have regard to fundamental rights and not expose any of our people to being held up indiscriminately and forced to undergo tests of this kind without due cause being shown.  There should be a reasonable suspicion that a man is under the influence of drink, and very much so, before he is subjected to the rigid provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>I agree very largely with the sentiments of Deputy Fitzpatrick and others who said that it is with reserve and a certain amount of anxiety that we should allow these kinds of stipulations to be included in any piece of legislation.  The Minister's comments will be welcomed on this aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all too happy about this breathaliser test.  The section is somewhat too loosely worded. It is not definitive enough.  Having said that, I think I should pose a number of questions to the Minister in relation <Col N="1217" /> to the operation of the breathaliser. Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I have read and heard that this is not altogether a reliable or conclusive instrument. Will there be a corps of the Garda Síochána trained to operate these breathaliser kits?  I think this is very important.  In America, they call them &ldquo;Rookie Guards&rdquo; who are trained to go out and to operate this very delicate instrument.  If this section is passed as it stands, I would ask the Minister to ensure that the Garda will be trained, and trained thoroughly, in the operation of the breathaliser kit.  I am not too happy about it generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a valid point concerning subsection (3) (a) and (b).  When does this section cease to operate?  A garda, who may have seen a car pass up the road three or four hours earlier, might say to himself, on reflection later, that the driver of that car looked as if he was drunk and that he would go up and knock at his door, get him out of bed and then possibly operate the breathaliser test. Is it possible that that could happen? I am not too happy about subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the points made by me and other speakers on the section.  I am not altogether in agreement with Deputy Treacy when he says it is an infringement of the rights of the individual. The individual has certain rights towards other people and we must protect people against the wrongdoings of others.  I do not want to be too pious about it but I think that is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody in this House should try to protect drunken drivers or to induce the Minister to do anything that would allow such a position to develop.  I think that would be an impediment to our drive to protect pedestrians and others in our community.  It is just as important that somebody would have power to say to the driver of a car: &ldquo;We want to take certain tests to see if you are fit to drive&rdquo; as to take precautions against defective brakes, worn-out tyres and bad lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two factors are involved here: (1) <Col N="1218" /> the driver, who is a very important element and (2) mechanical and other defects in the car which are of no less importance.  We have power to take steps against bad brakes, worn-out tyres and bad lighting but people who are perpetually drunk, so to speak, can drive whenever they feel like it.  If these people want to drink, then they should not drive.  There is no fear, then, of a breathaliser test or anything else.</P>
    <P>I think a measure of this kind will safeguard pedestrians who need protection from people who are driving around this city and this country daily in such a condition that every effort should be made by the authorities to ensure that there will be some device available such as the breathaliser, however reliable or unreliable it may be.  I am quite sure it will be reliable to a degree and that that factor will be taken into consideration by the appropriate authorities when an examination takes place.  I am quite sure they are aware of the extent of its reliability.  It may be said that these things are unreliable, and they may be to a degree, but everything has to be covered in the right way in the right time.  The people must be protected in any way and there must be some means by which such drivers in this age of transportation will be brought to their senses.  The Garda and others should have the power to stop them and take whatever samples are necessary in order to ensure that the public can go in safety.</P>
    <P>I am sure that nobody here has ever seen a person killed by a drunken driver.  If he had, he would be horrified if later on he was told that this man was not drunk in the eyes of the law because somebody had come along perhaps half an hour later and said that in his opinion the driver was not drunk.  We have seen people who we knew were drunk and at a later stage we were told that they were not drunk because some time had elapsed before any action could be taken by a police doctor or another doctor to say whether or not the person was fit to drive.  This would be an impediment against people taking out cars when they are loaded up with <Col N="1219" /> drink.  If they know that somebody may stop them with a bag into which they must blow to find out the quantity of drink they have taken, it will be a deterrent.  Most of these people have no regard for anybody but themselves. We have seen cars in ditches and off the road elsewhere, as a result of drunken driving and many of these people who have injured themselves, not to talk about causing injury to others, would be saved something if they knew that the police were waiting to take a breathaliser test if they thought they were incapable of driving. It is just the same as saying that a man would not drive his car without lights through a village after dark because he knows he would be stopped by the police and fined.  It is more important that the driver should be in a sound, healthy and fit condition to drive than it is to have the car fitted with good tyres, good lighting and good brakes.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to ask the Minister what will this test prove.  What will it indicate to the garda?  Will it indicate anything more than a look at the driver or a chat with him would indicate? Before he applies the test, he must be of opinion that the person has consumed alcoholic liquor.  Will the breathaliser indicate how much liquor he has consumed and will it indicate whether he is impaired or not?  I should also like to ask the Minister what is the meaning of the words in subsection (3) (a): &ldquo;and who, in the opinion of the member, is committing or has committed an offence under this section&rdquo;?  As I see it, the offence under this section is spelled out in subsection (2) which says</P>
      <P>A person who refuses or fails to comply forthwith with a requisition under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offence is the refusal to comply with the requisition to give a sample of one's breath.  What is the meaning of the words &ldquo;and who in the opinion of the member is committing&rdquo;&mdash;there seems to be some sort of continuing offence there&mdash;&ldquo;or has committed an offence&rdquo;?  I do not understand what <Col N="1220" /> those words mean.  They appear again in subsection (3) (b).</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in regard to the question of fundamental rights, the Commission which reported on this whole matter, and which included a number of lawyers and a judge, held there was nothing fundamentally objectionable in any of these tests. This is done in other democratic countries. I am quite satisfied that there is no infringement of fundamental rights in requiring people who are licensed to drive on the roads to establish that they are in a fit condition to do so.  In regard to the reliability of the breathaliser test, it has been agreed already that the test is not one the absolute accuracy of which can be assumed. The procedure in connection with the breathaliser test will be that if the breathaliser indicates that the blood alcohol content is probably below 125 milligrammes the garda will normally take no further action, but there may be cases in which the garda will have grounds for forming the opinion that the driver or person in charge of the car is committing an offence, even though the breathaliser indicates that the blood alcohol level is probably below the prescribed level here.  In such cases it will be open to the garda to bring the person concerned to the Garda station and take such further steps as may be considered necessary, such as requiring him to undergo more conclusive tests.</P>
      <P>If the result of this preliminary breathaliser test indicates that the blood alcohol level is probably greater than 125 milligrammes, this will not in itself be a ground for prosecution, but it could be taken as sufficient ground for forming the opinion that the person from whom the specimen was taken is committing or has committed an offence under section 49 or section 50 of the 1961 Act.  The Garda are empowered to arrest the person involved under the Act and to bring him to the Garda station and deal with him under section 29 or section 30 of this Bill.  In other words, they may require him to provide a blood or urine sample so that the alcohol content of the blood may be accurately determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> Subsection (2) refers to a person who refuses or fails to comply forthwith with a requisition under this section and who therefore shall be guilty of an offence.  The section does not provide any particular penalty so that the general penalty set out under section 102 of the 1951 Act may be invoked, £20 fine for the first offence, £50 fine for the second or subsequent offence and, in the case of the third or subsequent offence within 12 months, a fine up to £50 or imprisonment up to three months, or both.  Obviously, if it were possible for a person to refuse with impunity to undergo a screening test, guilty drivers could escape the provisions of the law completely.  That is why under subsection (2) a refusal will be punishable by fine or imprisonment. This will not fully solve the problem because people who know they are guilty of an offence might decide to refuse a preliminary test and thereby deliberately choose the lesser offence and the lesser penalty involved so as to evade being charged with a more serious charge of which they knew they were guilty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They could have this in their minds well before they consumed any alcohol.  It could be a matter they would have discussed fully before they left the premises where they consumed the alcohol.  Subsection (3) provides that a garda may arrest without a warrant</P>

    <P>In other words, the garda is empowered to arrest a person who has refused to undergo the preliminary test.  Such a person may be brought to the Garda station and dealt with under section 29 or section 32 of the Bill.  It is quite clear that if a person refuses to provide <Col N="1222" /> a specimen of his breath, the garda may decide to proceed under subsection (2) of this section and charge the person with being guilty of this particular offence of refusing to give a specimen.  On the other hand, he may feel that this person is deliberately selecting the easier way out, the lesser charge, probably because he knows he would be found guilty of the major charge and in such circumstances subsection (3) empowers the garda to arrest the person, bring him to the station and require him to undergo a blood or urine test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>While I support the Minister on section 27, I think it is something we should be very careful about.  Is it intended that the garda should have some training on how to identify the symptoms of drunkenness? It is not enough to say that if he is staggering around the place, a man is drunk: that would be a very dangerous conclusion.  I am afraid that with the introduction of the breathaliser, we might have a kind of national witch hunt for drunken drivers.  It would be only too easy for a garda to say that every person he suspects is drunk must submit to a test.  That would defeat the whole purpose because it would bring the breathaliser into ridicule.  We must satisfy ourselves that a person who is unconscious in a car is not a diabetic or suffering from any other malady, apart from drunkenness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section interferes with certain rights of the individual and yet we know that in the interests of road safety and of the lives and well-being of citizens, we must have more stringent tests.  They should be used very sparingly.  Because a man is involved in an accident does not mean he is drunk.  I would ask the Minister to consider having a Garda corps that would be taught the fundamentals of identifying drunkenness.  This would save a lot of trouble.  We in this House are not capable of knowing whether a man is drunk because of the different effects alcohol has on different individuals. While I support the Minister strongly on this point and agree the stringent test must be taken, I would ask him to impress on the Minister for <Col N="1223" /> Justice the necessity to convey to the Garda that this is not to become a witch hunt for drunken drivers, that they are there to help the drivers and the public and that they should use the breathaliser test very sparingly. Irish drivers will naturally resent being asked to pass breath or urine or blood tests but I think they must be educated about why they are asked to do these things.  It is because of the appalling road toll.  It is hard to say how much of it can be attributed to drunkenness but some of it undoubtedly is attributable to drunkenness.  If we could remove this proportion, we would be doing a good job but we must ensure that breathaliser and other tests do not become everyday happenings to be treated with a certain contempt after a while.  I think it is necessary that the Garda be given some instruction on how to identify a drunken driver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have replied to a point made by Deputy Andrews who asked if a special corps of gardaí would be trained to administer the Bill.  That is not intended but the gardaí who will be using the breath testing devices will be specifically trained in their use.  Of course all gardaí, as far as I know, are given instruction in the identification of people who are inebriated.</P>
      <P>Another point I should have dealt with was the question raised by Deputy Briscoe about a driver who goes to sleep in the back of the car to sleep off the effects of drink.  It is true that this section gives power to require such a person to undergo a breath test. This is necessary because the exact circumstances may not all be known to the garda at the time.  It is to enable him to decide whether a prosecution should be brought under section 50 of the 1961 Act but in this Bill we are amending section 50 of the 1961 Act by section 31 and the result of the amendment will be that the man who can show that he went to sleep in the back of the car in order to prevent himself from committing an offence will not be guilty of an offence.  I think it is necessary to put that obligation on the person concerned.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading, I asked the Minister what would happen to the fellow who was careful even when he was drunk and decided to sleep off the effects in the back of the car.  The Minister then gave an assurance to the House that arrangements would be made to remove any danger of that man being prosecuted.  The Minister now seems to be mending his hand again and says such a person may be required to undergo the test.  I think that the person is either subject to the same regulations as the fellow who is in the front of the car and prepared to drive, or he is not.  If a man gets into the back of a car for the purpose of sleeping off the effects of drink, I think it is stupid to suggest that he should be tested and prosecuted, if it is found that he has, in fact, taken intoxicating liquor because that is why he went into the back of the car.  The Minister should have another look at this matter.</P>

      <P>That is something else.  I was not prepared to agree with Deputy Moore on the question of a witch hunt but if we have people going around to find out if an offence has been committed, they might as well pick up somebody on the street who is drunk and test his breath in case he had been driving a car some time previously.  There is just as big a likelihood there as in the case of the man in the back of the car.  If you go that far, I think you are going too far.</P>

      <P>That is one thing. Investigation, yes, but taking a breath test in case you find out that some time previously he had been driving a car is too complicated for me.  I hold no brief for the drunken driver but I think this can become too complex. The Minister's statement, which can be found in the Dáil Debates, that if <Col N="1225" /> a man was in the back of a car, he could not be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, or even put through the tests was, I think, the correct approach and the Minister should go back to that.</P>
      <P>Deputy N. Lemass has an amendment here.  I was struck by his argument on Second Reading.  It seemed to be that while a man who was driving a car, if under the influence of drink, should be entitled to all possible protection and in no circumstances should his feelings be hurt, if a pedestrian were found drunk, the strongest possible action should be taken against him.</P>

I would go all the way with the Minister to prevent the drunken driver driving because like most Members of this House, I drive a lot and one of the things which cause many of us to get many a shock is the fellow who does not stop his car and go into the back of it to sleep.  He keeps on driving and is not sure which side of the road he should be driving on or whether we have changed over to the other side of the road like Sweden.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has stated that the breathaliser test is just a screening device.  If this test indicates that there are more than 125 milligrammes that garda may then request the motorist to come along to the barracks and submit to a blood test.  If my information is correct, this breathaliser is so notoriously inaccurate that a man who was subjected to a test after having had a half-one might flare up and register at 125 milligrammes if this test were taken a few minutes after coming out of a publichouse and getting into his car.  This man has only taken a halfone and is perfectly sober but the breathaliser would register the same as in the case of a person who had taken several half-ones and the test was not taken for some time.</P>
      <P>This is a very dangerous implement. The person may be subjected to a blood test later on in the Garda station. If that person refuses to have this blood test, he is subject to all sorts of heavy penalties.  I would like to hear if the Minister agrees with that.  That is my information which I have received from professional people in a position to know.  I would also like the Minister to say what is the meaning of those lines in (3) (a) and (3) (b) &ldquo; or has committed an offence under this section.&rdquo;  He has either committed an offence or he has not.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's point about the notorious inaccuracy of these breathalisers, there are different types of these devices. There are good ones which if properly and skilfully used are reasonably accurate and there are others which are not.  As I said, they are not being taken as being a conclusive test. Deputy Fitzpatrick says that the result of a breathaliser test, if it indicates a higher alcohol content than 125 milligrammes, would inevitably involve the suspect in a blood test.  There is power to permit the person who has been taken to the Garda station, as a result of the breathaliser test, to ask for a further breathaliser test.  Sections 29 and 32 are the sections which say that he is required to give the blood test.  The person could after having been taken to the Garda station, ask for a further breath test before being required to give a blood test.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to add to what has been said by other speakers about the application of this breathaliser test.  We should not proceed, as Deputy Dowling might be inclined to do, on the basis that all motorists are criminals and drunkards.  If it is necessary to introduce such a test as this in the interests of the public generally&mdash;and I am told there is a school of thought that says it is doubtful whether it is Constitutional or not, but I shall reserve that for another section, section 28&mdash;there is an obligation on the Minister and on those who will operate this measure, when it leaves this House, to ensure that the public are not subjected to unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable tests.  The gardaí will require, I think, that this instrument should not be carried wholesale by members of the Garda Síochána.  It should be for those who are to use it, who are designated to hold up the public to apply these tests.  They should be specially trained in the mechanism, if that is the proper word to use, of the instrument, in the manner in which they use it, when they are to use it and how it should be used.  It would not be good enough for a young garda to go out one night and say: &ldquo;I will have a spot check&rdquo; and then hold up any person he wishes to see whether he had alcohol taken and whether he should be brought to the barracks.  I do not think this House should pass legislation which would subject the citizens of this country to that sort of unnecessary treatment.</P>
      <P>Whatever views Deputies may hold, generally speaking, in relation to section 27 of this Bill, I think all of us will agree that there should be reasonable application of this section.  It should be administered in a reasonable way and that only when there is, in fact, suspicion that a person has a considerable amount of drink taken should he be held up and subjected to this sort of test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In this legislation there should be no way out whatsoever for the drunken driver.  Drunken driving must be stamped out at all costs.  If this particular instrument is <Col N="1231" /> not suitable, a better one will have to be provided.  I am satisfied that the tests are reasonably accurate and, with due consideration taken, that they are acceptable in a general sense.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to sleeping in the back of the car.  That is a way out for the drunken driver who goes out on the road, hits a person, knocks him down and then drives up a lane and sleeps in the back of the car.  I believe that whether he is in the back of the car or in the front of the car, if he pulls up just to convenience himself, he should not get away with it.  We should tie up this legislation so that nobody will get away, even the person who says: &ldquo;I am not driving the car now&rdquo;.  That person is no less a menace on the road than he who keeps on driving and gets home; he does not pull up but just drives off but the other fellow pulls up to suit his own convenience. People get cute in drink; they know when to stop and when and where to park.  The law should be fully complied with and the sooner we drive these drunken drivers off the roads so that people can walk around in safety and parents will not be anxious about their children the better.</P>
      <P>Many accidents are not reported to the Garda.  Accident victims are fixed up here and there with small amounts of compensation.  The sooner we get down to tackling this problem in a realistic manner and the sooner there is no way out for drunken drivers the better.  In regard to sleeping in the back of a car, I do not think that the fellow who goes up a lane to sleep in the back seat should get away with it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling is talking about two different things. Surely a man involved in an accident can be charged and tested to find out whether he is drunk?  But what we are talking about is a perfectly innocent person who has not hit anybody, but who is in a car, who comes out of a publichouse and, rather than drive the car home in his drunken state, sits in the back of the car and decides to sleep off some of it before starting to drive. Surely it is not unreasonable to say that that man should be treated differently from the man who comes out of <Col N="1232" /> a publichouse blotto, gets in behind the wheel and attempts to drive? Deputy Dowling is under the impression that if he is in the back of the car, no matter what he may have been doing before that, he is guilty.  Nobody has suggested that, except Deputy Dowling.  The Minister should not be confused by the issue put to him now.</P>

      <P>What I mean is that a person who can establish that he got into the back of the car with no intention of driving will be covered by section 31, but the garda may not be aware of all the circumstances.  He may have reason to believe that an offence may have been committed and, in such circumstances, he must have the power to take all the necessary steps to establish whether or not this person has committed the offence of driving, or attempting to drive, while having raised his blood alcohol content to a level of 125 milligrammes.  It is necessary to have this power but it will be a valid defence for the person to say he did not drive the car or did not intend to drive it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes; one is an amendment of section 49 and the other an amendment of section 50.  The same principle is involved.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Before section 28 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 49 of the Principle Act is hereby amended by the insertion after `the vehicle' in subsection (1) of the following: `and if there is present in his body a quantity of alcohol such that within 3 hours after so driving or attempting to drive the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood he shall be deemed until the contrary is <Col N="1234" /> proved to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to try to make my position clear.  The Minister, by section 28, proposes to make it an absolute offence for a person to drink to such an extent when he is driving, or within three hours thereafter, that the alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  The Minister wishes to make that an absolute offence.  My amendment proposes to make such a concentration of alcohol in the blood <i>prima facie</i> evidence that a person is drunk, within the meaning of this section, and unfit to drive, that a person who has such a concentration of alcohol in his blood will be deemed to be unfit to drive, until he satisfies a court of law to the contrary.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are seeking to rid the roads of drunken drivers.  I am sure the House is behind the Minister in that aim, and is prepared to give him a measure which, in our opinion, will enable him to make it more difficult, or indeed impossible, for a person who is unfit to drive a car, as a result of consuming alcohol, to get away with it.  But in our efforts to protect the general public from the impaired driver, we should not depart from accepted principles and standards in this country.  One is that a person cannot be compelled to convict himself, cannot be compelled to give evidence which will convict himself.  The second is that, broadly speaking, people are presumed innocent until proved guilty. I know my amendment has the effect of shifting slightly that onus of proof. Section 28 introduces a new offence&mdash; the Minister has told us that before, and will tell us again&mdash;that is, the offence of driving a car, or attempting to drive it, while the concentration of alcohol in the blood exceeds 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres.  I say that the offence should be that of driving a car while impaired as a result of taking drink.</P>
    <P>A Commission was set up on 14th September, 1961 under the chairmanship of the then President of the High Court, the Honourable Mr. Justice Cahir Davitt.  That Commission reported to the Minister on 15th May, <Col N="1235" /> 1963 and recommended that it should not be an absolute offence for a person to drive a car if he has a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of his blood.  It recommended that such a concentration should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence, and <i>prima facie</i> evidence only, of impairment.  The Minister stated this morning that the Commission reported that they did not consider there was anything fundamentally unsound about what he proposed to do, that there was not anything unconstitutional about it, but the Minister should bear in mind that the Commission did not recommend the absolute offence which the Minister seeks to impose in this section.</P>
    <P>I shall deal briefly with the Commission's report.  At paragraph 50, page 43 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>If any legislative changes are to be really successful and effective they must, in our view, have the support of the bulk of public opinion.  In countries where a certain blood-alcohol level has been prescribed as conclusive evidence of critical impairment, public opinion has, we believe, been conditioned, perhaps gradually, to accept the position.  Here the whole procedure of taking and analysing blood samples and giving evidence of blood-alcohol levels in prosecutions would constitute an innovation in criminal procedure with which everyone concerned might take some considerable time to become familiar, as well as an interference with personal rights which public opinion might be still slower to accept as necessary or desirable.  It may be that, as a result of experience, public opinion would in the course of time be conditioned to accept and approve of a prescribed level which would be conclusive evidence of impairment.  We doubt very much if the education of opinion on the matter has yet reached that stage.  We take the view that, initially at any rate, a blood-alcohol level should be prescribed which would be <i>prima facie</i> and not conclusive evidence of critical impairment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> That is the recommendation at paragraph 50, page 43 of the report.  In the following paragraph, paragraph 51, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Having regard to our examination of the matter in Part VI, the experience of our study groups who visited the Continent and Britain, and all the relevant material which we have considered, we believe that a suitable level is 125 mg.  We believe that with such a blood-alcohol level the great majority of persons will be critically impaired. and that to prescribe such a level as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of critical impairment would be just and reasonable.</P>
    <P>In the same report at page 71, paragraph 7 of Appendix II, which was the Report of the Committee of the Commission on their Study Tour of the Continent, it is stated:</P>
    <P>A major question is whether a specific blood-alcohol level should be prescribed or whether it should be left to the courts.  As indicated in paragraph 4, three of the countries have no prescribed level, but the courts have in practice adopted a specific level.  Of course, in exceptional cases (where the evidence of witnesses or medical evidence so warrants) a person with a higher level might be acquitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is important</P>
    <P>or a person with a lower level might be convicted.  If evidence as to blood-alcohol levels were to be used in this country, it would seem to be wise to adopt a specific level as <i>prima facie</i> evidence, otherwise there could be considerable variation in the decisions of different District Courts.  The State should be free to produce evidence that an accused was critically impaired even though his blood-alcohol level was below the standard specified, and the accused free to show that he was not so impaired even though his blood-alcohol level was above that standard.</P>
    <P>Those are the recommendations in this report of the Commission which considered the matter from 1961 to 1963. For the record, we had the President <Col N="1237" /> of the High Court, the State Pathologist, the President of the Safety First Association of Ireland, a general medical practitioner, a superintendent of the Garda Síochána, a psychiatrist, members of the Motoring Associations, the Chief State Solicitor, a District Justice as well as a couple of eminent civil servants on that Commission.  They reported and the Minister is not prepared to accept those recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that the Commission do not appear, in so far as one can ascertain, to have changed their views in the meantime because I consider I am at liberty to say that Father Kennedy, who is President of the Safety First Association, is still of the opinion that the concentration of alcohol which I have mentioned should only be <i>prima facie</i> evidence as recommended by the Commission and should not be an absolute offence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, people who have considered this carefully are of opinion that this section followed by the other sections which must be discussed to some extent with it&mdash;those are the sections which make it obligatory on a person to submit to these blood tests&mdash; are unconstitutional and will not stand up in the Supreme Court where, I am convinced, this measure will end.</P>
    <P>We have here, whether we like it or not, a rigid, written Constitution.  I know I am dealing with one specific amendment now but in dealing with this amendment, I am trying to give the Minister a better measure because I will give him a constitutional measure. I am told that this section coupled with the other sections will not stand up against Article 40 of the Constitution. Furthermore, from a practical point of view, if the Minister accepts this amendment and instead of making it an absolute offence to drive while the concentration of alcohol in the blood is 125 mg. to 100 accepts it as <i>prima facie</i> evidence, I am convinced, from my personal experience as an advocate in the District Courts which deal with this type of prosecution, that he will succeed in convicting the person who should be convicted.  Most advocates will agree that the person who was <Col N="1238" /> charged with drunken driving in the past often got off because he did not go into the witness box.  He invariably got off because the State failed to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case against him. Here we are putting an obligation on the accused person of going into the witness box, or producing other expert evidence to establish that although he had this concentration of alcohol in his blood at the time, he was fit to drive a car.</P>
    <P>I am told on the best medical authority I can get that people react differently to alcohol, that a person might be, and that many people would be impaired if the concentration of alcohol in their blood was 125 to 100. On the other hand, quite a number of people may be perfectly well able to drive a car with that concentration of alcohol.  It is for that reason that I say the Minister should accept the recommendation of the Commission set up by the Minister's predecessor which is, in effect, my amendment, and that he should be satisfied for the time being, at any rate, to make this concentration of alcohol in the blood <i>prima facie</i> evidence only.</P>
    <P>The Commission sent study groups to the Continent; they sent study groups to London.  They examined the position in a number of continental countries where blood tests of one sort or another were in operation, such as Switzerland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden and Denmark.  They studied the position there at first hand. They had the benefit of consultations with the police in those countries who enforce the law.  They had the benefit of seeing the procedure as it was operated in the courts.  Notwithstanding that, they came back and reported to the Minister in favour of <i>prima facie</i> evidence only.</P>
    <P>This blood test is <i>prima facie</i> evidence only in the United States of America, in Denmark, in Switzerland and in the Federal Republic of Germany.  It is true that in some States it is absolute evidence, but in those other States they differ very much from us in our approach to the administration of the criminal law.  I should like to hear the Minister dealing with the <Col N="1239" /> necessity for making this an absolute offence.  I know he will tell us it is a new offence and that the question of whether a man is impaired does not arise, that we are simply going to say that if a person is driving a car, he shall not raise the concentration of alcohol in his blood beyond the level of 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of those who may not appreciate what, in fact, is involved in this 125 millgrammes to 100 millilitres, I want to point out that an analysis which was carried out shows that the consumption of 2¾ pints of stout will produce a concentration of alcohol in excess of 125 to 100.  Many people would probably think 2¾ pints of stout too much to drink, but a great number of people would think this a very moderate amount and that a great many people would be perfectly sober after consuming it. Approximately two glasses of whiskey, or four small whiskeys, will also produce the prohibited concentration.</P>
    <P>As I say, in my opinion, this section is unnecessary.  I am quite prepared to give the Minister an efficient instrument to put the drunken driver off the road.  I want to emphasise again and again that neither I nor my Party stand here to condone the drunken driver.  I do not stand here to say that it should be made easy for the drunken driver to drive and get away with it.  What I am saying is that it is not necessary for the Minister to go as far as he is going: to invade the entire criminal code as we know it in this country, and to violate the Constitution by going as far as he is going.  That is not necessary. It is not necessary to attain the objective which the Minister has in mind, the very laudable objective of eliminating the drunken driver.</P>
    <P>If after some reasonable trial period and after some reasonable experience, the Minister is satisfied that the recommendation of the Commission and my amendment are not sufficient, he is at liberty to come back to the House and ask for the amendment he now asks for.  He is going too far and too soon.  Before I sit down, I want to emphasise again that what I am doing here is seeking to implement the recommendation <Col N="1240" /> of the Commission which reported on driving while under the influence of drink or drugs.  My amendment simply seeks to implement the recommendation of the Commission. The section as drafted by the Minister turns down that recommendation, goes much further than that advice, and seeks to create this new offence.  In my opinion, in so doing, the Minister is invading&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;our criminal code of long standing.  He is introducing a section which, coupled with the other sections about which I will complain later on, will not stand up to the scrutiny of the Supreme Court in the light of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>This, of course, is the fundamental point of difference between Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself, and it is the fundamental thing I am asking for.  The point under discussion is whether or not we should create the new offence of a driver raising his blood-alcohol level to 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, which has been scientifically established as being a dangerous blood-alcohol content for the driver of a mechanically-propelled vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the grave dissatisfaction in Waterford with his decision to provide Waterford Harbour Board with a grant amounting to only 58 per cent of the sum requested and with the limitations as to use imposed; and if he will meet a deputation to further discuss the matter with a view to having the whole situation and the future development of that important port reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy, State grants for harbour improvements to meet new or expanding trade are given only for essential works which cannot be financed otherwise. Waterford Harbour Commissioners sought a grant of £365.000 towards the cost of an improvement scheme consisting of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the reconstruction and extension of the North Wharf at an estimated cost of £430,000, and</P>
      <P>(b)  a new container terminal at an estimated cost of £300,000.</P>
      <P>It emerged that the new container terminal was to be provided for a private consortium on a basis of absolute priority and the exclusion of all competitors. The estimates submitted by the Harbour Commissioners indicated that the terminal should be a fully self-supporting project.  In these circumstances the Government considered that a State grant was neither necessary nor appropriate in respect of the proposed container terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government approved a grant <Col N="1242" /> not exceeding 50 per cent of the cost of the reconstruction and extension of the North Wharf subject to a maximum of £215,000.  These works will provide new deep sea facilities and a container berth intended for the use of the long established British Railways services between Fishguard and Waterford.  It will also provide relief for shipping services using the South Wharf.  The estimates submitted by Waterford Harbour Commissioners showed that the reconstruction of the wharf, as planned, would not be self-supporting and would require State aid.  None of the shipping services using the North Wharf is contributing directly to the cost but will, of course, pay harbour dues.</P>
    <P>The consortium proposes to provide an interest-free loan of £100,000 repayable over 12 years towards the cost of the private container terminal.  The consortium is, I understand, providing the corresponding terminal in Wales at its own expense.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Harbour Commissioners are dissatisfied with the Government decision.  They have asked me to meet them to discuss the whole matter and I have arranged to do so at the end of the month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the people of Waterford are concerned that the State here should apparently be favouring a British State-owned company against the interests of an Irish concern which during several years past has proved a success at Waterford port when in fact the British company were withdrawing services from the port in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to Question No. 1 establishes the fact that the same number of services is being provided by the company which the Deputy says have been withdrawing services.  The question that arises here, and it is a subject which will be discussed by the Minister at his meeting with Waterford Harbour Commissioners, is that of providing services where services would be exclusively for one company to the exclusion of all competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the position now not that State aid is to be provided for a <Col N="1243" /> British concern and that nothing is to be provided for the benefit of a concern which has traffic through Waterford port six times greater than that of the concern the Government are seeking to help?</P>

      <P>The arrangement under which 24 categories of officers in my Department were merged in eight grades of agricultural officer is based on an agreed recommendation made by the official and staff sides in 1955 under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Four of the eight grades are recruitment grades and the other four are mainly promotion and supervisory grades.  While a basic qualification common to all the grades at recruitment is a year's attendance at an agricultural college, additional qualifications, which vary according to the type of work of each grade, are also necessary.</P>
      <P>The appointment of officers to established posts is through the medium of competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  There is, in fact, only a very small number of officers with 25 years' service who have so far failed to secure established appointments.</P>

Does he not agree that this system of breaking up the groups into eight grades and giving the same representation in arbitration and conciliation to a grade with three persons as to a grade representing 400 means, in effect, that <Col N="1246" /> the Department can manipulate the grades in a certain way so that certain people concerned are not getting a fair do?

As I intimated in my reply, it would be open to the corporation to consider whether any particular portions of the canal banks might for special reasons be regarded as dangerous places.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the law as it stands gives the corporation ample power to take action in regard to any portion of the canal which in their opinion is a dangerous place.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The adequacy, and the control of off-street parking facilities in Dublin city is a matter for Dublin Corporation to consider.  The use of parking meters to control kerbside parking can be effected only by bye-laws made by the Commissioner of the Garda, after consultation with the corporation and with my consent. However, I have directed my Department to take a special interest in the Dublin traffic problem and am satisfied that the authorities concerned are taking such steps as are feasible at the moment in order to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parking problem is only part of the general traffic problem, and it would be as pointless to provide parking <Col N="1253" /> space for a volume of traffic which the streets could not take as it would be to provide a street system to move a quantity of vehicles for which parking was not available.

      <P>The Garda authorities expect that when the traffic lights referred to are operative they will have a platooning effect on traffic, thus considerably easing the position for pedestrians and vehicular traffic at other points on the Bray Road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda in Dublin receive special instructions on this matter at the commencement of each tourist season and they do their best to keep the nuisance to a minimum.  I might mention that, in 1966, 89 adults and seven juveniles were prosecuted for begging offences in the central city area.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that recently some American tourists <Col N="1256" /> who arrived here on the floating university informed me that they were badgered persistently by some of these itinerant children?  One girl complained that two or three of these young children attached themselves to her and would not let her go until she had parted with some money.  Another man paid up to get rid of them.  Is the Minister also aware that various complaints have been received from visitors to this country?  It is doing us a lot of harm.  Visitors ask a lot of questions about these people and as to why they are there.  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the adults as well as the children are threatening visitors to this city?  Would he please ask his Department to badger the Garda about preventing this nuisance?  It is creating a very bad image.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement in connection with the imprisonment and reported hunger-strike of James J. Flood of Clonfert, Maynooth, County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>James Flood, aged 54 years, was committed on 9th May to Mountjoy Prison on foot of warrants in default of payment of two fines of £10 each and in default of entering into recognisances to keep the peace in the sum of £25.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1 in respect of the fines was paid to the Governor on his behalf on 11th May.  Since his committal he has given no indication that he is prepared to sign the recognisances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of hunger-strike I wish to record the fact that the Deputy <Col N="1257" /> was informed both orally and in writing on 15th May&mdash;the day I received notice of this Question&mdash;that James Flood was not on hunger strike and that official statements, denying N.F.A. publicity in that regard, had already been published in the daily papers.  Far from being on hunger-strike, James Flood has been consuming&mdash;in addition to substantial quantities of milk&mdash;bovril, beef extract, tea, egg-flips and cheese.</P>
    <P>The Prison Medical Officer is satisfied that there has been no deterioration in James Flood's medical condition since committal; as a precautionery measure, which is usual when prisoners are committed with a history of ill-health, the Medical Officer sent him to an outside hospital for examination and, as a result, he is fully satisfied that the prisoner is fit to serve his sentence.</P>
    <P>I might add that, if this man or any other member of the NFA in prison were to go on hunger-strike, the entire responsibility would rest on certain leaders of the NFA who have been openly claiming the right to tell their members whether they are or are not to comply with orders of the courts and have been misleading them into engaging in anti-social behaviour by active and passive resistance to the law of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why I was refused permission to see Mr. Flood?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in that regard is that the normal conditions regarding visits are being adhered to. This prisoner was granted a special visit by his son.  He had already received visits from his daughter and his wife, and, in accordance with the normal procedure, no further visits were allowed.  I might add that Deputy Boylan also sought permission for a special visit but was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He sought permission for a special visit for someone else.  Will the Minister say why the practice that has been in operation since the State was founded that a Deputy would always be allowed to <Col N="1258" /> visit a prison has been refused in any case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No such practice has been in operation.  The normal procedure in regard to visits to prisoners is being adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that the Minister for Justice is not here because he knows that he said it was the normal practice.  It is not, I know, permissible at Question Time to quote but, in fact, the Minister for Justice used the exact words that I used a moment ago, on 28th February, when he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I might mention that it has been the practice of every Minister for Justice in every Government since the foundation of the State to extend to every Deputy the courtesy of visiting prisons on application to the Minister for Justice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach now say why, when I applied in writing to the Minister, in fulfilment of his statement on 28th February, the courtesy accorded to every Deputy in this House since the State was founded was not accorded on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of the Deputy's application until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach take steps, therefore, to ensure that his Minister for Justice honours the undertaking he gave to this House, an undertaking, may I say, that was also repeated on 1st March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I only interfere with Minister if they seem to transgress their responsibility.  I do not think he has done so in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, do I understand the Taoiseach to say that he is prepared to allow his Minister for Justice to be proved a person of no word, as can be proved from the replies to these questions, and is he satisfied that a Minister of State should refuse to honour an undertaking that has been given to Dáil Éireann that elected him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the question in my own way.  All this man has to do is to ignore the unwise advice which has been tendered to him and obey the jurisdiction of the court and sign the recognisances which the court asked him to enter into.  The moment he does that, he will be released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely a <Col N="1260" /> matter for the court.  It is the court which has ordered that this man shall sign a recognisance.  If he refuses to sign that recognisance, as this man has so unwisely done, then the Minister and the Garda have no option but to keep him in prison until such time as he signs the recognisance or until such time as the court directs otherwise.</P>

      <P>I have recently set up a committee to review the provision made for the education of deaf and partially deaf children and to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>One of the matters which the committee will be considering will be the question of the provision of a school for the deaf in Cork.  I propose, accordingly, to await the report of the committee before giving further consideration to this matter.</P>

There is a very big difference.  In view of the fact that the facilities are there and the children are there, would the Minister not reconsider the decision he has made?

      <P>There is already a special class for profoundly deaf children in Greenmount national school, Cork, and the question of a special school for the profoundly deaf has been raised on several occasions, though this school was not previously suggested as the location for such a school. <Col N="1261" /> The view of the Department is that there are three residential schools for the deaf: St. Joseph's Cabra, St. Mary's, Cappagh and Mary Immaculate for Junior Boys, Stillorgan, and that any advantages which a large school in Cork could afford would be far outweighed by the disadvantages. I may say that the matter is one for consideration by this new committee, and there are two representatives of the Cork Association for the Deaf on this body.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that in reply to a question on this matter last week, I referred to the fact that interest rates are declining at the moment and that there is, therefore, a <i>prima facie</i> case to justify the allegation that the building societies should not have increased their rates, but it is only a <i>prima facie</i> case until the matter has been investigated thoroughly.</P>

It may be that in a certain limited class of cases I may have some power, but certainly over the whole range, there is no such statutory power.  It might also be the case that such power will not be necessary.  If it were to be the outcome of the inquiry that their increased rates were considered unjustified an indication to that effect to the building societies might be sufficient to get them to toe the line.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the new section be there inserted&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, the point we are discussing now is whether or not this new offence which I am asking the Dáil to create should be created.  It is my proposition that we should decide that it be an offence for a person who is driving to have previously raised his blood-alcohol content to a level of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  I am making that suggestion because it has been scientifically and definitely established that in the vast majority of cases, if not in all cases, anybody who raises his blood-alcohol content to that level is impaired in his capacity to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that there may be cases of people who can take this risk and still not be impaired in their driving ability.  There may, and there may not.  But even experienced and practised drinkers cannot say with certainty that, because on nine occasions out of ten, they can take this risk without impairing their driving ability, on every occasion, irrespective of the conditions in <Col N="1265" /> which they take this risk, their driving ability is not impaired.  Even if they could say that with certainty, I still think it justifiable to provide that they will not take this risk or, if they insist on taking it, that they will be deprived of the privilege of driving a mechanically-propelled vehicle on the roads.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick says that this is inconsistent; the Commission recommended in favour of this being only <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  That is so, but I think it is quite clear from the Commission's report that the Commission's advice was related to its assessment of the state of public opinion in 1963 and, whatever the state of public opinion in 1963, whether the public were or were not prepared to accept this as an offence, is, of course, a matter of opinion.  I am quite satisfied that, in the meantime, public opinion has progressed and, with every day that passes and with every fresh fatality or serious accident on the roads, the public are more and more inclined to demand protection from those who take the terrible risk of putting themselves into a condition in which they are not fit to drive a motor vehicle.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the public are now prepared to accept this new condition that such people will not drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle when they have taken the risk of raising their blood-alcohol content to this level.  As I have said, I do not argue that everybody whose blood-alcohol content exceeds this level is necessarily unfit to drive, but I say it has been scientifically established that practically everybody in this condition is unfit to drive.  In view of the risk involved in driving a motor vehicle in such circumstances, it is quite justifiable for us to provide that any person who intends to drive must not take the risk of raising his or her blood-alcohol content to this dangerous level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick argues that this is unconstitutional but, although he has placed such reliance on the Commission's advice to make this only <i>prima facie</i> evidence, at least in the <Col N="1266" /> initial stages, he has ignored the fact that the Commission have also said that the making of this an absolute offence would, in their opinion, not be in conflict with the Constitution. I should like to point out that the figures with regard to drink intake which Deputy Fitzpatrick quoted are minimum figures and were applicable to a man weighing 11 stone, who was fasting, and who drank the amounts mentioned very quickly.  More realistic figures can be obtained from other sections of the report, as Deputy Fitzpatrick will discover if he looks through the report.</P>
    <P>The Commission did not rule out the introduction of a system, such as I propose here, at some future date. They merely considered that, at the time of the report, it was unlikely to be accepted widely by the public, in their opinion.  I think the situation has changed since then.  The experience in Britain has shown that the use of the blood-alcohol level as evidence, but not as conclusive evidence, has had little effect, because, as the White Paper issued by the British Government in 1965 pointed out, conviction still depends to a large extent on evidence of the accused's manner of driving, or his personal appearance and behaviour, and because some courts still ask to have the blood-alcohol level translated into the amount of drink the driver must have consumed, it is an unreliable and misleading procedure at the best of times.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of this are, as I have said, that at this level the driving ability of the great majority will be seriously impaired and the community is entitled to say that a person whose blood-alcohol level exceeds 125 milligrammes should not and may not drive.  If this level is to be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence only, then we will have to fall back on evidence based on clinical examination, observation, and so on.  In other words, we will be back exactly to where we are at present.  The whole intention of this section is to establish a definite test, which is not to be taken as evidence that a person is drunk, but as evidence that he or she is not in a fit condition to drive a mechanically-propelled <Col N="1267" /> vehicle.  That is quite a different thing. If there are exceptional individuals who can put themselves into this condition, and still be fit to drive, I do not think we should worry about them, particularly when we remember that they may not retain this facility for the whole of their lives or may not retain it in all circumstances.  Obviously their capacity will deteriorate with long practice.</P>
    <P>As I said, so far as I am concerned, this is a fundamental proposition.  One is either for or against.  If it is rejected, we will be back exactly where we are now; these cases will be decided on the basis of clinical examination and observation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a healthy society, people prefer to see a guilty man go free rather than see an innocent man convicted.  That is a cardinal principle any healthy society will support.  When we see the Government proposing to depart from that cardinal principle, we deem it our duty to warn where that departure will bring us.  It will bring us to the servile State.  It will create a society in which innocent people will be deemed guilty of having committed an offence.  While we join with the Minister and with all who wish to discourage drunken driving, or driving which is impaired because of the consumption of alcohol, we feel that the wrong way to go about curing the situation is by convicting innocent people and treating as criminals people who have done no wrong.  The Minister has stated that the optional procedure in Britain has not been successful.  He did not say why.  He might have added that it has not been successful in increasing the number of convictions, as though convictions were something to be boasted of.  The Minister said that, in England, still, the behaviour and appearance of accused persons are a relevant factor in determining their guilt.  I think that is perfectly unacceptable and that each person should be judged on the merits of his case.  Depart from that and we automatically accept that the innocent are guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick when he spoke about this proposal <Col N="1268" /> being repugnant to human rights but I am not at one with him in the view that it is necessarily unconstitutional. Our Constitution has been declared by the courts to be a most imperfect weapon for the protection of fundamental rights.  There are some rights which are spelled out in detail in the Constitution but even those are qualified by various factors such as &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good&rdquo; which has been described as a figure of speech the meaning and application of which can change from generation to generation.  I think it can change a few times within a generation.</P>
    <P>There are many fundamental rights which healthy communities take for granted and most of these are not spelled out in the Constitution at all. The right to life, the right to breathe: things like that are so part and parcel of nature that they are not in the Constitution.  I think the right of an innocent person or of any person to be presumed innocent until proved guilty is fundamental but it is not specified in the Constitution.  If it were, then some of the legislation passed by this House and the Seanad down through the years would long since have been declared repugnant.</P>
    <P>People sometimes say something is unconstitutional when, in fact, they mean it is repugnant to their conception of fundamental rights.  Let us not fall into the trap into which many of our predecessors fell of presuming that if we are wrong then the courts can correct us.  The courts can correct us only within the scope of the Constitution. The courts cannot go outside the Constitution even where the courts feel the Constitution has not been explicit enough.  The courts are confined by the verbiage and phraseology of the Constitution.  They can go no further than that.</P>
    <P>It is because I feel that the courts will be unable to find in the Constitution the power to condemn this particular proposal that I think we have a duty here not to adopt what the Minister wants us to adopt, namely, to condemn everybody simply because most people, within the limit he is providing, would be incapable of driving. <Col N="1269" /> On the Minister's own admission, there would be some people still incapable of driving who had not consumed that much.  He should find some formula to persuade people not to drive who are incapable of driving, or unsafe, when driving after drink, if they drink, then not to drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other part of section 28 on which I should like the Minister to answer one or two questions.  It mentions &ldquo;within three hours after so driving or attempting to drive&rdquo;.  Here, section 28 is not as explicit as section 27 which begins as follows: &ldquo;Whenever a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place ...&rdquo; Here, there is no mention of &ldquo;a public place&rdquo;.  Does that mean in the case of a man who has been out drinking and who arrives home at, say, 11 p.m.&mdash; maybe he has not been drinking at all &mdash;that, if somebody has seen him pass along some road and considered he was driving dangerously, then, at 11.30 p.m. for example, a garda could knock at his door and ask him to submit to a breathaliser test?  Have the Garda the right to call at a man's house in such circumstances and to test him for having taken a drink? If, within three hours of being reported to have been driving dangerously, he does not pass the breathaliser test then that is it and he is brought down to the station.  I should like clarification of that by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister concedes that, in insisting on section 28 of the Bill as he has introduced it, he is going against his own Commission or his predecessor's Commission on Driving While Under the Influence of Drink which reported against the Minister's proposal.  He goes on to suggest that some change has taken place in public thinking since the Commission reported on 15th May, 1963.  As far as I can ascertain, the members of the Commission&mdash;any of them who have expressed their view-point on it in public, at any rate&mdash;think now as they thought then.  I wish to quote the Reverend D.P. Kennedy, S.J., who is President of the Safety First <Col N="1270" /> Association of Ireland and who was a member of the Commission about which I have spoken.  In the course of his address to CIE drivers at the Safety First Association's presentation of awards, the President of the Association. Rev. Denis P. Kennedy, S.J., welcomed the introduction of the new Road Traffic Bill.</P>
      <P>Father Kennedy went on to say that, despite the fact that the present Road Traffic Act is but five years old a new Act becomes necessary if the findings of the Commission on &ldquo;Driving While under the Influence of Drink or a Drug&rdquo; are to be implemented.  That Commission was established by the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Neil T. Blaney, in September, 1961. One year and eight months later (May, 1963), the Commission submitted its Report to the Minister. The present Bill departs in at least one vital detail from the recommendations of the Commission.  The Bill proposed to make it an offence to drive or be in charge of a vehicle while there is a specified concentration of alcohol in the blood.  The Commission did not recommend that it be made an offence to drive while the blood-alcohol exceeded a certain level but that the specified level should be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the accused person was unfit to drive.  I hope that Deputies in Dáil Éireann will make very careful study of the difference between the two suggestions and find out just why the Minister proposes to depart from the Commission's recommendation on so vital a point.  As a member of the Commission, I am aware of the serious deliberation and detailed discussion that determined the Commission to favour <i>prima facie</i> evidence of unfitness rather than make it an offence to drive in such condition.</P>
      <P>I am quoting from a supplied copy of Father Kennedy's speech in November, 1966, at the presentation of Safe Driving Awards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is evidence that at least some members of the Commission think now, as they thought then, that the better way of dealing with this problem of drink and driving, which I readily admit is a problem which needs to be dealt with, is to declare this certain percentage of alcohol in the blood as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of being unfit to drive and to impose on a person with that percentage of alcohol in the blood the obligation of satisfying a court of law that at the time he was driving, notwithstanding the amount of alcohol he had taken, he was fit to drive.  The evidence he would have to produce would be the evidence of an expert, of a medical practitioner, who would say that from tests carried out on this individual he was satisfied that he was fit and well able to drive.</P>
      <P>We cannot deal with this amendment or with section 28 without having a look at the following section.  Section 28 proposes to make it an absolute offence for a person to consume so much alcohol that the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeds 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres of blood.  It follows that in order to ascertain whether that concentration is there or not, certain tests must be carried out, and section 29 gives us those tests.  It imposes an absolute obligation on a man who has been arrested to give a specimen of his urine or of his blood: in certain circumstances, he must give a specimen of his blood.  It goes on to say that a person who refuses to give a specimen of his blood shall be guilty of an offence under section 29 which carries the very same penalties as drunken driving at present.  A man who refuses to give a sample of his blood for analysis shall be guilty of an offence, which carries with it the penalties of heavy fines, imprisonment and disqualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my amendment is accepted, we can get over that difficulty.  All Members of this House, with few exceptions, <Col N="1273" /> will agree that it is undesirable that a man should be compelled to produce evidence to convict himself, that a man should be compelled to give a sample of his blood, and that if he does not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I appreciate that.  I said we cannot deal effectively with section 28 without looking ahead to see what flows from it. If you get rid of section 28 and accept my modification, section 29 will not be necessary in its present from.  I was saying that most Members will agree that it is undesirable that a man should be made to produce evidence to convict himself and should be liable to conviction, fine and imprisonment for failure to give a specimen of his blood. It is not a trickle of blood out of his ear which is required but a couple of ounces of blood which will be extracted by a minor surgical operation.  Many people with the best will in the world would not be capable of giving that amount of blood without fainting.  That is not their fault; it is the way they are made.  My suggestion is that section 28 be amended to make it <i>prima facie</i> evidence and to shift the onus of proof on to the accused.  If it is accepted, you can get over the grave objectionable feature of section 29 which makes a man convict himself and makes him liable to imprisonment for failure to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the failure of a person under section 29 to give a specimen of his blood should not be an offence at all and certainly should not be an offence carrying the penalty of imprisonment. This would shift on to him the onus of going into the witness box and producing satisfactory evidence that he was capable of driving the car on the occasion.  If this solution is accepted, it will get over these two very difficult sections.  There are a number of lawyers in the House at present and I want to repeat what I said before, that in the past failure to convict a person charged with driving a car while drunk was usually due to the fact that the State could not establish a <i>prima facie</i><Col N="1274" /> case against the accused, could not place before the court sufficient evidence to put the onus on the accused to show that he was fit to drive.  That has been my experience, speaking as an advocate, and I am sure it has been the experience of many others.  Once the onus of proof is shifted on to the accused person to show that he was sober, then unless he was really and truly sober, he has no chance of proving it.</P>
    <P>That is what I am trying to do here, to shift the onus on to the accused person in the circumstances, one, in regard to the concentration of alcohol in the blood complained of and, two, in regard to his failure to submit to a blood test.  In either of those cases, it is over to him to produce satisfactory evidence to the court to prove that he was not a drunken driver, that he was not a danger to other road users, that he had complete control of the car and was able to drive it properly and safely in a public place.  In putting forward this solution to an admittedly difficult problem.  I am giving the Minister an alternative; I am not simply shooting down the Minister's proposition without saying what should be acceptable in its place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the last to support any legislation which would endanger the innocent in any way, but in this case anyone who wishes to protect himself from proceedings under this Bill when it becomes an Act has a very obvious course open to him, namely, to take no alcohol before driving.  It is as easy as that.  If a driver, gratuitously and freely of his own will, takes alcoholic liquor before driving, he is taking a risk to himself and he is also taking a risk which will involve other people.  It is not just a matter of being kind to the innocent. We are dealing with human life and the danger to life and limb.  It is far better that we should face the fact that it is in the interests of the whole community that people should not drink when taking control of a mechanically propelled vehicle on the road or that if they do, they should, quite properly, to my mind, leave themselves open to proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan talked about the <Col N="1275" /> optional system in England where he said it was much preferable to try each case on its merits but the trouble in dealing with cases such as this is that it has to come in the end to a matter of opinion, the opinion of the garda that the accused is unfit to drive and the opinion of a medical practitioner that the accused is fit to drive.  It was in the face of this conflict of opinions that the courts, properly, I think, had to say: &ldquo;We shall give the benefit of the doubt properly to the accused; we cannot establish the facts and so the accused must have the benefit of the doubt,&rdquo; and therefore the prosecution failed, even though the judge or justice might have more than a suspicion that the defendant was in fact guilty of the offence with which he was charged.</P>
    <P>We must come down to some sort of standard and I am not aware that Deputy Fitzpatrick or Deputy Ryan ever made any objection to speed limits on the ground that some people might be improperly convicted on the charge of exceeding the speed limit, even though they were not driving dangerously.  I think it is agreed that it is not necessarily dangerous driving to drive at 45 mph in a 40 mph area. It may be dangerous or it may not.  In certain circumstances, it might possibly be the case that a driver would be driving dangerously at 20 miles an hour in a 40 mph area.  We must try to establish some standard and so, rightly or wrongly, and to my mind, rightly, we say that in certain areas motorists must not exceed a certain speed and if they do, they are guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy, if you keep your eyes open and restrain your impatience, to avoid exceeding a speed limit.  Here in section 28 we have made it perfectly clear that we are not out to establish a charge of drunkenness.  What we want to establish is that a standard has been set up for the amount of alcohol in the blood which can safely be carried.  If you like, that is an arbitrary figure.  Personally, I think there is considerable evidence to show that the proportion of alcohol permissible in the blood is, if anything, rather on the high side but I am not unduly worried <Col N="1276" /> about that because there is nobody who will readily be able to ascertain in advance what will be the effect on his blood of the consumption of two small ones, two large ones, three pints or so on.  It depends on so many other factors.  We cannot say one would be quite safe in having three pints before driving.  That is very good because if a motorist is in doubt whether he may have three pints or two pints or one pint, I think that is a very strong inducement to him to have no pint at all until he gets home, if he must have one.</P>
    <P>We must get away from the uncertainty of the law as it stands.  We must get away from the clash of opinion, whether lay or medical, as to the suitability or unsuitability of being in charge of a vehicle.  I suppose it would be ideal if you could readily establish a standard of ability to drive but that is just not possible.  I do not agree with the Commission in their suggestion that the alcohol content of blood should be merely a <i>prima facie</i> indication because if that is all it will be, we shall be back to a clash of opinion again.  It is far better, I think, that we should take the bull by the horns and say: &ldquo;There is a standard and if you are found to have exceeded that alcohol content in your blood, you have committed an offence.  It does not necessarily mean that you are drunk but you will have committed a technical offence for which you will be punished.&rdquo; I do not think that is any infringement of human liberty or anything else, when the obvious remedy lies in the hands of the individual.  If he wants to protect himself against proceedings, he just lays off the drink when he wants to drive.  It is as easy as that.  It is not a thing a man can be talked into unintentionally; he drinks only if he wants to drink.  If he wants to protect himself, let him lay off the drink in his own interest and in the interests of other road users.  We must not be concerned with considerations of convenience or otherwise. Actual life is at stake and even one life is well worth saving.</P>

      <P>I feel inclined to agree with much of what Deputy Booth has said but I think that even what he <Col N="1277" /> suggests is not necessary, if what we are told is correct, because the alcohol content laid down here is, I understand, almost double that required in certain continental countries.  If that is so, a man would need to be fairly well soused before he would be in the position that he could be convicted of being under the influence.</P>

      <P>My recollection was that the Minister agreed that could happen.  If the Minister now says that cannot happen, I should like him to explain how, or in what way, such a person is protected under this section. I have no desire to protect the drunken driver who is in charge of a vehicle and who, because he is under the influence of drink, is a menace to every other road user and a menace to himself, but I should not like the situation to arise in which a person who had been driving a motor vehicle <Col N="1278" /> in a perfectly normal manner and who, after returning to his home and having a few drinks, could, within three hours, be challenged by a garda to prove that he was not drunk.  That, in effect, appears to be the way in which section 28 can be read.  Now the Minister has a different interpretation of it and I should like to hear it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>Unfortunately, Bills have been passed through this House before and when Deputies were talking on them they were under one impression but subsequently even district justices took a different interpretation from that which any Deputy in the House thought would be taken. That is why I would like to ensure in regard to this Bill that sort of thing will not happen again.</P>
      <P>Let me be quite definite on this.  As far as this Party are concerned and I am quite sure as far as Members of the House in general are concerned, it is agreed that the man who drives under the influence of drink should, in fact, be held responsible.  I cannot agree with the argument made by the Fine Gael Deputies to the effect that a man should not be forced to give evidence against himself.  In fact, if he is charged with drunken driving at present the fact that he is drunk and his reactions will be counted as evidence against him anyway.  As I am not involved in the legal end of this, I am not going to try to interpret the niceties which they apparently feel would turn the whole situation.  If the Minister is satisfied that this section does not catch the person who has his drink after he has stopped driving then I feel the section as it is a perfectly reasonable one.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not think there is anybody in the House who approves of anybody getting into a car and driving it while he is unfit to drive due to the consumption of alcohol.  Nobody would stand over that and nobody is trying to defend it.  Deputy Dowling came in here and spoke about the massacre of infants and elderly people in the streets of this country.  Nobody stands over that.  Nobody is trying to defend it but we want to ensure that people who are able to drive and who are not drunk, whose judgment is not impaired as a result of the consumption of intoxicating liquor, are entitled to drive.  I think Deputy Booth got to the heart of this matter when he said that if the Bill went through the only safe precaution for any motorist who was driving was not to drink.  That is one point of view and Deputy Booth is quite entitled to it.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the country will accept that.  I do not believe that if you pass a measure prohibiting a person from driving if he has any alcohol taken it will command public respect or that it will be observed. Assuming you are going to let people drink something, that you are going to allow people to drink in moderation and to drive you are in my opinion imposing an impossible burden on them by this section because, as we have been told, and it is scientifically admitted, the same quantity of alcohol will react differently on different people.  A given quantity of alcohol may produce a level of 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres in one person but it will not produce any such level in another person.  How is a man going to know?</P>

He may be driving his car in a perfectly normal manner but under this section he may be disqualified from driving for 12 months at least.  That is not reasonable and it is not necessary.  You are making the consumption of alcohol <i>prima facie</i> evidence and it is going the wrong way because you are then going to shift on to the accused person the very considerable onus of subjecting himself to very considerable medical evidence that he has a certain level of alcohol in his blood but that his judgment and his ability to drive were not impaired.  You must either do that or accept Deputy Booth's suggestion and say that you must not drink if you are driving.  That will commend itself to a lot of people but it will not commend itself to a great many others. I do not think it would command respect in this age when a car is really such an important thing in everyday life.  If the Minister would, even at this late stage, agree to reconsider this matter without any loss of face and prestige and get on the Statute Book a measure that will do its work and be respected and which will not really create an entirely new position as far as our criminal code is concerned, he will be doing a very good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the three hours was referred to, so I will just make a few general remarks on it. As a result of the Second Stage speech, I read this section in conjunction with the Principal Act and it is now clear from that that the fear which I expressed on Second Stage, and which was expressed by Deputy Tully and Deputy Briscoe this afternoon, does not arise.  There are some other matters in connection with this which I can take up when moving my own amendment.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Minister's reply on Second Stage, I re-examined the Bill in the light of the fact that the Minister says we are creating a new offence.  This offence was not that you were drunk.  It is evidence, so that if you have so much alcohol in your bloodstream, you are guilty of a new and separate offence.  On that I should like to go along with Deputy Booth's analogy about speed limits.  If you are driving at 45 miles per hour in a 40-mile zone and no danger to anybody, you have committed an offence under the laws applying to that particular section of the road.  In the case of a man who breaks the speed limit, a man who is convicted of dangerous driving, the penalities are quite different.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of the amendment I put down is to say that I will accept this Bill on this basis; if you have now a new offence and this offence is something less than being drunk, then penalties must be something less than those attaching to conviction for drunken driving.  Then, being found guilty on this evidence means that this can be given in evidence, or, as Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment sets out, if a person has to give samples of his blood, urine or breath, the findings can be used in evidence in any subsequent prosecution, and to make it an offence to refuse to give these samples is contrary to the old concept of the Constitution and contrary to all the precepts of justice we have in this State, that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> There can be good reasons for a man not wishing to take such tests.  I, for one, would not undergo a breathaliser test because any evidence I have been able to obtain in regard to this test has shown that it can be totally inaccurate and I would not take a risk with a machine that is not reliable.  I certainly do not think I should take such a risk.  In live cover in a television programme, this test was proved to be inaccurate. I would have great reluctance to submit myself to a blood test.  I suffer from allergies.  I had an accident some years ago and I had to have a tetanus injection, and I suffered as a result for some two or three weeks.  I am also allergic to sticking plaster and I do not think I would submit to any doctor.  I would want my own practitioner who understands my particular case.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, I doubt if the Constitution would deny me the right to refuse to urinate in any police station at the behest of any garda.  Between the Minister and Deputy Fitzpatrick, we have a problem.  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests that there should not be a new offence but that evidence would be taken which could be used in a case of drunken driving.  The Minister, on the other hand, wants a new offence.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's argument for a new offence, provided the penalties for that offence are lesser than the penalties for the offence of drunken driving.  Having got that evidence does not prevent the garda taking steps to proceed with a more serious charge at a later stage.</P>
    <P>If we accept the Minister's point of view for a new offence then I say the penalties are completely out of proportion because a man can be perfectly sober and perfectly capable of handling his car, in carrying on his normal social routine, and he can be stopped and found guilty of a new offence and subsequently found guilty in court, if the content of alcohol found in his blood, if he submits to the test, can be produced as evidence to show that he had so much alcohol in his blood.  It is up to the person so charged to show that even if he had this amount of alcohol in his bloodstream he was perfectly capable of driving, and to ask for and be given the right to go through <Col N="1283" /> other tests to establish whether he was capable of driving a car.</P>
    <P>I think the laws already in existence are adequate.  I believe the accident rate here and the death rate on the roads per road mile for everybody are among the lowest in the world.  Trying to copy countries which have brought in legislation which is not respected and not properly observed by the people creates tension.  International statistics have shown that where there is tension in a society, the accident rate goes up in relation to that degree of tension.  I suggest to the Minister that a driver drunk or sober should be regarded as innocent until he is proved guilty.  If a man refuses to give a sample of his blood, urine or breath, this can be taken as evidence and then the court can form its own conclusion. But to say that to so refuse is an offence will not stand up on constitutional grounds.  I believe that somewhere between what the Minister proposes and what Deputy Fitzpatrick proposes, there is a solution.  If necessary, we should spend a great deal of time here to try to find where that solution lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the points raised by Deputy Ryan first.  He says that he believes that everybody would prefer to see a guilty man go free than an innocent man convicted. The point is that there is no question whatever of this section resulting in an innocent man being convicted.  This is not being put forward, as I have said on a number of occasions, as a test for drunkenness.  It is not to establish that a man is a drunken driver.  A person convicted of having a blood-alcohol level exceeding the maximum will not necessarily be convicted of being drunk but will be convicted of this new offence.  That is the fundamental thing.</P>

    <P>From the enactment of this Bill it will be an offence to raise the blood-alcohol content to the level of 125 milligrammes to 100 millimetres of blood and then proceed to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle.  In other words, a person who drives a car after he has raised his blood-alcohol content to this level will be committing <Col N="1284" /> an offence and will be deemed to be unfit to drive a vehicle.  Such a person may be innocent of being drunk in the sense accepted at present, but that is not the point.  He will be guilty of this new offence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of this being an interference with fundamental rights, I maintain that nobody has a fundamental right to drive a car.  I maintain that nobody has a fundamental right to do so any more than he has a fundamental right to possess, or to use a firearm, or to make his own whiskey.  These things can be only done under licence, and very properly so.  I am asking the Dáil to say that a person who takes this risk of raising his blood-alcohol content to this level may not drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asks why I have departed from the Commission's recommendations. I said that it is a scientifically established fact that the vast majority of people, if not, indeed, everybody, will not be fit to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle after consuming alcohol to such an extent that the content in the blood reaches the level specified here.  Because of that fact, I consider it my duty, as Minister for Local Government, to ensure that people who are in that position will not drive, whether drunk in the normally accepted sense of the word or not, and I quite concede that they may not be drunk in the normally accepted sense of the word.  The proposal by Deputy Fitzpatrick will, for all practical purposes, leave the situation as it is: it will be a matter for clinical examination, or observation, as to a person's behaviour and, then, it will be on such evidence that cases will be decided.</P>
    <P>What I am asking the Dáil to do here is to create this new offence of raising the blood-alcohol content to this dangerous level and then proceeding to drive.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said he does not approve of anybody who is unfit driving.  The question to be decided here is when is a person unfit? The fact is that unfitness to carry out this very serious action of driving a car is not always visually detectable: an experienced man may be able to conceal it and, even though he is not <Col N="1285" /> making any definite effort to conceal it, the fact is an experienced drinker may not show any signs of his driving ability being adversely affected, his ability to drive, as distinct from his ability to talk, walk or perform any of the other normal actions.  But it has been scientifically established that in practically all cases a person who raises his blood-alcohol content to even a much lower level than this will be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass suggests that because this is a separate offence, it is necessarily also a lesser offence and there should be a lesser penalty for it.  I do not agree; the danger arising from committing this offence is the same as the danger arising from driving a car while drunk: the possible outcome for the driver himself, his passengers and for innocent members of the public is the same.  It is equally necessary in the public interest that this offence of consuming alcohol to this extent should not be committed.  Therefore, I think the penalty must be the same. The only country in Europe which has an arrangement such as Deputy Lemass suggested is Sweden and there the level for the lower offence is only 50 milligrammes per 100 millilitres. But the offence we are proposing to create here is a blood-alcohol content of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.</P>
    <P>I have admitted here that it may be there are some people who would be fit to drive at that blood-alcohol content level.  I am saying that only because it may be; but it is not by any means certain that anybody is fit to drive at this blood-alcohol content level.  It is not certain that there is anybody whose driving ability will not be impaired at this level, and the British Medical Association said it is extremely doubtful if anybody with a level of 80 milligrammes or more could drive with his normal ability. Therefore, in other words, it is doubtful if there is anybody who can take this risk and still drive safely.</P>
    <P>Deputies Briscoe and Tully referred to the question of the test being carried out three hours afterwards.  The difficulty here is that this section is an amendment of section 49 of the Principal Act.  Therefore, it should be <Col N="1286" /> read only in conjunction with that Act, and section 49 of the 1961 Act does relate the offence to its taking place in a public place.  I dealt with this on Second Reading.  Deputy Tully seemed to think what I said on Second Reading was to the effect that the garda could test somebody two or three hours after the alleged offence had been committed. For the benefit of Deputy Tully, I think I should quote what I did say; it is in Volume 227.  No. 6 of the Dáil Debates, at column 1029:</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also dealt at length with what will happen to a person who drives home at 11 o'clock and after he arrives home takes a few drinks.  He seemed to think that a garda could forcibly enter that person's house at 1 a.m. and require him to undergo a preliminary breath test and possibly even arrest him for this offence of driving while under the influence of drink although it was two hours previously that he had, in fact, driven home.  This, of course, is completely out of the question.  A person can he required to undergo a preliminary breath test only if he is in charge of a vehicle in a public place. A garda, therefore, cannot come to a man's house some hours after he has been driving and ask him to undergo this preliminary test and, in fact, in such circumstances a garda would not have any power forcibly to enter the man's house.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think I did make it clear on Second Reading that this offence is clearly related to driving, or attempting to drive, in a public place, but there is no question of a man being tested two or 2½ hours after he arrives home.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister, Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment appeals to me now more than the Bill, as it stands: Take the case of a man who has a certain social habit and, for the past 20 years, was in the habit of meeting friends, say, once a week&mdash;be he playing cards or just in the local pub&mdash;and has consumed, one day a week, every week, for the past 20 years sufficient drink to make him guilty of this offence, has <Col N="1287" /> driven home and is perfectly capable of driving his car, not affected in any way whatsoever, he has caused nobody any trouble and has been doing this for years and years.  Now he is stopped. He is not found to be drunk; he is perfectly competent to drive his car but he is guilty of an offence of having a certain quantity of alcohol in his blood stream, and he loses his licence.</P>
      <P>While I go along with the Minister in creating a new offence, I think we can only go along with him, provided this offence is a slightly less serious one than that of being drunk; but to make this compulsory without a person being found guilty of being drunk is totalitarian nonsense, in my opinion, if we are going to create this new offence. The Minister clearly said in his statement that the man may not be drunk at all : he may be perfectly competent to drive his car.  He said it is highly unlikely that most people would be able to, but certain people, with experience and so on, might be perfectly competent to drive a car.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to take the Minister up on one point.  The Minister says that if my amendment is accepted, we will be back to where we were before this Bill was introduced.  With all respect, the Minister knows that this is not so. As the law stands at the moment, the <Col N="1288" /> onus is on the prosecution to prove that a man is drunk within the meaning of the section, that his judgment is impaired. If my amendment is accepted, when this Bill becomes law, the onus will be on the accused person to prove that he is sober, that his judgment has not been impaired and that he is able to drive a car.  I ask the House to agree with me that that is a substantial change in the law, that it is a substantial shifting of the onus and that it will make it much easier for the State to get a conviction and much more difficult for a guilty person to get away, if not impossible.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am putting it to the House that it is a substantial change in the law and I suggest that it is obvious to anyone who has experience in the courts of this type of prosecution that it is bound to make it much easier to get a conviction and much more difficult to get an acquittal.  It seems to me to be fundamentally wrong to create a serious offence which carries very heavy penalties and at the same time, to leave the law that a man will not know whether he is in fact committing an offence or not until he has been arrested and tested, and that is what the law will be.  It is all right for anybody to go in behind Deputy Booth and say: &ldquo;If you drink, do not drive&rdquo;. That is a point of view.  You at least know where you stand and the people who are going out know where they stand, but if this measure here becomes law, you say: &ldquo;Yes, you can drink at your own peril&rdquo;.  One would nearly want the equivalent of an accurate breathaliser attached to the motor car of each person who takes a drink so that when he is stepping into his car, he can check and see how he is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully has left the House but he seemed to have got the impression <Col N="1289" /> that in order to produce the concentration of alcohol complained of one would have to have spent a pretty debauched evening, one would have to have consumed a tremendous amount of alcohol.  That is not so because 2¾ pints of stout in some people will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;will create the concentration complained of, and, I think, four small whiskeys.  We should be realistic about this thing.  This, I am sure, is a continental introduction here and, as I was forced to say on Second Reading, another example of a continental Act to deal with Irish situations which did not work was the Succession Bill.  It had to be torn limb from limb and section from section and part from part and recast or it would have put the Government out of office.  There is adequate time yet to discuss this in a realistic way and to reconsider the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a certain amount of confusion about what is involved here and it might be no harm to get away from, first of all, the misconception that we are dealing with what one might call drunkenness in its moral or any other aspect.  We are dealing solely with the question of ability to drive and the safety of the public, and, indeed, of the person drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go along with Deputy Booth and we must accept the point which the Minister makes in the Bill that this is a separate offence.  Is it right that there should be this offence?  Personally I feel it is.  It removes all doubts.  It is as simple as this: the onus is on a person who drives a motor car to be in a fit, responsible position for so driving; if he takes the wheel of the car the onus is on him to be capable of performing the duty he has undertaken, namely, the duty to drive.  As the Minister points out, there are no constitutional rights otherwise.  Our question, therefore, is simply how to enforce that duty.  If the person has a <Col N="1290" /> duty and it is a definite duty of responsibility here, there is no use reducing the problem afterwards to the whole question of opinion, to getting confused with moral problems in regard to drunkenness.  A fairly simple test is needed.</P>
    <P>It is known that if the alcohol content in the individual goes beyond a certain level, on the average the driving capacity of the person will be impaired. I see nothing wrong with taking that average level and making everyone conform to it as a standard.  As Deputy Booth said, every person driving a car has a duty to the rest of the community. It is his duty to conform to the standard laid down.  I see no case for all the arguments that are made about whether he is on it, or the moral rights or wrongs or whether in the particular case he is capable of driving or not.  It is a question of protecting the community in the particular and on the average, and it is fair to have an average standard.</P>
    <P>My own misgivings about this Bill arise in regard to another section. Since the Second Reading, I have tried to look into the matter of the breath tests.  Projecting the argument that an average standard is needed and that no apology is needed for making people conform to that average standard, if one accepts that, then I can equally see no objection to accepting an average standard test.  It is beside the point to argue, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has been arguing, whether in any particular case the man in question was capable of driving or not.  That approach involves one in a lot of specific argument, a lot of clouding of the issue, and brings one to arguments like Deputy Lemass's about penalties.  The net result of that must be a lot of time spent and energy wasted on the part of the authorities and the ultimate job of keeping the roads safe suffering as a result.  If there is to be an average standard, then have an average test.</P>
    <P>To my mind, if the Minister has erred at all in regard to this Bill, it is in not being firm enough to abide by the test he is prepared to put there in the first instance.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I find it difficult to argue this point without going on to later <Col N="1291" /> sections and I do not want to do that now.  The development of what I am saying now will have to come when it comes to blood and urine tests but in the meantime, having set a standard of alcohol which is very high by comparison with many countries which have adopted it, it seems to me that the adoption of a standard average test such as this will work out for the best, by and large.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion I should like to make.  I know it is in anticipation, but perhaps the House will allow me to make it to indicate my line of argument.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is arguing in this amendment that it should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I should like to have this offence as the Minister has it.  I agree completely with Deputy Booth's line of argument on the basis of the evidence of the breathaliser test, and making that test sufficient for the prosecution.  Instead of having the mandatory confirmatory provisions there are in section 29, I would have the breath test, and modify section 29 to be a right for the defence to invoke the provisions of section 29, if they so wish.  I shall argue that in more detail on section 29.</P>
    <P>I would certainly give the accused the right to rebut, but only in the sense of a voluntary choice to rebut. The first test would be sufficient for the offence in question.  Anyone can read what I said on Second Reading. I had considerable misgivings about a number of problems.  We did not get much time to consider this matter when it came up in the first instance. Having considered it since, I think this approach is better than the <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <P>The weakness in Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is this.  When you bring it up, you are back to the individual argument as to whether the person at the particular time was or was not capable of driving a motor car responsibly.  As the Minister said, there are no fundamental rights involved in driving a car that demand that approach.  If there are not, it seems to me that you will bring about a lot of <Col N="1292" /> legal complications and uncertainties. You will certainly defeat any attempt to have uniformity.  I have seen what happens in the courts, the same as Deputy Fitzpatrick.  All too frequently this type of situation results in glaring injustices, and manifestly guilty people often get away with it, and possibly in a case where there is merit&mdash;I will not say a case that is innocent&mdash;the person is caught.  In this way, you will certainly get more fairness and equity. Deputy Fitzpatrick will agree that in the last analysis, we are back to Deputy Booth's position.  I agree with Deputy Booth in that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned the question of penalties.  Again, there are practical difficulties here.  In theory you might imagine that a person who is drunk and is guilty of something heinous deserves a certain punishment and a man who is blind drunk deserves a worse punishment.  That is the moral or academic way to approach it, but the fact of the matter is that a man whose judgment is impaired even if he is only slightly drunk is every bit as big a menace as the man who is blind drunk.  In fact, if he were drunk and incapable he would be safe because he could not drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Distinctions of that nature though they appeal at first flush are false from the point of view of what we are trying to do here.  We are trying to enforce the rights of the community and of every citizen, and we are doing it on the principle that a person who drives a motor car assumes a duty to every other person with whom he may come into contact in the course of his driving.  This places a duty upon him to take care, a criminal duty in the sense that if he does not carry out that duty he is behaving criminally.  That is the simple principle involved.  I think that distinction is false from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practical consequences of making this distinction would be disastrous.  You would never convict a man of the other crime no matter how bad the case was.  The people <Col N="1293" /> who have to take decisions which are hurtful or adverse to another human being are decent people.  When a judge or a justice has to impose a sentence it is not a pleasant task, and being a normal being he will be inclined to take the merciful point of view.  Advocates will not be wanting, and skilled advocates can play on the natural good feelings of the person who has to make the decision.  All these factors come into account and if you present an alternative on a plate to the person who is making the decision, the alternative will be taken.</P>
    <P>Let us be logical.  If you have a distinction between the penalties you end up by abolishing the other offence. Then you are back to square one.  How serious is this crime of driving under the influence of drink?  How serious and how dangerous is it to the rest of the community?  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment has not got the merit that it appears to have at first sight.  The Minister's case appears to be much stronger than it appears at first sight.  As I say, I would take my place with Deputy Booth on this.</P>
    <P>I do not know Deputy Fitzpatrick's attitude and how seriously he is taking this.  Is he arguing it on the basis of what would be better, or do the Opposition feel so strongly about it that they will take a positive line?  I will be interested to know that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera seems to be under a misconception as to my attitude.  I said on Second Stage that no research in relation to the problem which we are now trying to deal with was done in this country. I said that for a long time after the Bill was circulated the Government were not able to give me any reliable statistics which could be used in connection with this legislation.  I still believe that the Government and the Minister were tempted to put this section in as a result of temperance pressure groups out of emotion rather than out of clear study and conviction. I still think the Minister was wrong to deal with the Bill in this way.  Penalties have cured nothing.  Whether there is compulsory suspension of a licence or not, this will not change the accident <Col N="1294" /> rate resulting from drink one iota.  If we are to have a new offence that is a lesser offence than the one now on the Statute Book, I ask the Minister to give the judge the discretion to suspend a licence or not to suspend it, if he feels suspension is not justified.  Surely that is a reasonable request?</P>
      <P>We can find fault with the breathaliser. I would go on for half an hour telling about it, about cases in which it did not work, about the taking of liqueur sweets which became caught in the teeth cavities and gave a reaction as if the person had four large whiskies. A live test was done on our television network by one of the reporters.  He drank one glass of whiskey and he would have been found guilty of an offence.  This was performed on the screen for the entire country to see.  I understood the Minister to say that the breathaliser was being used as an indication as to the condition of the person but would the principal thing not be the blood and urine tests?</P>
      <P>In the blood test, as well, it has been found that if the needle used for taking a blood test has been kept sterilised in alcohol, even if the person has not had a drink at all a positive result will be obtained.  This has been established by medical associations.  I should like the Minister to tell us what effect has carbon monoxide poisoning on the blood and urine and can a test disclose clearly that the condition was caused by carbon monoxide poisoning? I should like to be told at least that these things have been cleared up. Then we might have some evidence that the necessary research was being carried out and not be subject to pressures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing we seem to be arguing about is the introduction of this new offence.  As a matter of fact, it is not new because it is already in the Road Traffic Act. Then there is the question of the speed limit.  Already the State has decided that there should be speed limits and perhaps it was suggested that anyone driving at 30 miles an hour could not injure anyone and perhaps people driving at more than 30 miles an hour felt they were being victimised.  We have all got to accept these speed <Col N="1295" /> limits in the interest of the safety of everybody and I do not think it is a good defence in court to say that one is capable of driving at 50 miles an hour with safety within those limits.</P>
      <P>I feel that the same principle lies behind the introduction of this alcohol test.  It has been alleged that sufficient research has not been done.  Essentially, this is a medical problem, and most medical problems, fortunately or unfortunately, take the research done in foreign countries.  The figure we have accepted is somewhat higher than that accepted in most countries.  In that way we have erred on the side of leniency.  The most recent information is about the breathaliser.  The breathaliser reading is low, certainly lower than the actual blood-alcohol content.  This again would be in favour of the person being tested.  These things weigh in favour of the person who might be charged.  I have, however, one fear. If we establish this 125 milligrammes alcohol content as an offence and a person who was obviously drunk goes into court and the evidence is that the alcohol content was only 100 milligrammes, can this be used as a defence?  Can the judge be persuaded that this man was not drunk when the doctor and everybody else concerned says he must have 125 milligrammes per cent?  Is there not a <i>prima facie</i> case that he was not drunk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass and others that the penalties are a bit severe for this new charge.  In the ordinary course, a person being charged in such circumstances will be charged with careless driving, dangerous driving and driving while drunk, and though his blood-alcohol content was more than 125 milligrammes per cent, the person trying the case, be it justice or judge, will have to separate all those charges, probably finding the person not guilty on some of them but guilty on a particular one.  I think it would be a very harsh penalty if the judge found that the person was not actually drunk, but, finding he had a <Col N="1296" /> certain percentage of alcohol, he had to suspend the licence.  I presume this would be mandatory on the justice or the judge under the Principal Act, which I have not got before me.  If that is the position, it seems to me that for this specific offence of having an alcohol content of 125 milligrammes, the person trying the case should have some discretion.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy de Valera is obviously not at ease about Part V of the Bill, taken as a whole.  Both of us agree that section 20 cannot be discussed without discussing section 29 because if we are to create an absolute offence, we must have some means of measuring the quantity of alcohol in the blood, and that means is provided in section 29, which provides for a compulsory blood test, carrying with it the offence and the penalties applicable to section 49 of the Principal Act which deals with drunken driving.  There is no use in Deputy de Valera putting his mind at ease by advocating the breathaliser because the books from the British Medical Association and the Commission's Report are agreed that the breathaliser is not satisfactory, that it is not accurate.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is the common object of us all here.  I am satisfied, the Commission were satisfied after deliberating on this from 1961 until 1963, after sending a study group to the Continent, after <Col N="1297" /> sending a study group to London, that the method suggested by me is adequate.  The Commission so reported to the Minister and in arguing this case, I consider myself in the best company, the most responsible company.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am prepared to go with the Commission all the way as far as this matter is concerned.  I do not think Deputy de Valera was here at the time, but I gave the names of the members of the Commission this morning.  They were most responsible people.  They studied this matter carefully from 1961 until 1963 and so reported to the Minister. I also stated that, as recently as a few months ago, the President of the Safety First Association in this country approved without reservation of the recommendations already put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to put a man in the position of exposing himself to severe penalties and of having his means of livelihood taken away without his being in a position to know whether, in fact, he has violated the law or not.  That is exactly what this section says.  When you go on to section 29&mdash;we will deal with that in more detail when we come to it&mdash;you are going to have this compulsory blood test with severe penalties for not carrying it out.  I wish to put on the record again that, as far as I know, there is nobody here as the advocate of the drunken or even the irresponsible driver, but I think there is a trend coming from the far side of the House for some time that we should change our whole legal system in this country, that gradually we should get away from the idea that the accused person has any rights and adopt the <Col N="1298" /> system acceptable in some Continental countries.  I do not think we should I think that, by and large, the system of criminal law we have in this country since the foundation of the State has served its purpose well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that, if Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment were to be accepted, technically the position would not be the same as it is now.  At the same time, I maintain that the decision in these cases would eventually depend on the same type of evidence as is required for the offences that exist at present.  I pointed out that the British Government's 1965 White Paper bore this out after three years' experience of the blood alcohol level being treated as <i>prima facie</i> evidence. The White Paper points out that conviction still depends to a large extent on the accused's manner of driving and his personal appearance and behaviour. If we are to take the specific blood alcohol level as being <i>prima facie</i> evidence only, the defence will fall back on evidence based on clinical examination, observation and behaviour, and the whole case will eventually be decided on the basis of that evidence. Therefore, I maintain that, in effect, the position will be roughly the same as it is at present, and that has been the experience in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> With regard to Deputy Lemass's argument, I want to say that this offence is at least an equally serious offence, if not a more serious offence. It is not a lesser offence than the offence of driving while drunk.  A person may have a lesser amount of alcohol consumed but may be a greater danger to himself and the public than the driver who is obviously drunk as at present understood.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I think the person who is not completely drunk but whose driving is impaired as a result of the consumption of alcohol will very likely be a greater danger and, therefore, be committing a greater offence than the person drunk and incapable.  The person merely stimulated by the excessive consumption of alcohol rather than incapacitated is, in my opinion, a greater danger to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, Deputy Lemass was arguing that this was a lesser offence.  I say it is not and that, therefore, the same penalty is justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only asking that the judge be given discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If he should have discretion in a case like this, he should have it in the other case also.  I maintain that this is at least an equally serious, if not a more serious offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the breathaliser test being accepted as conclusive evidence, <Col N="1300" /> as I said, we are not completely satisfied that the reliability of the breathaliser has been satisfactorily established yet, but it may be in the future.  If it is, I certainly would prefer to have the breathaliser test as the conclusive one.  But I do not think we are yet in a position in which we can do that. As Deputy de Valera said he is reserving his main argument for the appropriate section, which is the next one, I think we can wait until then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear on one point.  Assuming a man has a breathaliser test and he is informed he has over this percentage of alcohol in his blood, would he not be entitled to have a blood test afterwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I explained that earlier.  The breathaliser test is only an indication to the garda as to whether or not he should bring the person to the station and require him to give samples of blood and urine.  A charge cannot be based on the result of the breathaliser test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely convinced or satisfied with the Minister's argument.  I want to be able to feel that we are, in effect, maintaining the whole spirit and ideal of justice that has prevailed in this country and has worked well.  While we all agree that the drunken driver is a menace who should be got off the road, I do not agree that simply by imposing penalties you are going to solve the problem.  There is far more to be solved than that.</P>
