      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Progeny testing, as practised here and in several other countries, is used to rank bulls in relation to each other for important economic characteristics such as milk yield, milk quality, heifer conformation and beefing qualities of male progeny.</P>
      <P>At present 169 Friesian bulls and 74 Shorthorn bulls are standing at AI stations.  Of these 38 Friesian bulls, or 22.5 per cent, and 12 Shorthorn bulls, or 16 per cent, are fully tested and approved on the basis I have indicated. 20 Friesian bulls, or 12 per cent, and 34 Shorthorn bulls, or 46 per cent, are at varying stages of testing.  The remaining Friesian and Shorthorn bulls are too young to have progeny available for testing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is satisfied with the adequacy of the present fire-fighting services in the country, with particular reference to the equipment available for fire-fighting and the number of trained personnel for the service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a previous question <Col N="302" /> asked by him on 6th April, 1967, in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, generally, that sanitary authorities are meeting their obligations under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, to provide adequate fire-fighting services.  This is evidenced by the fact that the annual cost of administering the fire services has increased from £462,784 in 1961-62 to £838,426 in 1965-66&mdash;the last year for which complete returns are available.  During the same period, the number of trained personnel employed in the fire service has increased from 2,113 to 2,303; 13 new fire stations have been erected at a cost of £65,285; and 40 new fully equipped fire appliances have been acquired at a cost of £137,261.  As I previously informed the Deputy, the general question of the fire-fighting arrangements in the country is kept under constant review in my Department, and recommendations for improvements are made to sanitary authorities from time to time if and when inadequacies become apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if any refresher courses are held and, if so, if they are held on a regular basis?  Is it not a fact that a mere increase in cost and in the amount of money spent on the maintenance services is no test of the efficiency of the service and that in fact, except for a few isolated cases where the fire officers concerned have either on their own initiative or on the initiative of the local authorities availed of retraining or refresher courses, there is no general system of refresher courses in operation?  Will the Minister, in view of the fact that certain very large fires occurred recently, consider having a full inquiry into the whole method of recruitment and refresher courses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is continuous training going on in all the different areas and there is continuous review of the whole fire-fighting service.  I do not think that there are any inadequacies in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that at least two major fires occurred lately, fortunately in the daytime, but had they occurred at night, <Col N="303" /> in the case of one occupied dwelling certainly serious injury and loss of life might have resulted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is conjecture.  Loss of life could occur in occupied buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in regard to the fire inone building in Dún Laoghaire, the fire in the church, if it had occurred when the building was occupied, there might well have been serious loss of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If a fire occurs in an occupied building, there is more likely to be injury than if it occurs in an unoccupied building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no dispute on that.  The point I am making is the inability to cope with that fire with the equipment available which in no way reflected on the personnel involved but certainly reflected on the standard of equipment and the water pressure in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether <Col N="304" /> there are any special arrangements for the painting, decoration and maintenance of corporation flat schemes; and if he is aware that certain schemes have been neglected in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the external painting and decoration of the rented dwellings in the corporation's estates, including flats, is carried out on a programmed basis, at intervals of six to 6½ years.  Other work, as necessary, is carried out by the corporation in conjunction with the redecoration work.  In addition, repairs are carried out on a day-to-day basis after inspection by officers of the maintenance department of the corporation, or following receipt of complaints from tenants.</P>
      <P>Tenants are generally responsible for all internal decoration and for any breakage of glass in the windows and any damage to the fixtures, fittings or structure of the dwelling.</P>
      <P>Subject to the tenants' liability as indicated, the maintenance of their housing estate is a matter for the corporation, who have provided £1.182 million for the purpose in their current year's estimates.  I am not aware that any particular schemes have been excluded from the scope of the redecorating programme referred to.</P>

There is a general desire to conclude the business by the end of this month but because of the local elections and because many Deputies will be candidates in these elections and many others who are not candidates would wish to vote in their respective areas, it might be better to avoid sittings that week.  It might be possible to end the business next week if there were long sittings, including Fridays.  I should like the Whips to consider such a proposition.</P>

    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 439 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) of a further paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>`(v) or being payable to a charity for a period which exceeds or may exceed four years provided that the exemption provided by this paragraph shall not be effective for purposes of surtax'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point of this amendment is to provide that a convenant on income in certain circumstances for a charity will be effective for relief in income tax but will not be effective by way of surtax relief for the purpose of enabling otherwise a high surtax payer to give, at the expense of the revenue, substantial sums to charity.  A case could be made that if substantial sums were to be given by a surtax payer in these circumstances to a charity, the surtax payer should give them himself and should not make the selection in such a way as to give the large amount that would be involved in surtax at the expense of the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which was dealt with at some length in the Seventh Report of the Commission of Income Taxation, and the Commission ultimately, in paragraph 355, arrived at the conclusion which is included in my amendment and which has also been submitted by other bodies concerned over past years to various Ministers for Finance.  Let me say at once that I do not claim at all that the drafting of the amendment is 100 per cent effective to carry out what I have in mind. It seems to me that this was the appropriate drafting in which to implement paragraph 355 of the Commission's <Col N="322" /> Report, but if, in fact, it does not do it in that way, then I want to make it clear that it is the principle I wish to urge on the Minister and on the House rather than the wording of the draft.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to covenants was that they were allowed for certain substantial purposes in relation to charities until the Finance Act of 1940 was framed to put an end to subscriptions to charitable purposes being given by people who were paying heavy surtax.  The charity got, in effect, a subsidy from the State, I agree, and, in addition to that the subscriber got a substantial reduction in the amount of his surtax.  That restriction, therefore, that was included in section 3 of the Finance Act, 1940, and which was carried in with section 439 of the Consolidation Act, was one which reasonably enough prevented the surtax payer taking a covenant as a charge on his income for the purposes of reduction in surtax.  The Minister for Finance of that day made it very clear, when introducing section 3 of the Act of 1940, that it was an escapement from surtax which he thought all wrong and a gap he was anxious to close.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the amount involved in this amendment at the present time would be.  Even then it was only £13,000 a year, and the Seventh Report of the Income Taxaation Commission, which I would say from recollection, was published around 1962, estimated that perhaps the amount that would be lost in surtax if section 3 of the 1940 Act were wholly repealed would be £50,000. For that reason the Commission at that time, and I in this amendment, deliberately excluded surtax, so that the revenue would not lose the £50,000 involved and would not lose any surtax on such covenanted income in the future.</P>
    <P>At that time when the Commission was considering the matter, the Revenue Commissioners pointed out that the covenant system was likely to be entirely lopsided because people with modest remuneration would not be liable to income tax and, accordingly, would not be able to avail of a <Col N="323" /> subscription to charity in this way. That may have been true then, that they were not so liable, but with the increase in monetary remuneration, apart from real remuneration, and with the manner in which allowances have remained static, people now are liable often to heavy income tax without having any excessive incomes at all.  In fact, many people with most moderate incomes have now pretty heavy tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>At that time also the provision in relation to a covenant was that it had to be operative for a period in excess of six years.  It was felt then that the obligation to look ahead so far was a thing that militated against the person of moderate means.  Accordingly the Commission came down flatly and recommended that the covenant to rank in this way should be one that could operate for more than four years. The Report also made it clear that the Commission were very handicapped in considering the matter of covenants because of lack of information.  I do not think that can now be the position because there has been a campaign, if I may so describe it, in recent years by Revenue to obtain such information.</P>
    <P>Various people from time to time&mdash; in particular, my colleague, Deputy P. Byrne&mdash;agitate against carrying in certain provisions here from British tax legislation.  That always infuriates Deputy Byrne, and rightly so, because if it is a taxing provision we always copy it but, if it is a relieving provision, we never carry it into our legislation.  It is interesting to note in this respect that the British Revenue authorities have provided relief exactly of the type we ask for in this amendment. There are many charities which would benefit considerably if this amendment were accepted.  The universities have got a concession in respect of research.  Science is treated as research.  There are areas of university education in which it would be highly desirable to afford an opportunity to those who graduated from those universities to support the universities by tax-free subscriptions.  That would be a substantial help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> There are many charities which have the greatest difficulty in carrying on and anything that might act as an incentive to people to subscribe to these very worthy charities is something of which I am sure everybody would approve.  Restricting it to income tax alone, I do not think the Minister would lose by accepting the principle of this amendment.  The amount would be small in the context of the Budget with which we are dealing.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools naturally try to get help for projects of one kind or another from their past pupils.  These schools would be helped considerably if this amendment were accepted and the schools would be enabled to deal with their appeals in a way in which they would be guaranteed far greater support and a much bigger response.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that the effect of this amendment would be to give something to these charities at the expense of revenue.  That is not so.  The amount involved from the revenue point of view would be very small. Payment would be the net amount under the covenant when one takes into account that it is not to be treated as a charge against income for surtax purposes.  There would be the dual effect in that it would act as an incentive, on the one hand, and represent, on the other, a saving in relation to certain aspects and permanent features of education.  It would also act as an incentive in regard to other charitable works which are badly in need of funds.  I accept, without question, the definition of charity as a charity operative in Ireland.  If the amendment is not absolutely copperplate, it can be amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment with a social purpose.  It is quite remarkable to discover the astonishing number of charitable organisations doing national work without any assistance of any kind from the State. The position here in that respect is in marked contrast to the position obtaining in other countries and, in particular, the position obtaining in Great Britain where the paid social worker is commonplace.  We have literally dozens of religious orders quietly doing <Col N="325" /> the most remarkable work.  If this work were not done by them, it would have to be done by the community, at considerable expense to the community.</P>
      <P>There is no harm in being specific.  I am carrying on annually a tradition founded by my late father many years ago; annually I am invited to preside at the opening of a sale of work in Portland Row.  The good nuns there do not get one pennypiece from the State.  The order which runs the Hospice for the Dying does not, so far as I know, get one pennypiece from the State.  The Little Sisters in Kilmainham and in Roebuck do not get one penny from the State.  There are orphanages run by nuns, in which literally thousands of children are cared for, which get the most meagre of State assistance and, in some cases, no State assistance at all.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to serve a social purpose by generating a new source of subscription from the charitable public.  We are alleged to be living in an affluent society.  It is a marked feature of our society that those who are newly affluent are not as socially conscious as one would wish them to be.  There are demonstrations of gross vulgarity by the new rich.  They are not giving the lead they should give. They do not recognise their responsibility. The acceptance of this amendment would provide such people with an incentive to make what might be described as a healthy transfer of income for the benefit of those in need. The amendment would, in fact, serve a socially desirable national purpose. It is a very reasonable amendment and one which was recommended by the Commission on Income Taxation in its Seventh Report.  It behoves the Minister not lightly to disregard the recommendations of that Commission which studied this problem in considerable detail.  Any argument which the Minister can produce against the amendment was anticipated by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the change in the law, which disqualified charities which previously benefited, was effected in 1940, the Minister for Finance at the time was <Col N="326" /> under considerable wartime stress. That situation no longer exists.  He was concerned about the loss of revenue in surtax of £13,000 a year.  He felt it necessary to plug that gap.  The need for this 1940 restriction is no longer with us.</P>
    <P>There will be very little loss of exist ing income tax revenue to the State in this amendment is accepted.  It will serve to provide an incentive to gene rate a new source of income for the deserving charities of which I have spoken which are put to the pin on their collar to carry on in these extra ordinary times of fantastically high costs.</P>
    <P>The Lord knows, having regard the fact that so little is done by the State, officially, for the bodies of which I have spoken, it would seem not  be asking very much of the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, at the outset, that regret to have to inform the Deputies opposite that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that it is not necessary for us to argue about the wording of this amendment and that we can discuss it in principle.  I must tell the House that I am opposed to it in principle.</P>
      <P>Before I say any more, I should like to agree with some of the things which Deputy Byrne and Deputy Sweetman have said and to disagree with some others.  First of all, I want to subscribe fully to the tributes paid to the many wonderful charities which carry on, in difficult circumstances, in our capital city and indeed throughout the country.  Certain religious orders, as Deputy Byrne pointed out, render a most valuable service to the community. It is difficult, in regard to some of the services they render, to see how the work would be done if it were not undertaken by religious bodies.  As I go about my duties as a public representative, like other Deputies, I am, time and again, struck by the devotion and the dedication of these people, both lay and clerical, to the various charitable purposes which they undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> I disagree with Deputy Byrne in his reference to some apparent lack of interest by the better-off in the less well-off sections of the community.  In my experience, it is the opposite.  I am continually amazed at the generosity and decency of the ordinary people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not speaking of the ordinary people; I was speaking of the new rich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some of the <i>nouveau riche</i> who are not mindful of their obligations.  I cannot say I find that generally.  I find that there is a great generosity and charity at all levels of our society.  Like other Deputies, I have the experience from time to time of helping this or that particular cause. I personally cannot agree that there is any great deal of selfishness in our society or in our community at any level.  I suppose that, in our society, there will always be some who are not prepared to accept the obligations which their comparative affluence would place upon them but I do not think this is general.  In any event, that is largely by the way.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to this idea, on principle, because, in the first place, I do not think it is the desirable way to do what the Deputies have in mind.  I do not think it is the right way to go about achieving this particular objective. They want to help charities.  I have pointed out that there are many charities that carry on with very great difficulty without any assistance from the State.  That is true.  I am not sure that it is not a good thing, in many cases, that they do not get assistance.  There are certain types of institutions which glory in the fact that they do not get State assistance.  They seem to be able to command a greater degree of loyalty and dedication from their members and supporters because of that very fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that is really only applicable to a subsidy than to anything else?  This would not be a subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the charity in need of support, the precise way of doing it and the orderly way of doing it is to give direct assistance from the State. That assistance could then properly be measured on the basis of the situation of the particular charity and geared to its exact requirements.  This method could be a very imperfect method of doing it.  In effect, what would happen here is that for every £1 a person gave to a charity, the State would, willy-nilly, have to give 10/-.  We would, in fact, be giving the power to a private individual to decide, in relation to a particular charity, that the State would give a 10/- supplement to it for every £1 that the covenantor gave it.</P>
      <P>I do not think an individual should have that selective power.  He is perfectly free to give his own money to any charity he wishes but the effect of this amendment would be that not alone would he be giving his own £1 but he would in fact be taking from the Exchequer another 10/- for the charity of his choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a breach in the code.  I am not sure it should have been made.  However, it is there and I do not now propose to interfere with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the situation in Great Britain.  It is of very great interest to us to see what has happened there.  In Great Britain, this system applies.  Deputy Sweetman is quite right: in Great Britain it applies for the purpose of income tax and not surtax.  I understand that there is the most intense activity by professional fund-raisers in Great Britain in regard to these convenants.  Of course, the professional fund-raiser is very much in favour of a convenant because it binds the donor to give a particular amount of money for a number of years.  I understand that there is actually very intensive advertising and door-to-door canvassing in this regard.  They go so far as to specify the type of convenant and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> There is no doubt that, if we were to agree to Deputy Sweetman's proposal, it would certainly skyrocket here too. We know that various charities are more and more engaging the services of professional fund-raisers and we could expect in a short number of years that these covenants would mushroom into something very substantial.  It is difficult to put a figure on it, and I do not want to attempt to mislead the House and to use figures to confuse the House, but I am told that we could contemplate a loss of revenue of something like £¾ million a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the Commission said only £50,000, including surtax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be after a period of years if the thing were to develop on the line on which it is developing in Britain and which would most certainly follow here.  There is that aspect and it would be a different proposal from what the Commission had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there is this very solid argument in principle against it.  We should not give the right to the individual taxpayer to take 10/- from the Exchequer and give it to the charity of his choice.  There is no objection to his giving his own pound and it is open to him to give that one pound to the charity of his choice but it is a different <Col N="330" /> thing when he takes 10/- and adds it to his own.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that for these reasons I have no option but to oppose the amendment, much as I am in sympathy with the notion behind it, the social purposes to which Deputy Byrne has referred.  But if we want to achieve that particular social purpose, if a charity finds it cannot carry on on the basis of voluntary subscriptions and voluntary work, then the proper machinery is for them to go to the appropriate Minister under whose jurisdiction the charity works, whether the Minister for Health, Social Welfare, or whoever it may be, and say: &ldquo;Here is our financial position; our expenditure is so much and we can depend on so much income from traditional sources, and we must have a grant.&rdquo;  The taxpayers for the specific purposes of the charity could decide to support the particular form of activity.  In this way you would not be spending the taxpayers' money at the discretion of the individual, which I think is indefensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In all matters relating to the raising of revenue, we usually take a swipe at the Revenue Commissioners via the Minister for Finance and perhaps I may be excused if on this occasion I ask the Minister, on behalf of the House, to compliment one of our distinguished Revenue Commissioners on the international honour being so appropriately conferred on him.  It reflects a high distinction. Mr. Culligan has been appointed Chairman of the Customs Co-operation Council in Brussels.  I know I speak for all sides when I ask the Minister to express our satisfaction with this well-deserved honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point involved here really is the Revenue approach and, I trust the Minister will excuse me if I say, the commonsense approach.  I consider that when we start speaking of £¾ million from the Treasury point of view, the Revenue Commissioners have an obligation to tell the Minister what is the maximum they reasonably apprehend cases of this kind might involve the Exchequer in and thereupon say to him: &ldquo;If you want to spend £¾ million, we imagine you prefer to inform <Col N="331" /> the Government that you have this at your disposal for distribution and let the appropriate Department increase the social services to the tune of approximately this sum and then we will know where we are, whereas this is a step in the dark.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister to contrast with that the commonsense point of view?  The purpose of this amendment is to operate on human nature which we politicians understand much better than the Revenue Commissioners do.  Many a person is contributing to an orphanage or to some of these organisations to which Deputy Byrne referred, whenever the case is made to him anew about the merits of the charity, but having made his subscription and the thing having passed out of his mind, he does not subscribe again. Here, however, the case can be made on behalf of a deserving charity: &ldquo;If you will undertake to subscribe for five years, the charity will not only get the benefit of your subscription but also the refund of the income tax&rdquo;.  In the vast number of cases, people would gladly contribute for the period of five years ahead for the very reason they gave the first subscription.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are cases where people will say: &ldquo;I am good for one contribution but I am not prepared to commit myself further; come back again if you want to&rdquo;.  There is no use anybody in this House saying that a proviso such as that contained in the amendment would not encourage ordinary people to convenant for the support of a charity to which they would otherwise give a single contribution. In the matter of principle mentioned by the Minister, I think that disposes of the argument that this amounts to no more than charging the Exchequer with 10/- for every £1 the donor gives.  In fact it does encourage the average donor to undertake to repeat his donation for a period of years.  There is no answering the case made by Deputy Byrne that a great number of these charities do work that the State, of its very nature, cannot do.</P>
    <P>I do not agree in the matter of principle raised by the Minister that, if <Col N="332" /> there is a worthy work in progress which we all here in Oireachtas Éireann come to the conclusion requires further finances than are available by way of charitable donation, the proper thing is to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister responsible for that general sphere of activity so that, if he can, he will prevail on the Government to provide some supplementary income which the Government see their way to provide.  I want to impress on the Minister most energetically that in that principle he is wholly mistaken because in the ordinary course of financial practice &mdash;and it is a sound course as a general rule&mdash;if public money is donated to a body not directly responsible to the Minister, then the Committee of Public Accounts must follow it up.  I know that to that rule there are exceptions.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture there was the question of the IAOS charity.  It was a society concerned with the development of co-operatives in the country and was entitled to an annual grant.  I remember saying: &ldquo;I am going to ask the Government to increase your grant, and not only that, but I am going to suggest that your receipt will be a full discharge for the Accounting Officer.&rdquo; I remember another voluntary body which was doing work of incomparable value to the rural community.  These people could not expand their work if they could not hire six organisers.  They were prepared to say to me that, if they could get the money to get these six organisers, they would never have to ask for a penny.  They could get the money they wanted from voluntary sources.</P>
    <P>I went to the Minister for Finance and I said that we were prepared to give a sum to this organisation, their receipt for which would be a full discharge for the Accounting Officer.  At first he made the case that this was impossible because public money must be accounted for.  Eventually I proposed this compromise.  I said that, if we had a certificate that this money was used for no other purpose than organisation, that should meet the requirements of the Department of <Col N="333" /> Finance.  Eventually that compromise was agreed upon and they furnished the Minister for Agriculture with a certificate that this grant was used solely for the purpose of organisation. The ordinary rule is that a grant such as the Minister thinks would be a suitable substitute for Deputy Sweetman's amendment has to be accounted for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>It is the general practice. I think that, if the Minister inquires, he will find it is the general practice.  It was the then Deputy McGilligan who made an exception in the case to which I am referring.  I do not want to name the organisation because it has long since passed out of the stage where it required that supplement. It got under way and developed its own income and is now doing invaluable work.  Surely the Minister will agree that the general tendency must be that, if public money is allocated to a body not under ministerial control, it must be accounted for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was a young Deputy, I tried to teach him that I as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts could ask the Accounting Officer to produce the audited accounts in respect of grants made.  There is the very heart of the question.  They get a grant and they must produce a certificate.  Inevitably that comes under the control of an Accounting Officer whose duty it is, if the account is unsatisfactory, to send it back and say: &ldquo;The Minister is not satisfied with the material in that account and requires the accounts to be cast in the following form.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the situation of an independent charity functioning by its own genius?  It has to start adapting itself to the rigidity of Treasury control.  A great deal of nonsense is talked at times about the excessive rigidity of Treasury control but, if you start relaxing Treasury control, you open the floodgates <Col N="334" /> to abuses of every possible type. An account must be subject to Treasury control or it must not.  The moment you start introducing grey middle country, the floodgates are open to abuses.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the classic argument against that form of relief and says: &ldquo;Why should an individual taxpayer have the right to donate 10/- of Treasury money for every £1 he himself gives?&rdquo; I do not think that is a fair description of what actually transpires in transactions of this kind.  The effect of Deputy Sweetman's amendment would be to sway the citizens who recognise the value of a particular charity to give an undertaking for four years or more to support it instead of giving one £5 note or one cheque and forgetting the charity thereafter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman's Treasury training is not lost upon him and he recoils from the idea of including surtax.  Am I wrong in believing that the fact that these endowments are exempt from tax in the US has given rise to great foundations?  I do not say the relief is identical, but it is along this principle. Can anyone say the world is a worse place because these foundations were called into existence?  I do not think the world has been any the poorer because of the fact that the Rockefeller Foundation or the Ford Foundation or the Kellogg Foundation were called into existence by tax concessions.  I am certain that America is not the poorer.</P>
    <P>It requires an imaginative approach to see this problem in its right perspective. It was pointed out to the Minister that this concession is already available in regard to certain educational functions. He burshes that aside and says that a breach was made in the general principle and that on the whole he regrets it.  I think he is mistaken and I think he is mistaken because he is allowing the Treasury squint to grow upon him.  He is forgetting the side of the problem from which he would have looked at it before he became Minister for Finance and from which the average person looks at it.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that the type of charities described by Deputy Byrne should retain their autonomy by virtue of the fact that they are sustained <Col N="335" /> exclusively by charitable contributions. If it involves taxation concessions which further increase their resources, it will be a very rare circumstance if the consequential contribution from the Treasury is used to a bad purpose.  This is the phenomenon which haunts the Minister.  Suppose this thing began to skyrocket and we had people running high-powered collections.  I do not want to introduce anything approximating to controversy into this discussion, but to hear the father of Taca warn us against these dangers in respect of the carry-on of such groups is rich; if this concession generated a burden on the Treasury and if the Minister felt that it really got out of control and that such expenditure got beyond the beyonds what objection would there be to coming back and saying: &ldquo;It was never envisaged that the Treasury would ever have to carry a burden of £750,000 in income tax refunds or over £1,000 a year.&rdquo;  An end could be put to it.</P>
    <P>In 1940 this was done.  The concession existed and it was put an end to on the ground that we were facing a European war and that every penny had to be saved.  If this thing got out of control, and the charities were perhaps getting more than their share, what would prevent the Minister for Finance of that day coming back to the House and saying: &ldquo;This concession must stop.  We are not forbidding anyone to contribute to charity, but saying that the secondary impact on the Treasury no longer exists after the lapse of a fair period which the Oireachtas should determine&rdquo;?  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the Treasury seeks to establish a user.  The size of the charity he anticipates as possible&mdash;and I have no need to put it higher than that&mdash;is almost fantastic, but, even if it were realistic, it is not irremediable.</P>
    <P>There are two methods that can be adopted.  One is the Treasury method which I think is false in the sense of the approach by the ordinary legislator.  The purpose of Deputy Sweetman's amendment is to persuade the prescribed charity to do it in a systematic way from the point of view <Col N="336" /> of the charity and the irreplaceable work these people do.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister to look at this again, and perhaps posterity might care to call this concession in celebration of the international recognition and the distinction of our Revenue Commissioners, the Culligan-Sweetman amendment, or, including the Minister, the Culligan-Sweetman-Haughey amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all very persuasive but I do not think that I am influenced solely by the Treasury outlook in this matter.  We are facing today, as I mentioned earlier, a situation where you have planned giving and there are certainly not many Catholics, in the parishes of Dublin at any rate, and perhaps throughout the country, and parishes of other religious denominations who have not now put their finances on a comprehensive basis.  All of those would qualify for this.  I would visualise that any parish that has this planned system of giving would very quickly avail of this concession if we were to make it.</P>
      <P>I would just put this calculation before the House as a tentative one. We have about 600,000 income tax payers in the country.  If, for instance, 25 per cent of those, that is 150,000, decided to give 5/- a week under covenants it would cost us £700,000.  I do not think that the figure of £750,000 is altogether out of the question.</P>
      <P>I am afraid this is too much to contemplate and I think it would be realised very quickly, bearing in mind the new tendency there is in all fund-raising today.  I know that these covenants are very widely availed of in Britain by churches and other charity organisations.  If this were something which were to be confined to a clearly recognisable charity, which all of us would understand to be a charity in the popular sense, then we could probably take a risk, but I am afraid it could not be so in fact and it would be very widely and very comprehensively availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I do not think that I could be persuaded to adopt it.  I am not at all convinced by Deputy <Col N="337" /> Dillon's argument about the undesirability of giving direct subventions where they would be needed.  I cannot find any specific organisation, whilst talking, but I do know for certain that there are a number of organisations which get grants from Ministers simply by the production of their audited accounts and the audited accounts are not for the purposes of checking on the activities of the organisations but for simply determining the amount they should get.  Very frequently the arrangement of the pound for pound applies.  The Minister agrees to put up a pound for every pound the organisation puts up, up to a certain sum.  In this case the Minister concerned does not interfere at all in the affairs of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I have been given a list of grants which the Minister for Education gives. He gives a grant of £17,625 to the Royal Irish Academy; £17,500 to the Royal Irish Academy of Music; £5,250 to the National Film Institute of Ireland; £2,000 to the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland, and I am sure my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, does not interfere with the internal affairs of the Zoo, and £2,500 to the Irish Committee of Historical Societies&mdash;</P>

      <P>And Muintir na Tíre get £5,000.  I think that is the correct way to assess the size of a particular form of social charity.  The proper way to do it is by direct grant based on the needs of the organisation in question related to the scale of its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I still hope that on reflection the Minister will redetermine the matter.  In regard to that last point the Minister makes on the kind of charity that cannot reasonably aspire to a State grant but urgently needs <Col N="338" /> some prosperity through sustained subscriptions for its function as a local charity, take an Irish country town where a lottery is operated by the nuns. It has no more claim to a State grant than any other charity; yet it is the neighbours' children who very probably constitute 20 per cent or 30 per cent of the recipients.  It is a fitting and a proper thing that local people should direct their charity in that direction.  It is a good thing that, where possible, we should encourage them to covenant to that end.  I wish the Minister to bear that type of charity in mind as being peculiarly suceptible to the kind of benefit Deputy Sweetman's amendment could confer and which, by its very nature, is disqualified from the alternative of a State subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disqualify it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister will readily see, one such institution applying to the Minister for a subvention immediately confronts the Minister with corresponding applications from a hundred others between which he finds it virtually impossible to distinguish. If you are a covenanted benefactor to a local charity, you will help on the annual carnival; you will lend flags to decorate the grounds for a garden fate.  You become associated with it.  Now I cannot expect the machine of the Revenue Commissioners to have regard to these kinds of local considerations.  We are here to qualify their expert approach to such matters by our more human political approach, knowing the conditions of the people we represent, amongst whom we live, and the circumstances of the local charity we seek to promote.</P>
      <P>I am inviting the Minister to reflect on that aspect of the situation, always bearing in mind that if the mushrooming into great figures which he is entitled to apprehend should materialise, he can always come back to the House and say: &ldquo;This thing has got out of control and we simply have to revert to the grant.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty there.  If the thing went wrong, if the thing were producing a bad end result, I do not think the Minister would have any difficulty in coming back in here and saying: &ldquo;Look, some of the cute boys who have got into the business of organising charities and so on, have turned the whole Act into a colander by punching holes in it which in this new kind of organised charity collection has become a scandal.&rdquo;  I think the House would support him in that and say: &ldquo;Well, we tried to do the right thing and the cute boys got past us; the only way we can remedy the matter is to review the whole situation again.&rdquo;  But, mark you, do not quote the experience of the Internal Revenue in Great Britain as being a warning to us.  They naturally, approached their Chancellor and said: &ldquo;This burden has become very substantial.&rdquo;  But, when the Chancellor&mdash;as the Minister tells me&mdash;went to the House of Commons, they said: &ldquo;We do not think it is excessive. We think the money is being well spent.  It may be an unusual way of conveying money to charity but we feel that voluntary charities do the kind of work that State social services, even in this socialist State of Great Britain, cannot do.&rdquo; And, when you have all <Col N="340" /> of the social services, all the social workers and all the machinery they have, is it not an interesting thing that the British House of Commons, which at present is dominated by a majority which professes to believe that in a welfare state all human aid ought to be covered by State social services, still say to their own Chancellor: &ldquo;Although your duty is to provide money to cover every human contingency, still there is a place left for voluntary charity which we know is a large burden but it is not too great to sustain, so great is its value, albeit we have a great welfare machine far more comprehensive than anything operating in Ireland?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;charity&rdquo; is being bandied around here.  God be with the times when people would be ashamed to look for charity.

They are given this on the ground that it is, in fact, a charity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have that, it is about all you need.  The position about it is that we have at the present time in this country numerous organisations doing an excellent job because they know they are jobs many of us believe the State should be doing and is not doing.  For that reason, the charities, as they are called, must take them up.  When they find themselves short of money, they occasionally ask that the State would help them out, but I do not think all Ministers for Finance would be as generous as <Col N="341" /> the present Minister has stated he would be&mdash;that he would not turn them down.  I honestly believe there should be some set way of dealing with these matters.  I go a long way with the Minister when he says&mdash;though he does not use these words&mdash;that people may attempt to salve their consciences by giving to charities what they themselves are giving but what the State should be getting.  Indeed, it is not the only field in which people prefer to give rather than to the State.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a figure of £750,000.  I wonder how this would be affected by the amendment which Deputy Sweetman has suggested? Would the amount involved&mdash;which would go for charity, because of this amendment&mdash;be very much greater?  It was only a notional figure; nobody could put a definite on it, but, from the discussion here this afternoon, I would be inclined to agree with the Minister that the right line is being taken and, if more money is needed, then he should be in a position to provide this extra money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just leave these two final figures with Deputies. In Great Britain, the experience has been that the gross figures under covenants trebled in the past ten years, from £11 million in 1956 to £33 million in 1966, doubled in the past five years, from £16 million in 1960 to £33 million in 1966.  Therefore the amounts in Britain trebled in ten years and doubled in five years.  That is indicative of the sort of thing that would probably happen here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainly is. Nobody has ever been more forthcoming than I have been in the tributes I have paid publicly and in private to the people whose advice I was privileged to receive when I was in the office of Minister for Finance. However, it is undoubted that the whole set-up&mdash;if I might put it that way&mdash;of the establishment, the whole manner in which the establishment has grown up and is bound to grow up, is that it sets its face against tax incentives.</P>
      <P>I remember one of the most distinguished public servants we have had, who was then in Revenue and is now retired, when I informed him that I was going to introduce the tax incentives for exports in 1956, being utterly appalled, and saying that this was not a Revenue job, that the Revenue job was to provide the revenue and to give, if I thought it necessary, what was necessary by way of subsidy.  I think the Minister personally will agree with me that it was a good thing that I overrode that advice.  The Minister in section 9 has extended the decision I then took contrary to that advice.</P>
      <P>I now find that the necessary caution of the Revenue Commissioners is clearly imparting some advice to the Minister against tax incentives.  The reason I like tax incentives more than the direct subsidies to which Deputy Tully has referred, which the Revenue people prefer and which the Minister has asked for, is that they stimulate private individuals to get on with the job and in a job like this the private individual, if he is given the incentive, has a far greater chance of getting on with the job than has State direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister completely minimises, completely overlooks, the effect of the incentive in relation to this.  I do not think that in our circumstances here there is any possibility whatever of escalation to the figures the Minister has suggested which have been drawn up by comparison with Britain.  Their way of life and their industrial base for taxation would provide very different figures and a very different approach and results from here.  I think <Col N="343" /> the Minister is wrong in dropping out the incentive that would be available here.  I accept that it is the job of the Revenue Commissioners to protect their revenue and to resist inroads of all sorts.  The Minister said a moment ago that a research inroad was one, the wisdom of which he was doubtful about.  It is the job of Revenue to protect the Central Fund, the Exchequer, which adventurous Ministers for Finance might diminish by way of incentives. The incentive in this case would be very worthwhile and I would urge the Minister strongly to reconsider this matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The position as I understand it in the US and in Canada to which Deputy Byrne referred is slightly different. There, a fixed percentage of the taxpayer's income can be donated to charity and, if so donated, is allowable for tax purposes.  I would not quarrel with the Minister if he were to adopt the American system here and to say: &ldquo;Yes; I will allow a convenant up to a certain percentage of a person's income&rdquo;, the same percentage if you like all the way or any escalating one, as he thinks fit.  However, I do want to have some provision which is an incentive towards the charities remaining in being and in operation, able to do the work they have done for many years, the marvellous work to which Deputy Byrne, Deputy Dillon, the Minister and all of us want to pay a tribute.  I feel that an incentive is the best way of doing that.</P>

      <P>In page 9, lines 13 and 14, to delete all words after &ldquo;care&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The scope of the relief, as drafted, excludes routine ophthalmic and routine dental treatment and we consider that we should ask the Minister at least to justify their exclusion.  Both items can be very expensive. For any given person they could exceed the limit of £50 for which the section provides. That being the case, it seems anomalous that they should be excluded from the relief being made available.</P>

      <P>It is intended to cover ordinary care and maintenance, as it were.  The whole principle behind this new provision is that where a taxpayer is faced with something in the nature of a disaster in a year, a major illness, he will be enabled to charge the medical expenses involved for tax purposes. Anything in the nature of routine dental care or routine ophthalmic treatment is clearly not within its scope.  People would be expected to make reasonable provision for ordinary routine medical expenses.</P>

      <P>I will look at it but it is not something we could contemplate taking within the scope of the provision, the whole purpose of which is to take care of an exceptionally heavy medical bill for an unfortunate taxpayer in a particular year which he could not have foreseen.  Routine maternity care and ophthalmic treatment are normal and natural and occur from year to year.

      <P>The entire cost might be £49 10s and these other things might be more than £20.  There is another angle to this section which I should like to mention.  A number of things are allowed for and it means there will be greater difficulty in filling in income tax forms.  It will have to be dealt with in a certain way and details will have to be given.  These forms are Greek to 70 per cent of the people.  There are so many qualifications that they find it most difficult and they go to Deputies or to county councillors who know as little about it as they do.  There is still another angle at which the Minister should have another look.  I wrote to him about it.  Somebody who is not clear about his entitlements might wish to discuss the matter with the income tax officials.  He must stand in a queue with a number of other people and there is a public confession of everything to the official who opens a shutter like a confessional.</P>

They count very much.  As a trade union official, I have to go occasionally and I know that it means standing in a queue.

My point is that it is extremely difficult to find somebody who wants to avail of the benefits of the amendment to go to the income tax office and try to explain his case in the full hearing of the public, both male and female.  The Minister should at least have cubicles where such people can talk in private.  The conditions for even the staff in those places should not be tolerated in 1967.

      <P>I should like to clarify one point.  In regard to routine ophthalmic treatment, which means a refraction or a small thing like that, it does not imply that there is any particular exclusion for hospital treatment.  If a person has to go into an ophthalmic hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in provided the cost is more than £50 a year.  In reply to the Deputy's point, I want to say that routine ophthalmic treatment is, in fact, any treatment not carried out by a specialist so that, in fact, what is out is very narrow.  In reply to Deputy Tully, I want to say that I hope there will not be any great difficulty in the administration of this.  It will not be included on the ordinary income tax return.  There will be a special form prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners. It will be a simple form where at the end of the year the person will set out the medical expenses he has incurred and claim his reduction accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is great necessity for privacy in those matters. From our point of view, and here I identify myself with the Revenue Commissioners, <Col N="349" /> people naturally enough and understandably enough do not send in their return forms in time and when they should and, therefore, there is always a bit of congestion at certain times.  If we could persuade all taxpayers to send in their forms every year in plenty of time there would be no need for this congestion.  I accept that there is an obligation on us to enable the taxpayer to conduct his affairs with resonable comfort and a certain degree of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not expect a taxpayer to be comfortable when he goes to discuss his business with the Revenue people.  I want to make it clear that the staff of the Revenue Commissioners are always anxious to be helpful. It is the method which is entirely wrong.  It is not the matter of sending in a form in time which is the cause of this congestion.  It is when the tax assessment is sent out that the trouble starts.  People then go in to claim for something which they should have been allowed.  This is something which they do not want to discuss in public.  They have to discuss their business in front of other people.  This is something which should not be put on the long finger.  Privacy should be provided for people who want to go in to make a case like this.  Any time I have gone in there has been at least a dozen people standing in a hallway waiting their turn.  Some of those people have to discuss their private business in front of other people, some of whom they may know and some of whom they may not know.  This should not be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11a.</P>
      <P>In page 9 between lines 27 and 28, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  curative training prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make it clear primarily that the amendment is based on the assumption that mental ill-health and mental disability come within the scope of section 12.  I would ask the Minister to clarify that point.  It seems to me that mental illness is an ailment, an <Col N="350" /> infirmity, a disability which must come within the scope of the definition set out in respect of health care.  That being the case, I would suggest to the Minister that the modern treatment of certain forms of mental illness, particularly in relation to mentally retarded or arrested children, children whose development is arrested or autistic children, in some cases is not carried on in a hospital.  It would, therefore, seem necessary to provide in this list of cases which are covered for what I have termed in the amendment curative training prescribed by a practitioner.  I invite the Minister to clarify particularly the question of mental illness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Mental illness will certainly be covered.  I would just like to point out to the Deputy that any treatment in hospital is covered.  That covers treatment whether he is an in-patient or an out-patient.  Hospital is very widely defined.  It includes any health institution within the meaning of the Health Act, 1947, that is to say a hospital, sanatorium, county home, home for persons suffering from mental or physical disability, maternity home, convalescent home, preventorium, laboratory, clinic, health centre, first-aid station, dispensary or any other similar institution.  I think that is certainly wide enough to cover the sort of treatment which Deputy Byrne has in mind. I want to point out that this section will be administered by one agency in the Revenue Commissioners which will ensure uniform treatment.  It will be under instructions to administer and to interpret those provisions generously and in such a way that they will not be niggardly and not exclude any type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just intervene on a point of clarification here?  The line of demarcation is sometimes very difficult between what is known as severely retarded children and moderately retarded children. Sometimes institutions in which it is possible to give some form of education, no matter how small it is, to this type of child, even though it might be designated as a moderately retarded child, are known as schools.  In spite of that, many of those children, in <Col N="351" /> fact, most of them, who are severe moderates are severely retarded, go in and stay indefinitely and they are a considerable charge on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it quite clear, and I agree with him on this, that the severely retarded child is completely and absolutely covered here.  The severely retarded child is a charge on the Minister for Health and the Department of Finance to start with and, secondly, all places in which he is found are institutions.  There is the other type of child who is not covered. In fact, there are two types.  The first mentioned just now by Deputy Byrne is the autistic child.  This is a child who needs prolonged detention in an institution. In fact, the institutions who have autistic children are really schools. Therefore, the purpose of Deputy Byrne's amendment is to cover that type of child, to ensure that autistic children are covered and that there will be no difficulty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are covered. If the Deputy will look at paragraph (d) of the definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; in subsection (1) of section 12 he will find that the definition is very flexible. It includes any other hospital, nursing home or maternity home approved of for the purposes of this section by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Health.  What hospital means is set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) and paragraph (d) makes it quite flexible.  What will happen, of course, is that if there is any doubt the Revenue office dealing with this section will consult with the Department of Health for an expert decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

Is the Minister quite satisfied that is the most desirable method of defining the qualifying people?  I have in mind in particular the income limits.  There may be a certain anomaly there.  I do not think there is any ceiling on the income of a housekeeper for the care of one's children. I think she will get the £100 allowance irrespective of her income.  Certainly, the limit of the child's income is £80 and the new limit for the dependent relative is £200.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not rather unfair, that, if the dependent relative has a small income that excludes him from the ordinary tax allowance, it should also exclude him from the health allowance?  We all know the dependent relative is one of the people most likely to cause this type of heavy expense.  I raised the question on the Second Reading and the Minister correctly referred me to the manner in which the child over 16 is transferred from one section to another.  In the case of the child over 16 who is mentally retarded, who is never going to be all right, the grandparents might have made some small provision for him.  It might be enough to take the child out of the category of being a dependent relative for the purposes of the parents' tax allowance but it does not minimise in any way the very heavy expense that is going to be borne under this section.</P>
      <P>Although I appreciate the Minister has to have some definition, I think he should have the definition without reference to the income limit.  I would urge the Minister to consider that very strongly between now and Report Stage.  It would be very simple to have a definition of a person in respect of whom an individual is allowed for the year of assessment a deduction under so-and-so, or would have been, were it not for the income of the person concerned.</P>

      <Col N="359" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>Before section 24, but in Part IV, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subsection (2) (b) of section 53 of the Finance Act, 1920, is hereby amended by the addition of the words `other than loans granted by the Industrial Credit Company which are repayable over a period not exceeding twenty years'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to corporation profits tax and urges a repeal of section 53 of the Finance Act, 1920, a British Act.  Interest payable on long-term loans is not an allowable charge for purposes of corporation profits tax, although, of course, bank overdraft interest is so allowable.  Interest on short-term loans is an allowable charge for relief of corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates specifically to interest on loans granted by the Industrial Credit Company which are repayable over a period not exceeding 20 years.  The Act which we seek to amend is the British Act of 1920.  The Industrial Credit Company, which was not even dreamt of in the year 1920, plays a most significant role in the Irish economy in regard to the development of industry.  It is clearly very desirable that that role should not be hindered by tax law.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants in their submission to the Minister some months ago urged this amendment, pointing out the big number of Irish industries which draw on the Industrial Credit Company for short to medium-term capital in place of bank accommodation. This is a very significant feature of the development of the Irish economy; the banks are not being relied upon to the extent that they were in the past for short to medium-term industrial capital.</P>
      <P>Taking things by and large, ignoring the odd occasion when there may, perhaps, be intervention with the Industrial Credit Company, the work which they do, the capital which they advance to industries, is socially very desirable in the national interest and it is wrong that this should be hindered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an anomaly here.  The interest <Col N="360" /> on short-term loans is allowable, as the Minister knows, but the usual loan granted by the Industrial Credit Company over a period of ten, 15 or 20 years is normally redeemable by the borrower not on three months' notice, which would qualify as a short-term loan under the existing practice, but on six months' notice.  There is an obvious case for this relief and for synchronising the tax law with Industrial Credit Company practice.  The Industrial Credit Company is, after all, a State company.  It is owned and controlled by the Minister, and I feel confident that this amendment must be acceptable to him, particularly having regard to the recommendations submitted to him by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and to his predecessor's undertaking a year ago to have a pretty close look at this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could introduce a concession for my own company that would not be applicable generally.  I do not think this would be good practice or procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Credit Company operates on a commercial basis and it is competing in a certain market with other firms, many of them private.  If we were to make any changes in regard to the allowability of this interest for corporation profits tax purposes, then it would have to be of general application.  I do not think we could ask the private sector to tolerate some very special concession to the Industrial Credit Company.  In any event, I would be against doing it, because, as Deputy Byrne knows, this provision was introduced to prevent profits being distributed in the guise of interest.  If we had not some sort of provision, then a lot of capitalisation would be in the form of loans and the profits would be distributed in the form of interest and, of course, would qualify for relief for corporation profits tax purposes.  Therefore there is very good reason for retaining the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is somewhat of an academic question, because I understand there is a form of words which may be used in regard to these long-term loans <Col N="361" /> which gets over the difficulty from the point of view of the lender and the company concerned.  I think this device has been resorted to by many of the companies interested, including, I believe, the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point, as far as I am aware, Industrial Credit Company loans are never redeemable at the borrower's option at anything less than six months' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that this device of expressing the loan to be repayable at less than three months' notice has, on occasions, been availed of by a number of companies, including the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the Industrial Credit Company frequently figures in proposals for the development of new industry activated by the Industrial Development Authority and by An Foras Tionscal, proposals which are the subject of State grants of 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the necessary capital.  I am satisfied that it defeats the purpose of the Industrial Development Authority's work to quite an extent if hindrances are placed on the Industrial Credit Company by the Revenue authorities.  I think the Minister is being academic when he says he cannot do something for the Industrial Credit Company without doing it for merchant bankers and other commercial operators.  That cuts across the whole purpose for which our State companies are operated, which is a social purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Before section 26 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment the first £7,500 of any estate shall be exempt from estate duty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment means that the first £7,500 of an estate should be exempt from duty, and it also means that in estates over and above that value, the sum of £7,500 should be deducted from them before they are dutiable. As I know the position, at the moment, admitting that there have been some minor concessions in relation to estate duty over the past few years, up to the first £5,000 is exempt from estate duty, but if there is £1 over that, duty must be paid on the whole sum.  Therefore, the benefit the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners are offering in relation to estates is really negligible, and when we take into consideration the valuations as they were when this clause was first introduced a couple of years ago, it will be seen they bear no relation to valuations today.</P>
      <P>It does not take very much to run an estate up to £5,000 today.  It would be a very small farm that one would not pay £5,000 for today.  The value of land is increasing all the time.  If one takes into consideration such things as livestock, machinery and so forth, the £5,000 will be reached very easily.  It is for that reason I am urging the Minister to go a little further and extend it to £7,500.  When one comes to the urban area and considers the value of house property, a figure of £5,000 can be reached very easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> I believe estate duty is immoral.  I have always believed that and I have raised this matter every year since I came into the Dáil and I intend to continue raising it so long as I remain in the Dáil.  Estate duty imposes a considerable hardship on the lower and middle income groups.  I realise that it is the duty of the Minister's advisers to resist any revolutionary change in taxation.  My amendment last year was rejected, even though I pointed out that this estate duty acts as a disincentive to saving.  If this duty were abolished, there would be an inflow of capital and we all know that we are suffering from a serious lack of capital in expanding our economy.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance published a document recently entitled &ldquo;Work for All&rdquo;.  At page 12 there is a heading &ldquo;Saving for Investment&rdquo;. I will read what is stated here for the edification of the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out earlier that a big increase in national savings is needed to provide money for new investment.  No one policy will achieve a dramatic rise in savings by individuals, savings by private and public companies and savings made by the Government spending less than its gets in taxes.</P>
    <P>In Ireland today, the effort devoted to persuading people to save is small compared with that employed to persuade people to spend.</P>
    <P>It is possible for thrifty, hardworking people, with comparatively small incomes, to save considerable sums throughout their lifetime, with advantage to the State and to the economy as a whole.  Estate duty acts as a direct disincentive to such saving. I am sure the Minister will not accept this.</P>

      <P>Shakespeare said &ldquo;Hope springs eternal in the human breast&rdquo;.  Deputy Byrne fought a lone battle for years for medical expenses.  He carried the day.  I suppose I cannot hope to carry my point today, but I have hopes for the future.  It is <Col N="364" /> more likely that the present Minister may be inclined to accept something on the lines of my amendment as compared with his predecessors.</P>
      <P>The document continues:</P>
      <P>The balance between these two kinds of persuasion is clearly out of line with the longer-term goals of the country.  People must be persuaded to save more and save regularly.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance would seem to be going all the way with me here.</P>
      <P>And there should be direct incentives to encourage them.</P>
      <P>Is there any more direct incentive to encourage people to save than the feeling that their savings will not be swiped from them eventually in estate duty?  The Government have produced many documents, some meaningless, some with some grist in them, but this is one of the most interesting and illuminating ever produced.  At page 9 we find the statement:</P>
      <P>Money for investment is scarce and likely to get scarcer.  National savings are the only reliable source and they must be substantially raised.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance is going all the way with me in this illuminating document.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>And the <Col N="365" /> Department of Finance seem to be accepting the suggestion I am putting forward.  They make such an admirable case that they have made my contribution here on this amendment a very easy task indeed.</P>
      <P>But even at the most optimistic reckoning they would not be large enough, for a long time to cover the investment we need.  Even if all the external investments now owned by Irish residents were realised, and the proceeds re-invested in Ireland, we would still need help from abroad.  We would have to use this borrowed money to create enough new exports at least to pay for the interest on the debt.</P>
      <P>Is it not perfectly obvious that, if the Minister takes this step&mdash;it may be a revolutionary step&mdash;and frees the first £7,500, there will be an immediate inflow of capital?  Everyone today is being advised by accountants, economists and financiers as to how they can best escape estate duty.  We want money and want it badly.  The return from estate duty is not very big.  Apart from that there is another issue.  I know&mdash;I am sure the Minister knows &mdash;the considerable hardship caused in the middle income groups when widows are compelled to dispose of property or borrow from the bank in order to pay estate duty.  I am not asking very much really.  I want to establish if I can, the principle of the thing, namely, that whatever reliefs are given will be deducted from the whole estate.  If they are deducted from the whole estate, something has been achieved, a principle has been established and it has been recognised by the present Minister for Finance that hardship is being imposed on people.  It is also recognised that there will be an incentive to save and there will be an incentive for small savings, and they are what will really come because it is the bulk of the residents in the State who produce the money for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider what I have said.  Even if he turns me down perhaps he will be good enough to tell me in what way I am wrong in the arguments I have put <Col N="366" /> before the House.  I am not an economist and I am not an accountant but I am a realist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy modestly says he is not looking for much.  In fact, he is: he is asking for a very great deal.  There is an exemption in this country for small estates under £5,000.  Then the scale starts at one per cent on estates between £5,000 and £6,000, and so on, until for estates over £100,000 the rate is 40 per cent.  The Deputy is asking, in the first place, that that £5,000 exemption limit be extended to £7,500.  In other words his proposition first of all is that all estates under £7,500 should be exempt.  The Deputy is going farther than that.  He wants to exempt the first £7,500 on all estates.  That would cost £1 million if the rates of duty were not affected.  We do not do that at the moment in regard to the £5,000.  It is only if the estate is under £5,000 that it is exempt.  If it is £6,000, you pay on the full £6,000 at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>If we were to exempt from estate duty and from aggregation the first £7,500 of all estates, it would be enormously expensive because it would not be £7,500 at the low rates but at the top because the whole estate would move down to a lower rate, maybe from 40 per cent in some cases, 20 per cent in others and so on, so it would be enormously expensive if we were to do that which Deputy Esmonde suggests. It would be £1 million for the full year to do even the limited thing of exempting the first £7,500 of all estates without altering the rates of duty.</P>
      <P>We have not been doing too badly in this business of exempting small estates.  Between 1894 and 1951, £100 was the exemption limit.  Any estate over £100 paid estate duty.  In 1951, the limit was increased to £2,000.  That lasted until 1960 when the £2,000 was increased to £5,000.  In addition to the fact that any estate which does not reach £5,000 is completely exempt, there are two other factors to which I wish to draw attention.  One is the question of marginal relief and the other is abatement of duty in the case of widows and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Marginal relief has a bearing on that question.  When an estate is slightly over the figure which brings it into a higher bracket, marginal relief applies, so that a person does not suddenly jump from one rate to another with fairly severe consequences.  I think most Deputies know how this marginal relief works.  Take, for instance, a figure of £6,000.  Suppose an estate is £6,010. The duty payable on £6,010, is one per cent on £6,000 plus the amount by which the estate exceeds £6,000, that is, plus £10, so the duty payable on an estate of £6,010 would be £70 because of the operation of marginal relief.</P>
    <P>From the social point of view, by far the most important aspect of this matter is the allowances which have been introduced in respect of widows and dependent children.  The net effect of this is that if the estate goes to one dependent child only, there is no liability if the estate does not exceed £8,010, and so on.  If there is a widow with no dependent children, an estate of up to £8,750 is exempt.  If there are two children and no widow then the exemption limit is £10,100 and so on, until if there is a widow and seven children the exemption limit is £17,850. I think these are fairly reasonable concessions. I am not sure, when Deputy Esmonde was putting down his amendment, if he was concerned with the position generally or was adverting specially to the case of widows and children.  There are fairly generous provisions in regard to them under the existing legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given any reply to my suggestion that, by doing this, it would be an incentive for a inflow of money into this country and an incentive for savings too.  That is one of the three reasons I mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of our attracting foreign money, if we were to make concessions with regard to estate duty, is a very debatable point. There is a great deal of argument about this.  Today, most other countries have their estate duty affairs so arranged that it is very difficult indeed for anybody to come here and escape <Col N="368" /> the death duty of the country which he has left, very difficult indeed.</P>

If it does not, if his £3 million or £4 million is collected from small estates, then in my opinion it is a waste of money because more and more officials are required to administer it.  If you take £7,500 from an estate worth £100,000, you encourage a man to come here and invest money, which would be good business.  I do not think the Minister has answered that.</P>

      <P>Like so many features of our finance laws which have come from Britain, these have been tailored for a wealthy country and they are quite unsuitable to Irish conditions.  To my mind the burden of estate duties falls on relatively small estates and the <Col N="370" /> effect of inflation is such that very ordinary, modest-living people with modest incomes of £1,500 or £2,000 nowadays, by reason of the theft of inflation, die and leave a small two by four house in the Dublin suburbs which is valued at £5,000 or £6,000 for the purpose of death duties.  The man who some years ago was well insured and considered he was doing well by his dependants if he had insurance of £2,000 or £3,000 must now, to make any reasonable provision for his dependents, cover himself for £10,000 or £15,000, thereby bringing his estate into this net.  It is socially most undesirable and to my mind very unjust.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress on this Estimate on Thursday last, I was referring to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  When speaking on that Agreement, I mentioned that from what we heard from the then Minister, the farmers could expect to be millionaires at the end of that year, but what we saw during 1966 was quite contrary to what we were led to expect. We saw poorer prices for cattle, prices which consistently dropped, and poorer prices for farming products.  That was quite contrary to what was forecast in this House.  We also saw unrest during that period and, indeed, even up to the present time there is grave unrest amongst the farming community.</P>
      <P>We have seen members of the NFA brought to court; we have seen them jailed.  At times when it suited the Government, prior to elections, we have seen fines being mitigated and decent farmers released.  We saw similar happenings in May last on the eve of the Spring Show.  Now I am happy to see that, since I was speaking here last Thursday, more farmers have been released.  I hope the Government are not just biding their time until after the local elections, because it seems to be a happy trick of theirs on occasions such as this to give the impression of a softening of their hearts.</P>
      <P>Some people may hold a certain view about the activities which took place last June, the road blockage, but I believe that due to the treatment the farmers got from the Minister and the Government, members of this organisation, and farmers in general, were driven to the point of going outside the law.  Anyone who is antagonised must lose his patience at some stage, and if ever any section of the community were antagonised, they were antagonised by the previous Minister for Agriculture and by the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>When I was interrupted I was speaking about the cause of these troubles.  I have asserted what the reason was, in my view.  I suppose Members on the Government side of the House expect me to refrain from making any such statement, but it would be very hard to speak on this Estimate without referring to what has taken place over the past 12 months and the way in which the farmers have been treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in my constituency on the Monday before the decision was taken by the general executive with regard <Col N="376" /> to the calling off of the no rates campaign that the Minister for Justice unleashed his troops.  Not only the Garda but also the Army came into Kilkenny at an early hour of the morning to start their seizures.  That was done purely to antagonise the members of the NFA on that occasion. Anybody who had his ear to the ground at all or who was keeping in touch with events realised that a decision was to be taken during that week.  I mention that in passing and I hope that in my constituency we will never again see a Government here taking the attitude that was taken on that Monday.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned falling cattle prices and, in that regard, I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister: his Department should consider a guaranteed floor price for beef cattle in the period January until April.  I suggest this for the reason that we find in the months of November and December&mdash;in other words, the end of the year and the end of the grass season&mdash;a glut of cattle on the market because people have no faith in prices for stall-fed cattle.  I should be glad if the Minister and his Department would examine the position with a view to giving a guaranteed floor price, at least for the first four months of the year, from January till April.  That would encourage the farming community as a whole with regard to cattle production.  In other words, we would not have this complete glut of cattle on the market during November and December, with consequential loss to many farmers.</P>
    <P>The derating of agricultural land given in this year's Budget will, I hope, be of some benefit to the farming community generally, and particularly to the small farmers.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Finance and the Government took a line from Fine Gael policy in this respect.  Whilst it may have been worded differently, it certainly followed the same lines.  I believe that to the small farmer within the appropriate poor law valuation, it will be a help that is really necessary. But, for the life of me, I cannot understand how some of the small farmers have survived at all during the past few <Col N="377" /> years.  Here again I might add that any of the benefits that have been given were given because of pressure from the farming community.  Whilst £5 million is something, I think it is not a lot to give out of the Exchequer to our main industry, agriculture.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figures in the Minister's statement on the acreage of crops, one particular figure struck me forcibly. Coming from a constituency, Carlow, where we have a sugar factory, I find it quite alarming to see, in Appendix I, that in 1959 the acreage under sugar beet was 69,200.  There was a slight fall in 1960 to 68,306 acres and it increased again in 1963 to 83,300 acres.  In 1964 the acreage under sugar beet was 79,800 and in 1965, it dropped to 65,548.  It is most disappointing to find in 1966 a drop in the acreage to 53,500, which is practically 16,000 acres less than we had in 1959.  That figure is disturbing and there must be a cause for it.  The farmers do not look on beet as a paying crop and this is something that does not augur well for the future of that industry.  I hope these figures will show an improvement.</P>
    <P>In Appendix II, there is another striking point.  Under the heading of &ldquo;poultry&rdquo;, the June enumeration shows, in 1959, a figure of £1,235,800 which in 1966, went down to £507,200. It is disappointing to see such a drop, for the reason that the money the small producer got from the turkey trade was always in circulation.  The money the small farmer got for turkeys was spent during the Christmas time and it never went from the farmer directly to the bank but was usually spent by the farmer's wife on the necessaries of life, and it does not augur well to see such a drop in that figure.</P>
    <P>I notice that the volume of gross agricultural output in 1966 is lower than in 1965.  The net output rose.  The figure given is £247 million in 1966 as compared with £252 million in 1965. There again there is a drop of £5 million.  This, in the context of my opening remarks about cattle prices, clearly shows that the decline was mainly due to the fall in cattle prices during the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House <Col N="378" /> longer, having made these few points on the Estimate.  I had a note on the constitution of the committees of agriculture but, as we dealt with that point last week and the House took a stand on it, there is no need to discuss it on the Estimate.  It is surprising to note that a previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, brought an amendment to the House which was never given a chance to operate.  I am wondering what is at the back of the Minister's mind when he brings in the amendment which went through this House today and which we opposed here last week.</P>
    <P>I suppose at this stage one should refrain from referring to the National Farmers Association because it seems to annoy some of the people in this House.  Whilst that association may have been driven by the Minister for Agriculture and the Government to going outside the law, the advice I would give them&mdash;which I think has been given in this House already&mdash;is that the best way to make themselves felt is when the opportunity arises on 28th June.  That is the time when the farmers will have an opportunity and, I hope, will use it, to make their discontent felt in the ballot boxes in the local elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I wish to relate my remarks on this Estimate to the position as it exists in the constituency of Cavan, and constituencies of that sort, such as Monaghan, Longford and neighbouring constituencies.  The Cavan constituency might be regarded as a typically small farming constituency.  County Cavan is not regarded as a county deserving to be classed as a congested district, as a county which needs very special assistance from the Government. Therefore, we may take it that it is a county which the Government believe should be able to support a community of small farmers in reasonable comfort.  Indeed, it is a county where farming is carried on on a mixed basis.  We have some dairy farming; farmers who raise and sell dropped calves.  Some farmers keep them until they are yearlings and sell them as yearlings; some of them keep them until they are two years old or even <Col N="379" /> fat cattle and then sell them.  Cavan was a county which was noted as a pig rearing area and a county where a farmer's wife was able to run a house on the sale of poultry and eggs.</P>
      <P>In addition, many small farmers in my constituency supplemented their incomes by taking work in factories, where it was available.  Many were employed on the roads and were glad to get road work.  I am afraid the lot of that type of farmer is a very sorry one at the present time.  It is no exaggeration to say that not for many years have dropped calves and yearling animals been such a bad price.  They are down up to £20 compared with two years ago.  Dropped calves are now fetching from £4 to £12, as against £24 to £30 a couple of years ago.  Even strong cattle have taken a very severe hammering.  Farmers are inclined to try to hold on to their stock in desperation in the hope that prices will improve, but the contrary seems to be the position as far as young cattle are concerned, and as I have said, my county is primarily concerned with young cattle.</P>
      <P>The heifer subsidy scheme, introduced a few years ago, did not inject any money into the farming economy of County Cavan.  The farms are small; most of the farmers were carrying as many cows as the farms could support. Perhaps a few, comparatively speaking, big farmers here and there throughout the county may have got a good few heifers passed for subsidy but, by and large, the heifer subsidy scheme has been responsible for the present condition of farmers' incomes in County Cavan.  The small farmers got nothing out of it.  There was nothing in it for them; they could not carry any more cattle.  But the scheme seems to have created a glut of young cattle, some of an inferior quality, on the market and, instead of helping the small farmer of Ireland in general, it seems to have had the effect of depressing the price of cattle he has to sell.  That seems to have been the net result of the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was ill-conceived.  There was nothing selective about it and no effort was made to ensure that only <Col N="380" /> heifers of the right type for breeding would be put in calf.  It was there for all, and anything that was capable of carrying a calf seemed to qualify for a subsidy.  We know that the year the scheme first came into operation farmers switched overnight from dry stock to heifers in some parts of the country.  In the major counties, they collected subsidies on hundreds of heifers, people who were not in the dairy business at all, who had no interest in dairy farming.  The net result of the whole thing seems to have been that the price of cattle has been depressed.</P>
    <P>We were told on the mid-day radio news today there will be 150,000 surplus cattle in the country this year. People who are not so optimistic believe that figure will be doubled, that the figure of 150,000 is a very conservative one.  What will become of those cattle?  The same news bulletin stated that the Institute believes there will be no market in the Common Market countries, that we cannot expect anything there.  We remember the efforts of the Minister's predecessor last year when he panicked, came back and strutted around the House for two days and then stated at Question Time: &ldquo;Oh, wait till you hear the good news I will have tomorrow; you will be disappointed&rdquo;, the good news of course being that he had found a market for 2,000 cattle in Germany, which never materialised.  Even if it had materialised, 2,000 cattle is a very long way from the 300,000 or even the 150,000 which, according to official figures, we will have as a surplus this year.</P>
    <P>The Government have a grave responsibility to the country and the farmers for failing to plan or give any thought as to what they would do with this surplus of cattle when it was created.  Of course one of the things the former Taoiseach did was to take a tremendous gamble on getting into the Common Market hoping that, when we got into the Common Market, all our troubles would be at an end.  The gamble did not come off and we are paying the price now.</P>
    <P>The big industry is practically at a standstill in the counties of Monaghan and Cavan where once, and not so <Col N="381" /> very long ago, it flourished.  People simply have got out of pigs because there was no profit in them.  The margin of profit would not justify the effort.  The price of feeding stuffs was too high.  There you have it.  It is admitted now that we cannot fill our quota to the British market, that bacon factories in the country are panicking and looking for pigs and cannot get them.  It will be very hard to entice or encourage people back into the pig industry in these counties unless they have some sort of a fairly long-term assurance that, as soon as they get back into it, the bottom will not fall out of it again.  That has been their experience.</P>
    <P>The people of these counties of mixed farming are not afraid to work; they are anxious to work if they can get any reasonable return.  I suppose it is nearly a waste of time to talk about poultry but poultry was a very valuable source of income in these counties.  It was an accepted fact that a farmer's wife who was industrious and anxious to play her part in contributing to the family income could run the house on the poultry and that by carrying a couple of buckets of eggs to the end of the lane to the egg collector, she could buy her groceries and have cash back.  That is finished. Therefore, the position of these farmers is really serious.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the farmers in Monaghan and Cavan and such counties are not afraid to work.  I have known plenty of those men who worked on the roads for five and a half days a week and later five days a week, having worked on their farms before going off in the morning, when they came home at night and on their half day or day off in order to get a living.  The bottom has fallen out of their cattle trade.  The pig industry is non-existent and poultry is gone.  The latest we hear is that the road work from which the small farmer supplemented his income is gone.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;by 25 per cent in every county. The Government are keeping it quiet but they cannot deny it.  That is another source of income gone for the small farmer.  Not alone is the Road Fund being reduced to the tune of £1,211,000, but the county councils have been notified within the past couple of weeks that the road grants have been reduced by as much as 25 per cent.  This means that those small farmers who are prepared to get out and work on the roads are to be deprived of this work now through Government intervention.  This calls for an explanation from the Government. It calls for an effort by the Minister for Agriculture to do something to make up for this loss of income in the form of education in road grants in every county in Ireland. Certainly some effort should be made to do something about it in the counties of small farmers where the farmers supplemented their incomes by engaging in this road work.</P>
      <P>While talking about roads, I should like to say that many farmers are very badly served with roads and with common lanes leading to groups of farmers' houses.  I would appeal to the Minister to extend the farm improvements scheme which at present only covers a lane leading to one farm to lanes leading to groups of farmers' houses, because, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the rural improvements scheme which catered for this sort of case has also been suspended since 1965 and we are told that there are enough cases on hands to meet the revenue and the officers of the Department for the current year.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture and his Parliamentary Secretary are not responsible for the operation of the rural improvements scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am well aware of it, but what I am appealing to the Minister to do is to extend this scheme for which he is responsible, the farm improvement scheme, to lanes leading to several <Col N="383" /> farmers' houses.  In view of the scrapping of the other scheme, it is not an unreasonable request.</P>
      <P>I have already said that the ill-advised heifer scheme, ill-advised in the form in which it was conceived and operated, is creating a glut of unsaleable cattle and the Minister and his predecessors did nothing to anticipate that glut or to find alternative markets for the cattle they were encouraging farmers to produce.  Nor indeed have they done anything to enable farmers to feed these cattle over any given period.</P>
      <P>Nitrogen is an artificial manure essential for producing grass.  It is costing about £22 a ton a year whereas it is costing £14 a ton, approximately, across the Border.  That is a source of annoyance to farmers in my area who say their neighbours in Fermanagh and Armagh are enjoying the benefits of the application of nitrogenous manures at £7 a ton less than they can be bought for here.  It is something the Minister should do something about.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible to the House for the activities of Bord na gCon.  Bord na gCon, when they took over control of greyhound racing, assured greyhound owners they would assist them by ploughing back any money they collected into the industry, by reducing overhead expenses, by reducing travelling expenses and by making the rearing, the racing and the selling of greyhounds a more profitable activity.  There is concern among greyhound owners at the moment, especially those who race on the smaller tracks, about the proposal to reduce the qualifying time from 32 seconds to 31.75 seconds.  Before the Board imposed regulations, as we all know, one could race a dog if he had done only 37 seconds around a track, but a qualifying time of 32 seconds was imposed and an owner had to keep trying his dog until he got his time down to 32 seconds before he could enter him for a race.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This involved a few extra trials, at extra cost and extra travel.  For some reason or another now the proposal is to reduce the qualifying time to 31.75 <Col N="384" /> seconds and the feeling in the industry is that this will have the effect of adding to the overhead expenses of the small man who goes in for breeding, racing and selling greyhounds.  Indeed, I do not think it is likely to improve to any appreciable extent the standard of racing or to eliminate any malpractices which may exist in the industry. I therefore ask the Minister to consider whether this proposal should be allowed to proceed.  I am assured by responsible people that it is unnecessary, that it will not attain anything and that it will add to the cost and the trouble and the inconvenience of greyhound owners, that it will take up more of the time of people who engage in greyhound racing as a parttime business.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be proper to let this Estimate pass without making some reference to the deplorable relationship existing between the organised farmers and the Government during the past couple of years, particularly during the past six months. Whatever our ambitions are, however we think the economy of the country should develop, there is the one inescapable fact that this is basically an agricultural country, that we are either a success or a failure according to agricultural standards, that we either develop a successful economy based on agriculture or we are a failure.</P>
    <P>Most of us, no matter what walk of life we may be in or however we earn our living, can immediately trace our upbringing, our existence, to farming stock.  Most of us indeed were reared on farms, small, medium or large, and all of us in Ireland, wherever we are, whether we are businessmen, industrialists, professional men, are all proud to be able to say: &ldquo;I was reared on a farm,&rdquo;&ldquo;My father was a farmer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;My grandfather was a farmer in such and such a place.&rdquo;  We all regard it as the hallmark of a stake in the country; we all regard our associations with the land as something to be proud of.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think it is more than deplorable that a state of affairs has been allowed to develop, or should I say, has been promoted, by the Government in which farmers have been provoked into unlawful activities and have <Col N="385" /> been branded as criminals.  Notwithstanding the protestations of the Taoiseach and his Ministers, it is still going on.  I shall come back to it later.  We have the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers protesting that they want to get down to work with the farmers, that they want the farmers' organisations to come in and sit down at a round table conference and hammer things out with them in a reasonable way.  At the same time, we have the Minister responsible to the farmers indulging in petty acts such as withdrawing the services of a civil servant who had been appointed to sit on a selection board to select a secretary for Macra na Feirme.  What is to be gained by that sort of thing?  What is their object in doing this?  Is it not petty? Is it not something that disagreeing neighbours do?  At the same time, the Minister withdrew the services of another civil servant who had agreed to act as judge at a sheep-shearing competition or some such function. That is petty in the extreme.  It is nauseating.</P>
    <P>What is to be gained by this sort of pinpricking, this sort of conduct that is calculated to worsen relationships rather than improve them?  If there were any substantial issue at stake, one might be able to understand it.  I read about this in the papers over the week-end and it has not been contradicted. It baffled me at a time when the Taoiseach was receiving deputations and leading the country to believe that he wanted peace, that he was anxious for peace.  Does the Taoiseach know what his Ministers are at or does he approve of what they are doing?</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about this dispute because it is right that it should go on the records of this House, that both sides of this dispute should go on the records of this House, even for the twentieth time.  I believe that the dispute between the NFA and the Government, is, in fact, a dispute between the farmers and the Government. If any evidence were needed to corroborate that, the commodity strike proved it beyond doubt.</P>

It did not develop, in my opinion, within the past six months, the past 12 months or the past two years.  It is something which has been developing over a long number of years.  It is, in my opinion, due to the fact that this Government and previous Fianna Fáil Governments have taken the agricultural community for granted on the basis that they would not have them at any rate.  They have had no policy for agriculture calculated to improve agriculture or to improve the income or the lot of the Irish farmers. Over the past 35 years, with a break of six years, successive Fianna Fáil Governments have been tinkering around with agriculture.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This came to boiling point 12 months ago.  I will leave this by saying that the situation which came to a head <Col N="387" /> between the farmers of Ireland and the Government in the past 12 months was simply and solely the coming home to roost of the Government chickens.  It was inevitable that it had to come.  It came to a head by a march on Dublin city towards the end of last year.  This was a peaceful march by farmers from the four corners of Ireland.  They marched to Dublin and were joined by thousands of their fellow farmers in a demonstration.</P>
      <P>What were they demonstrating? They were demonstrating to the country that they had a grievance, that in the past 12 months their incomes had fallen considerably.  Indeed, they were pointing out that since 1953 while other incomes tended to increase the farmers' incomes remained static or went back.  They were protesting that a state of affairs had been reached within the last financial year, which we are discussing here, which had become unbearable and a state of affairs which could not any longer be tolerated by the farming community. You know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, while the Government and the Minister disagreed rather violently with the march, the demonstration and the protest, they seemed to admit that what the farmers were saying was the truth. Whatever else we may say about the Minister, he has put on the record of this House in his speech introducing this Estimate, that the farmers' incomes fell by £6 million in the past 12 months. That is exactly what the farmers were saying.  They were demanding that the Minister and the Government should do something about this.  They had no access to newspapers or television. They adopted this rather unique way perhaps of bringing their claim home to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did the Government do about it?  The Minister's predecessor&mdash;he was in this House this evening when this debate began and could not sit for even two minutes listening to the remarks of a previous speaker without getting hot&mdash;refused to meet the farmers.  He defied them.  He may say what he likes about their demands being unreasonable, but the fact is he did not hear their demands and did not <Col N="388" /> receive them.  He pulled up in his Mercedes outside his office and walked over them to get to his office.  He left them sitting there.  It was generally agreed by all who saw their demonstration that it was a peaceful, law-abiding process.  The general reaction throughout the country was that it was a credit to those who took part in it.  But the Minister's predecessor decided to ignore the farmers and to let them sit there in the gutter until they cooled themselves, as he said.</P>
    <P>One thing followed another.  By-elections came on; there was a change of Taoiseach and a change of Minister but not, I regret to say, a change of heart.  The farmers were received by the outgoing Taoiseach and his Minister in order to get them off the steps so that the incoming Taoiseach and his new Minister might not be embarrassed and so that the Party might not be embarrassed in the by-elections. But the assurances given to the farmers were not fulfilled.  They were goaded into carrying out further demonstrations and into adopting other methods to bring their grievances to the notice of the public.</P>
    <P>These methods ran contrary to the law of the country; but, as has been said previously in this House, there are two sides to every wrong.  How often has it been said in the courts that if there were no receivers there would be no thieves?  The receiver who encourages the thief is regarded by the law as being guilty of a much more serious and reprehensible crime than the thief.  I say that the Government and the Minister who drove the farmers into breaking the law have much more to answer for than the farmers who, as a last resort, blocked the bridges and roads for 12 hours.  This was not something done by surprise.  It was well known it was going to happen.  It was announced in advance.  Apparently, the Government decided to let it go, and then changed their mind.  So far as I am aware, they did not issue any warning beforehand that if the farmers engaged in this sort of activity they would be dealt with.  They were then brought before the courts, tried as criminals, sentenced, as would appear, by <Col N="389" /> arrangement throughout the length and breadth of this country, and put into prison.  A number of unusual methods were employed for first or isolated offenders.  Driving licences were suspended and bail bonds were insisted upon.</P>
    <P>In my considered opinion, these extreme measures of heavy fines, withdrawal of drivers' licences and recognisances were unnecessary and were calculated to do more harm than good. These things were insisted upon by the Attorney General on the instructions of the Government, not in order to prevent a recurrence of a breach of the Road Traffic Act, but, according to the Taoiseach and the Minister, in order that the rule of law might prevail, in order that the law would be upheld and would be seen to be upheld. The Taoiseach came on television and, white with fury, threatened that the sentences would be served and the recognisances entered into.  There was no necessity for those measures, for those prison sentences and for those recognisances.  That has been proved beyond doubt by the events of the past three or four days when the fines have been wiped out and the accused persons relieved from the obligation of entering into recognisances. That proves beyond yea or nay that it was never necessary to insist on these measures.  I wonder will the farmers who have paid fines of £10 or £20 have them refunded.</P>
    <P>Instead of adding to respect for law and order, the activity of the Government in relation to these prosecutions and appeals has done more to shake the confidence of the people of this country in the administration of justice than anything that has happened for a long time and has convinced them that the hand of the Government and the hand of the politician extends into the administration of the courts.  How otherwise, they are asking, could one set of courts all over the country automatically insist on recognisances, automatically withdraw driving licences and impose heavy fines, and at another time, on the invitation of the head of a Government to the people with whom he was rowing to appeal, could another set of courts in different parts <Col N="390" /> of the country come to a totally different decision?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> What I want to say, Sir, is that when the Taoiseach invited the farmers in prison to appeal, he made a statement with which I could not agree.  When asked would the Government support or oppose the appeals&mdash;and surely the conduct of the Government in relation to that is relevant &mdash; the Taoiseach emphasised that the Government had no part to play in these appeals, that the appeals were matters for the convicted persons and the courts.  Of course, being a lawyer himself, he knows that that is not so.  He knows that it is the duty of the Government, through their law officer, the Attorney General, to go into court on such appeals and to say: &ldquo;I, as the Attorney General, oppose these appeals&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I agree with them,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We are neutral in them.&rdquo;  It may not have a great deal to do with the Department of Agriculture as such but the Department of Agriculture has extended its lines into many things recently with which it would not seem to be totally concerned.  I will leave the matter by saying that these prosecutions and the general conduct of the Government, and the Minister in relation to them and in relation to the appeals, have done no useful service to the administration of justice or to respect for law and order.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That sort of thing needs an explanation, especially at this time when the Taoiseach is protesting that he wants peace, that he wants co-operation.</P>
      <P>The dispute of which I have been speaking was brought about, partly at any rate, by the demand or request for a meat marketing board and a national agricultural council.  The Minister's predecessor said: &ldquo;Right; we will give you a meat marketing board.&rdquo;  When the present Minister came in, he went back on that promise and said; &ldquo;I will not give you a meat marketing board.&rdquo;  I think a meat marketing board would be in the interests of the agricultural industry. It has not been tried.  Anything which might improve the present state of affairs in relation to prices and marketing is well worth trying.  In that respect I would suggest that the Minister might consider paying the beef subsidy direct to the farmers.  At present the beef subsidy is paid to the factories and the farmers are not satisfied that they are getting any worthwhile benefit from it.  It should not be beyond the powers of the Minister and his advisers, with their district veterinary offices and their offices in connection with bovine TB eradication and warble fly eradication and all the other agricultural offices and organisations, to devise a scheme whereby this subsidy would be paid direct to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> The Government over the past 12 months do not seem to have had any policy on agriculture.  There was a change of Ministers and change of policy but the one thing that seemed to be consistent all the time was: &ldquo;Keep your heel on the farmers.&rdquo; Why the marketing board was accepted by one Minister and his advisers and then turned down by another Minister and the same advisers is difficult to understand.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this council, as I understand it, was to put the views of responsible and organised agriculture to the Minister and his Department for serious consideration.  The intention was that these farmers' organisations would have access to the Minister, that he would hear from them what they thought, without, of course, any obligation to accept, that he would hear their views, that he would get a new slant on agricultural requirements, that he would have the benefit of a second opinion, so to speak, which he could weigh and consider and think about and implement in full or in part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as in the case of the meat marketing board, the Minister conceded that a national agricultural council was a good thing, that it could play a part in solving the many difficulties confronting the agricultural industry.  At least, he appeared to accept it but I am afraid that the body which he set up could not reasonably command the respect of any group of open-minded or independent people in the country.  I regret to have to say that he loaded this council, and eventually formed a council which, instead of advising the Minister, would accept the Minister's views and put them across to the people.  The tin hat is put on the whole thing when the Minister himself becomes chairman of <Col N="393" /> the Council which is set up and designed to advise him for the purpose of bringing a breath of fresh air into his Department, for the purpose of putting across to him the views of organised agriculture.  We all know that a chairman, if he wishes to do so, can exercise a considerable influence on any body over which he presides. When the chairman is the Minister who wants to put across his policy, how much more so is that true?</P>
    <P>I venture to forecast that this National Agricultural Council will, within the next 12 months, fall asleep, cease to be heard, become a rubber stamp which will echo the Minister's views, or break up in disorder.  One of two things will happen and only time will tell which.  I sincerely hope it breaks up in disorder because, if it does, we shall then probably have it replaced by a worthwhile council that will fulfil the purposes which were in mind when it was advocated, and it was advocated by Deputy Clinton of this Party over a number of years.  But surely the type of national council which Deputy Clinton had in mind, which was calculated to advise the Minister, to bring a breath of fresh air to bear on the Minister's activities, was far removed from the rubber stamp which has been foisted on the farmers.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the Minister and some other Ministers of this Government have been denouncing the farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They have been alleging that intimidation is being exercised against non-NFA members who want to send their milk to the creameries, who want to send their cattle to the cattle marts, who do not want to become members of the NFA.  The general impression given by the Minister here is that this is wholesale and will have to be stamped out.  There is a fair number of NFA members in my constituency and in neighbouring constituencies, and I want to put on the records of this House that I have seen no intimidation nor have I heard of any intimidation.  I do not think it exists.  This is purely and simply an effort by this Minister, who is a good politician, who prides himself on having the know-how to win elections, <Col N="394" /> to drive a wedge between the urban community and the farming community on the eve of the local government elections, and an effort to go further and drive a wedge between one section of organised agriculture and another section on the eve of these elections, in the hope that he will divide and conquer, in the hope that he will win the local government elections.</P>
    <P>I do not think the people of Ireland will accept everything the Minister says on the eve of an election, because it is not so long since the same Minister, on the eve of an election, called a press conference, went on television, went on the radio, and commanded headlines in the national newspapers, to announce that he had discovered that thousands upon thousands of bogus letters had been poured into the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim on the eve of a by-election in an effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The relevancy is that the Minister who said that on that occasion cannot now be treated seriously when he says this on this occasion.  It was an effort on that occasion to blacken the Fine Gael organisation, to blacken the Fine Gael candidate and to secure the election in the by-election of Deputy Gibbons. When that allegation was investigated by the Garda, the thousands of bogus letters announced on television, at the press conference and in the national newspapers, reduced themselves to one solitary letter written by a practical joker in the locality to an elderly bachelor in the locality advising him to vote for the lady candidate in the election.  There was no prosecution, and the Government were glad to forget about it.  That is the man who was reckless enough to make that charge on the eve of that by-election, the man who is trying to blacken the farmers in the eyes of the urban dwellers for the same base political motive, and I do not think he will get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to talk strongly when one finds a Minister who should have the interests of agriculture and agricultural organisations at heart acting in a <Col N="395" /> manner calculated to disrupt these organisations, calculated to drive the farming community against the urban community and the urban community against the farming community.  As I said when opening, that is all the more deplorable when it is being done at a time when we are belatedly, 30 years belatedly, supposed to be preparing to take our place in the Common Market with the other countries who will join, when we should be encouraging harmony, when we should be enlisting the assistance of the best brains in the country, organised or unorganised, to prepare the country to meet the challenge which it will definitely have to meet as an agricultural country in the Common Market.  Instead of that, we treat the farmers, first, with the utmost contempt; then we subject them to the most extreme provocation and, having driven them to a state in which they are no longer able to resist that provocation, we brand them as criminals and put them into jail.  We leave them in jail but, when we think it is politically expedient to do so, we release them from jail.  That is not good enough, and I believe the people will not tolerate any longer a state of affairs in which the farmers and the farming community generally are treated in that fashion, reduced to second- or third-class citizens, ignored, provoked and imprisoned.</P>

      <P>During the course of this debate, there has been much to do by people whom I should like to regard as responsible but who, in my opinion, have acted in an irresponsible fashion, about a circular which emanated from the Department of Agriculture.  We had a former Minister for Agriculture, a man well acquainted with the Department, a man who knows the calibre of the officers serving in that Department, doing a disservice to the people who worked with him in that Department by his references to that <Col N="396" /> circular.  These officials work for agriculture, irrespective of what Government are in power.  By misrepresenting the circular, an effort has been made to drive a wedge between one of the best services and one of the best groups of public servants in the country and the people whom they serve.  We are aware that certain people were, in fact, not allowed to take their milk to or have it collected and brought to the creamery because they did not want to belong to a particular farming organisation. Every Member of this House should defend to the last the right and the prerogative of a farmer to be in every farming organisation or to be in none, if he so wishes, and anyone who tries to misrepresent the Department's attitude towards individuals and groups is not doing a service to the nation or, indeed, to the farming community. Contrary to what Deputy Clinton stated, this circular was not sent to anyone except officers of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were not complacent and will not be complacent about any field of endeavour in agriculture. We in Fianna Fáil have consistently, down the years, recognised agriculture for the important industry that it is.  We have treated it as a major part of the backbone and as one of the foundation stones of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, we are told that, of all the moneys in this Estimate, very little, in fact, gets down to the actual farmer.  I have here, and I would recommend it to those who are not informed on the matter, a rough graph of where the moneys go.  We find that 36.6 per cent of the moneys go in subsidy on dairy products.  The second highest sum, then, is 13.8 per cent for the improvement of land and buildings.  The lime and fertiliser subsidy accounts for 12.3 per cent and there is 9.5 per cent for <Col N="398" /> research, education and advisory services. For the improvement of livestock and livestock products the percentage is 3.6 and the meat and bacon export subsidy account for 7.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>It has also been challenged that it costs so much to run the Department and administer the services that very little percolates to the actual farmer but general administrative expenses accounted for only 3.4 per cent of the entire Vote.  It should be the aim of every person contributing to this debate to be realistic in these matters because the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is one of the most important Estimates to come before the House.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points which I should like to correct.  It would appear that Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was not completely informed when he said that Fianna Fáil, on the eve of the elections, agreed with everything in order to ensure that there would not be any picket on Government Buildings.  In fact, as each and every Member of the House is aware, that picket did start on 1st December and was in evidence at the vital time just prior to the by-elections in both Waterford and Kerry.</P>
    <P>Peculiarly enough, very little has been mentioned on the actual Estimate. Fine Gael have made a political plaything of a difference between a farming organisation and the Government. Not being very naïve myself as regards political matters, I probably might, in similar circumstances, be tempted to come out a little bit in that respect.  However, the one factor, the important issue, the Estimate itself, has been totally disregarded and we have had from Fine Gael a complete play up of a difference between a farming organisation and the Government. That has been made their main plank by Fine Gael in this important debate.  To my way of thinking, this is a big take-over bid by the Fine Gael Party for that farming organisation.  I would warn any farmers' party or any farming organisation or any farming group in this country to be careful of courting with Fine Gael because every <Col N="399" /> farmers' party or farmers' representative with whom Fine Gael ever came into contact was absorbed by them. You will find, in the benches opposite, many men who started off as independent farmers or farmers' candidates of one sort or another.  They found themselves taken under the umbrella of the Fine Gael colossus.  I think Fine Gael have highlighted their own inadequate position by virtue of the fact that they have no constructive opposition, within themselves, to this Government.  They have clutched with fantastic enthusiasm at the difficulties, and have, I think, contributed to keeping those difficulties going.</P>

      <P>Much ado about all difficulties and nothing by way of trying to help out and resolve the problems that are the nation's problems and that are the farmers' problems. Remember that an industry such as farming is the first to feel adverse waves in times of depression or recession and is one of the slowest to develop or to react to the injection of a stimulus.  Everything in farming is approximately at least on a twelve months' system.  Other people in other business and in other walks of life can quite easily change their methods and the type of business in which they are engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, we in Fianna Fáil have always been interested in the farming community.  I was reading Deputy Dillon's speech in 1950 when he asked our farmers to accept 1/- a gallon for milk.  It is interesting to look up the records now.  Fianna Fáil came into power almost immediately after that.  They were able to increase the price of a gallon of milk and, not alone that, but, to show how worthwhile it was, milk has now increased to 411 million gallons.  The Exchequer support for the creamery milk price amounted to £2.35 million in 1960-61, an average of 2d as related to the gallon.  The milk intake in 1960 was 281 million gallons, when the average return to suppliers was 19.44 pence.  Since then, increased sums have had to be provided by way of subsidy <Col N="400" /> towards the ever-increasing flow of milk to the creameries and the export of our dairy products.  The milk price increase at the rate of 1d a gallon was introduced in June, 1962, and this figure has progressively increased until, on 1st May, 1967, it reached 7d per gallon.  In all the years Fianna Fáil were in office, they showed in a very practical and positive way their real concern for the farming community and the dairy farmers in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1966-67, the entire cost of support for the milk industry was £13 million odd, or an average of 8d per gallon, and the corresponding figure for 1967-68 will amount to £17 million.  These are irrefutable facts and while we might all wish to see greater subsidies for agriculture, we must be realistic.  We know full well that only the nation's ability to pay will allow anything further at any particular time. In this country, proportionally speaking, we have probably the highest ratio of dependants, in so far as people under 15 and over 65 are concerned, people who are non-profit making, and it is the workers in between who must produce and be willing to pay the moneys that will allow for further expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the Fianna Fáil laid-down policy that never at any stage, in so far as the nation has the ability to pay, will we ever shirk our responsibility to the farmers.  Since 1960, three new creameries and 12 new separating stations have been established, ten of them in the western counties.  In addition, ten new plants were established for such diversified products as cheese, milk products and butter-oil.  This again shows our concern and our desire not to allow a <Col N="401" /> situation to arise in which farmers would not be able to take advantage of increased prices.  The vast increase in milk production and dairy production over the past decade has resulted in a considerable expansion of exports, from £9 million in 1960 to £22 million, in 1966.  Everybody realises that milk products are in surplus supply on world markets and there is the keenest competition for export outlets.  We are no different from every other country which finds it necessary to subsidise, in one form or another, its dairying exports and it can truthfully be said that the measures taken by the Government to secure foreign markets in which to sell our dairy products to the best advantage have, in the circumstances, been most effective.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bainne, which was established under the Dairy Products (Manufacture) Act, 1961 has in the face of intense competition been an unqualified success in disposing of our surplus dairy products abroad. The Free Trade Agreement with Britain has, of course, been of considerable assistance to the Board as this Agreement raised the basic Irish butter quota on the British market from less than 13,000 tons to 23,000 tons in 1966-67 and 26,000 tons in 1967-68.  This was the Agreement the people opposite have so often criticised and the Agreement that is working to the advantage, and is seen to be working to the advantage, of the Irish nation, and the farmers particularly. The past record of Fianna Fáil shows clearly that the farmers were their concern and will remain their concern as long as they are in government. There will be no sacrificing of any farmer on the altar of the gods as long as we have anything to do about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and to a certain degree berated them for not having made more money available. The Agricultural Credit Corporation, to my mind, and I am sure to the mind of any member who has had dealings with them, are one of the most courteous and efficient of our services. They have done a tremendous amount of good for the farming community. Unfortunately, money is not like manna from Heaven and they must <Col N="402" /> work to a budget, as each and every one of us must work.  This year they have reached a record level in their loans for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>In other fields of endeavour, Fianna Fáil have shown their concern for the farming community and the setting up of the National Agricultural Council, if all who are invited participate in it, will be an unqualified success.  The benefits of its work have already been seen and I am hopeful that the calibre of the men on it, and the contribution they have to make, will be seen not merely by this House but by the nation in the years to come.  I do not subscribe to Deputy Fitzpatrick's view that the NAC will break up or that, to use his exact words, it will cease to be heard of.  The National Agricultural Council in its advisory capacity to the Minister will prove to be one of the best steps forward in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Fine Gael will undermine us in every way possible. Why, I do not know.  If they claim they are interested in the farming community, they should not try to be destructive, or hope for the failure of this Council, but lend every possible support to it to ensure that its workings will be fruitful and efficient, with the minimum of disturbance.  The Taoiseach and the Minister have indicated their willingness and readiness to rectify and resolve the difficulties of this nation at every level.  It would be unfair of me to sit down without referring to that because I know, as indeed the nation knows, through press reports, that both the Minister and the Taoiseach have spent many long hours &mdash;on one occasion up to a late hour at night&mdash;in consultation with the executive of the NFA.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that the officials of the Department have never been, and have never acted as informers or spies, and never will.  They will continue to work for the benefit of the farming community and of the nation they have the privilege to serve.</P>

      <P>I have not had the advantage of listening to many of the Fine Gael contributions <Col N="403" /> to this debate so far, but I did take the trouble to read what many of them had to say in the Official Report.  I always like to read what Fine Gael lawyers and millers and shopkeepers have to say about Irish agriculture because it always has a common denominator. In my opinion, lawyers are not the best judges of agricultural matters.  It seems to me that in the ranks of the Fine Gael Party the scarcity of farmers is so noticeable that they have no one else to put up. So far as I know, in that Party they have not got a farmer on the Front Bench.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party have another propensity.  It is laughable to see the crocodile tears begin to stream down the legal jaws of Fine Gael when they refer to the small farmers.  I have often sat here and I almost developed a lump in my throat at the pathetic squeals from the Fine Gael lawyers from Dublin about the plight of the small farmers from Cork, Kerry, the West and probably my own constituency as well.  They tell the small farmer that Fianna Fáil have designed their downfall.  There is one Fine Gael Deputy who used to make the same speech about six times a year. He made the same speech on the Budget, on the Finance Bill, on the Estimate for the Department of Lands, on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture&mdash;about six times in all.  He used to say&mdash; and I could do the accent, Sir, but I have too much respect for the House&mdash;that it was the declared policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to run the small farmers out of the West.  With some variations on that theme, that is the Fine Gael attitude.</P>
      <P>I have been in this House for ten years now, and is it not remarkable that, with some notable exceptions like Deputy Tom O'Donnell, who makes a rational and intelligent contribution to this debate every year, the Fine Gael contributions to the debate on agriculture year after year are designed to aggravate a sense of grievance amongst the farmers in general, and since the small farmers are more numerous than any other farmers, this is aimed particularly at them.  As I say, it is revolting for a person like myself who comes from the land to be lectured upon the ills of Irish agriculture by Fine Gael lawyers and millers and other persons put up to speak about agriculture.</P>

      <P>If I were the organising secretary for Fine Gael&mdash;Lord save us from any such fate&mdash;I would <Col N="405" /> apply myself to the task of trying to enlist the support of the farmers of Ireland for my Party.  Since 1932, they failed to get it and, with their present attitude of duplicity, they will be farther than ever from getting it in the future than ever they were.  I should like to remind Fine Gael that this Party have never had to resort to duplicity in their dealings with the farmers, for many reasons, but most importantly because this Party consists in great measure of people who either come directly from the land as farmers or who have a distinctly agricultural background.</P>
      <P>There are undoubtedly many serious problems to be tackled in this matter of improving Irish agriculture.  That, I suppose, is the understatement of the year.  It is a massive and a serious task. I must confess that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have my sympathy in dealing with a problem of such massive proportions, because in the particular marketing climate in which we find ourselves, it is an extremely difficult task so to organise our agricultural undertakings as to give our farmers a respectable living. Difficult and all as it is, it is our intention as the Party in Government to achieve it.  I suppose we must confess that there are as many views upon how best to tackle this problem as there are facets to the problem itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear Fine Gael statisticians talking about the precise number of farmers and classifying them into different degrees of smallness and largeness, I often think that statistics give a somewhat false picture because I think we would all agree that while the Abstract of Statistics may give a certain number of hundreds of thousands of land holders in the country, it does not necessarily follow&mdash;in fact, it does not follow at all&mdash;that the owners of all these pieces of land make their living even in part from farming.  I do not know whether this has ever been done and, if it has not, I think it should be done.  An effort should be made to determine the number, approximately at any rate, of people who live on the land and derive their living from it exclusively in the first place, and then those who derive their living in part from it. <Col N="406" /> Until we do that, we will not be able to get the true picture of the actual dimensions of the agricultural problem. It is no harm to call it a problem because it is a problem that could well become more acute in the coming time.</P>
    <P>There are some optimistic people who feel that, if and when this country enters the European Economic Community, all our agricultural troubles will be over.  It is certain that we will have new opportunities and that certain drawbacks which we labour under now will be removed, but we must also remember that we will enter an era of pretty sharp competition.  In order to face that situation properly and with confidence, we certainly must face it with our ranks closed and with some form of united agreed policy on how we are to proceed in it.  I apologise to the House for talking about the small farmers because I feel that many sincere people have an instinctive revulsion when they hear politicians speaking about them and see so many insincere people shedding crocodile tears on the subject.  In spite of that, there appears to be an acute problem with regard to the living conditions of tens of thousands of our small farmers.</P>
    <P>Before we attempt an examination of his position in general, we should ask ourselves what does the small farmer want.  The quick answer is that he wants a better income and more money.  Having said that, we should ask ourselves by what means this can best be provided.  I suggest that the first thing we should consider is increasing the efficiency of production on farms of all sizes, but particularly on the small farms, and then more efficient marketing.  There should be better planning of production, better planning of husbandry, better stock breeding, better management and lower overheads.  This can be achieved but, as well, the farmer should have cheaper materials, cheaper fodder and cheaper fertilisers.</P>
    <P>There are some who would believe that all that is necessary to achieve these things is to kick up a row and ask the Government to provide them, but I believe, being a farmer, that most sensible people will agree that the best <Col N="407" /> way to achieve the objectives I have mentioned is by assisting the farmer to help himself.  At present anything the farmer produces is not, on a national scale anyway, produced on any planned pattern, but haphazardly. These tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of people make their own plans for their cropping programme every year and they buy and sell on the completely open market without any assistance from anybody, good, bad or indifferent except whatever assistance the Government provides in support of their products, their cattle and other things.</P>
    <P>If we depend on Government assistance, and on Government assistance alone, to solve the farming problem, we will see that he markets his produce as best he can.  Whether he has pigs to sell or barley, or whatever product he has, he goes on the completely competitive market all on his own and sometimes has to sell in competition with his neighbour.  He arranges his own crop rotation and his own stock breeding but he does those things largely without the assistance of anybody else or any agency and certainly without the benefit of any existing plan of marketing.</P>
    <P>Again, the farmer is always handicapped in these markets because of the high cost of materials, the high cost of fodder and the high cost of fertilisers. True enough, the Government have heavily subsidised the purchase of superphosphates and potash but sometimes, when I see these very colourful television advertisements by fertiliser companies and the enormously expensive campaigns they mount, I ask myself who is paying for all this and the answer obviously, in the long run, is our friend the small farmer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the farmers about whom we are talking, there is a very serious need for specialised training of young farmers.  I do not think that we are taking a sufficiently serious view of this.  The Department, as one of its activities, is providing assistance along this line but we will have to tackle the problem in a more radical <Col N="408" /> way in order to get the more realistic results we wish to achieve.</P>
    <P>I have often said in this House&mdash;I keep plugging it and shall continue to plug it&mdash;that I believe our best bet for the prosperity of the Irish farmer lies in the creation of a truly operative system of co-operatives, perhaps approached from a psychological point of view or something like that, a system of co-operation that actually works in effect and that covers all the aspects of farming work&mdash;farm production and marketing.</P>
    <P>Many decades have passed since Horace Plunkett and his friends started out on their great campaign to establish co-operatives in this country. The co-operatives they established reached a certain primitive stage but that movement has been arrested for several decades now.  Possibly that is a result of our history as an agricultural country in our grandfather's time when we had to fight a long and bitter war for the possession of the land we now own.  During all that long and bitter campaign our dearest aspiration and our dearest wish was to own the land, to manage the land and farm the land on which we live. After the many vicissitudes, trials and sufferings of our forefathers, we achieved this object and I suppose that now in every sense the Irish farmer is the freest man in the world.  It may well be that, in order to improve our standards of living, we should possibly relinquish some of this fierce spirit of independence that was imbued in us in our forefathers' time.  Instead of insisting on being, and living totally as, individuals, we must realise that our own future wellbeing as farmers will depend, in the ultimate, not only on ourselves but on our neighbours and our efforts and our neighbours' efforts must be welded together to give a real co-operative movement, before the Minister or the Department or anybody else can do anything really worthwhile for the great mass of people about whom our friends at the far side of the House have been talking.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the stunting of the development of the co-operative movement.  I see my colleague, Deputy Crotty, sitting opposite.  He and I share a constituency where there are <Col N="409" /> 22 small co-operative units.  Some of them are highly efficient and others are not quite so efficient.  Some of them are probably a bit too small for separate existence, but it is my contention&mdash;and I have often aired this view before&mdash;that no matter how big they are, they are still too small to continue, as I have said before, little republics, living completely detached from other co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Another serious drawback about most of them is that efficient though they may be in the handling of farmers' milk, their activity ends there. In general, what the co-operatives have developed into are little butter factories. In some cases they produce other things, like powdered milk. There are one or two who increase the depth of their interest in their shareholders and in the farmers in their areas, but, in general, it is fair and true to say they show little or no interest in the basic raw material of milk in the first place, which is grass.  They show no interest that I have ever noticed on a general scale in the other goods the farmer produces; they are strictly little milk factories and, probably, the structure of the apparatus they have for conducting their business is a little out-dated and capable of improvement.</P>
    <P>We all know creamery societies where the men who are now members of the committees are the sons or even the grandsons of the men who founded the societies.  It becomes like a little title or an honour conferred upon people: when one is a member of the creamery committee, one has a certain status.  But a co-operative undertaking conducted by people who have nothing else to recommend them except that they are their fathers' sons is destined not to prosper.  Their activities will be isolated and circumscribed.  We have seen this situation time and time again, two neighbouring creameries competing, and competing with great ferocity, over milk suppliers in some border area.  They will compete with each other and with private enterprise in the sale of all sorts of things.</P>
    <P>The former Deputy Moher, who is no longer in this House, used to refer with some facetiousness to a creamery down in Cork which dealt with ladies' <Col N="410" /> foundation garments, handles on buckets, plastic clothes pegs, and the most extraordinary things and, at the same time, the standard of cattle breeding in that creamery area might be pathetically bad.  The production of grass might be as low as you could get and this is, I am afraid, still the case in many parts of Munster I have seen.  I am glad to say that in this part of the country, in the province of Leinster, grass is becoming more and more a carefully husbanded crop.  But in some parts of the country it is regarded as something which just grows and the co-operatives in the areas do not take the slightest interest in it.  When a farmer brings in his milk, they measure it and pay him for what he has delivered, and that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there are so many things that could be done by a truly organised and united co-operative movement.  We have long since entered into an age where things such as milk quality are absolutely essential.  You cannot have good milk quality without good buildings. If it were not for the assistance given by the Department of Agriculture alone in this matter, our buildings would still be completely unsuitable: good byres that may have done well enough in their day will not be suitable for the type of market we will be getting. Even in dairy areas, all these commodities one could call secondary production, production of commodities such as wheat and barley are very important.  It is, I am afraid, completely unsystematic and unregulated and as far as the creameries go, they have no interest in cattle breeding.  I know there are exceptional societies. In my own constituency, there is one which takes a great interest in cattle breeding and has a scheme for the provision of highly selected heifers for their members.  This is an isolated attempt on the part of the enterprising committee and manager to help their members but the trouble and the tragedy of it is that it is isolated. Somebody else may have big projects, excellent in their own way, but the trouble is that each society is completely isolated from every other society.  If we want to get a really <Col N="411" /> concrete effect, we will have to overcome this bottleneck which has persisted for decades, and will continue to persist unless this extremely formidable problem is tackled radically.</P>
    <P>I have faith in the Minister.  He is a man of great energy, great resource and great persistence.  I feel sure he recognises what I say.  Anyway, the problem is there to be tackled.  Until we do tackle it and overcome it, everything our friends opposite say, everything anybody else says&mdash;the wringing of hands and the shedding of crocodile tears&mdash;will all be in vain.  If we could weld all these small co-operatives into one, or possibly a small number of really large combines, I am certain these elementary problems such as the high cost of machinery hireage or machinery ownership on the part of farmers would be solved.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose Fine Gael would know, because there are very few farmers in Fine Gael, but certainly my own colleagues in this Party know, how extremely difficult it is for a farmer of a limited acreage to own a tractor to do his tillage operations, indeed to do any kind of mechanised operations on his land.  Sometimes the ownership of such a tractor can be prohibitively expensive.  There are in the country isolated examples.  My friend, the former Deputy Moher, whose contribution to this debate is always sadly missed, used to tell of a machinery undertaking in Mitchelstown where the farmers in that locality might have five acres of wheat and five acres of barley to cut.  First of all, of course, before they cut it, they would have to sow it. They acquainted their creamery manager and he made the necessary arrangements for ploughing, harrowing, sowing and reaping.  The operation was economic but the individual farmer did not have a tractor, a disc harrow, a corn driller, combine harvester or any of these things, and he had no expensive, uneconomic tractor sitting in his shed for six months of the year.  If one relatively small co-operative enterprise, on its own resources, could provide a service of this kind, think how much bigger a service a thoroughly united and coherent co-operative <Col N="412" /> system could provide in that one respect alone.</P>
    <P>In another way a new system is developing in the broadcasting of fertilisers. In the old days, as I and many of my colleagues know, when fertilisers were sold in two-cwt jute bags, the way to get that stuff on the grass was to collect it from the railway, load it on to the trailer, with a couple of handlings, and sometimes spread it by hand.  I did that myself, too.  Sometimes if you were lucky to live near a fellow who had a fertiliser distributor or if you were luckier still and had one yourself, you spread it that way.  Now, however, a new system is coming into operation: the person from whom you buy your fertiliser will now spread it for you at what I suppose is a competitive enough price.  This type of operation, in my opinion, is one which lends itself ideally to its undertaking by a co-operative, a co-operative even of a small size.  I could go on for hours reciting the various things that could be undertaken but I do not want to delay the House unduly.  I have said most of this before, although I do not apologise for repeating it.  Dr. Knapp has come and gone and told us nothing at all that we did not know already. He made his report and passed on his way but we have got no nearer to the solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>All the time we have side by side with the creamery co-operatives, a number of co-operative meat processing plants.  I am a member of a co-operative meat processing undertaking and I never hear from them from one end of the year to the other, except once a year when they send me a small dividend, small because my investment was small, necessarily.  However, I believe that if that undertaking were running properly, it would be running in conjunction with the other co-operative undertakings in my part of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not limit myself to my constituency or to any particular area at all but at present as far as I know this very large undertaking draws its supplies of cattle, sheep and pigs from dealing men and agents and fellows who are &ldquo;in&rdquo;.  Whether they are members <Col N="413" /> of the society or not, I do not know.  Certainly this project is not a co-operative undertaking although it derives benefits and very important benefits from calling itself a co-operative. There is no doubt at all that if this enterprise were welded to others and the whole thing brought together, it would change the face of Irish agriculture. I am confident that this is beginning to happen.</P>
    <P>A new type of co-operative enterprise came into being some time ago in the form of co-operative marts.  Again, I am afraid that although they provide a very fine service, it is a truncated operation, an <i>ad hoc</i> system of selling livestock.  I would think that with the development of livestock marts, they would not only buy live animals but sell processed meat.  I do not think it is an insuperable task to weld these two activities together because the people who built the marts are, by and large, also the people who built the processing plant.  Even if they were not, it is to their benefit that these projects should be linked.</P>
    <P>Again I go back to the theme of what I say: if we do not co-operate, if farmers do not unite and help themselves, all the help the Government can give them will not do the trick. This is a place where a real and effective farming organisation could do a wonderful job.  I think it is necessary to have farming organisations to do this job but how on earth are they to tackle it while they are divided among themselves and how are they to tackle it when one of the biggest of the organisations&mdash;at least, one that is said to be one of the biggest&mdash; is in a state of undeclared war with the Government?</P>
    <P>Here is a task worthy of the best of Irish farmers.  This is a challenge worthy of the best of those who come from the Irish countryside, and I think we have the men to do it, but we are frittering away our time in stupidities and talk about jackboots and Savile Row suits, and we have important vice-presidents of this organisation in this year of grace, 1967, advising farmers to ram other farmers' products down their throats.  This is the lowest low that we ever struck in Irish farming <Col N="414" /> and I hope Deputy Clinton is listening to me now because I want him to know where I stand.  This is where I stand: I say that when the representative, who is incidentally a farmer himself, said this idiotic thing, he did a great deal of harm.  He struck a very serious blow at this one thing that we must have before we can get the co-operation of which I speak.</P>
    <P>We must get unity.  It is not a question of saving people's faces, whoever may own the faces.  People's faces are not important in a problem as important as this.  What is at stake is the future of Irish farming, and probably in the long run the future of our country as a free, independent nation, but the only thing we get is talk about jackboots and accusations by ill-advised and foolish people who did the most outrageous damage to the future of the country by idiotic talk about an alleged desire on the part of the Minister and the Government to crush the National Farmers Association.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a politician, as are the other members of the Government. It is the business of a good politician to produce results: the better results he produces, the better his electorate will like it.  I am a politician, too, and I know this.  We do not want to have any dead bodies in our back garden.  The idiotic and unfounded accusation that the Government have any intention of crushing any farming organisation will not stand up to examination in the light of this.  It simply is not good politics.  If you examine it in the light of the way this question has been treated by the Government, in the light of the fact that the people who were sentenced to various forms of punishment for an outrageous breach of the law that was condemned by every sensible person in the country, in the light of that action and the way in which the people who were jailed for participation in this outrageous thing were treated, you will see no effort to crush the NFA.</P>
    <P>If the Government really wished to crush the NFA and produce bitterness, they would proscribe the NFA.  I congratulate them on their wisdom and forbearance in not doing this, because <Col N="415" /> my belief&mdash;I hope Deputy Clinton will take note of this carefully so that he may analyse it properly in his own time and determine precisely where I stand &mdash;is that the great mass of members of the NFA are sensible farmers.  I believe the great mass of people in the NFA want this unity which I say is absolutely vital to my future as a farmer and to their future as farmers.</P>
    <P>Possibly it would be difficult for a Fine Gael man to appreciate this because there are not any farmers to advise him about this truth, but that is so.  As I have said, most NFA people are moderate, sensible, hardworking men but there seems to have developed, since the NFA embarked on what they declared to be a policy of militancy, a passage of power, a passage of authority to people who do not want concord or unity, who have insultingly and indignantly repelled the offers of other farming organisations to co-operate and assist in the common work of putting Irish agriculture really moving.</P>
    <P>There is this other aspect of which we must all be conscious.  The Party of my colleaque, Deputy Crotty, have a document circulating in my constituency at present which is a disgraceful attempt by the Fine Gael Party to cash in on this affair.  It is so disgraceful and so miserably contemptible that the Fine Gael people did not put the name of their Party on it.  There it is.  The only help the farmers are getting from Fine Gael at present is help to get out this contemptible, miserable handbill which goes all over the alleged wrongs that have been done to the farmers by the Fianna Fáil Party and urges them now, for the first time, to strike, to give their answers in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>This is the best Fine Gael can do in my constituency and it is a very poor best.  Are they ever conscious of the fact that&mdash;probably not, because they have no farmers to advise them&mdash; farmers are a community of canny fellows who can see through this contemptible effort to cash in on the most important political, the most important social problem we have in <Col N="416" /> this country?  The best Fine Gael can do is to mount this alleged attempt to establish peace negotiations in order to embarrass a colleague of mine, with the co-operation of Labour, to try to commit the Fianna Fáil Party to something that would be less than allegiance to their own Party.  How stupid can they be.  Needless to say, they have failed in this attempt but it reveals the venal, cynical attitude they have got to the whole problem.</P>
    <P>They ask: &ldquo;How can we get this to pay politically?  It does not matter if the ICMSA and the NFA get together so long as we can benefit politically by it.&rdquo;  If that is all Fine Gael can offer they should be ashamed of themselves.  Earlier in the debate I was invited by Deputy Clinton to say where I stood in these matters.</P>

      <P>My reaction to matters of this kind is this.  We are all politicians but the one thing in my experience that the Irish electorate despise is a Tadhg an dá Thaobh.  When a person expresses his sincere opinions clearly they will accept his sincerity. That is where Fine Gael fall down. Deputy Cosgrave, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, made a formal renunciation on behalf of his Party on the matter of illegal activities and in justice to him he set the lead, but some of his colleagues saw political advantages in it.  I do not accuse Deputy Crotty in <Col N="417" /> any way of being directly responsible for this filthy little miserable campaign in my constituency but it is typical of Fine Gael that they had enough wit to see how contemptible it was and to refrain from putting their names to it, though their election agent did not.</P>
      <P>The facts are well known.  My worry about this is that the great magnitude of the problem that lies behind it may not be seen clearly.  During the past six months or longer we have had the ferocity of the dispute between the ICMSA and the NFA.  It was a battle of personalities such as we had in Russia recently.  It was the cult of personalities: &ldquo;Who said what last and who will say what next?&rdquo; All the time the people about whom they were all supposed to be concerned are waitting for them to do something positive. The thing that must be done is to unite.  That brings me to the NAC. Does Deputy L'Estrange find this amusing?</P>

I have said what I believe.  We have got to establish a co-operative movement <Col N="418" /> that will work.  It is the only thing that will work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is because we will never get any other type of remark from the Deputy.  It is a demned pity he did not get himself suspended today.  I have made my point.  I deplore the negative and foolish attitude of Fine Gael.  I was speaking about the NAC and the possibility of some unity.  I have spoken to various NFA men in my time about this and I know that many of them would like to see co-operation. We will have to get the ICMSA, the BGA, the NFA and all others to pull in the same direction.  This country has waited for a very long time for those organisations to do something about this.  It may well be that the NAC is not the answer but it was a good idea of the Minister to establish it.  I hope it will be a success.  It would obviously be far more successful if we had all the farmers' organisations in on it.  The NAC might well be the key to the unity I spoke about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, if the NFA prefer to go it alone we will not get the unity I wish for.  It is their right to stay outside if they want.  I do not believe they are doing the country any good by staying outside.  If the NFA came into the NAC and reformed it in the way they thought best they would be doing a good service.  They should come in and give it a trial and if they do not like it, then they could go out of it but they would have done some good by coming into it.  They are not doing any good for the country by refusing to sit down in conference with other farmers' organisations and with the Minister who, after all, is the person who was elected by the people to look after the farmers' interests.  It is a disastrous blow to the unity I speak of when the <Col N="419" /> NFA will not come to the conference table with the other farmers' organisations.</P>
    <P>I want to end by saying this to the NFA.  Have another look at the NAC. We are told that you do not like it particularly at the present time.  Come into it and give it a trial.  State your views at the conference table and that will be a step in the right direction. While the NFA maintain their present attitude of remaining in the wilderness and sulking outside, they are not doing any good for anybody.  They should give over this and come into the NAC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Estimate as far as the rural Deputies are concerned.  We are all glad to get the chance to speak on this important Estimate.  There are a few points I should like to refer to.  When reading through last week's debates I noticed that most of them were concerned with the dispute between the NFA and the Government.  Seemingly it has died down this week.  I happen to be one of the people who sat on a farmers' organisation.  Now we get people trying to boycott those organisations. Some of this is being organised by Fine Gael Deputies.  I do not think they are doing anybody a service by this.  Fine Gael are making statements about the NAC.  I had experience of that on committees of agriculture in my constituency and what Fine Gael said then.  They are now saying that nothing useful can come out of the NAC, that it is foolish to try to co-operate. They are trying to maintain disunity among the farmers.  It is Fine Gael who are responsible for this&mdash;not the NFA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, as a farmer, was a member of the NFA.  I was a paid up member to 9th January last when the roads were blocked.  I withdrew then.  I could not stay in the organisation any longer when they took that action which caused such distress to many people. They prevented ordinary men and women from going to work.  Those people were entitled to go about their business but they were prevented from doing so.  I heard of one man who was going to Dublin with his sick wife.  She <Col N="420" /> arrived in hospital after travelling for nine hours from Tipperary to Dublin. He told me that they would not be let through.  When I saw that had happened and that this was what this farmers' organisation was doing, I left it.</P>
    <P>Last week we had Deputy L'Estrange lacerating the Fianna Fáil Party and saying that they attacked the outgoing President of the NFA, that they called him a Protestant and that they said he was a British Army captain.  I come from North Tipperary and to my mind no Fianna Fáil Party member ever made any such statement on any platform. This was a scurrilous thing for the Deputy to say.  No Party in this State would say anything like that.  Of course, the Fine Gael Party are disappointed that this dispute will not be kept going until after the local elections. That is the full sting behind their attack.</P>
    <P>Last week or the week before Deputy O'Higgins said: &ldquo;If you vote Fine Gael in the local elections everything will be OK.  The farmers will have everything and everything will be grand.&rdquo;  Deputy L'Estrange last week referred to the dead hand of Fianna Fáil in relation to the tillage farmers. To my mind, the dead hand of Fianna Fáil never fell on the tillage farmers. The tillage farmers always did well by Fianna Fáil.  I notice two things in Deputy Dillon's speech last week which he never mentioned&mdash;wheat and beet.  He did not mention them because he said he would not be got dead in a field of one or the other.  One thing Fine Gael did was to reduce the price of wheat by 10/- or 12/- a barrel and they never gave it back.  Deputy L'Estrange tried to make out last week that the drop in the price of wheat was the cause of the decline in the sowing of wheat.  That was not the cause of it. The bad weather curtailed the growing of wheat.  Farmers did not get a chance at harvest time and there was both millable and unmillable wheat.  Two members of the NFA are on the Grain Board and they are still there.  It was they who were the cause of the lower price given for the wheat.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about the <Col N="421" /> price of cattle and the price of calves 12 months ago and two years ago. Surely to goodness it was the small man who bought his cattle from the big man who suffered because of this.  Two years ago when the price of calves was dear this small farmer bought them but when they were ready to be sold again he could not get his price for them.  If the big man sold his cattle at a loss he was able to get the purchase price back again but the small man could not do this.  The small farmer was the one who lost money.  When he had to pay £27 or £28 for a suck calf, surely that was going too far?  As I said in the Budget debate, if the big man sold cattle cheaply, he could replace them with cattle at £15 or £20 less than he would usually pay for them.  He bought them last November and often made £30 per head.  This is not a question of the small man losing but the big man gaining.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that nearly all the speeches from the Opposition in this debate dealt with the dispute between the Government and the NFA.  The Government really have no dispute with the NFA.  As a Government, they must rule and are entitled to rule.  We expect respect from all decent farmers, and there are plenty of them in the NFA.  The farmers are entitled to an organisation run on the right lines but, when some politicians got behind them, they made very poor use of the farmers' organisation.</P>
    <P>There was a reference a few minutes ago to the Beet Growers Association trying to get the politicians out of the association.  I am one of the politicians on the Thurles board, so I suppose they would want to get rid of me.  The other local man is an NFA man and a Fine Gael man.  I am amused that Fine Gael have no politics.  I suppose I have as a Fianna Fáil representative. If that be the case, I am proud of it.  I think the beet growers in that area will be very slow to discard their old organisation.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the NFA did not go into the NAC.  There are plenty of farmers there who would support them. If they were not satisfied, they could come out of it.  Deputy L'Estrange <Col N="422" /> criticised the appointment of the Minister as chairman, but I think it is the right place for him.  If I put something to the Minister, he has to listen to it directly.  It is not a question of dealing with a civil servant who says he has to consult the Minister.  The Minister is the man on the spot.  We all know that, if you put up something to the Department, the Minister may get it in a fortnight or three weeks' time; but when he is on the spot, he cannot but say the complaint is made. No matter what other people may think, I believe it is the right place for the Minister.</P>
    <P>We heard complaints from other Fine Gael speakers about the quality of our cattle, and they try to blame the AI stations for the bad breed of our cattle, and they try to blame the AI stations for the bad breed of our smaller stock.  I was more than surprised at that.  I come from near the Dovea station.  They keep only the very best of stock there and pay a high price for imported bulls.  They bring in the small suck calves a week or a fortnight old to see how they will do and only the best are kept.  I do not like to see people condemning something which has done such very good work.  Before AI we had plenty of scrub bulls giving bad cattle and bad stock.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Common Market, I happened to be in Brussels a fortnight ago for a beet conference and demonstration.  The farmers there get only £6 per ton for a 15.5 sugar content whereas we get £7 11s.  What will the prices be if we go into the Common Market?  The smaller farmers will find a big difference.  There will be no marching to Leinster House or sitting on the steps, because the people over there have a halfday's work done before some of our farmers are up.</P>
    <P>We had a decline in cattle prices, but the one explanation never mentioned is that beef consumption in Britain fell by about 12 per cent from 1963 to 1965.  This meant that about 200,000 fewer cattle were consumed.  I have been told this fall is due to the fact that meat got dearer during that period and, as a result, the British people <Col N="423" /> ate less of it.  It that is so&mdash;and there is some truth in it&mdash;they are not going to take as much of our cattle and will not pay high prices for them.</P>
    <P>I come from a tillage area, am a representative of the small farmers and have been elected by the farming community.  I have no hesitation in going back to those people in a few weeks' time and I am satisfied they will again show me the confidence they have shown in the past.  If you are straight with people, they will be fairly straight with you.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said&mdash;and he was speaking as a farmer&mdash;there is no use coming in here bluffing.  What percentage of farmers spoke from the opposite side on this Estimate?  They were very few and far between.  It is a pity they would not have more commonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange mentioned Fianna Fáil attacks on Mr. Deasy, that he was a Protestant and so on.  He is not.  I know him well and all his people before him.  They were Catholics, and good ones.  I would not be associated with anyone passing such remarks in order to try to get votes.  As no one except those on this side of the House seem to be busy here tonight, I would conclude by congratulating the Minister on his stand.  There is no sense in letting any organisation tell him what he should do.  He must have the final say in running his own Department.  I agree thoroughly with it.  The NFA made one great mistake in not going into the NAC where they could do a good day's work for the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this Estimate should come up while the crisis between the Government and the NFA is unresolved because only then could we have a reasonable discussion. Those on the Fianna Fáil side of the House are against the NFA and cannot discuss the Estimate reasonably.  They are just attacking Fine Gael, saying what Fine Gael should do, but not coming to the Estimate.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said that the Minister is a good politician and that good politicians <Col N="424" /> produce results.  Over the past few years, we have had three Ministers for Agriculture&mdash;Deputy Smith, Deputy Haughey and the present Minister. Were they all good politicians producing results?  In my estimation, they must have been very poor politicians, because one of the first results one should look for is an increase in the population on the land.</P>
      <P>Years ago, I heard of the small farmers on very uneconomic farms leaving the West.  I thought we would never see that in Kilkenny, but that development is to be seen in Kilkenny now just as much as the West.  It is one of the things those Ministers must be accountable for.  I do not say they could have stopped it straight away, but their minds should have been directed to that problem.  They should have been finding ways of improving conditions on the land, especially for the small farmer.  If there is reasonable prosperity for the small farmer there is no need to worry about the big farmer whose means of production are greater.  The small farmer must be assisted and provided for.</P>
      <P>We hear from Ministers about the various aids to agriculture.  It is very easy to juggle figures and to quote sums of £40 million here, £50 million there.  What amount of these sums goes into the pocket of the small farmer? People may wonder why, if all these aids are given, the small farmers do not remain on the land and get a better living off the land.  The fact is that people are leaving the land.  Young people are going to the cities and to England, leaving their fathers and mothers behind, because they see that under the present policy of the Government there is no prospect for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many small farmers are able to avail of the grants that are given? The people who want these grants are not able to avail of them because of shortage of capital.  In order to get a grant a farmer must be able to contribute a certain portion of the cost of the structure for which he requires the grant.  Small farmers are not in a position to contribute this portion of the cost and therefore cannot avail of the grants to build cow-byres or other farm <Col N="425" /> buildings.  That is a matter that the Government should have considered. They should have made grants available for small farmers and should have provided loans at a very low rate of interest.  Even if they never got a grant, loans covering the entire cost should have been made available at very low rates of interest.</P>
    <P>The first thing the Government did when they returned to power in 1957 was to shelve Section B of the Land Project, which enabled the small farmer to get his land reclaimed and to put his share of the contribution on to the annuity.  The Fianna Fáil Government did not abolish Section B, but they did not implement it.  They did not provide the money for it.  Section B of the Land Project should be implemented and the necessary money should be provided.</P>
    <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, good politicians produce results.  The Parliamentary Secretary firmly believes that the Minister did produce good results.  I cannot agree with him there.  Is it one of the results of a good politician that the wheat acreage, which was 365,000 acres in 1960, reached the all-time low in 1966 of 131,000 acres?  The acreage is one-third of what it was in 1966 and much less than it was in 1956.  At that time the price had to be reduced because we had two years' stock of native wheat.  Now we have not got three months' stock of native wheat. Should it not be Government policy to produce enough wheat at least for home consumption?  Should it not be Government policy to help the small man and to ensure a market for his produce?</P>
    <P>One of the causes of the big reduction in the acreage of wheat is loss of confidence on the part of farmers in the Government.  That loss of confidence was created by the fact that farmers, having gone to great expense to produce millable wheat, when the price was 87/6 per barrel, received only 45/- a barrel.  We should judge the Government on results.  I would agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that a good Minister will produce results.  We have had three Ministers for Agriculture in succession.  Will the Minister say that he has not been long enough <Col N="426" /> in power to produce the results?  The other man was long enough in power.</P>
    <P>There should be only one criterion in the case of millable wheat&mdash;bushel weight and moisture content.  Producers would then know that they would be able to sell their produce. The Government put a levy on wheat when there was surplus production. They subsidised the export of wheat and a levy had to be paid.</P>
    <P>A point that has been lost sight of is that some years ago we produced 85 per cent of our wheat requirements and had developed the Atle strain, a reasonably strong wheat.  At that time the Minister had determined to produce an even stronger wheat suitable for bakers' flour so that importation of wheat would no longer be necessary.  That idea has been completely dropped.  There is one variety of wheat but, in my opinion, it is no great improvement on the Atle. That matter should have been considered.  The Department should ensure that enough wheat is grown to make imports unnecessary.  We are importing wheat and exporting farmers.</P>
    <P>Now let us consider the position in regard to oats.  Again to quote Deputy Gibbons, let us consider the results of a good Minister in connection with oats.  In 1960, the acreage was 462,000.  In 1966, it was 240,000 acres.  We are importing oats.  Racehorse owners are allowed to import oats.  Anyone is allowed to do so.  It should be the duty of the Government to ensure the production of sufficient oats.  That would provide a certain amount of profitable employment on the land.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of barley, there was a decline in production in 1966 as against 1965.  Admittedly, the decline is small but it is there.  Barley is the only crop in which the farmer has confidence.  He knows that if he harvests his barley crop reasonably well, there is a market for it.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny, where wheat, barley and oats are grown extensively, people have gone out of production because they have lost confidence in the Government. When it came to grading, <Col N="427" /> they felt that the Government were not behind them and they just had to take what they could get, whether it was 45/- or 40/-.  Since 1959, there has been a reduction of 200,000 in the acreage of corn grown.  We are paying out £20 million for imported wheat, barley and grains.  That in itself damns the Government and damns Government policy.  This sum of money is spent on importing something that we could produce.  It may be necessary to import petrol, as petrol is not produced in this country, motorcar parts, other things like that.  Goodness knows, we could produce wheat and if it had been developed, we would have been able to meet our full requirements.  Government policy over the past 11 years has fallen down completely.  Is it any wonder things have come to a crisis when we have been importing £20 million worth of grain while the farmers' sons are leaving the land?  Is it any wonder we have the present crisis with the NFA?</P>
    <P>That is only one side of the business. Over the past number of years when the farmers could not make a living from grain they turned to cattle.  The heifer scheme was initiated, but the then Minister for Agriculture forgot about the question of marketing.  Up to the time of the heifer scheme the small farmer, particularly, produced calves, bought in calves, fed them and sold them as yearlings, getting a good market for them.  What happened last year and this year?  The five cwt or six cwt beast is not wanted.  The poor quality beast is very hard to dispose of at any time, but even the good quality small beast has been sold practically at a dead loss, at give-away prices, for the past number of months.  The result is that the small farmer instead of getting £40 or £50 for the five cwt to six cwt beast has to be satisfied with anything from £30 to £35, which makes a tremendous difference.  It has spoiled his husbandry and is another reason for shaking his confidence in the Government. We had the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, telling the farmers to hold on to their cattle, and very bright prospects were held out to them under the <Col N="428" /> Free Trade Area Agreement.  They held on to the cattle and it turned out that, instead of there being a great demand for cattle, there was a collapse.</P>
    <P>It was a great mistake to set up the National Agricultural Council without the support of the NFA.  The NFA has always had very able men; it is a wonderful organisation.  The executives have had consultations over the past number of years with the Government. They brought up their plans and the Government would not accept them.  Is it not a pity the Government did not accept some of their plans, for instance, the marketing board and the proposal to produce more corn in the country rather than import it?  Instead of that the Minister decided to set up the National Agricultural Council, having representatives from four organisations and then nominating six of his own.  What organisation could have confidence in such a set up?  To cap it all the Minister went to the top of the table himself.  No wonder the NFA are dissatisfied.  No wonder we had the no rates campaign.  No wonder we had the situation that developed in my own constituency of Kilkenny.  In that connection I take this opportunity to deplore the amount of force that was used.  There was nearly as much force used in Kilkenny on that day as was used by the Israelis in Jerusalem.  The people of Tullaroan were overawed when they saw gardaí on motorcycles, military lorries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The gardaí did not permit photographs to be taken.  Whether it was because the Government did not want to have these scenes depicted in the newspapers, I do not know.  I would ask the Minister to settle up this dispute with the NFA. They are available to the Government to be consulted.  If the Government had consulted them we would not have the sorry picture we have today in the agricultural industry.  No matter what the Government or the Minister does, the NFA are going to stay there.  Their organisation is a very fine one.  They do not want to dictate policy to the Government.  They merely want to advise the Government, and the Government can do with a lot of good advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Crotty and coming from the same constituency, I suppose I should refer to some of the remarks he has made.  He has referred to increasing the number of people living on the land.  In every country in Europe and, indeed, in Ireland, the number of people employed on the land, that is, the number of people who will find a living by remaining on the land is decreasing.  If you take any road in rural Ireland you will find the farmer, whether small or large, living on a farm with six or seven in family.  Further down the road there is a cottage where the farm labourer lives with five or six in family. What is the ultimate solution to that problem?  The point is that whether the farm be 45, 60 or 100 acres, one member of that family will remain on the land and the other members of the family will find employment in the local county council or in some Department of State.  Some of them may have to emigrate.  Take the family of the farm labourer.  One boy may decide to continue in the employment his father had; the others may find employment in some local industry or on the roads.  This is the traditional pattern.  A great many people living in the rural areas are now going into industry.  There are people living in <Col N="430" /> Tullow and Rathvilly who motor 50 miles to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty said, and I agree with him, that the big farmer is all right and it is the small farmer who must be assisted.  Small farmers just exist.  They lack the capital to invest in extra cattle or in machinery.  Capital is a big problem and giving farmers a few more acres is not always the answer to their problem.  Very often the man with ten acres, who does intensive tillage, can make a better living on the land than the man who gets an extra 20 or 25 acres by way of addition to his holding, or the man with 100 or 150 acres.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty referred to wheat.  He was a Parliamentary Secretary in the Coalition Government and it was the Minister for Agriculture in that Government, Deputy Dillon, who reduced the price of wheat by 10/- or 12/- a barrel.  Deputy Crotty is well aware that the farmers in Carlow and Kilkenny will never forgive Deputy Dillon for that reduction.  I know that because I am a farmer's son.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty also referred to oats. Oats are hardly grown at all now. There is a plan in the Department of Agriculture to subsidise oats in order to encourage farmers into the production of oats.  Oats do not show a great deal of profit, as the Department are well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prices paid for agricultural produce have been debated <i>ad nauseam.</i> The farmer gets 1½d for a head of cabbage, for which the housewife subsequently pays ?d.  Nobody will deny that that is the situation.  I am a farmer's son, as I said, but I have gone into the wholesale business and I have discussed this problem with several people.  The farmer grows the cabbage and brings it to the market. The auctioneer sells it and gets his five per cent.  The man who buys it picks and chooses the heads he will take and rejects others.  He takes the cabbage to a shop and the shopkeeper exercises the right of choice also.  The shopkeeper then tries to sell the cabbage and, once more, the customer exercises the right of choice.  The only answer to this is co-operative selling. <Col N="431" /> The farmers should combine and bring the cabbage themselves to the new housing areas and sell it direct from the lorry.  Is there anything wrong with that?  I am hopeful that at least one farming organisation will start co-operative selling.</P>
    <P>With regard to eggs, it is said that it is no longer economic for the farmer to produce eggs.  Down in Carlow, I knew several farmers who had a few hens who got 3/- and 3/6 a dozen for eggs from the merchant, while down the street there was someone paying 3/9d.  In Tullow, a man started battery cages with thousands of hens. It cost him 2/- a dozen to produce the eggs.  He is a Fine Gael candidate in the local elections.  He sold the eggs at 2/3 a dozen.  The small farmer was getting 2/9 a dozen.  It is economic to produce eggs at 2/3 a dozen, provided one does it in the right way.</P>
    <P>We talk about a meat marketing board and about the selling of meat. The markets of the countries comprising the EEC are closed to our cattle trade and our lamb trade but now and again the French market opens and we can sell lamb there.  We must depend on selling at least 90 per cent of our beef to Britain. There are half a million persons unemployed in Britain at the moment where there is an economic recession and some people who could normally pay a good price for meat are now on unemployment benefit. They have to cut down on the amount of beef they buy and this will affect our beef sales in Britain.  That is one of our major problems.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that, at the moment, there is a tremendous debate going on between certain farming organisations and the Minister in relation to the promotion of markets for our meat produce.  We must start in a small way.  If we are not satisfied with the marketing of our meat in Britain, we must take effective action to remedy that position.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who has spoken in this debate has mentioned the small farmer.  Deputy Crotty said the small farmer must be assisted and I wholeheartedly agree with him and surely <Col N="432" /> he will wholeheartedly agree with me that that is the policy of Fianna Fáil. Take, for example, a viable holding of 45 acres.  The owner owes money to the bank, to the merchant and has a certain amount of credit elsewhere.  He just cannot get off the ground.  The Agricultural Institute took over a farm in Limerick with a farmer on it who employed one man.  They put into that farm the amount of capital that would make it an economic proposition and actually pay off the interest and the sinking fund.  They discovered that a farm of 60 to 70 acres of arable land, with capital available, and so on, would show a profit of about £1,500 per annum.  I believe that that estimate is correct, provided they have the capital, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to the sheep subsidy scheme which was introduced last year on the recommendation of a committee set up to advise the Minister on how a sheep subsidy scheme should be operated.  In the Blackstairs Mountain area, the Cheviot ewe was bred.  That was crossed with a Border Leicester ram.  The people who did so made a considerable profit. Then the people from the Blackstairs Mountain area where the Cheviots were bred asked themselves why they should not get some profit.  It was my duty as a public representative to bring the complaints to the attention of the Minister.  The people who formerly bred Cheviots decided they would have no more of them but would get Suffolk rams and produce half-bred Suffolks.</P>
      <P>The committee set up to inform the Minister on where to inject the subsidy were wrong in their recommendation because the Border Leicester is not the ideal type of ram or ewe to give us the type of lamb we want to sell in London or Paris.  The leg is too long and scraggy and butchers and people in the business tell me that the Border Leicester gives us too much fat.  The ideal is to get the Suffolk and Cheviot more closely related.  Some of the people, even from the Department, who advised sheep-breeding associations in my county, or perhaps were advised by the sheep-breeding associations, about this scheme discovered they were wrong and were men enough to admit it.  If we are going to export lamb&mdash; and I am sure Deputy L'Estrange will agree with me&mdash;we want the nice lean leg of lamb and you will never get that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope we will have good wheat in Carlow-Kilkenny again this year.  A review is taking place in the Department of Agriculture.  I went to the marts in Carlow and I saw six or seven inspectors from the Department. Several farmers came to me and asked: &ldquo;How much does it cost to bring down six or seven men?&rdquo; It has been stated that we are going to have inspectors to see who will qualify for grants.  I am sure we will all agree that there is no problem and that the farmers who are entitled to these grants will get them.  It will cost less and less.</P>
