      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why the practice of conveying passengers by bus to and from aircraft at Shannon was suspended for a long period, thus making it necessary for passengers to walk long distances often in bad weather; and whether he will now give an assurance that suitable arrangements will be made for the future.</P>

      <P>The carriage of passengers by bus to and from aircraft at Shannon has never been undertaken except occasionally in inclement weather when aircraft were parked in remote positions.  I understand that Aer Lingus, as handling agent for the airlines, are considering the introduction of an apron transport service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the fact that, with the exception of the major ports, there is a great need for up-to-date hydrographic surveys of Irish harbours and coastal waters and for modernised charts; and, if so, if he has any plan to meet this need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a comprehensive hydrographic survey of Irish harbours and coastal waters would be very desirable.  Such a survey <Col N="1604" /> would require the establishment of a hydrographic service with a suitable vessel, equipment and personnel and would involve substantial capital and running costs.  The establishment of such a service is under consideration in consultation with the other Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider acquiring the services of a private company, an Irish company, that is available to carry out this survey?  This is a company consisting of retired navy personnel who would have been trained in that work all their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I actually saw correspondence in which such a suggestion was made.  I do not know whether it ever reached the Minister but if he were to receive it, would he give the matter favourable consideration? As no doubt he appreciates, the survey for most of these charts was made in the last century by the lead and line method which is now obsolete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if it is a fact that a radio and television licence issued on 31st October in one year expires on 30th September of the following year; if so, why; and if he will take steps to ensure that the licence will cover a full 12-month period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Broadcasting (Receiving Licences) Regulations, 1961, an original licence issued on any day between 1st and 31st October expires on 30th September of the following year.  Renewal licences cover a full 12 month period.  It would unduly complicate renewals work if licences expired on days other than the last day of a month.  I see no good reason for changing the existing arrangements which have been in force for 40 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that as a result of the close-down of the sub-postoffice in Glendowan, County Donegal, approximately 30 pensioners have to travel eight miles to Churchhill to collect their pensions; and if, as there is no public transport available, he will consider reopening the sub-postoffice or making alternative arrangements for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Seventeen old age pensions were paid at Glendowan sub-office; these are now paid at Churchhill sub-office which is about four miles from Glendowan.  It is not necessary for the pensioners to attend in person to cash their pension orders; they can appoint agents to do so and some of the pensioners in the Glendowan area have already made such arrangements.</P>
      <P>In view of the trifling amount of post office business arising in the area, the reopening of the sub-office would not be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that in remote parts such as Glendowan, as his colleague the Minister for Agriculture will bear out, in many cases there is but the husband and the wife living in the homestead and it is left to one of them to walk four miles to the nearest post office? Does he not consider that hardship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a case where the business of the sub-office was <Col N="1606" /> almost negligible and we had to consider the rising cost of postal services to the public and the relationship between the basic postal charges and service and people's incomes.  We also had to consider that we have greater density of post offices than almost any other country in Europe and where a post office is hardly used at all, as in this case, where postage stamp sales amounted to less than £2 per week and there were only seven other postal transactions in the week, that is regarded as a totally uneconomic venture and were we to have such post offices all over the country, the cost of the postal services would be ruinous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and I do not wish to labour this but surely the Minister must consider more than economics? These are people you are dealing with and when you talk about people, you do not talk strictly on economics.  There is the social aspect as well.  These are people who have given good service to this country and who are entitled to a service.  If the Minister cannot see his way to reopen the sub-office, would he not at least get someone in his office to try to devise some way to enable these people to receive their pensions instead of asking them to travel four miles on foot? Could the pension not be posted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very rarely that arrangements cannot be made whereby pensioners receive their pensions.  I did not say that all the post offices were uneconomic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many post offices and a great part of the telephone service will continue to be social services and to be uneconomic.  What I said was that there must be some limit.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In view of the obvious hardship which a walk of four miles imposes on old age pensioners and in view of the fact that old age pensioners may actually have to pay to get their pensions brought to them, would the Minister consider paying their pensions through the post as many other pensions and remunerations are paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>A farm workers' training scheme devised to meet conditions in Britain would not necessarily be a suitable one for this country where the conditions are very different.  The British scheme is, of course, still in the process of development and no real assessment of its merits is possible at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment we are considering the re-introduction of the short farm courses which were in existence some time ago.  As well, we have looked at this but without reaching any conclusion.  The first big difference we encountered is that in Britain they have 150,000 farmers employing about 300,000 full-time workers, whereas we have 215,000 farmers of over 15 acres employing only 35,000 workers.  Clearly this poses a vastly different problem for us than under the British situation. That, then, allied to the fact that recognising this situation, we have had these night classes mainly for farmers but also for the workers, if they care to go.  We have rural science classes in our technical schools and agricultural colleges, and we also have the inservice horticultural courses.  It is rather difficult to make any true comparison between the two situations.  We have gone into the British scheme, and indeed they themselves are finding <Col N="1608" /> difficulties in it at the moment.  A lot of criticism has been voiced about it from various aspects.  Perhaps some of the experience they are gaining may help us to formulate something better than the British scheme would provide at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether Bord Iascaigh Mhara with his sanction sold or leased part of the pier at Cahirciveen, County Kerry so that there is no public access to the pier and to the cradles for the fishing boats which were built over a year ago at a cost of £8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara bought from Córas Iompair Éireann the disused railway site at Cahirciveen and gave a lease of it for development of local sea angling.  The Board did not seek my permission to do so nor was such permission necessary.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Board that public access to the pier and access to the laying-up bars for fishing boats has not at any time been restricted by the present lessee of the former railway site.  When apprehension about this was expressed locally the lessee immediately agreed to clarify the matter by surrendering back to the Board an appropriate part of the site and the Board in turn arranged with Kerry County Council that they would transfer that part of the property to the council.  The necessary legal documents to effect the conveyances are at present being prepared and the transfer to the council is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>In view of the desirability of using available capital for the erection of houses for those who need them, I notified Wexford County Council on 16th June last that I was not disposed to approve of their application for a loan of £20,000 to meet the cost of cottage repairs&mdash;which is properly a charge on current revenue for which the council, like other authorities, are expected to provide in their current budget.</P>
      <P>In regard to the houses in Wexford borough and Gorey town, the repair of houses owned by a local authority is primarily a matter for the authority and the tenant, subject to the terms of the letting agreement.  I have no funds at my disposal for the purpose.  I understand that there is, at present, a delay on the part of these two authorities in carrying out general repair works to their dwellings, due to the necessity to execute works in connection with applications recently received by them for the purchase of dwellings by tenants.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Kerry County Council that negotiations are proceeding for the acquisition of a housing site at Kenmare for about 20 houses.  I am aware that there is an urgent need for houses in the area and my Department has been pressing the housing authority for some time to acquire a suitable site.  I am also informed that while only four houses were built by the council in the town since 1934, 31 houses have been provided by them in the Kenmare area since then.

      <P>This is the basic principle underlying the scheme and must be applied to all areas in the country.  The fact that a privately organised transport service subsidised through travel scholarships by the North Tipperary Vocational Education Committee, previously operated from the Rathcabin and Lorrha districts to Borrisokane does not constitute a valid reason for the continuance of such a service.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, of the desirability of allowing pupils who had spent a few years in Borrisokane Vocational School to complete their course there.</P>
      <P>With that in view I authorised some weeks ago the re-routing of the service to Borrisokane so that the bus could come as far as Lorrha.  Existing students from Rathcabin are being given free transport to Borrisokane from suitable pick-up points on the bus route.</P>

      <P>The Queen's Institute of District Nursing in Ireland at an extraordinary meeting of 3rd October, 1967, passed resolutions that, in view of the failure to obtain trainees, the Institute would cease to provide district nursing courses.  The local district nursing associations will, however, I am assured, continue to provide services with their existing nurses.</P>

    <P>I am not aware that these decisions were due to financial considerations. Shortly before the meeting referred to, I had intimated to the Institute, in writing, that I was prepared to consider financial assistance to district nursing associations from public funds if that were necessary over and above the substantial subventions which they already receive from this source, and that I would do all in my power to help the Institute resolve their problems. I had also suggested alternative <Col N="1628" /> training arrangements for the nurses which, in my view, would have proved fully satisfactory if adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A new National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, 30th October.  The loan will be for £25 million but £5.3 million of the stock is being allotted to certain life assurance offices and other financial houses in respect of firm pre-issue applications and an application for £5 million is being made on behalf of funds under my control.  The balance of £14.7 million will be available for public subscription and has been underwritten jointly by the associated banks and the Government.  In the event that applications in excess of £14.7 million are received from the public, the allocation to departmental funds will be scaled down.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest will be 7 per cent per annum and the price £98½ per cent.  The stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1992 and may be redeemed at any time from July, 1987. The yield to final redemption is £7 2s 7d per cent.</P>
      <P>Stock of the issue will carry the usual income tax and death duty concessions. These are: it will be accepted at its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on estates of which it forms a part; interest will be paid without deduction of income tax at source though, of course, holders ordinarily resident in the State will be liable for whatever tax on the interest is appropriate to their respective incomes.  The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
      <P>Holders of 6 per cent National Loan, 1967, which is due for repayment in cash on 15th December next, will be given an option before that date to convert their holdings into stock of the present loan at a price which will be announced and an additional amount of the loan will be issued for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> The issue is being made under the authority of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the central fund.  The attractive return on the stock, the tax privileges attaching to it, and its status as a trustee security make this loan an excellent investment.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of the issue will be used for the financing of State capital outlay on agriculture and industry, on housing, sanitary services, schools, afforestation, telephones, fuel resources, transport and other schemes of national development.</P>
    <P>The prospectus will be published in tomorrow morning's newspapers and copies, with application forms attached, can be obtained from any bank, stockbroker, post office or trustee savings bank.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that every Deputy will support the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving the customary benediction to this loan, I think it right to emphasise that national development can be maintained and continued only if adequate capital is available for schemes such as were referred to in the speech of the Minister.  For productive purposes of an economic nature and for social or other essential or desirable projects, capital must be made available, irrespective of Party views on the manner in which the State is administered or on the priorities decided upon from time to time.  It is essential, if work of a national character, financed by national loans and financed by State subvention, is to continue, that adequate finances be made available. It is necessary, however, to express the view that we hope the greatest possible care will be taken to ensure that this money is devoted to productive purposes, productive in the economic sense or productive in a wider social context of desirable, objective such as housing, education, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about housing.  If there were somewhat less talk and more action, it might be possible to speed up the urgent national <Col N="1635" /> work of providing houses in the urban as well as in the rural areas.  It is a matter of national concern that it should clearly be understood that, in national expenditure&mdash;whether it be of a capital or a current kind&mdash;the greatest care must be taken to avoid waste or any expenditure that is not entirely justified by the projects to which it is devoted.</P>
    <P>The terms of this national loan are particularly attractive and should commend themselves not merely to the larger investors but also to the small individual investor.  In that connection, I think the question of the return, particularly in the case of smaller investors, from former loans must at some time require consideration by the Government and by the House.  This loan is particularly attractive.  It is designed to enable the national development programme to continue and, as such, must commend itself not only to Deputies but to the public for generous and willing support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on these Labour benches, realise that a national loan has traditionally, and quite correctly, never been a matter of Party controversy and we heartily commend this loan and its terms to investors everywhere. We are vitally concerned with the uses to which these funds will be put and, in particular, we may mention the matter of housing.  We are, as we know, in a situation which requires a maximum effort by everybody to solve the very pressing housing problem which extends to every town and village and rural area throughout the State.  Similarly, in agriculture, industry, in matters such as sanitary services, the provision of schools, afforestation, telephones, fuel resources, transport and so on, which have been mentioned by the Minister, it is essential that money should be made available for these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will dispute, and we will always reserve our right to dispute, the method of tackling these problems, but there can be no question about the desirability of having the capital available to the Government's hand to do what <Col N="1636" /> it is necessary to do to solve these problems.  In the light of that fact, and in the light of the tradition which has long existed in this House, full support should be given to Government effort of this kind to raise funds, and we of the Labour Party urge the loan on the people in the strongest possible terms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> This is a drafting amendment.  It is necessary to qualify the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; on line 44 to ensure that the term applies only to an employee who is entitled to redundancy payments under this Bill.  As worded at present, it would seem from reading the section that a worker who terminates his employment in accordance with section 12 (2) would automatically become entitled to redundancy payments under the section, irrespective of whether or not he qualified.  The insertion of the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; covers this situation.</P>

      <P>It is very desirable that this should be done.  It is not much use offering a person who has been employed at, say, £18 or £20 a week, other employment at £8 or £10 a week.  The terms of employment which he is offered must be comparable with the kind of employment he had prior to this notice; otherwise it would be unreasonable to expect a person who did have this type of employment to accept another type which will either lower his status or put him, perhaps, to grave inconvenience financially if he were to take it.  In order to protect the workers, we should have such words as these inserted into the section.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We discussed this change of name last week.  As far as I was concerned at the time, it did not matter whether the word &ldquo;Board&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tribunal&rdquo; was used.  The House accepted &ldquo;Board&rdquo; because it did not seem to matter and particularly since Deputy Treacy conjured up a vivid picture of workers being arraigned before a tribunal which would put the worker in a bad position.  As it did not seem to matter, I said I would accept the word &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.  But, over the weekend, I learned that the trade unions, who will be one side of those engaged in the operation of the appeals tribunal, wanted the word &ldquo;Tribunal&rdquo;.  I wondered if Deputy Jones, in the knowledge of that, would like to go back to &ldquo;Tribunal&rdquo;?</P>

The House will be aware that when funds such as the proposed Redundancy Fund are established which comprise a current account and an investment account, it is normal procedure to provide that the current account will be managed by the appropriate Minister who is dealing with the legislation and the investment account will be managed by the Minister for Finance.  Examples of such funds are the Social Insurance Fund under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and the Occupational Injuries Fund established under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966.  These three amendments are designed to provide that these arrangements will apply to the accounts of the Redundancy Fund.</P>

      <P>While the two funds which the Minister has mentioned have an element of State contribution in them, there is no element of State contribution in the fund which is now being created.  Therefore I have reservations in this regard.  If the Minister's proposal goes through, what effect will it have on the section which follows it if the House should accept the amendment which I propose to move in relation to this Fund?  Here is a fund to which only the employer and worker contribute; the State has no responsibility in regard to it, but the Minister for Labour who is directly concerned with the administration of the Act will not have the administration of the Fund at all.  Its administration will pass over to the Minister for Finance.  This again involves the dual type of responsibility in relation to which I was glad to see the Minister accept the principle that he should keep it within his own Department.  The Minister knows from his own experience in the Department of Education that many funds which fell to be administered within the Department of Education were administered, invested and managed by the Department of Education.  This is an argument on which I should like to elaborate on the succeeding amendment. If this amendment is passed, I do not want to be told afterwards: &ldquo;The previous section nullifies the effect of what is now being proposed.&rdquo; If the control of the Fund passes over to the Minister for Finance, there is no reason why there should be an advisory board set up at all to deal with the matter.  Therefore I am in some difficulty in this regard and I should like to have some advice on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the point of view expressed by Deputy Jones in relation to control of funds having regard to the fact that funds such as superannuation funds, which arise as the result of the contributions of workers and employers, are usually dealt with on a trustee basis.  However, there is another aspect of the matter on which we have not disguised our dissatisfaction, that is, that the Minister up to this stage has insisted that contributions towards this Fund shall come only from workers and employers.  We have consistently held that because to some extent redundancy may come about as a result of State activities, as a result of State exhortations to employers, etc., the Government should not stand aside and refuse to contribute. This is the reason I feel reluctant to support Deputy Jones's amendment, because we would be indicating quite clearly that we would be departing from the stand we have taken and will continue to take on this question of redundancy compensation, that the State should not wash its hands of the responsibility of contributing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's amendments for this reason: I realise that somebody must control the Fund and I certainly would not agree it should be left to employers to control, because we know what some employers would do and what other employers <Col N="1645" /> would not do.  I regard this arrangement as a progressive step, and I take into consideration the predicament the worker finds himself or herself in in connection with social welfare cards. They are in the custody of the employer, and if they are lost or stolen, the poor worker will not be paid.  We know whom to look to in connection with this Fund, and I am sure it will be accounted for regularly.  If it were left to each individual employer, we would be in a sorry mess.  I know we are not dealing with Deputy Jones's amendment, but I am not for this idea of setting up too many bodies to administer this Fund, particularly when it is advocated that people should be paid out of it other than people who contribute to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points which fall to be considered at a later stage in regard to this Fund, and even under these amendments, is the fact that the Minister's control is being weakened. Subsection (6) of section 26 says:</P>
      <P>...shall be invested by the Minister in accordance with such directions as may be given by the Minister for Finance...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that emerges in the following sections is that while the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State will not contribute anything to this Fund, at the same time, he will have power to see that his expenses and other expenses will be paid from this Fund. It is very important that the Minister for Labour, under whose auspices this Fund is being created and to which the Minister for Finance makes no contribution, will not be able to deal with this Fund directly himself but its control and management will pass to the Minister for Finance.  The extraordinary thing is that in later sections of the Bill the Minister for Finance is taking power so to arrange that he can require that payments shall be made out of this Fund in regard to any measure required under this Bill. Equally, should we have to advance moneys under this Bill to enable it to get off the ground, he can recover these sums from this Fund.  I hold this is something that should not happen in <Col N="1646" /> regard to legislation like this.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Mullen and by Deputy Larkin previously is that they do not concede that there should not be a contribution from the State.  They feel that the State could very well have an obligation in regard to redundancy payments for workers who lose their employment.  At the same time, it is hard to imagine why, in these amendments as proposed, control of the Fund is passing to the Department of Finance and from the Department of Labour.  Why should the Department of Labour not be able to manage these funds as other Departments manage theirs, invest them and give an account of their management as is done by every other Department, to the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
    <P>Previously, I objected to the fact that control was taken away from the Minister under another section.  That has now been rectified but, particularly when the State is not contributing, I see no good reason why the Minister and his Department should not be able to manage this Fund.  If the State were contributing to the Fund, one might see that the Department of Finance, as custodian of State finances, would have a vested interest in the Fund to ensure that it was properly managed.  I shall be later suggesting that this Fund could very well be properly managed by the Department of Labour with the advice of the Department of Finance.  I am sure the Minister has some views on this and I should like to hear them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, the ordinary management of the Fund will be the function of the Minister for Labour, the collection of subscriptions, payment of redundancy lump sums and so on.  Any management of a current type will be done by the Department of Labour but from time to time I hope and expect there will be money available that is not being drawn and the Minister would have to invest it as best he could.  In any case he would seek advice from the Minister for Finance on how best to invest the money and for administrative purposes it is better to give the Minister for Finance the money and say to him: &ldquo;Invest that for me&rdquo;.  That <Col N="1647" /> is exactly what the amendments are doing.  The management of the Fund so far as it affects the scheme and any activity related to the scheme will be done by the Department of Labour and any moneys which come to be invested will be given to the Minister for Finance who would invest it for the Fund.  If the amendments are not accepted and there is a duty on the Minister for Labour to invest it himself he would still, because of the structure of Government, have to seek the advice of the Minister for Finance on investment.  Therefore, for administrative reasons I think what is suggested here is best.  The principle is already established in other legislation.</P>

      <P>Having the Minister for Finance involved in this is, I think, a guarantee for the future.  From the point of view of the workers affected, it is well to have the Minister for Finance concerned because, as we know, this is purely a trial piece of legislation.  It may have to be amended when we find out how it functions. Therefore I think we should leave it as it stands in the meantime, with the Minister for Finance having a deep interest in the whole matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen spoke about stamping cards.  Will we have any guarantee that cards will all be stamped under this Bill?  At present we very often have cases, particularly with small employers, where cards are not stamped and even though the offender is prosecuted, it does not do the worker much good even if the offender is sent to prison or fined.  That does not restore payments. I should like to know what improvement we could have on the present system to ensure that redundancy payment cards are properly stamped and the workers given full credit for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that because the financing of the Fund marks a complete departure from traditional methods of financing social welfare here which up to now has been on a tripartite basis, with contributions from the employee, the employer and the State.  In this case contributions come only from the worker and the employer and there is no provision for State contribution.  That is regrettable, and while the Minister is very confident in his belief that there will not be serious redundancy in the future and does not envisage a run on the Redundancy Fund, we have to face the fact that the Committee on Industrial Organisation which examined certain industries indicated very clearly that as freer trade came about, we would face serious unemployment and redundancy problems, that we could have upwards of 11,000 people unemployed in freer trading circumstances and if certain adaptation measures were not adopted, we could have a further 23,000 unemployed.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, it would be unfair to expect the financing of the Fund to fall only on workers and employers.  The Minister should have latitude in this measure to allow the State to come to the rescue of the Fund in the event of its being in jeopardy. I am pleased to have an assurance from the Minister&mdash;and I want it to go on the records of the House&mdash;that in the case of such an event occurring, there is provision in this Bill whereby the Minister for Finance can make a subvention to the Fund in order to deal with a special emergency situation.</P>

      <P>Any time money is wanted for the Fund it is covered in the Bill that it will be taken back. Deputy Moore raised the point about an employer who does not stamp an employee's card.  In this Bill the worker is covered by his service, whether his card is stamped or not, so that if he has an adequate period of service he has a claim on that employer for a redundancy lump sum and a claim on weekly payments according to his service.  So that, if an employer does not stamp his card, the worker does not suffer.</P>
      <P>As to the question of a subvention, what is provided for in case of a run on the Fund, which I do not expect, is that the Minister for Finance will give a repayable loan to the Fund, but this comes under a later section.</P>

      <P>There is one other point I want to put to the Minister.  It concerns one of his amendments in connection with subsection (6) of section 26.  As this Bill is drafted, it is provided in subsection (6) that moneys standing to the credit of the investment account of the Redundancy Fund shall be invested by the Minister in accordance with such directions as may be given by the Minister for Finance.  For some reason, that is now being amended and it will be provided that the money shall be invested by the Minister for Finance.  Could the Minister justify that amendment at this stage or is this a matter of the Department of Finance sticking its nose in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to bring it into line with social welfare legislation.  As I explained, it is easier administration. It is easier to let the Minister for Finance have the money in order to invest it rather than that he should tell the Minister for Labour how to do it. It is easier administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware, from his experience as Minister for Education, that there are various funds under the control of the Minister for Education and that the Minister for Education directs the investment of these funds.  Again, he seeks the advice of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is to bring it into line with social welfare <Col N="1651" /> legislation.  There is not a big principle in it, only easier administration.  It will have the same effect in the long run. Either the Minister for Labour invests it on the advice of the Minister for Finance or he will give it to the Minister for Finance to invest.  The second course is the easier administrative way. There is no big principle involved. There are much more difficult things in the Bill than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think there is the principle that a Minister in his own Department should be able to manage the funds of his own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said some time ago, they are not my funds at all.  I have it in such a way that the Minister for Labour in anything to do with the day to day running of the fund, collection of contributions, payment of benefit, payment of the part of the lump sum or all the lump sum if the employer defaults, will be managed by the Minister for Labour.  If he wants money he gets it from the Minister for Finance, wherever he has it invested, and if he has money to spare, instead of asking the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;Where will I invest it?&rdquo; he gives it to him and says &ldquo;Invest that.&rdquo; I do not see a big principle involved. It brings it into line with social welfare legislation.  It is better administration, easier to handle.  However, management and every dealing with that Fund in anything to do with redundancy are done by the Minister for Labour.  The investment of money for the Minister for Labour and where it is best invested is left to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the contemplated wise investment the Minister for Finance is going to indulge in, we can assume that the Fund will grow, particularly if we take into consideration what the Minister for Labour has already said, that he has great hopes for the future.  This means the Fund will grow and there will not be the draw upon it that, perhaps, there would have been if it had been in operation now.  Am I to take it that as the Fund will grow as a result of investment and because people are not <Col N="1652" /> withdrawing money, that will enable the Minister to have another look at the benefits?  Is there any provision made at the moment or about to be made for the yearly, biennial or triennial revision of the Fund, with a view to seeing if the Fund can afford greater benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is true.  Any scheme of this kind is experimental and what you do first is based on your best calculations and the experience in other countries.  Our calculations are based on an estimate of about £1 million coming in in contributions and the benefits payable are based on what the Fund with that income and the likely draws on it could carry.  I would hope that the Deputy is right.  If any change is necessary in the benefits payable I would have to come to the House again, but it can be done by motion rather than new legislation. This comes later.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>Before section 27 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister shall appoint an advisory Council to be known as `the Redundancy Fund Advisory Council' (in this Act referred to as the Advisory Council) consisting of a chairman and members three of whom shall be appointed from a body or bodies representative of employers and three from a body or bodies representative of employees.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Advisory Council shall advise the Minister on the management of the Fund, the level of weekly contributions necessary to be maintained from time to time and on any other matter referred to them under this Act by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(3)  The members of the Advisory Council, not being employees of the State, shall be paid such remuneration, and in the case of all members, such allowances as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have previously adverted to the fact that I am concerned about the position that here there is a Fund which is being created by the contributions of workers and employers and the manner as to how the Fund is to be built up, what the level of contributions will be, are matters being determined by an authority outside the persons who are contributing to the Fund.  We suggest that an advisory body be set up which would be helpful, first and foremost, to the Minister in his administration of the Fund.  The setting up of that body would be an indication again of what is most necessary in regard to the future of both workers and employers, that is, the goodwill which is necessary even for the successful working of a Redundancy Payments Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister comes to think of it, he will find that in setting up a body such as this to assist him he would not be imposing, by way of regulations or otherwise, on either side in regard to <Col N="1654" /> the contributions that will have to be made, and he would not be imposing in regard to the state the Fund would be in at such time.  Everyone knows that it is necessary to keep an eye on a fund created for a purpose such as this, or for any other purpose, where contributions are paid out at a later stage.  That is an actuarial job which requires expert advice.  Where there are contributions from two sections, without any third body contributing, surely the two contributing elements should be entitled to express their opinion as to how the Fund should be financed and administered?  That does not take from the Minister's discretion at all.  This is an effort to improve the situation.  It is a negation to deny the people who are contributing any say in the administration of the Fund or the level of the payments to be made into it.</P>
    <P>One of the things that may well fall to be considered at a later stage is that the contributions may have to be increased.  If we may envisage such a fortuitous occurrence, it is easily possible that the amount being contributed may not be needed.  The Fund will be growing and will be passed over to the Investment Fund of the Minister for Finance.  The fact of having an advisory body such as that recommended in this amendment to deal with this Redundancy Fund would do a lot of good from the point of view of creating an interest on the part of the people contributing to it and creating their goodwill, and it would also be helpful from the management point of view.  It would be helpful either way. Beyond that, it would give the people directly concerned a say in the administration of the Fund which they themselves were helping to create.</P>
    <P>In the third subsection of the amendment, we propose that the people engaged on such an advisory body should be remunerated.  That is no worse than the situation will be if the Minister for Finance is handling it, as is proposed at present, because the Minister for Finance has the right, as set out in this legislation, to recoup any expenditure incurred by him out of the Fund.  I cannot see any violation of that principle.  I cannot see that <Col N="1655" /> the situation will be any different from what will happen if the Fund is completely under the control of the Minister for Finance.  For that reason, I am moving this amendment and I hope the Minister will see fit to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that, in actual practice, the decisions which will come to be made about the Fund will be in relation to changes in the rate of benefit or changes in the contributions required, as our experience may suggest.  As I said before, any redundancy fund must be experimental because we do not know what the demand will be.  As I said, £1 million might be paid in but the amount necessary will depend on the age of the workers, the level of incomes, the years of service and many other imponderables. That is why we say it is experimental.  It is a tentative estimate of the payments and contributions that will be required.  An advisory committee, to my mind, could deal only with actual figures such as, should the contributions be higher or the benefits be better.  That is in relation to the day to day running of the Fund.  I believe that any change in the rates should be a function of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have provided that any proposal to change the rates should be subject to an affirmative resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am satisfied that the Oireachtas is the appropriate place to discuss what in actual fact would be discussed by an advisory committee.</P>
      <P>There is a man-power advisory committee which has worked all the way with me and with the Department on this legislation and the training legislation. While they are there to advise and to alert the Minister to what needs to be looked at, the Oireachtas is still the place for making decisions and giving advice about the rates of contribution and the rates of benefit.  I do not think I could accept an advisory committee.  It would not be required and would be taking the place of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand the need for an advisory committee.  As I understand the situation, this Fund will be under the <Col N="1656" /> control of and administered by the Department of Labour.  I am wondering can the Minister describe the set-up which will come into existence when this Bill becomes law.  Am I right in assuming that in actual fact a section of the Department of Labour will be responsible for the administration of this Bill, and that it will remain for any aggrieved person to make a complaint through the channels which are there?</P>
      <P>Earlier on, we were talking about the composition of an appeals tribunal to which matters in dispute would be referred.  Furthermore, am I right in saying that since this scheme is in its infancy, it will be open to the employers' side and the workers' side, as time goes on, to make representations, if they see fit, in connection with any improvement of this Bill, and that in the final analysis, if any improvements are to be made in regard to the contributions or the benefits, such matters will be brought to this House?  I should like the Minister to tell us how he envisages this Bill will operate?</P>
      <P>I have already said that I presume a section of the Department of Labour will be doing this job.  I am sure the people in such section will be charged with the responsibility for gathering in funds and making sure that contributions are paid.  As was said earlier, arrangements will be made to advise those who come within the scope of this measure as to what they should do in order to obtain benefit from it.  I do not support the idea of the formation of more committees for this and committees for that.  One can get cluttered up with committees.  Very often committees are set up to keep people quiet. I know a great number of voluntary committees working in industrial circles in which no payment is made to the members of the committees, in which the members of the committees do not expect payment for their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the various joint industrial councils and other committees in existence, representative of both employers and employees.  These people are not paid: they give their labour voluntarily in the interests of the particular industry.  If it is necessary to set up a committee, I am sure <Col N="1657" /> it could be done without making this kind of provision for it.  The Minister has his contacts with organised employers and with the trade unions; he would have no difficulty in calling them together at any time for consultation.  I do not think this advisory council is necessary.  If Deputy Jones insists on this, then I should like him to elaborate further on the particular purpose he thinks it will serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already mentioned the purpose.  Under the social welfare code, employers and employees make a joint contribution towards the payment of a representative of management and labour to look after welfare funds; they meet from time to time and discuss how this money is to be apportioned.  Now this is something in the nature of welfare, in the sense that it is designed to make provision for people who become redundant so that they can be helped financially until such time as they get other jobs. There will be two sides contributing and those who contribute will naturally have the greatest interest in the operation of the Fund.  While admitting the validity of Deputy Mullen's argument in relation to people who give voluntary service, subsection (3) of this amendment is not mandatory in any sense.  I am sure management and workers could set up an advisory body, the members of which would not require compensation for their time. This is just the ordinary provision to ensure that such a body could be set up, if it were thought desirable.</P>

There would be no authority to do anything except talk.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> Subsection (7) of this section lays down the circumstances under which redundancy contributions are payable.  The basic intention with regard to these contributions is that they should be payable on behalf of eligible employees in precisely the same circumstances as employment contributions are payable under the Social Welfare Act, 1952. This intention is not fully expressed in the subsection as at present worded. Instead of repeating the lengthy sections of the social welfare legislation involved, I consider it makes the requirement more readily understood if it is simply stated that a redundancy payment on behalf of an eligible employee is payable when an employment contribution is paid under the Social Welfare Act.

      <P>If we are making the point that this is not like social welfare, and indeed that it is better than <Col N="1660" /> social welfare, surely we now have the opportunity to recognise that where a worker is absent from work through no fault of his own, it should not be held against him?  One can envisage a person who has been paying into this Fund for a number of years and through no fault of his own meets with an accident or becomes very ill and has to go into hospital for a period of time. Is this person to be denied benefit? Surely that should not be held against him?</P>

      <P>Paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 relates to continuity of employment rather than what we are dealing with at the moment.  It says:</P>
      <P>...continuity of employment shall not be broken (even though notice of termination of a contract of employment has been given) where an employee's period of service has been interrupted for a period of not more than 26 weeks by reason of lay-off, sickness, holidays, service by the employee in the Defence Forces of the State or any other reason (other than the voluntary leaving of his employment by the employee) authorised by the employer.</P>
      <P>Therefore it would take 26 weeks to break the continuity of employment, but what the Deputies envisage is sickness and dismissal.</P>

      <P>In the case of a person with, say, tuberculosis, where a minimum period away from work is six months, is it not unreasonable to have a person who is afflicted by such a disease cut off from the Redundancy Fund?  We can discuss it later if the Minister wishes, but one would have thought that where a person has pulmonary tuberculosis and is laid up for a considerable period of time&mdash;six months is the minimum period and very often a person is advised not to return to work for a further three months &mdash;he should not be cut off.  I think this is something the Minister should look into.  It is unreasonable that such a person should be deprived of the benefit of a fund to which he has been contributing and that his benefit at that stage is lost.

      <P>We dealt with that last week.  The claim is made by a worker who has worked for four years with one employer and by having worked four years, he has established a right in that position by contributing during his work in that employment.  The question was raised here last week of workers who do not stay with the one employer &mdash; dockers and catering workers were mentioned&mdash;and it was argued that something should be done for those people.  I propose for this type of work that we will have a special scheme and under this scheme they would be contribution.  If they frequently change their employment, they would never work up enough service with a single employer to get benefit.  The amendment is for a separate type of scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  Am I right in thinking that he is expected to make contribution to this Fund in the same way as he presently makes contribution to the social welfare fund?  The man may work one day in the week with one employer.  The first person he works with is the person who stamps his card.  The man has got to <Col N="1664" /> pay the contribution, once he is employed in any part of the week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I explained that last week.  There will be people paying contributions who will not benefit under this Bill.  We hope to have a special scheme for them.  There was a proposal before I brought this Bill to the House to have such people excluded but I felt it was better to put pressure on those concerned to have a special scheme.</P>

      <P>I just want to comment briefly on the section.  Subsection (7) states:</P>
      <P>A contribution under this section shall be payable in respect of each contribution week during the whole or any part of which the employee concerned was employed but where no remuneration has been received for, or no services have been rendered by the employee during, any contribution week, the employer shall not be liable to pay any contribution either on his own behalf or on behalf of the employee concerned for that week.</P>
      <P>That is easy enough but I want to query the Minister as to whether the same principle stands in every week where the employee may be rendered unemployed because of a laying-off, sickness, holidays and the like, that is, for every week he receives no wages, no redundancy stamp will be applied? It is very unfair if this is true because it means that if a man is out because of sickness he obviously gets no wages and no stamp is credited to him for redundancy purposes.</P>

In this section there is reference to the Act of 1952.  Would the Minister consider putting that in when he is making regulations&mdash;to spell it out for people so that they can look at this without having to go back to previous Acts?</P>

Furthermore, it is imperative that a synopsis of the regulations be made out and published alongside for the workers' scrutiny, because it is very difficult for an ordinary working man to apply his mind to a set of regulations drawn up in Civil Service language. I agree with the point made by Deputy Jones of a worker having to refer to section this, that or the other of a previous Act.  The clearer these regulations can be made, even to the people contributing to the Fund, the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>In page 28, before section 55, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>(1)  If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing into operation this Act or any amendment or repeal effected by this Act, the Minister may by order do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation, and any such order may modify a provision of this Act so far as may appear necessary or expedient for carrying the order into effect.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every order made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it annulling such order, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> (3)  No order may be made under this section after the expiration of one year after the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will realise by now that this Bill is a very complex piece of legislation.  To a large extent, it is breaking new ground in social legislation. In these circumstances, it is quite conceivable&mdash;although I think it unlikely&mdash;that when the Act is brought into operation, some unforeseen difficulty or circumstances could arise which would impede or hold up the implementation or the operation of the redundancy payments scheme.  I would then be in the position of having to come to the House, to the Oireachtas, with amending legislation. I think the House will agree it would be unfortunate if, after the commencement date of the Act, some technicality for which we had not provided could hold up the benefits for the section of the community for which the Bill is intended.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted operation of the Act, I would seek in this section power to remove any difficulty which is likely to stand in the way of the full implementation of the Act when it is in force.  The section would not give me power to make substantial changes, or any change, in the Act; it would merely give power to the Minister to overcome any difficulty in the operation of what has been enacted by the Oireachtas. There are ample safeguards for the Oireachtas against misuse of any powers vested in the Minister by way of this section.</P>

    <P>This amendment is to correct an omission in the drafting of subsection (2) of section 55.

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 4, page 29, line 36, to delete &ldquo;four weeks&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one week&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We think this is a reasonable amendment, particularly when one considers that the type of people we are dealing with are in the main provident people. They are people who, according to this Bill, will have less than £1,200 per year income.  If we bear that in mind, I submit it is unreasonable to ask them to wait four weeks before the first weekly payment is made to them.  The people I speak about have not been in a position, and will not be, to save up for the type of eventuality posed by redundancy.  The main reason we welcome the Bill is that it affords such people an opportunity of getting something in the event of redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask the Minister to accept the amendment because, one way or another, these people will get paid and we consider it to be imposing a hardship on them to have them waiting longer than a week before they get their first weekly payment.  Workers now declared redundant are covered by the social welfare code and can go to the employment exchange to obtain their benefit without having to wait a period of four weeks.  We ask the Minister to go along with the idea of giving the benefit a week after the termination of employment.  It should be an easy thing to bring about, particularly because the Department of <Col N="1680" /> Labour will have a special section dealing with it.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we get a more enlightened approach to extending benefits than has been the case under the Social Welfare Acts.  We are more than anxious to avoid delay in giving redundant workers their weekly payments. As I have said, all the people who will come within the ambit of the Bill will not be able to afford to wait for the money to come.  They have daily commitments, never mind weekly commitments, and will need to be paid a week after termination of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In parts of this Bill we decided on periods which we thought most suitable in the light of circumstances which exist.  In determining the lump sum provision, we had to decide what an industry could carry, what would be an incentive to an employer.  In relation to this period of four weeks, I have tried to come to a decision on whether a man should get redundancy weekly payments at once or whether there should first be a waiting period so as to provide an incentive to him to seek out new employment. I should point out that the waiting period does not reduce the number of weeks for which he will get benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes nothing from him&mdash;he will get the full benefit, starting four weeks after he becomes unemployed.  I have been thinking it over: I have had strong representations from my own Party to reduce this period and I am prepared to take a lesser period than four weeks.  I think one week is too short.  The smallest lump sum would equal two weeks pay and I would be willing to take two weeks as the waiting period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's approach but may I direct his attention to the fact that this amendment deals with weekly payments, not lump sums, and I understand that the purpose of the Bill is to help people to tide themselves over until they get <Col N="1681" /> employment, to keep them going? The income of those who will be affected by the Bill is so low at present that it is not sufficient to enable them to put money by for this rainy or evil day.  The State is in a better position, the Department are in a better position, to meet the payments immediately &mdash;there is the Redundancy Fund itself. The Department are in a better position to do the waiting, if waiting is required.  This deals with a man who, through no fault of his own or, perhaps, of his employer, loses his employment and finds himself subsisting on a weekly redundancy payment, to be regarded as something in the way of a substitute for the weekly wage he had. He will have lost that wage to which he was accustomed and will have to fall back on this, but instead of being able to fall back on it immediately, he will have to wait four weeks.  I am conscious of the fact that he will not lose anything but the payment should be made, shall we say as a continuity of the wages he had.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said he has had representations from his own Party.  I can assure him we shall be satisfied if he makes up his mind between now and Report Stage on this matter.  I am sure a number of Deputies in his Party who are in touch with working people will bear out what I have said, that it is highly desirable that this payment be made on a weekly basis without a gap before the first payment.</P>

      <P>I am not now concerned with the lump sum.  It is all very well if the employee gets a lump sum but a lump sum should not be regarded as being a workman's first weekly payment from the Redundancy Fund.  That is not its purpose and let us not confuse it.</P>

      <P>The lump sum is related to weekly wages.  The smallest possible lump sum is two weeks' wages. Most people will have, in the lump sum, money to carry them over the period and that will give them a longer period for their weekly contributions.</P>

      <P>At the worst, he will have two weeks' wages to cover a gap of two weeks.  Most redundant people will have more and will not be left without money for the gap.  It is a sort of horse-trading, if you like, but I think we should have a gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The weekly payment will undoubtedly be considerably removed from his weekly wage and it will last only a certain period.  The lump sum will last as long as he sees fit to keep it.  In the majority of cases, the lump sum will be utilised to supplement the weekly payment for as long as the weekly payment last so as to bring it as near as possible to his weekly wage.  Most men endeavour to ensure that the wife has a fixed amount per week to run the home.  If the lump sum is spread out over the period of weekly payments then the amount will not be anything related to his weekly wage.  Perhaps we would never be satisfied with the amount of money that is paid.  Many people will pay into this Fund who will never get anything from it.  Let us not attach too much importance to this lump sum payment. When a working man thinks in terms of the expression &ldquo;lump sum payment&rdquo;, he thinks of a few hundred pounds or £60 or £70&mdash;not of two weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very pleasant to hear that the Minister is amenable to cutting down the time-lag in this connection. Much play has been made of the payment of a lump sum as something which would tide a man over this difficult period.  Have we any guarantee that that lump sum will quickly be paid, that it is immediately payable when a man becomes redundant?  Is it not conceivable that there would be a considerable time-lag before the lump sum is paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very fine. We want to be completely satisfied that the lump sum will be paid quickly, immediately, on a man's being dismissed and qualifying for redundancy pay.  If the time-lag is too great before coming to the rescue of a redundant worker by way of weekly payments, there is a grave likelihood that we may lose quite substantial numbers of skilled workers.  In these times of high cost of living, the responsible worker and especially the skilled worker is not prepared to wait around for two, three or four weeks until such time as the State gives his extra benefit or until a job turns up.</P>
      <P>Our experience at the present time, especially in industry, is that unless a man sees a prospect of employment&mdash; especially a man with family responsibilities who has been used to a relatively high standard of life&mdash;he invariably goes to Britain.  Such people cannot afford to wait four weeks.  They must come to a decision.  Unfortunately, all too many of them decide to go to Britain.  We simply cannot afford to lose this important pool of highly-skilled labour which may well be affected by redundancy.</P>

I want to sound this note of warning that, during this crucial period of waiting, a man and his family must make a serious adjustment in their standards of life and unless the assistance is readily forthcoming we may lose these people to our society and to our economy.  The day has gone when men could simply stick around hoping, like Micawber, that something would turn up.  If this Bill is to be effective, there must be the speediest application of redundancy payment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
      <P>In page 30, after line 27, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.  Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 5, 8 or 9, a person who is undergoing a course of training arranged or approved by An Chomhairle Oiliúna shall not be disentitled to receive a weekly payment for the period of such training on the ground only that he is ineligible to receive unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for that period.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is designed to ensure that a redundant worker who is undergoing a course of training approved by An Chomhairle Oiliúna will be entitled to draw the weekly payments under the redundancy scheme as if he were not undergoing training at all.  The Social Welfare Acts lay down that a person undergoing a course of training is deemed to be not available for work and consequently would not be entitled to receive unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  Under Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 of this Bill, a redundant worker is not entitled to a <Col N="1685" /> weekly payment if he is disqualified or ineligible in any way to receive unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  As it stands this would mean that a person who is redundant but who accepts a course of training for employment would not be entitled to receive redundancy payments.  The amendment is designed to preserve such a man's entitlement to weekly payments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P>In page 33, line 50, before &ldquo;section 10 (4)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;section 10 (3) and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  If it is to be explained, we should have to study the complex provisions of section 10 (3) and Paragraph 18 of Schedule 2 to grasp the need for the amendment. If the House wants me to explain, I will endeavour to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 18 of Schedule I deals with the position of an employee (a) who is under notice of dismissal by his employer, (b) who has given notice to terminate his employment on a date earlier than in his employer's notice and (c) having done that, dies before the expiry date of his own notice and before his employer has a chance to give him notice requiring the employee to withdraw his notice.  This is very complicated but circumstances do arise where an employer gives notice to the worker and the worker sees an opportunity of getting employment before the period of notice is up.  In such a case, if he wishes to get redundancy payment, he has to give notice to the employer of his desire to terminate at an earlier date.  If an employer for good reasons does not want to let him go, he has to give a further notice to the employee to withdraw his notice of earlier termination.  If the employee should die at the stage where he had given notice to terminate earlier and before the employer has had a chance <Col N="1686" /> to ask the employee to withdraw his notice, this difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>The intention is that in the circumstances I have outlined, it would be assumed that the employer had given the employee notice requiring him to withdraw his notice of termination of employment and the employee had not complied with that notice.  If an employee dies in the circumstances I have mentioned, the rights of the employer to dispute a redundancy payment claim will not be taken away by the death of the employee. If the claim were disputed, it would be for the Tribunal to decide whether or not redundancy payment should be made.  Just to go over that again: provision is made for a man who is under notice and who wants to leave his employment at a date before the expiry of that notice while preserving his entitlement to redundancy payment, to give notice that he wants to terminate at that earlier date.  If the employer has good reasons for requiring the employee to finish out the notice given by him, then he must give the employee notice asking him to withdraw his intention to terminate earlier and if the employee unreasonably refuses to comply with that, then he would not be entitled to redundancy payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <P>Yes.  The original drafting was to protect the employer against an employee leaving him when he needed him, even though the employee was under notice.  As originally drafted, if an employer said: &ldquo;I want your services to the last date of my notice,&rdquo; and if the employee unreasonably&mdash; and this is something that could be determined by the Tribunal&mdash;refused to finish on the employer's expiry date, he would not get redundancy payment. It depended on the employer saying in writing: &ldquo;I want you to withdraw notice terminating your employment at an earlier date because I want you to the end of the notice.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I suppose he would have to say that he wanted him to remain on for business purposes.  He could not do that if the employee dies. It would be difficult for the employer <Col N="1688" /> to say that the employee caused him to suffer by his absence for the full term of notice.

If the worker unreasonably says: &ldquo;I am going before the notice is up,&rdquo; he will lose his redundancy payment but he will lose it only if the employer has told him in writing that he wants his services.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> In page 35 to delete paragraph 1 and 2 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The amount of the lump sum shall be equivalent to the aggregate of the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  the product of one and one-half times the employee's normal weekly remuneration on the date of his dismissal and the number of years of continuous employment with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal, after the employee had attained the age of forty-one years, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the product of the employee's normal weekly remuneration and the number of years of continuous employment with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal, between the date on which the employee attained the age of twenty-one years and the date on which he attained the age of forty-one years, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the product of one-half of the employee's normal weekly remuneration and the number of years of continuous employment, with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal, between the date on which the employee attained the age of eighteen years and the date on which he attained the age of twenty-one years.</P>
    <P>2.  Where, in reckoning the number of years, of employment in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Schedule, twenty years of employment have been reckoned, no account shall be taken of any year of employment earlier than those twenty years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as it now stands, a lump sum redundancy payment of a half week's pay for each year of employment between the age of 18 and 41 and one week's pay for each year of employment over the age of 41 is provided for, subject to a maximum of 16 weeks' pay.  We propose that the lump sum should be as it is in Northern Ireland, that is, a half week's pay for each year of employment between 18 and 21 years; one week's pay for each <Col N="1691" /> year of employment between 22 and 41 years; and one and a half week's pay for each year of employment over 41 years of age.  In addition, we propose that the lump sum should be related to the number of complete years in continuous employment up to a maximum of 20 years.</P>
    <P>We feel that a man who has given such service in employment is entitlted to far more consideration than is proposed in the Bill.  It is only proper that the Minister should accept this amendment as something more reasonable than that proposed in the Bill for a person who has given long and loyal service to a firm and who, through no fault of his own, finds himself faced with unemployment.  As I said, the amendment we have tabled conforms with the provision in Northern Ireland. Surely we can have here at least as good a Redundancy Bill as is provided for there?  I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the practice in Northern Ireland, reasonable redundancy compensation has in a number of cases been negotiated with individual employers.  Under the provision in the Bill, a person could work almost 20 years with an employer and find, possibly as a result of adaptation procedures or the re-equipment of the industry, himself faced with redundancy. Apart from temporary weekly redundancy compensation, the lump sum would be confined to a half week's pay for each year of service, which would be completely insufficient.  For workers with long years of service to suggest, as the Minister has, that a half week's pay up to 41 years and a week over 41 years is leaving the situation most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this Bill we must bear in mind we are dealing not only with cases of redundancy arising from a diminution in trade or a loss of orders.  We may very well be dealing with redundancy brought about as a result of adaptation procedures or the introduction of new and expensive machinery, for which in many cases the owners may receive adaptation grants or grants from An Foras Tionscal. Yet the effect on that industry <Col N="1692" /> might be that the labour force is reduced. Even though production in that industry may increase, there could still be a reduction in the labour force involved. That is not guesswork.  It has happened in many cases.  Unless orders in such industries increase tremendously, you may have the situation in which fewer workers are producing the same or more goods.  Cases can be cited from these benches in which employment in fairly substantial industries has decreased by as much as 30 per cent over a relatively short number of years; yet the production in the same industries has gone up.  Therefore, we are not dealing with something that comes about merely by chance.  It can happen as the result of the implementation of policy emanating in some cases from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>In certain cases where this has occurred, as a result of negotiations by the representatives of the workers concerned, agreement has been reached to protect the workers against the effects of direct redundancy.  They are guaranteed either that alternative work will be available for them or, in cases where reasonable pension schemes are in operation, they are urged to opt for a pension at an earlier age.  But this Bill would not apply only to these cases.  It would apply in any case where a worker is declared redundant.  The Labour Party view on this matter is set out clearly in the amendment.  In our view, the lump sum compensation under this Bill is inadequate in the circumstances I have described.</P>
    <P>We would ask the Minister to look at the position again.  Workers are not just cogwheels.  They may be considered as such by the employers or even by representatives of the State. But for somebody who has worked ten, 15 or 20 years for an employer, that is his way of life.  His domestic circumstances and his social circumstances are geared to that employment. Where redundancy occurs, it means a major operation so far as the worker is concerned, from the family and from the social point of view.  He may have to transfer his home, maybe not to another town but certainly to a different part of the city or town in <Col N="1693" /> which he lives.  I support this amendment and I would ask the Minister to have another look at the level of the lump sum compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add to what has already been said in relation to the lump sum payment, which is probably the key to the whole Bill. This compensation is intended to cushion the effects of redundancy, which is a depressing and expensive period for a worker.  He may have entered into long-term commitments in the belief that he would continue in permanent employment, and then finds himself redundant; he may have purchased a home near his place of employment in order to cut out travelling expenses.  I believe the period of 16 weeks is somewhat short. The Minister has been fairly sympathetic right through in meeting the points of view of the various Deputies, and as this is probably the most important section of the Bill, I would ask him to reconsider the size of the lump sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I am glad that Deputy Dowling is also supporting it.  What is provided in this Bill could not be described as a reasonable lump sum.  In this regard, I should like to emphasise something that has already been said, and indeed acknowledged by the Minister, that there will be a number of workers excluded from payment under this Bill who have paid into the Fund. The Minister has already indicated that he expects there will not be a great deal of redundancy.  Those are two indications that this Fund will be reasonably solvent.  If we take into consideration the Minister's confidence in regard to the future, we cannot be regarded as unreasonable in putting forward this amendment.  Furthermore, as I said here last week, it is highly desirable that when the opportunity presents itself to be as good to our people as the other Government is to our people in the Six Counties, we should seize that opportunity.  The opportunity is now there for us to equate our scheme with that of the Six Counties.  What we are advocating <Col N="1694" /> here is already law in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the lump sum payment, there is not a whole lot dividing us.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out, redundancy can come about as a result of improvements in industry and in some cases an employee may be regarded for the time being anyhow as conveniently old because the type of job he has been doing for a number of years has folded up.  It could take a considerable time for such a person to adjust himself to other types of employment, and I understand the whole purpose behind these redundancy payments is to assist people to get by, pending the finding of other employment.  That being so, it is imperative that we give them a reasonable lump sum payment.</P>
      <P>Earlier on when we were advocating from these benches that the weekly payments should be made the first week after an employee's employment has been terminated, instead of after four weeks as provided in the Bill, we were told from the Government benches that there was this lump sum payment provision in existence.  If one takes time to add up what this lump sum payment amounts to as it is set out, one finds it is nothing to write home about. We have the support of Deputy Dowling for this amendment, and I am sure there are other Deputies in the Minister's Party who feel the same way.  If the Minister does not agree to the amendment, perhaps he would agree to make his decision known on Report Stage.  We would naturally hope he would recognise that there is a case for increasing the lump sum payment.</P>

      <P>I think there is a misconception here, because we are told we should give this lump sum, that we should make it bigger, omitting any consideration of the fact that this lump sum does not come out of public funds, that it does not come out of the contributions towards the Redundancy Fund but from the employer alone.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of voting money from public funds but of putting an obligation on the employer only who is already contributing very <Col N="1695" /> heavily to the Redundancy Fund, who may very well find his business running down due to circumstances over which he has no control and that he has to pay this lump sum as well.  It is not just a matter of the Minister being generous, of the Minister having another think about it.  The Minister has not got to find the money.  It is the employer who has to find the money. I agree that a man may very well be placed in a difficult position because of redundancy, but who is going to take the brunt of it in the total sense?  As I see it, the chances of redundancy coming about by way of large-scale modernisation of equipment or methods are quite slight.  It does happen occasionally but rarely enough.  What is much more likely is that redundancy will be caused by a change in trading conditions, withdrawal of protection to an industry or some such factor over which the employer has no control. Where a business is contracting, it certainly cannot afford to pay unlimited lump sums to its employees.</P>

      <P>It disturbs Labour Deputies to hear the facts, but let it be clearly understood in the House and appreciated by the Minister, as I am sure it is, that we are not here to agree to distribute benefits out of somebody else's pocket.  It is very easy to say that so-and-so should get more money when neither I nor you have to pay it, but when you are putting an obligation on one sector of the economy which has already been burdened with a considerable amount of additional taxation to subsidise this Redundancy Fund, to place on him an additional load at a time probably when business is least able to bear it, is all nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody would like everybody else to have more money, but we must see where the money is to come from. <Col N="1697" /> The entire amount of weekly payments will be paid out of the Redundancy Fund to which the employer as well as the worker contributes, but the lump sum is entirely the employer's responsibility. I do not object to the lump sum provision as it stands.  It is a good provision and an added incentive to employers not to declare people redundant.  It is a penalty on an employer for declaring people redundant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Very many employers already have pension schemes.  Under this Bill they will without any pension scheme have to contribute a larger amount than the employees to the Redundancy Fund.  Also the employers must now make provision towards setting aside a certain amount of money to pay this lump sum immediately on the dismissal of any employee for reasons of redundancy.  What more can you ask?  You may say the amount is small.  It is small where the service is <Col N="1698" /> very short but it will be a considerable sum in the case of a genuine long term employee.  The House must remember that we are not dispensing money out of the air.  We are imposing an obligation on an employer, on a company, which probably when this arises will be very hard pushed even to meet its obligations.  That is what happens when there is redundancy.  It is a question of contraction of business and consequently there is no money there to distribute to anybody.  Please look at this in a realistic way and do not begin distributing largesse without realising who has to foot the bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The final point made by Deputy Booth was dealt with by Deputy Larkin, that is that redundancy is not necessarily caused by contraction of business.  Redundancy can be caused&mdash;and we are told by the Minister is likely to be caused&mdash;by the adoption of new methods of production which may make a reduction of the labour force inevitable.  Contraction of business does not come into that and, in fact, adoption of modern production methods and the introduction of up-to-date machinery may bring about a situation in which far greater production is secured and consequently far greater profit instead of the reverse which is the poor mouth case made by Deputy Booth.  Deputy Booth is a halo dispenser.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that you <Col N="1702" /> are not being kept under control.  I must appeal to the Chair for protection against this gross interruption that I am subjected to by the Minister.  If I may be allowed to come back to the subject of the Bill, I want to say that we feel very strongly that the proposal is acceptable.  Surely, we cannot be in earnest in our protestations about our desire for the unity of the country if we perpetuate the inequities existing as between workers in the North and workers in the South?  It is very obvious that we have a duty to endeavour to do as well as the Government in the North of Ireland do in respect of the people for whom they have responsibility. Accordingly, we urge this amendment upon the Minister.  I certainly think that the Deputies who have tabled the amendment have done very well.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Booth is not here.  I would have a great deal more to say to him if he were here, but as he is not here, I do not propose to say anything further about him.  I would say to the Minister that he has got now the opportunity of proving whether Deputy Dowling is just putting on a show or not, whether he is pretending or not.  We would like to know just what the Minister's attitude is in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly to refer to one or two points.  Strange as it may seem, the answer to this whole controversy may be found in the Labour Party's contributions and in Deputy Booth's, and in the centre there is the Minister who has given tremendous thought to this Bill.  I feel with him that the Bill here compares favourably with the legislation in the Six Counties.  It is a good start in a redundancy payments scheme.  I would accept the Labour Party outlook that automation will lead to less employment but for the fact that this theory is over 100 years old, going back to the time when the Luddites of England opposed the introduction of the spinning jenny in Lancashire.  They were defeated and Lancashire became the greatest cotton centre in the whole world until the Japanese, by better methods, made Japan the cotton centre. <Col N="1703" /> Automation and modernisation do not necessarily mean less employment. That has been proved in the United States of America where industries have been modernised and automation has been introduced.  Eventually you have much greater employment.  In the OECD magazine issued monthly or quarterly, the opinion is always stressed that automation does not, in fact, lead to redundancy.  I do not think it does.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Labour Party, they do feel like Deputy Dowling and myself.  While I know the Minister has given very careful thought to the Bill, it is natural for some of us here to seek more for a man who is going to lose his job.  It is not a pension, merely payment to tide him over temporary difficulties until he finds alternative employment.  I know what is in the Minister's mind.  On previous occasions when we asked the Minister to amend a proposal, he has done so.  I do feel that tonight, perhaps, he could extend the period mentioned in the Bill.  That would meet the Labour Party's wishes and I am sure, despite what Deputy Booth has said, would meet his wishes. We have to consider the fact that this money will not come from Government funds or members' contributions; it will come from employers.  If we approach this matter in the spirit that each person involved has his rights, an extra few weeks would not break any employer while it would mean a great deal to a worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Dowling and the Labour Party on this point in asking the Minister to examine the period mentioned in the Bill and, if possible, to extend it.  At the same time, I want to pay tribute to the Minister who has done a tremendous job on this Bill. This is the first time that we have had redundancy payments legislation and the Minister has set a headline in its preparation and has promised that he will have special schemes for special types of workers.  We can face the future unafraid of automation or that a worker will be left penniless.  He certainly will not become affluent as a result of the Bill but, at least, he will not be left penniless.  I put it to the <Col N="1704" /> Minister that he should review the period here and, if possible, increase it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into a discussion with Deputy Moore in regard to the effects of automation. He said that automation does not bring about redundancy.  He should have said: &ldquo;should not bring about redundancy.&rdquo;  We cannot ignore the fact that our unemployment figure has grown and is still growing and we are not in a period of full employment when we can start thinking in other terms in regard to automation.  In my capacity as a trade union official, I have had some knowledge of the results of automation.  In a number of cases it has brought about redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that.  Let us not talk about automation as doing great things for the workers.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the section now. Despite the knowing way in which Deputy Booth talked on this occasion &mdash;as he tried to do on other occasions &mdash;it is obvious that he, who is always eager to point out to people that they are wrong, has not applied his mind to this Bill at all.  It strikes me that he has neglected to do his homework. He tried to come to the defence of the employers and he unhesitatingly cried on behalf of the employers, without realising the full extent of the provisions of the Bill.  In the explanatory memorandum which was circulated to all Deputies, it is stated on page 2, paragraph 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal payments which will be made out of the Redundancy Fund are the weekly payments to redundant workers (paragraph 7 above) and rebates to employers who make lump-sum payments in accordance with section 19 of the Bill. The rebates to employers will be the equivalent of one-half of the lump-sum paid but a bonus of 2½ per cent of the lump-sum will be added to a rebate in respect of each extra week of notice given in excess of the minimum period of two weeks provided <Col N="1705" /> for in section 17, subject to a maximum rebate of 65 per cent of the actual lump-sum payment (section 29).</P>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious that Deputy Booth did not read that.  It is unfortunate that he is not here: as usual, as my colleague, Deputy Dunne, said, he runs in and makes a speech and runs out again.  He is oblivious of what is happening.  In this instance he does not know what he is talking about. There is the proof that rebates are given to the employers.  Let us forget about crying and whinging about the employers paying the lump sum.  The money to a great extent will come from the Redundancy Payment Fund. Let us stop talking about the employers paying all this.  They will get rebates.  Where will the rebates come from?  They will come from the Fund.  Indeed, I am sorry that Deputy Booth did not bother to study this piece of legislation since it affects his business as an employer, and his business as a man responsible for workers.  Now and then he purports to have an interest in the workers.</P>
    <P>I think a reasonable case has been made for the amendment.  Many arguments were put forward in favour of it, including those made by Deputy Moore and Deputy Dowling.  I hope the Minister will accept all that has been said. He has been urged from these benches and by his two colleagues to change this section and to make the provision which we are advocating in the Labour Party amendment.  Undoubtedly this will not make or break the Fund.  If what we envisage comes about, it surely will not break the Fund to give decent lump sum payments.  There is no doubt that the lump sum payments and the weekly payments will be utilised by the working men and women to tide them over until such time as they find another job.  During that period of tiding over, it is natural that they should aspire to have the same standard of living, if possible, or as near as possible to the same standard of living, as they had before they were declared redundant, while they were working.</P>
    <P>The people we are talking about have less than £1,200 a year.  They need this type of assistance and they need <Col N="1706" /> these lump sum payments.  They are not extravagant lump sums.  Another good reason why the Minister should accept this is that apart from this Redundancy Payments Bill, day after day the different trade unions find it necessary, unfortunately, to discuss redundancy payments in respect of some of their members, and on those occasions we have to ask the employers to have regard to the years of service given by the employees.  In most cases payment has been made far in excess of what is mentioned in the Bill.  I am conscious of the fact that the Bill provides for the minimum only.  We have some decent employers and I am hoping that they will not regard this as the be-all and the end-all of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, these are largely tentative estimates of what the Fund can carry.  Experience will show us whether we can improve them. The figures given here are based on the best estimate that could be made by us, but only experience can tell us what can be done in actual fact.  The experience in Britain was that after a year or so of operation the contribution had to be doubled.  Their estimate erred and they had to double the contribution to support the Fund.</P>
      <P>The difference between our scheme and the one in Britain is that we have weekly payments out of the Fund.  This Fund will have to carry the weekly payments and the lump sums or part of the lump sums.  Deputy Mullen spoke about the rebate which may be given to an individual employer, and the individual employer will provide the rest of the lump sum.  Industry generally in Ireland will be carrying these lump sums and weekly payments. If we want to make our lump sums equal to those in Britain and continue with the weekly payments, we will be putting too much of a burden on industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a better scheme to have weekly payments and lump sums rather than lump sums only.  It suits us better to have lump sums plus weekly payments.  I do not know what our experience will be, but if time proves that the Fund can carry more, the House will be in a position to accept <Col N="1707" /> a proposal by me to increase the amount.  I have gone into this deeply with representatives of the workers and employers.  Deputy Moore spoke about this period of 16 weeks.  That is a figure which I would not mind looking at again, and increasing it.</P>

As it happens, they will not be made redundant; they will not be put out the gate.  There will be alternative work for them elsewhere.  Let us make the position quite clear because there has been a great deal of talk about productivity: productivity means making the same amount of goods with less labour or a greater amount of goods with the same labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers have called for a greater development of industry and that has resulted in adaptation and new equipment.  That may well result in redundancy.  Many employers on many occasions have indicated that, in order to make new techniques and new equipment most efficient, it might be as well if the older workers would stand aside, retire earlier, or become redundant.  Employers are doubtful that the older workers can be retrained as efficient units in the handling of new equipment.  As Deputy Mullen has pointed out, the Minister is very conscious of this particular problem and that is shown in the sections providing for a rebate out of a common fund in relation to redundancy compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1709" /> We are concerned primarily in our amendment with the effect on the worker who is declared redundant. There are two methods of approach. One is the payment of weekly compensation for a certain period.  It is hoped it will be a short period, but it may be longer than is anticipated.  The other is compensation by way of a lump sum.  I urge the Minister to look again at this level of redundancy compensation. As the Bill stands, if a worker becomes redundant after 20 or 25 years service, he can get half a week's wages for each year of service.  Would that happen at any level in management? The Minister knows very well it would not.  Management would get compensation of one year, two or three years salary.  Management would get adequate notice.  Here we are dealing with the worker earning under £1,200 who becomes redundant after 20 or 25 years' faithful service.  We hold that ten weeks redundancy compensation, aside from the weekly compensation, is wholly inadequate.  In the case of a worker who may have difficulty in getting employment readily elsewhere, it is not only inadequate but utterly miserable.  We appeal to the Minister to reconsider this.</P>

      <P>There are many <Col N="1710" /> schemes in operation far superior to that contained in this measure.  One has only to look at the schemes in operation on the Continent and in Britain. I know schemes under which two weeks wages are paid for each year of service, and sums in excess of that in certain industries.  If the Minister insists on pinning down the lump sum payment to half a week's wages, or a week's wages are paid for each year of will stand as a very inferior one.  The Minister has agreed to extend the payment period from 16 weeks to 20 weeks.</P>

      <P>I have not agreed to extend the rate of payment; I have agreed that for the lump-sum the maximum period will be 20 weeks instead of 16 weeks.  I am not talking about weekly payments.  It is impossible to discuss the Bill if the Deputy does not know what is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was out while I was here.  In all the circumstances, I would like clarification of the original stipulation in the Bill that the half-week's pay would commence at the age of 18, between 18 and 41. I take it that the Minister has agreed to apply the scheme to people at the age of 16 and that this age limit will now change to 16 years of age.  I do not know if the Minister is confirmed in that opinion at the present time, but I thought at an earlier stage that he was favourably disposed towards applying the scheme to people at the age of 16 rather than 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The service will count from 16 instead of from 18.  I shall amend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear.  One of the reasons why we feel that the lump-sum payment should be a pretty generous payment is the fall in the value of money in these times. Workers, when they are declared redundant, are compelled to make a decision, sometimes a quick decision, and this may involve the requirement <Col N="1711" /> of their being mobile enough to transfer to another area within the country or perhaps to emigrate.</P>
      <P>Where the lump-sum is concerned also, many workers think in terms of branching out on their own and going into some little industry or enterprise and the payments which we envisage in this scheme are ridiculously low from that point of view.  Taking a basis of an average wage of £10 a week, the redundancy payment under this scheme as at present constituted would not exceed £160, or £80 for the people who would be only entitled to half a week's pay.  If one of the features of this redundancy scheme is to achieve mobility of labour and to entice people to change from one job to another, the Minister will have to increase the lump-sum payments.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances, we feel that a half week's pay between 18 and 21 is something which the Minister has in mind anyway, a week's pay for each year of service between 22 and 40 is contained in the British Act and we are only asking for 1½ week's pay between 41 and, say, 70.  There is not an awful lot between us I suppose and I would appeal to the Minister at least to bridge that gap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise, the lump sum payments are not very attractive. As was pointed out earlier, the Minister does not envisage a spate of redundancy and the vast majority of the workers who will be contributing to this Fund, fortunately for them, will never benefit by this scheme, so that in respect of the small numbers of people whom we are catering for, I feel that we could afford to be more generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 64:</P>
      <P>In page 35, after line 33, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  When the total number of years of continuous employment as ascertained in accordance with subparagraphs (a) to (c) falls to be divided for the purposes of <Col N="1714" /> paragraphs 1 (a) and 1 (b), any remaining parts of a year in those divisions shall be aggregated and the number of full years represented by this aggregation (when calculated in accordance with subparagraphs (a) to (c) shall be added to the period of employment mentioned in paragraph 1 (a).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an additional sub-paragraph to paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 and it is necessary to provide a basis of calculation when the period of continuous service falls to be broken down between service under 41 years of age and service over 41 years of age because there is a different estimation of amounts for each and it affects the amounts of the lump sum to be paid.  We have to lay down rules for the calculation of this because of a complication which arises from a provision which provides for periods of 26 weeks or more being rounded up to one year.  In other words if a period of 26 weeks is remaining it is called a year.  This is favourable to the worker.  The purpose of the new subparagraph is that where this breakdown of service is necessary, any residual service under or over 41 is treated as years under 41.  This arrangement preserves the balance between the employers' and the employees' interests.  The employee gains by rounding up anything over 26 weeks to a year and to counter that incomplete years would be counted as equal to a year under 41 years of age.  It is a fair balance.</P>

      <P>In page 35, after line 45, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;6.  Where a trade or business or an undertaking (whether or not it be an undertaking established by or <Col N="1715" /> under an Act of the Oireachtas) was transferred from one person to another, the period of employment of an employee in the trade or business or undertaking at the time of the transfer shall count as a period of employment with the transferee, and the transfer shall not break the continuity of the period of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that continuity of employment is preserved for the purposes of redundancy payment, where a worker was employed in a business which changed ownership before the operative date of the Bill.

      <P>Could I, at this stage, raise a question in respect of the interpretation of this whole question of seniority of service?  I want to pose a special question to the Minister.  You may have a situation where an employer arbitrarily decides to suspend the services of his workers and to take up an attitude that they are no longer entitled to seniority of service or any other perquisites attached to the firm. This employer adopts the attitude, as the result of a trade dispute, that the workers have ceased their entitlement to any recognition in the firm and that he is purporting to re-open the firm.  He purports to re-open the firm, even though the firm is in the same name.  Can that employer's arbitrary action have any adverse effect in respect of continuity of service under this redundancy payments scheme?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 67:</P>
      <P>In page 36 to delete paragraph 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is that we want a strike as well as a lock-out <Col N="1718" /> to count.  The Minister makes it clear in the Bill that where a lock-out takes place, this would be deemed as allowable service for the purpose of qualifying for redundancy payment.  We feel that &ldquo;strike&rdquo; should be inserted. We are asking that this word be inserted before &ldquo;lock-out&rdquo; so that this will cover both strike and lock-out. There are many cases where a strike would be very justifiable In the vast majority of cases, strikes are justifiable and people are placed in the position where in order to secure their rights, they have to withdraw labour.  We feel that this period of time should be allowable with regard to qualifying for redundancy payments.  We would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment and in doing so, may I direct the Minister's attention to what appears to me to be contradictory?  We are objecting to paragraph 11 which reads:</P>
      <P>Absence from work by reason of a strike in the business or industry in which the employee concerned is employed and which occurred after the commencement of this Act shall not be allowable as reckonable service.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 10 appears to be contradictory. It reads:</P>
      <P>Absence from work by reason of a strike in the business or industry in which the employee concerned is employed and which occurred before the commencement of this Act shall be allowable as reckonable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 11 clearly indicates that workers who go on strike will not get redundancy payments.  This is extremely unfair.  It interferes with the liberty of people.  Very often people have to go on strike.  They have no other option. The Minister is very well aware of this in regard to the office he holds now as Minister for Labour.  Many strikes have come about in this country after long and tedious negotiations extending as far as the Labour Court.  What is being advocated in this paragraph is affecting all these efforts and you get an employer continuously saying no, as has been highlighted by a very eminent man who attempted to intervene <Col N="1719" /> in the bacon strike.  If we have a situation of that kind occurring and the workers are let go on strike such workers will not be allowed to have that period of time taken into account as continuous service.  We have always held that a workman on strike is still in employment, still under contract.  Does it break his contract to have a disagreement with his employer?  When he goes back, he goes back on whatever terms emanate from the strike.</P>
    <P>That is added on to the agreement that is already in existence, but this particular paragraph will create a very serious precedent.  It will encourage employers to do something that only a few of them have attempted to do up to the present.  To the present time, in the matter of service being extended to people, we have had strikes which have been taken into consideration for continuance of service.  This paragraph will inspire employers to say in future that if you go out on strike, the period you spend on strike will be a penalty and you will not get any allowance for that period by way of continuity of employment.  If this happens, it will only make the people involved in a strike look for compensation before they return to work.</P>
    <P>The taking out of this paragraph will improve the Bill.  The continuity inclusion in it will destroy the real meaning of the Bill and will fall into line with the thoughts that have been repeatedly expressed, not only on this occasion but on other occasions, by Deputy Booth.  There is no penalty of this kind being imposed on the employer.  His failure to give continuous employment to the worker can end up only with the worker getting a meagre lump-sum or weekly payment.</P>
    <P>I would entreat the Minister to accept the Labour Party's amendment and delete this paragraph from the Bill, just as he has in paragraph 10 where there is an allowance made for strikes in retrospect.  They are taken into account for the purpose of calculating continuous service.  Surely the Minister can follow it through and let it continue that way?  We will not look to the future and say that there will be a series of strikes.  Let this <Col N="1720" /> Bill not indicate any semblance of a big strike, of a penalty being imposed on workers because they exercise their constitutional rights, rights which they exercise most times after a lot of discussion and argument in connection with the matters affecting them.  Very often it can be proved that the disputes that occur are not always the workers' fault.  But this paragraph is saying straight away that because a person went on strike, he will have his continuity of service interfered with for the duration of the period of the strike.  I would ask the Minister to change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put to the Minister another aspect of the matter.  Section 10 deals with the question of absences from work through industrial illness and so on, and absence from work with the permission of the employers.  Every case is dealt with on an individual basis, on the individual's absence from work because of his suffering from industrial disease or injury or being absent from work because of illness through occupational disease or absence from work with the permission of his employer for a period not exceeding 13 weeks. This is all covered on the basis of what happens in the case of the individual, but when you come down to this particular section, what do you find&mdash;absence from work by reason of strike or absence in the case of injury to a person concerned with his employment.</P>
      <P>This particular case departs completely from an individual on strike, perhaps on a strike on a decision of all the workers in the particular employment.  It may arise as a result of a section of the workers who are members of a trade union having a dispute with their particular employer and placing pickets on their employment, and other workers in the employment observing the normal trade union practice of not passing trade union pickets.  Therefore, you have people who are affected because of this by reason of a strike, not even a strike they are engaged in, a strike from which they gain nothing but one which has affected some other grades of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> As has already been said, if you have progressive legislation going through this House, and with all its faults this Bill represents progressive legislation, it does not do very much good and it does not create any kind of good atmosphere to include a section like this in the Bill.  There have been many cases in which employers in some circumstances have had perturbed feelings.  Yet, they have recognised service for employment purposes, for seniority purposes, for the purposes of payment of service pay and for payment of other things, and interruption of work due to strike would not affect the claim of the worker.  It has been accepted and agreed to very widely by large employer organisations and, in fact, accepted by the trade unions, that if a strike takes place, its having taken place should not deprive the worker of the rights he enjoyed previous to the strike.</P>
    <P>This section will, in the eyes of the average worker, be a section which will interfere with the rights he had and which will affect him in relation to his compensation.  Aside from these matters of a policy approach, let us say, I would put it to the Minister that if he looks at the record of the average period of people on strike, it is so short that to put such a paragraph in this Bill is only creating a situation where people will start looking back on records.  Take five years from now.  This is 1967 and it comes in in 1968.  In 1970, the employer will start compensatory redundancy payments, start looking back over the records and will find &ldquo;we had a strike of a week's duration in 1969; all right; that is when we got somebody else,&rdquo; and make all these calculations for the purpose of interfering with and reducing the rights of the workers under this Bill.  From the practical point of view, it is not worth inclusion in the Bill and from the policy point of view, might I put it to the Minister that it is a section which does not contain the slightest bit of merit?  The Minister has been not unreasonable regarding some of the Labour Party amendments.  If he will accept this amendment, then he will be doing a good day's work in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand the full implications of this section.  If the worker has a right to strike, a break in continuity of service should not occur with the implementation of this section.  If it indicated that it applied only in the case of unofficial strikes or wildcat strikes, then there would be some sense in the section, but, in the case of official strikes, I do not see why there should be any break in continuity of service.  If an employer feels he can hold up workers as an example &mdash;that they will lose redundancy payments because they participate in a strike&mdash;that is very wrong.  I would ask the Minister to take another look at this section.  I feel it is wrong; the worker has a right to strike and the question of continuity of service should be preserved if it is an official strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to add my voice to the voices of others in an appeal to the Minister to delete this penal clause, which is directed against the trade unionists of this country. Reading through the various sections here, one is amazed to see the inconsistencies from one section to another. Paragraph 10 reads:</P>
      <P>Absence from work by reason of a strike in the business or industry in which the employee concerned is employed and which occurred before the commencement of this Act shall be allowable as reckonable service.</P>
      <P>That is all right.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 11 reads:</P>
      <P>Absence from work by reason of a strike in the business or industry in which the employee concerned is employed and which occurred after the commencement of this Act shall not be allowable as reckonable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all wrong, but paragraph 12 says that absence from work by reason of a lock-out shall be allowable as reckonable service.  This challenges the fundamental right of people to join a union and to assert their right to strike, which is enshrined in our Constitution: the right to free association and to withdrawal of labour when the necessity arises is fundamental.  It is wrong <Col N="1723" /> of the Minister and his Department to seek to intimidate, reprimand, or denigrate in any way this fundamental right by allowing this penal clause to stand &mdash;that absence from work as a result of strike action will not be allowable as reckonable service.  This is obviously an attempt to punish people for going on strike, even those who go on official strike with the sanction of their unions, and there is no punishment at all contained in this Act in respect of the employer who can continue to lock out hundreds or thousands of men indiscriminately at his own whim.  The problem of lock-outs has been serious in these times also.  It is gratifying to observe that the period of the lock-out is allowable as reckonable service, but there is obviously no way in which a Minister can get at the employer who may be completely in the wrong in respect of a lock-out.</P>
    <P>Therefore, unless this Bill is going to show a very distinct anti-working class and anti-trade union bias, this penal clause must be removed.  If it is a puny attempt by the Minister or his Department to intimidate trade unionists in the future&mdash;that because of the paltry sums which they will get under this measure, they will for one moment concede or acquiesce in this right to strike&mdash;these people are under a very mistaken notion altogether.  This will have no effect at all in respect of the principles applying in industry in respect of whether or not there shall be strikes in the future; it will not alter the situation one jot, but it does appear to us to make very bad law that one section of our people should be singled out in this Bill for special treatment if they are not good boys.</P>
    <P>It was a pity this section was allowed to stand at all, that it should come before the House, because it does indicate a certain mentality and it may well be a forecast of things in future in respect of this whole question of trade unionists, strikes and industrial relations.  If this Bill is to be a new section of a workers' charter in this country, I would ask the Minister to consider omitting this reference to setting aside the period involved in <Col N="1724" /> official strikes.  It is difficult to rationalise or understand why this should have happened at a time when the period of strike, prior to the commencement of the Bill, is being taken into account.  I feel sure the Minister, being a sensible man, will meet our wishes in this matter and will not be influenced by people in his Party or outside it who have a distinct bias against trade unionists and who would seek to shackle them in respect of the rights they enjoy in our democratic society, rights which they will never give up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>A man's right to strike is held sacred in this country and, provided it is an official strike with union sanction, I join with Deputy Dowling in asking the Minister to look at this matter again.  A man may be on strike for six months before he is affected and very few strikes last six months.  Most of them are of much shorter duration.  Deputy Treacy's suggestion that this is anti-trade union legislation is wrong.</P>

Matters of the nature now before us have been debated at long and difficult discussions and it will be difficult for me to get away from the principle that a man creates a right in his job by working in it; and that when a man is on strike he is not giving anything to that job. Therefore, it is hard to say to an employer that he owes something to a man for not being there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic principle is that employment shall be deemed to be continuous unless terminated by a dismissal or by the employee leaving the employment voluntarily.  Notwithstanding that, it says that continuity of employment will not be broken even though notice of termination has been served where the employment is interrupted for a period not exceeding six months in respect of any absence authorised by the employer.  The Deputy asked about a man who is sick <Col N="1728" /> for a period of less than six months. If a man is ill for longer than six months I think the employer could then dismiss him.</P>

Anuraidh a chuaigh Vóta na Roinne thar mhilliún punt den chéad uair agus ba mhaith liom a dheimhniú gur chaitheamar an t-airgead sin ar fad. Tá breis agus ceathrú-mhilliún eile curtha leis sin sa Mheastachán i mbliana agus is mar seo a leanas atá an soláthar do na príomhimeachtaí:&mdash;</P>
      <P>£250,000 do scéimeanna tithíochta &mdash;méadú £16,000 ar an £234,000 a caitheadh anuraidh, £387,000 do scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;méadú £187,000 ar an £200,000 a caitheadh anuraidh, £232,000 do scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha&mdash;méadú £32,000 ar an £200,000 a caitheadh anuraidh, £90,000 d'eagrais áirithe Ghaelige&mdash; méadú £20,000 ar an £70,000 a tugadh dóibh anuraidh, agus £220,000 do Ghaeltarra Éireann faoi mar a tugadh don Bhord anuraidh.</P>
      <P>Ó bhí mé ag labhairt anseo cheana ar chúrsaí na Roinne i gcoitinne d'fhoilsigh an Rialtas tuarascáil í mí na Nollag seo caite faoin bPáipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge agus bhí an méid seo a leanas le  acu mar chuspóir don tréimhse atá romhainn amach:</P>
      <P>Maidir le muintir na Gaeltachta, leanfaidh Aire na Gaeltachta de bheith ag feabhsú agus ag leathnú na scéimeanna atá ann chun a staid eacnamaíoch, shóisialach agus chultúrtha a chur chun cinn.  Rachaidh Gaeltarra Éireann ar aghaidh ag cur barr forbartha ar a ghníochtaí tionscail d'fhonn cur leis na deiseanna atá ann chun fostaíocht shochrach a sholáthar.  Leanfaidh na gníomhaireachtaí go léir a bhíonn ag plé leis an nGaeltacht de bheith ag déanamh curam speisialta de chaomhnú agus neartú na bpobal Gaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht.  Leanfaidh an Rialtas de bheith ag teannadh agus ag treisiú le hiarrachtaí áitiúla chun comhoibriú agus comharfhorbairt áitiúil a chur chun cinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoi mar a gheall an Rialtas, táimid ag feabhsú agus ag leathnú na scéimeanna atá againn agus ba mhaith liom cúpla sampla dá bhfuil déanta againn le déanaí a lua.  Tá eolas faoi na <Col N="1731" /> scéimeanna ar fáil i Leabhrán Eolais na Roinne ar cuireadh cóip de chuig gach Teachta anuraidh agus tá roinnt leasuithe i bhfillteán nua a chuireamar amach ar na mallaibh.  Beidh áthas orm cóipeanna breise den leabhrán a bhfuil an fillteán nua iontu a chur ar fáil d'aon Teachtaí a bheidh á lorg.</P>
    <P>Faoi Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht) (Leasú), 1967, a ritheadh i mí Iúil seo caite, tig linn deontais tógála agus deontais fheabhsúcháin a thabhairt i leith tithe seachas na tithe ina mbíonn gnáthchónaí ar na hiarratasóirí.  Is féidir linn freisin, faoin Acht céanna, deontas suas go £300 agus iasacht suas go £300 a thabhairt d'iarratasóir príobháideach i leith gach ceann de thrí shealla saoire&mdash;ní raibh an deontas le fáil ach do shealla amháin roimhe sin. Is chun a chur ar chumas Ghaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht tuilleadh cuairteoirí a choinneáil a rinneadh na socruithe sin. Ag an am céanna tá Scéim na Cóiríochta Saoire againn faoina dtugaimid suas le 20 faoin-gcéad breise den chostas ceadaithe do Ghaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht a thuilleann deontais ó Bhord Fáilte Éireann&mdash;deontais a méadaíodh go mór sa Cháinaisnéis i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tugadh scéim nua&mdash;Scéim na Seomraí Oibre&mdash;isteach cúpla mí ó shin chun cabhrú le ceardaithe oilte sa Ghaeltacht seomraí agus fearais oibre a sholáthar dóibh féin d'fhonn cur le tairbhe a saothair.  Faoin scéim sin, tig linn deontas suas go £250 a thabhairt do cheardaí chun seomra oibre a thógáil nó deontas suas go £100 chun seomra oibre atá ann cheana a fheabhsú agus, ina theannta sin, deontas suas go £250 eile chun fearas de chineál ceadaithe a chur ar fáil i seomra oibre.</P>
    <P>Is le scoláirí lae amháin a bhain an Deontas £10 go dtí an scoilbhliain seo. Anois, áfach, i gcás daltaí a thuill an deontas sin mar scoláirí lae agus atá ag freastal ar scoileanna cónaithe iarbhunoideachais ina múintear na hábhair trí Ghaeilge, tig linn Deontas £20 a íoc ach a bheith sásta gurb í an Ghaeilge gnáth-theanga an teaghlaigh acu agus go labhraíonn siad í go líofa nádúrtha dá réir.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil ceantair <Col N="1732" /> Ráth Cairn agus Bhaile Gib i gContae na Mí aitheanta anois mar chuid den Ghaeltacht oifigiúil.  Beidh tairbhe scéimeanna na Roinne le fáil feasta ag Gaeilgeoirí Ghaeltacht na Mí agus tá súil agam go gcabhróidh sé go mór leis an nGaeilge a chaomhnú agus a leathnú ansin agus go mbeidh tarraingt mhór Gaeilgeoirí ar Ghaeltacht atá chomh gairid sin do Bhaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>I measc na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin atá ag an Roinn, tabharfar faoi deara go bhfuil méadú mór ar an soláthar le haghaidh muiroibreacha.  Is amhlaidh atá socraithe againn tuairim £92,000 a chaitheamh ar an bpiara i gCill Rónáin, Oileáin Árainn, ar mhaithe le cúrsaí cumarsáide agus cúrsaíiascaigh. Tá conraitheoirí ceaptha chun na feabhsúcháin sin a chur i gcrích agus tá súil agam go mbeidh ar a gcumas dul ar aghaidh leis an obair gan ró-mhoill.  Chomh maith leis sin, beidh tuilleadh saoráidí calaíochta fós á bhfeabhsú chun an iascaireacht a fhorbairt.  Bunaíodh foireann suirbhéireachta tamall ó shin chun ceist na saoráidí i gContae Chiarraí a mheas agus tá an tuarascáil uathu á scrúdú faoi láthair.  Tá foirne eile i mbun an chúraim chéanna i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i gContae Mhaigh Eo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh moltaí na bhfoirne sin ar fáil go luath.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Dáil, is é Gaeltarra Éireann an príomhghléas atá ag an Rialtas chun tionscail a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní fada ó ritheadh Acht anseo chun cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Bhord agus is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil toradh le feiceáil cheana féin ar na cumhachtaí sin.  Tá Gaeltarra tar éis dul i gcomhar le tionsclaithe eile chun marmar Chonamara a phróiseáil in aice leis an Spidéal.  Tógfar monarcha ansin gan mhoill agus beidh obair do scór fear inti i dtosach báire.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas comhthionscal eile atá le bunú i gCo.  Dhún na nGall a fhógairt go luath.  Ag an am céanna tá na deontais suas do dtí £2,000 á gceadú ag Gaeltarra chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun cinn gan dul i bpáirtíocht leis na daoine ina mbun agus tá an fhostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht ag dul i méid dá réir.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> Tá faighte amach ag Gaeltarra gur mhór an chabhair dóibh dá mbeadh monarcha nua ullamh acu le tairiscint do chuid de na tionsclaithe a mbíonn siad ag plé leo.  Tá socraithe acu mar sin dul ar aghaidh agus réamh-mhonarcha amháin a thógáil i nGaoth Dobhair agus ceann eile ar an gCeathrú Rua.  Ansin nuair a bheidh tionscal fóirsteanach i ngach ceann acu sin, tiocfaidh le Gaeltarra tabhairt faoi chúpla réamh-mhonarcha eile a thógáil.  Idir an dá linn, ar ndóigh, tig leo deontais a thabhairt do thionsclaithe arbh fhearr leo monarchana dá gcuid féin a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór an chúis sásaimh dom nuair a d'fhógair Bord Ghaeltarra ar na mallaibh go bhfuil socraithe acu a gceanncheathrú a aistriú ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go Gaeltacht Chonamara. Ceann de na cúiseanna atá acu leis an mbeartas sin ná gurb é a dtuairim gur fearr a fhéadfar tionsclaithe a tharraingt chun na Gaeltachta más sa Ghaeltacht féin a bheidh suíomh ar cheanncheathrú an chomhlachta a bhfuil cúram tionsclaíochta na Gaeltachta air.  Is athrú bunúsach é sin agus is comhartha anmhaith é, dar liom, ar a dhiongbháilte atá an Bord i mbun na hoibre atá faoina gcúram.  Tá gach dóchas agam go mbeidh rian an bheartais nua sin le haithint ar eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne le himeacht aimsire.</P>
    <P>Is mór an fhorbairt atá ar siúl i dtionscal an bhréidín lámhfhite atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra.  Is i gCo.  Dhún na nGall amháin a bhí an tionscal sin go dtí tamall beag ó shin agus ní miste a lua go mbeidh monarcha eile le haghaidh na bhfíodóirí á tógáil i nGaoth Dobhair go luath.  Chomh maith leis sin, áfach, tá monarcha nua fíodóireachta ag Gaeltarra i Ros Muc anois&mdash;rud a thugann deis do mhuintir na háite sin an scil a bhí ag a sinsir rompu a fhoghlaim agus a chleachtadh athuair: níl ach glúin nó dhó imithe ó bhí fíodóirí go fairsing ag obair ar na seolta baile ar fud Conamara.  Faoi mar a dúirt mé ag an oscailt oifigiúil ar na mallaibh, féachfaidh Gaeltarra chuige go dtabharfar oiliúint d'aos óg an cheantair ar gach gné den cheardaíocht a bhaineann leis an mbréidín <Col N="1734" /> lámhfhite agus, ansin, braithfidh dul chun cinn na monarchan ar a fheabhas a éireoidh leis na hoibrithe an oiliúint sin a chur chun tairbhe.  Tig le muintir Ros Muc tionscal a chruthú a mbeidh siad féin agus pobal uile na tíre mórálach as.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, tabharfaidh an Dáil faoi deara go bhfuil méadú ar an soláthar atá againn i mbliana le haghaidh na n-eagras Gaeilge.  Tá sé sin á dhéanamh de bhrí go gcreidimid gur féidir leis na heagrais dheonacha eolas ar an nGaeilge agus grá don teanga a chothú lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ar shlí nach bhféadfadh aon Roinn Rialtais é a dhéanamh.  Táimid agus beimid ag brath go mór ar na heagrais sin.  Tá cúnamh eile á thabhairt againn lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht i mbliana freisin den chéad uair, is é sin, cúnamh do choláistí Gaeilge atá aitheanta ag an Roinn Oideachais ar feadh tréimhse cúig bliana ar a laghad; cuireadh na sonraí chuig na coláistí atá i gceist.  Is chun coláiste mar sin a dheisiú nó a fheabsú a thabharfar an t-airgead agus beidh ar ár gcumas suas go dtí dhá thrian den chostas ceadaithe a íoc ach a bheith sásta go bhfuil gá leis an deisiú nó leis an bhfeabhsú, go bhfuil an caiteachas thar acmhainn an choiste agus gur fiú, ag féachaint do shaothar an choláiste, an cúnamh a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Ní beag le rá an dul chun cinn atá déanta againn le bliain anuas.  Tá feidhm na scéimeanna atá ag an Roinn chun staid na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú ag dul i bhfairsinge; tá iarrachtaí Ghaeltarra chun tuilleadh fostaíochta a chur ar fáil i ngnóthaí tionscail ag dul i dtreise; tá spreacadh na n-eagras Gaeilge chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú ag dul i neart; agus tá suim an phobail sa teanga&mdash;faoi mar is léir ón tarraingt a bhíonn ar an nGaeltacht agus ón éileamh atá ar &ldquo;Buntús Cainte&rdquo;&mdash;ag dul i mbríomhaireacht.  Is léir, mar sin, go bhfuil toradh ag teacht ar ár n-iarrachtaí ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge. Molaim an Meastachán don Teach.</P>

      <P>Níl ach cúpla rud le rá agam ar an Meastachán seo.  Tá sé soiléir anois go dtuigeann an Roinn gur ceist eacnamaíochta í ceist na <Col N="1735" /> Gaeltachta.  Is é an rud céanna a bhí i gceist ag Fine Gael sa leabhar úd: &ldquo;Beartas Gaeilge&rdquo;.  Seo sliocht as:</P>
      <P>Bhí faillí á thabhairt sa Ghaeltacht féin fad is bhíothas ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a athbheochan lasmuigh dí ar bhealaí nach raibh glacadh leo i gcoitinne ag na daoine.  Ní dhearnadh ach mion-iarrachtaí fóirithint ar an nGaeltacht féin.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios againn gur adhb dheacair nach furasta a réiteach í seo.  Dá ndéantaí forbairt eacnamúil sa bhealach mícheart ar na háiteanna sin is lagú in ionad neartú a dhéanfadh sé ar an teanga iontu. Mar sin féin measaimid gur féidir breis a dhéanamh thar mar rinneadh chun iad a chur ar bhonn ceart eacnamúil.  Tabharfaimíd tosaíocht don cheist seo seachas aon cheist eile a bhaineann leis an teanga.</P>
      <P>Ba chóir obair a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus ba cheart do mhuintir na Gaeltachta bheith i ndán airgead a thuilleamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní féidir leis an Ghaeltacht a bheith láidir ná ní féidir leis an dteanga dul ar aghaidh ina n-éamais.  Aontaíom le gach rud atá sa Mheastachán.  Is geal liom scéimeanna na seomraí oibre.</P>
      <P>Tá ceist amháin agam le cur ní ar Rúnaí Parlaiminte na Gaeltachta ach ar an Aire Oideachais ach iarraim ar an Rúnaí Parliaminte an cheist seo a chur faoi bhráid an Aire Oideachais. Ar mhiste leis a rá leis an Aire nach bhfuilim sásta le cúrsaí bunscoil sa Ghaeltacht.  Dúnadh scoil amháin im bhaile dúchais bliain ó shoin.  Ba chóir don Roinn cúpla focal a rá leis an Aire Oideachais chun an cheist seo a réiteach.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag dul ar aghaidh.  Do chaith siad go leor airgid anuraidh.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar chúrsaí.</P>
      <P>Níl mórán eile le rá agam.  Ní ábhar troda na cúrsaí seo.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag dul chun cinn. Ba chóir obair a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht mar gan í ní féidir leis an Ghaeltacht a bheith láidir agus ní féidir léi dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>Níor mhaith liom an <Col N="1736" /> deis seo a ligint tharm gan rud nó dhó a rá ar an Meastachán seo i nGaeilge. Tá tábhacht faoi leith ag baint leis an meastachán seo ó thaobh na teanga agus ó thaobh mhuintir na Gaeltachta dhe.  Ba chóir dúinn ár ndícheall a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus níl slí is fearr chun sin a dhéanamh ná gach cabhair agus cúnamh a thúirt don mhuintir úd ar leo sean-chultúr na hÉireann.</P>
      <P>Do mholfainn don Rúnaí Parliaminte féachaint chuige tionscail oiriúnacha a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht agus ar an gcaoi sin stop a chur leis an imirce agus ní imirce go dtí tíortha iasachta atá i gceist agam ach an imirce úd go dtí na bailte móra agus, go h-áirithe, go hÁth Cliath.  Ba chóir aon tairbhe is féidir a bhaint as an gcuartaíocht mar níl áit is fearr in Éirinn chun saoire a chaitheamh iontu ná na Gaeltachtaí. Tá roint áirithe déanta ach d'fhéadfaí a thuilleadh a dhéanamh chun daoine, agus ár muintir féin ina measc, a mhealladh go dtí na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>Ach an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú táimid ag déanamh deimhin de go mairfidh an Ghaeilge agus má mhaireann an Ghaeilge, agus mairfidh sí ach cur chuige i gceart, ní baol don náisiún.</P>
      <P>I suppose it will be regarded as slightly dishonourable of me to address myself for the rest of the time to this subject in the tongue of the foreigner, But, nonetheless, it would not be realistic for us to deal with this very important Estimate only in the native tongue.  As we know, not everybody has reached that happy condition where they readily understand Irish.  It is not sufficient that the Parliamentary Secretary should simply read his introductory statement and that there should be no discussion in the House on this important matter except, as we say, &ldquo;through the medium&rdquo;.  If we are to bring home the importance of the Gaeltacht to the maximum number of our people, we will have to speak to them in Dáil Éireann, through the press, in the language which most of them understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tremendous fund of goodwill throughout the length and breadth <Col N="1737" /> of this country for the Gaeltacht areas. It is something more than a sentiment. Everybody accepts there still exist in these areas the remnants of what was once a nation-wide Celtic culture and civilisation.  We all accept the obligation placed upon us to try to preserve what is there, to try to foster regard for such of it as has survived, and particularly regard for the language and the practice of the language.  I have often seen ill-informed comment outside this House on the amount of Irish used within the precincts of Dáil Éireann.  It has been my experience that, taking one thing with another, there is greater use of Irish among Deputies in the ordinary course of their daily business and social intercourse in Dáil Éireann than there is among any body of people of a like number in any outside employment, except perhaps in the more elevated areas of the Civil Service where we know the use of Irish is something more than a badge of nationality&mdash;it is a social and occupational <i>cachet.</i> All Deputies are anxious to do what they can to see that this Department should do well in the promotion of the practice of the Irish language and in the creation in the Gaeltacht areas&mdash; this is the fundamental thing&mdash;of a viable economic way of life.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that emigration has been the stamp of the population of the Gaeltacht for well over a century. It began with the hardships of Black 47 and all that happened since and the apparent inability of the region to exist agriculturally as a unit.  There is an acceptance of the fact that we have to promote some form of suitable industry there which will induce our young people to remain.  On this front, we are not just fighting a battle purely of economics.  It is the common experience of those of us who have gone through these areas to meet young people who have travelled far more extensively than most of us have, particularly in Britain, and to whom Camden Town, Birmingham and Coventry are far better known than O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>This is a feature peculiar in its universality in these regions.  When we talk about keeping these young people <Col N="1738" /> in the Gaeltacht areas, keeping them speaking Irish, trying to preserve what it is possible to preserve of what is left there, in competition with the pressure of modern conditions, we must always be reminded that we have to combat the unquestionable attractions held out to them by life across the water, which can provide much higher wages than they can earn here&mdash;for much lighter work, be it said&mdash;which can provide recreational facilities and perhaps, too, a freedom in the enjoyment of such recreations they will not find at home.  This is all part of the problem.  It is not an easy one.  At election times the Gaeltacht becomes very much a football between different political teams.  But to those who think about it at all, it is perfectly obvious that unless there is an united all-Party effort to save what is left, then we may very well see the end of this historic heritage as we know it in our time.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that everything in the Gaeltacht is worth preserving, nor is it indeed to say that the entire population of the Gaeltacht have not had their share of the heritage of original sin like the rest of us.  In fact I should just like to draw this to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I was talking to a child of 9 or 10 years of age some two or three months ago who had been on one of these holidays in a certain Gaeltacht area.  I do not want to identify the area; I can if it is necessary, but I do not think any useful purpose would be served by doing so.  Nor do I want it to be thought that what I have to say applies in any general way.</P>
    <P>This child told me the manner in which he and those who were with him from the city were treated in the guesthouse, as it was euphemistically described, to which they were sent, left a great deal to be desired and that he had not known what hunger was until he went west, not directly west, slightly north of west.  What I have to say is this, that there will be people in the Gaeltacht areas, as there are everywhere else in Ireland, as there are everywhere else in the world, who will take advantage of schemes and of subsidies and bounties to make the maximum amount of money for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> This, I suppose, is part of the frailty of human nature, but great care should be taken to see that, in our administration of these holiday schemes which involve the payment of monies, the subsidisation of any hotel or guesthouse, the first principle, which is the care of the guests, particularly when they are children, is ensured.</P>
    <P>In saying that, let me add that this may be the only case in all the Gaeltachts that are in existence, but it was brought to my notice.  It is by no means a condemnation of the many thousands of decent people who do their best to show the traditional hospitality with which we are all familiar, that is, those of us who have had the pleasure and privilege of spending any time there.  There is the odd one.  This is an odd one.  I shall tell the Parliamentary Secretary about it privately when I get the opportunity.  It is only right that it should be mentioned for the discouragement of others.</P>
    <P>I saw today in the paper a letter from somebody who apparently is very much concerned about the proposal to transfer the headquarters of Gaeltarra Éireann to the West.  It is somebody living in Dublin who puts a point of view which perhaps is worthy of some consideration.  I do not know who the person is.  All of us welcome in a very general way the idea that Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash;indeed some of us think the Department of the Gaeltacht, the whole apparatus of the State which deals with matters of this kind&mdash; should be moved from Dublin to a rural centre with the idea of revitalising that place, in so far as the shift of civil servants can be said to revitalise any place, with the idea of bringing greater trade, and may I use the word &ldquo;industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Congeniality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, trade and congeniality to these districts.  It is a very laudable idea and I hope it will be at least tried, and we shall see how it works.  However, I want to make a plan in respect of this person of whom I know nothing, because there may be many like him.  When one comes to think about it, there must be many <Col N="1740" /> people working in such organisations as Gaeltarra Éireann who have their whole being in this city, who have built up family life, who have houses here, perhaps whose children are being educated here, perhaps whose children are working here and to whom a shift holus bolus to a country town would represent a bit too much for them at a certain stage of their lives.  Every argument can be made where young people are concerned, particularly single people.  There should be no argument against discommoding them, young, single people who are living in Dublin, many of whom are country people themselves who should welcome, and I am sure would welcome, the more relaxed tempo of a small town and the generally less hectic atmosphere of such a place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I hope the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will take care to see that in any such change workers who, as I say, are inextricably bound to the city of Dublin and for whom such a shift would mean economic disaster or at least domestic upset not to be contemplated at middle age or little more than middle age, will not be required to have their lives disrupted in that fashion.  While I say that, I applaud most sincerely the whole idea of decentralisation of which this is, I hope, the beginning.  The decentralisation of many of our arms of administration is a very necessary thing.  We must by some means or other, by whatever means lie within our reach, halt this frantic rush to Dublin city, this swelling of the conurbation, this desertion of the rural areas which is going on.  If we do not do that, we shall become so lopsided as to make talk about rural Ireland something of the past with little relevance to fact. All of us are aware of this matter of depopulation.  It has been talked about <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House.  In my journeys into the hinterland and quite recently when I had the opportunity of going West and South during the course of a few days' holiday in the Recess, I was struck by the fact that early in the morning you could travel 100 miles and would not see a living soul.  You would not see the slightest <Col N="1741" /> spiral of smoke even in some of the towns.  As the day wore on, you might see some life in the towns; and the odd thing, even some of the smallest towns had parking signs.  Possibly this has little to do with the Gaeltacht except that it is related to it so far as the people are fleeing there also and to an extent that is frightening for anybody who has the concern of the country at heart.</P>
    <P>Political Parties, particularly those with representation in the Gaeltacht areas, bear a heavy responsibility in this matter which they cannot shuffle off easily by saying: &ldquo;It is an inevitable development,&rdquo; because, at every election I can remember, political Parties have come forward with programmes promising the solution of all the evils to which the flesh is heir, including those of the Gaeltacht.  There has been a great deal of deceptive discussion of the matter and an avoidance of facts.  Perhaps it is true that these areas of which we now speak, the Gaeltacht areas, never could have supported their populations.  Perhaps we can now admit in a mature way that these areas if they had remained purely agricultural, never could have given a decent standard of living to the large numbers who once were there.  I think that is evident.  The population is now attenuated and there is still inability to provide for them on the part of the central Government, not just this Government. This has applied since the State was founded.  It may be that what was blamed on foreign occupation 50 or even 100 years ago, while it was due in large measure to the maladministration of the hated Saxon, had a sort of inevitability about it and that the large population in the west and south of Ireland by their very existence in too small a space could never have achieved a decent standard of life.</P>
    <P>I mention this because I feel, and have always felt, as many others feel, that a lot of bunk is talked about the Gaeltacht and the areas on the western seaboard and their preservation.  I hate to use these cliches but in ransacking my mind.  I cannot find any others.  We have much lip service brought into the matter of the Gaeltacht.  What is the answer?  How can we keep these <Col N="1742" /> areas, what I would regard as a precious heritage, a uniqueness without which we are no different from the rest of the world, this thing which makes us the Irish people?  It does not make us any better than the rest of the world.  I do not claim that because I am not a racialist.  It does not give us any superiority over any other nationality; it might even make us worse.  It may be a small thing but it is our own and it is for this reason that we should preserve it.  How can we do it?  One thing is certain: we shall not do it by tearing it apart in this House, by saying: &ldquo;You did this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Somebody else did that or said that.&rdquo;  We cannot do it by bowing before fanaticism of any kind, and we get plenty of it from both sides, either the antis of the pros.  It needs the cooperation of everybody, a pooling of the thought of everybody interested in the problem.  Up to now, so far as I can see, the Gaeltacht has been made the plaything of the Parties and of interests outside the House which, perhaps, are not very obviously connected with Parties, various vested interests of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The idea which has been operated in Glencolumbkille is one of which I cannot speak with any authority, except what I have read about the efforts of the priest there.  The idea of the co-operative use of land by neighbours, the co-operative use of the tools with which to work land by neighbours, the pooling of resources, helping one another and sharing the results&mdash;all this was first adumbrated in any political sense by James Connolly, the socialist, long before 1916.  Let me say that the dogs would not lap his blood for saying such things.  It was atheistic; it was red, roaring communism; it was all that was bad.  But it is respectable now.  It is even more than respectable but I shall not go further, as I am tempted to do, along that road in describing what use is being made of it today.</P>
    <P>I rise merely to offer these comments on this very important Estimate and to say that as far as the Labour Party are concerned, we feel that unless there is a concerted national effort by all elements in the community, including <Col N="1743" /> political Parties, and unless the political Parties cease to make a plaything of the Gaeltacht in order to win a few Dáil seats and unless the true interests of the people of the Gaeltacht are taken into account in a determined approach in this way, the grave danger is that the Gaeltacht will disappear completely and that children now coming into the world will live to boast that they knew people whose fathers and grandfathers were there when there was a Gaeltacht, which will not be there then.</P>

      <P>Do scríobh mé le goirid chuig an Rúnaí Parlaiminte faoi shoillsí a shólathar in Árainn chun eolas na slí a theasbáint do na h-iascairí amuigh san oíche.  Mhol mé ceann in Inis Meán agus ceann eile in Inis Thiar.  Tá scrúdú ar bun faoi láthair idir é agus Irish Lights agus tá súil agam nach mbeidh sí i bhfad to gcuirfear na soillsí seo ar fáil.</P>

    <P>Tá rud amháin á chur isteach ormsa le cuig nó sé bliana siar agus tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil an rud céanna ag cur isteach ar gach uile Theachta a chuireann suim sa Ghaeltacht, is é sin ceist chaighdeán maidir leis an deontas £10 a fháil.  Tá clainn i gConamara agus gheibheann páiste amháin nó b'fhéidir beirt acu an deontas agus ní fhaigheann na páistí eile é.  Is aisteach an rud é sin.  Chuir mé litir faoin rud sin chuig an Roinn agus dob é freagra a fuair mé nárbh í an Ghaeilge teanga an teaghlaigh.  Ní maith liom freagra a fáil ag iarraidh orm dul go dtí an dream seo agus a rá leo feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  B'fhearr liom gan freagra ar bith a fháil seachas, <Col N="1745" /> freagra den sórt sin.  Is mór an náire é rud mar sin a dhéanamh i gcás clainne ar bith sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil dreamanna ann agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil seachtar nó ochtar sa chlann amháin ag freastal ar an scoil chéanna agus b'fhéidir go bhfaigheadh duine nó beirt acu an deontas £10 agus gearrtar amach na daoine eile sa chlann chéanna.  Níl ciall ná réasún leis sin.  Tá súil agam go ngearrfaidh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte an rud sin amach.</P>
    <P>Tá mé sásta go bhfuil an Rúnaí Parlaiminte ag iarraidh a dhícheall a dhéanamh agus chomh fada is atá monarchain, idir bheag agus mór á gcur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht, tá sé ar an mbóthar ceart.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtús ama buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a labhair ar an Meastachán.  Taispeánann sé go bhfuilimid uilig i bhfách le caomhnú na Gaeltachta.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuilimid ar fad ar aon aigne faoin mbealach is fearr leis sin a dhéanamh ach fad a labhraíonn Teachtaí as gach páirtí sa Teach ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht, tá a fhios ag muintir na hÉireann go bhfuilimid uilig báúil leis an nGaeltacht agus go mba cheart í a chaomhnú agus, bíodh nach n-aontaímid faoin dóigh is fearr chun é sin a dhéanamh, is maith an rud é.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Teachta Lindsay gur ceist eacnamaíochta a bhí sa cheist seo agus an ceart aige.  Ní inniu ná inné a dúirt mé féin an rud céanna.  Dúirt mé é sarar tháinig mé isteach sa phost seo. Dúirt mé go minic go mba cheart aire chóir a thabhairt do chúrsaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta agus gurb é sin an dóigh a b'fhearr chun an Ghaeltacht a choimeád beo.</P>
      <P>Labhair an Teachta Dunne faoin rud céanna agus dúirt sé go mba cheart tionscail a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.  Is dócha nach fearr rud a dhéanfainn ná achoimre a dhéanamh ar an méid a dúirt mé i mo ráiteas faoi chúrsaí monarchan sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tamall gairid ó shin d'oscail mé monarcha fíodóireachta i Ros Muc; tá monarcha phróiseála marmair Chonamara <Col N="1746" /> le togáil agus tuigim go dtosófar é an tseachtain seo; dúirt mé sa dréacht a léigh mé ó chianaibh go raibh súil agam monarcha nua a fhógairt do Thír Chonaill faoi cheann achair bhig; agus tá socraithe againn réamh-mhonarcha a bhunú i nGaoth Dobhair agus ceann eile a chur ar fáil sa Cheathrú Rua. Sílim gur tús anmhaith é sin.  Tá súil agam nuair a bheidh na monarchana sin ag obair go gcoinneoidh siad na daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Sin í an aidhm atá againn uilig.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Lindsay gur chaill Gaeltarra Éireann cuid mhaith airgid anuraidh agus le blianta anuas.  Tuigeann sé an chúis.  Is é an dearcadh atá agam faoi láthair go mba cheart dúinn iarracht a dhéanamh leis an gcaillteanas a laghdú agus le brabach gnó a bheith againn.  Bíodh is nach ndéanfaidh Gaeltarra Éireann brabach go fóill, má tá an dearcadh sin acu beidh an eagraíocht níos foirfe.  Tá a fhios agam go n-aontaíonn Bord nua Ghaeltarra Éireann liom sa dearcadh sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na mbunscoileanna labhróidh mé leis an Aire Oideachais fá dtaobh de.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Dunne fá dtaobh de pháiste sa Ghaeltacht a tháinig ó Bhaile Atha Cliath agus nár cuireadh cóir cheart air.  D'fhéadfadh sé sin a bheith amhlaidh.  Tá corr-dhuine ann nach ndéanann an rud ceart.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh sé an t-eolas dom agus féacfaidh mé isteach sa scéal.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Dunne fosta faoi aistriú ardoifig Ghaeltarra Éireann go dtí an t-iarthar.  Sílim go bhfuilimid go léir i bhfábhar é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá a fhios agam go mbeidh corr-chás achrannach ann.  Ach beidh Gaeltarra Éireann cóngarach do chathair na Gaillimhe mar a bhfuil ollscoil, íocfar costais aistrithe leis na daoine a bheidh i gceist agus ní shílim go gcuirfidh an t-aistriú isteach orthu mórán.  Ní bheidh sé deacair ar dhuine a bhfuil cónaí air i mBaile Átha Cliath aistriú, go háirithe ó thaobh scoileanna agus ollscoile de. Go deimhin, ní bheidh aon chúis gearáin aige ón taobh sin.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Geoghegan fá dtaobh de na céanna beaga.  Faoi mar a dúirt mé sa dréacht a léigh mé, <Col N="1747" /> táimid ag féachaint isteach sna ceisteanna sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Deontas £10, níl sé chomh simplí agus a dúirt an Teachta. Dúirt sé go dtarlaíonn sé go bhfaigheann duine nó beirt as clann an deontas £10 ach nach bhfaigheann triúr nó ceathar eile as an gclann chéanna é. Seans maith nach ceart an deontas a thabhairt d'aon duine díobh ach socraíonn an Roinn an deontas a thabhairt do pháistí áirithe chun misneach a thabhairt don chlann i dtreo gur féidir leo go léir an deontas a fháil an bhliain atá chugainn.  Faoi mar a dúirt mé go minic tá sé an-deacair ceist an deontais a réiteach i gcásanna den saghas sin&mdash;bíonn siad &ldquo;an-chóngarach don líne&rdquo; mar a déarfá.  Tugaimid an deontas chun an chlann a mhisniú agus chun go ndéanfaidh siad iarracht leis an nGaeilge a thabhairt ar ais sa teaghlach.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta fosta go dtarlaíonn sé anois agus arís nach bhfaigheann corr-dhuine an deontas i gceantar áirithe nuair a fhaigheann na daoine eile é.  Séard a tharlaíonn, sílim, nuair a théann an cigire go dtí an scoil go mbíonn an páiste as láthair.  Sa chás sin bíonn ar an gcigire dul ar ais go dtí an scoil tar éis míosa chun an páiste a fheiceáil agus scrúdú a chur air.  Thiocfadh a fhoirm isteach níos déanaí.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé ceart don Roinn na díolacháin a chur siar toisc go raibh páiste amháin as láthair.  Ach faigheann an chlann an deontas ar deireadh thiar nuair a fhaightear na foirmeacha.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil sé le feiceáil.  Aithníonn muintir na Gaeltachta féin é sin.  Sna cuairteanna a thug mé ar an nGaeltacht i mbliana mhothaigh mé go raibh níos mó misnigh agus dóchais ag na daoine ná mar a bhí acu le tamall toisc go bhfeiceann siad na monarchana agus go dtuigeann siad go bhfuilimid dáiríre ag iarraidh obair a chur ar fáil dóibh chun iad a choimeád sa bhaile.  Caithfimid ár ndícheall a dhéanamh le saibhreas aiceanta na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú ach, mar a dúirt duine de na Teachtaí, ní leor é sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Sin ceann de na fáthanna ar chinn mé ar <Col N="1748" /> thionscal a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht mar go bhfacthas dom nach bhféadfaí dóthain oibre a chur ar fáil gan é sin a dhéanamh.  Sin é an fáth a bhfuil an Roinn agus Gaeltarra Éireann ag brú ar aghaidh go gasta leis an bhforbairt sin sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá ag éirí linn.</P>
    <P>Tá contúirt áirithe ann.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine ann a deir go dtiocfaidh teicneoirí le Béarla isteach sa Ghaeltacht ag obair sna monarchana seo agus go dtabharfaidh siad an Béarla isteach leo.  Nuair a d'fhéach mé ar an sort rogha a bhí againn&mdash;na monarchana a thógáil nó ligean do na daoine imeacht&mdash;ní thiocfadh leat a rá gur rogha é sin ar chor ar bith.  Cionn is go dtuigim go bhfuil baol seo an Bhéarla ann, tá scéimeanna ar siúl ag an Roinn, ag Gaeltarra Éireann agus ag na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais do dhaoine óga as an Ghaeltacht.  Tá súil againn, nuair a bheidh na monarchana seo faoi lán-tseol, go mbeidh daoine óga againn a bheidh oilte sa cheardaíocht agus a mbeidh postanna acu mar theicneoirí sna monarchana sin. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an lá sin.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag brú ar aghaidh fosta le forbairt na cuartaíochta.  Faoi mar a luaigh mé i mo ráiteas, tá an-chuid deontas curtha ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta chun a gcuid tithe a fheabhsú, chun tithe nua a thógáil agus seallaí saoire a thógáil do na cuairteoirí.  Níl áit ar bith sa tír seo nó ar fud an domhain is áille ná na ceantair Ghaeltachta agus níl daoine níos cineálta le fáil áit ar bith.  Ba mhaith liom féin dá gcuireadh lucht na Gaeilge eagar orthu féin agus tithe sa Ghaeltacht a chur in áirithe dóibh féin don bhliain seo chugainn.  B'fhearr liomsa dá rachadh na Gaeilgeoirí go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Dá ndéanfaidís amhlaidh ní dhéanfadh sé dochar ar bith don teanga agus bheadh cabhair acu ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Muna dtéann lucht labhartha na Gaeilge go dtí an Ghaeltacht, rachaidh na Béarlóirí ann. Siúd is go gcaithfidh muintir na Gaeltachta teacht i dtír ar an gcuartaíocht, tá sé so-fheicthe, faoi mar a dúirt mé, nach Gaeilgeoirí ar fad a rachaidh go dtí an Ghaeltacht mura gcuirfidh lucht na Gaeilge eagar orthu féin.</P>
    <P>Tá cur síos ar na deontais atá ar <Col N="1749" /> fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i Leabhrán Eolais na Roinne.  Tá na deontais nua agus na deontais fheabhsaithe sa bhfillteán a chuireamar leis an leabhrán le déanaí.  Teachta ar bith a bhfuil cóip den leabhrán agus den fhillteán ag teastáil uaidh beidh sé le fáil aige agus fáilte.  Ba mhaith liom dá mbainfeadh muintir na Gaeltachta an tairbhe is mó is féidir as na deontais agus tá mé sásta go leor leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta sna cúrsaí seo.  Ó thárla gur caitheadh an t-airgead a cuireadh ar fáil dúinn anuraidh, is léir go bhfuil na <Col N="1750" /> daoine ag baint úsáide as na scéimeanna.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a labhair agus tá súil agus dúil agam go n-éireoidh linn ní amháin an Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú ach í a leathnú chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26th October, 1967.</P>
