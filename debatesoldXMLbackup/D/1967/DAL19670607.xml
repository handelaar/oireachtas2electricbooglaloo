    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received any communication or indication from the EEC Commission suggesting some form of transitional arrangements between this country and the EEC other than actual membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say yet when formal negotiations are expected to start?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach himself taken the initiative in finding out whether or not what has been suggested by Deputy Cosgrave, namely, a form of association, could be applied to Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not because this is only a suggestion which has been made; it is supposed to have emanated in France and apparently it <Col N="2" /> has not found approval in the minds of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If Ireland's application is rejected, do the Government accept that rejection as such or are they prepared then to negotiate for association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should prefer not to answer that question until such time as we know where our application stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not make up his mind to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; on the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it will depend on the manner in which the British application is treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion is one that should be considered and does he not, therefore, agree that the subject matter of Deputy Cosgrave's question is particularly apposite at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked whether we had had an approach from the Commission of this nature and I replied &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that.  We have not, and I do not think it is likely to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it that association is not ruled out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not contemplated association.  We are seeking for membership because that is the most desirable form to have in the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I ask is that the former Taoiseach said, when asked, that he would not consider association at all.  Is that still the view of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as association because any association is temporary leading to full membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is suggested by Deputy Cosgrave's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is suggested, but the simple answer is that we have not been approached about this and I have not contemplated it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government make an approach if they are rejected for full membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If and when that situation arises, we will make up our minds as to what we should do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether a decision has been taken as to who will conduct the negotiations on behalf of this country?  Will it be at official ambassadorial level or ministerial level?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps next week. I am not sure yet.  These matters are being canvassed all the time but, now that the situation in the Middle East has reached a crisis, it is not easy to have arrangements made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is in a position to indicate in general what constitutional or other legislative changes will be necessary should Ireland become a member of the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An Inter-Departmental Committee under the Chairmanship of the Attorney General is currently examining the constitutional and legal implications of Ireland's membership of the European Economic Community.  It is expected that the Committee's report on the constitutional aspect will be submitted to the Government in the near future.  The Committee is continuing its work on the other legal aspects but Deputies will appreciate that the full scope of legal implications will be dependent on the state of development reached by the Community at the date of our entry and on the conditions of our accession.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that the treaties establishing the Communities are mainly concerned with economic and commercial activities and related social matters, and therefore other aspects of domestic law need not be affected by membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The British authorities have been asked to undertake the consular protection of Irish citizens in Israel and Jordan and, in conjunction with our consulate there, in Lebanon and Syria.  Irish citizens will be included in their evacuation plans for their own citizens.  Similar arrangements have been made with the Italian authorities in respect of Irish citizens in the United Arab Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that Irish citizens may be placed in any jeopardy in view of the rather unpopular nature of the British Government's attitude to the Middle East crisis?  Does he think that because of the belief of the Arab States that the British are not acting in a neutral manner, Irish citizens may be affected? Does he think he could have got a more acceptable nation from the point of view of neutrality?</P>

Under the planned post-development programme the Board expect to undertake a re-canvass of the Dungloe area in about two years.

      <P>There are ten kiosks in Drogheda which together with three public telephones in the post office adequately serve the areas mentioned in the questions. Three of the kiosks were erected only last year.  The position in all areas is reviewed regularly and new installations are provided as necessary. The need for additional public telephones in Drogheda will be examined again later this year when the 1968 kiosk programme is being prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one subscriber has complained about the service since the beginning of this year.  The difficulty mentioned was due to some congestion on trunk dialling equipment.  This matter is receiving special attention. Additional equipment, including extra outlets to Dublin, is in course of installation and will be ready for service in a few months' time.</P>
      <P>There has been no complaint of difficulty on the local service or of crossed lines.  If the Deputy knows of any subscriber who may have had trouble with crossed lines I will have the matter investigated on receipt of details.</P>

The meter advances by one unit for each local call.  For dialled trunk calls it advances by one unit at regular intervals while the call lasts.  The length of the interval varies with the distance of the call and the time at which it is made.</P>
      <P>The quarterly charges for dialled calls are made up from the meter readings and those for trunk calls obtained through operators are made up from tickets and summarised on a statement issued with the account.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that there are instances in which fantastic accounts have been sent out and that, on occasion, it has been found that where one call has been made, it has been registered in units of ten and one call could mean that ten, or 60 and in some cases 100 have been recorded?

      <P>I agree that there are rare occasions when this happens but I would not like it to be taken that it happens frequently.  This is a recording mechanism and it is possible, as with all mechanisms, that it can go wrong, but it is seldom that it does happen. The mechanism is somewhat similar to the ESB meter which records current consumption.  There may be slight inaccuracies from time to time but the Department makes every effort to control these.</P>

      <P>Because of distance from their local office, the majority of smallholder recipients of unemployment assistance attend once weekly to declare unemployment at a Garda station or at a special signing-centre and subsequently are paid through the post.  There are no generally-applicable hours of attendance in these postal cases and it will be appreciated that it would not be practicable to have uniform hours of attendance for every Garda station and special signing-centre because account must be taken of local conditions and the feasibility of the arrangements from the point of view of the Garda.  Recipients living within six miles of their local office attend there both for signing and payment <Col N="26" /> purposes.  If the Deputy can furnish me with evidence of undue hardship or inconvenience resulting from the timing of attendances at any particular place, I will see, in consultation with the Garda authorities, what can be done to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>Grants amounting to £50,000 were approved by An Foras Tionscal for the firm named by the Deputy towards the provision of new machinery for the production of PVC floor-coverings and tufted carpets. Having regard to the home market interests of existing Irish manufacturers, it was made a condition of the grants that the company's entire output of PVC floor-coverings of a value below 9/- per square yard should be exported and that the company's entire output of tufted carpets made from wool or wool/synthetic fibre mixture should be exported.

The only thing remotely resembling the matter raised by the Deputy and of which I am aware is that this firm makes tufted carpeting suitable for floor covering for motor cars and some firms who recently wanted this material were referred to this firm before they were allowed to import it.  The firm, in fact, could not supply it.  This is the only thing I am aware of.  If what the Deputy says is true, there is no basis for it as far as that firm is concerned.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of correspondence between my Department and the Federation in relation to suggestions made by them for a reduction in the number of licensed premises in the country.</P>
      <P>The suggestions include the establishment of a fund to be financed by levies on licensees, for purchasing and extinguishing licences in excess of the public needs and various amendments of the law to intensify the existing requirement that the grant of a new licence would be conditional on the extinguishing of one or more licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> I have repeatedly pointed out to the Federation that I am satisfied that any proposals put forward by them so far do not form the basis of a workable scheme.  Having regard to the fact that there are about 12,000 licensed premises in the country a great many of which are sited in close proximity to one another in towns and villages with a limited licensed trade I can see, what I might describe as, insuperable difficulties in bringing about, within measurable time, such a reduction in the number of licensed premises as would guarantee substantial business for all&mdash;which is what the Federation wants.</P>

Might I suggest that when as a result of untoward circumstances, a Minister is not present and has not appointed a delegate to answer his questions, it would be appropriate if some public expression of regret were made to you, Sir, for the Minister's failure to be present when you called upon him to answer his questions at the appropriate time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  to redeem borrowings, and interest thereon, in respect of capital <Col N="34" /> services, there shall be charged annually on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof a sum of £1,788,105 in the twentynine successive financial years and a sum of £1,880,083 in the thirty successive financial years commencing in each case with the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Resolution itself, I must say I am disappointed that the Minister in the framework of this Finance Bill has not done more to accord with European taxation, and particularly taxation in the EEC.  It is a pity that he did not take advantage of the reasonably short Finance Bill to make some move to iron out some of the points that could be made clear here.  Perhaps the Minister intends to deal with this in the Finance Bill which he gave notice he would introduce this session for consideration in the autumn.  It may well be that he intends to deal with more than the mere repeal of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, and the substitution of the appropriate new legislation for it.  I will not say any more until the Minister has had an opportunity to make the case, if he <Col N="35" /> wishes, that he will deal with it then.</P>
      <P>I had hoped, too, that on the Money Resolution, or at some stage of this Finance Bill&mdash;and I would have thought that the Money Resolution would be more appropriate&mdash;he would have given us some indication of when we can expect the text of the new Bill and what it will contain other than the broad general principle that has already been announced about the repeal or variation of Part VII of the 1965 Act.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some outline at this stage because at present there is great uncertainty among the business community at large, and until that uncertainty is dispelled by a firm announcement, it is not going to be too easy for business people to plan their affairs properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot do any more at this stage than repeat what I have already said, that the provisions of the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which will be introduced in the autumn will be in the main relieving provisions.  In so far as they are reliefs they will be retrospective, as already indicated.  The purpose will be to remove from the scope of the existing section a number of items which might be regarded as not having been intended to be caught by it in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Money Resolution is also the Resolution that deals with the general collection of taxes. It seems to me, therefore, it would be appropriate to raise on it a matter affecting one aspect of our tax structure very vitally, because there is no section in Part II of the Bill dealing with taxation on hydrocarbon oils. Therefore, the Minister should on this Money Resolution give some indication to the House of the position in relation to the supply of oil in the present deplorable circumstances in the Middle East.  Any interruption in the flow of oil, petrol or heavy oil would have a very serious effect on revenue. Therefore, this Money Resolution is the appropriate occasion to deal with our needs.  The effect on industry generally is something of which people <Col N="36" /> must be apprehensive.  I trust that the Government have taken appropriate steps to ensure that the supply will be assured; that, in addition to the supply for the Whitegate Refinery and so for industry generally being assured, the Government have taken appropriate steps to make certain that industry will get the supplies so very vital for the employment and livelihood of so many of our people.  I think the Minister might indicate what those steps are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in the interval I might explain what my view of the section is?  As most Deputies know, the housekeeper allowance is at present granted to a widower or a widow or a husband whose wife has deserted him.  The purpose of the section is to extend that housekeeper allowance to a married woman not living with her husband who has presumably, deserted her.  We want to put the deserted wife in the same position as the deserted husband at the moment.</P>
      <P>The reason we specified &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; is that, if we did not, it would leave it wide open to all sorts of people to avail of this who would not really be entitled to it, strictly speaking.  Unless we use some words like &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; the most nominal type of employment would entitle a woman to secure this concession.  The idea is that it is given to a woman who, because of the full-time nature of the occupation she undertakes, has to be absent from her home and therefore has to employ somebody to look after her children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument may be all very well to avoid what I shall call the fake claim, but he must accept also that many young widows with young families cannot take a completely full-time job.  They have to give some time and attention to their families and take a job that may be a half-time job or even a three-quarter-time job.  Therefore, they have to have somebody to look after the young family while they are out.  Surely that case deserves much more consideration than is being given to it by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> I can see the Minister's point of view that a person could get around the section by working for five minutes in the day.  I am quite prepared to meet the Minister on that, but full-time employment takes the matter too far the other way.  Some phraseology to the effect that she is engaged in some trade or profession which occupies at least half working time would, I think, be a fair compromise.  I am with the Minister in so drafting the Act that there will not be the avoidance of the type he suggests.  Equally, I think the present wording of it is far too rigid and it ought to be possible to arrive at a halfway house that would be feasible and fair both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to support Deputy O'Higgins's amendment but it does appear that, perhaps, the wording is a little too loose.  The Minister must take into account a person who is working for a period and whose major income is what he gets for that period.  If the phraseology used could be related to that, it would meet the bill.  I would ask the Minister to consider dealing with this matter at a later stage or in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>There is one other thing.  The fact that there might be fraud is hardly worth considering.  The amount of money involved is very small.  There is the substitution of £135 for £120.  The amount involved would be £15 at 5/3. I do not think anybody would be inclined to bother trying to obtain that fraudulently, or even the whole £35 at 5/3.  For that reason, the Minister, if he wants to help, should phrase it in such a way that it would refer to persons who are getting their major income from this sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not necessarily apply only to persons who would be practising fraud.  Unless we put in words to that effect, everybody would be legitimately entitled to it who worked five minutes a day.  They would not necessarily have to be practising fraud.  I want to repeat this assurance to the House, that this provision will be administered in a very liberal and sensible way and I also want to say that I will interpret and the <Col N="39" /> Revenue Commissioners also will interpret &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; as covering the case of a woman who could show that she is working what might be regarded as the normal hours for the occupation in which she is engaged.  We would certainly consider her as working full-time.</P>

      <P>I cannot attempt to deal with everything here.  The sort of thing I am thinking of is this: supposing you had a receptionist whose normal work hours were three or four hours in the morning.  Provided that she is working the full amount of hours which would normally be understood to be the appropriate amount for the occupation, then we would regard her as working full-time.  I would also envisage &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; being interpreted to cover a case where the employment involved lengthy absences from home and where the earnings involved substantially represented the means of subsistence of the taxpayer and the children. In other words, if, by virtue of the employment, she were away from home for considerable periods of time and the amount she earned was reasonably equivalent to full maintenance for herself and her family, this also would qualify as full-time.</P>

      <P>The Minister's approach is extremely stingy.  The Minister may say that this will be dealt with liberally but did anyone ever see the income tax people dealing liberally with anybody?  Do we not all know they try to screw the very last penny when it comes to assessing tax and is it not true that unless it is written into the Bill and is in fact laid down so that it cannot be twisted in any way, there will be no remission at all except for those working full-time? The Minister might as well face up to it.  Either change it and include &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; or delete &ldquo;full-time&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>No, I do not.  But I do think that Deputy Tully is right, for this reason: the Revenue Commissioners have got to interpret the Act and administer the Act that is before them and the Bill that is before us does not allow of liberal interpretation. It is as specific and as restrictive as it could possibly be and there is no use in the Minister saying that it will be interpreted in a liberal way when the wording of the section which the Revenue Commissioners under their warrant of appointment have to carry out does not allow of any liberal interpretation.  It could be covered, if you like, by phraseology such as I suggested already or by such phraseology as &ldquo;throughout the year is in reasonably full-time employment&rdquo;. If it is specifically, as it is there, &ldquo;in full-time employment&rdquo;, there is no use in abusing the Revenue Commissioners and the inspectors of taxes for carrying that out.  The person to be abused is the Minister for Finance who brings in the Bill and who has so phrased the Bill that it is restrictive and cannot be interpreted in any other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in difficulty here.  The idea behind this, of course, and the idea behind the use of the phrase &ldquo;full-time&rdquo;, is that a woman's employment or business must entail a substantial absence from her home, must, <i>bona fide,</i> necessitate the employment by her of a housekeeper.  I think we are all agreed on that.  If a woman is necessarily absent from home sufficiently long to have to employ a housekeeper, then we would all like her to qualify.</P>
      <P>I want to put the opposite point of view.  I want to say that by using &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; here we are, in fact, making it flexible.  What is &ldquo;full-time&rdquo;?  For a Senator, for instance, &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; employment as a Senator does not by any means equate with full-time employment for a Deputy.  &ldquo;Full-time&rdquo; in this regard may be used flexibly as related to the type of employment a woman would take.  If the employment necessitates being absent for only half a day, that is full-time employment, whereas, if we go the other way at it and try to spell out the circumstances in which she will be entitled to this allowance, then we will probably bring unnecessary rigidity into it, which I know Deputies would be anxious to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am giving the House a solemn assurance that the term &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; will be sensibly interpreted.  I do not quite agree with Deputy Sweetman that that assurance by me in this House is of no value because, admittedly, <Col N="42" /> the revenue officers have to interpret the law and apply it without fear or favour or distinction.  But, here what we are dealing with is the actual interpretation of this phrase and this single phrase, not the section as a whole, just this phrase.  I think they will be quite within their jurisdiction in interpreting &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; in the way in which I am describing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that if the Minister checks through the various Government Departments he will find there is an interpretation of &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; which does not equate with what he has just been saying; in fact, if the person is full-time, it will be taken that he or she is employed for a set number of hours per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister checks, he will find that the interpretation, even in his own Department, of &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; cannot be taken as two or three hours.  I should like to see included in the Bill something which would protect the interest of a woman who is living in Ballyfermot&mdash;if Deputy Dunne were here, he would tell me there are no deserted wives in Ballyfermot&mdash;or in some other part of the city, and has to travel across town to a job which she may be doing for only two hours in the morning and two in the evening.  Because she has this job, she has to get somebody to look after one or two small children at home.  My reading of this provision would be that that type of woman will not qualify.  I am quite sure the Revenue Commissioners will be the very first to say that the law does not allow them to include her because she is not employed full-time.  I do not wish to delay the House by pressing this, but surely it should not be beyond the competence of the Minister, between now and the introduction of this Bill in the Seanad, to have the matter investigated and try to find out something which would meet the wishes of the House?  It is not a big matter.  Deputy Byrne says there are not many of them; I think there are too many, but the amount involved is very small and it is not going to make or <Col N="43" /> break the Minister's next Budget, if he has a next Budget.</P>

Deputies do not have to force me very hard to do things for deserted wives, and I should like to remind them that was the approach right from the Succession Act to the various other pieces of legislation which I introduced, and it is in that context I introduced this provision into the Bill.  However, I have a difficulty, and it seems to me at any rate that this is the best and most flexible way of tackling the problem.  I do not mind undertaking to look at it again.</P>

      <P>This deals with section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, into which was carried the exact wording that had been in earlier sections.  I find considerable difficulty not in dealing with this administratively but in understanding the actual wording of subsection (1) of section <Col N="47" /> 344.  I am surprised that I should find that difficulty.  The present position factually is that if a person has deposit interest which is less than £50 per annum, that deposit interest is exempt from income tax assessment.  On the other hand, if a person has £55 deposit interest, the first £50 is exempt and the assessment is made on the excess over £50.  The effect of this amendment is to change the £50 to £70.  I have no difficulty whatever in understanding the wording of section 334 in relation to a sum by way of deposit interest received by an individual up to £70 per annum but, if a person has £75 worth of deposit interest per annum, after this section is passed, I take it the intention of the Minister is that the first £70 will be clear of assessment and the remaining £5 will be assessed.

In section 344 subsection (1), it is stated &ldquo;said sums shall be disregarded for the purposes of this Act if or in so far as the said sums do not exceed £50&rdquo;.  I cannot see where in that there is authorisation that only the excess on £50&mdash;£70 now&mdash;is to be taxed.  I should have thought a more reasonable approach to the drafting of section 344, except that it had to be taken from the previous Act, would be that the basis would be that, if the interest were under £50&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 186 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the deletion of subsection (2)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that it will not be possible in future for the income tax authorities to go back <i>ad infinitum.</i> Let me say at once that we all accept that, if there is a case of fraud, then there should be no time limit on that fraud.  Everybody accepts that without question.  However, <Col N="49" /> the effect of subsection (2) of section 186 of the Income Tax Act is that the Revenue Commissioners can go back for 45 years.  I am not quite certain if they can go back even before the inception of the State.  Certainly they can go back 45 years.  Very often it is extremely difficult for a taxpayer to have the kind of records to deal with what is required and the Revenue Commissioners are in a most unfair position <i>vis-à-vis</i> that taxpayer.  This case has been made to the Minister on many occasions.  It was made very forcibly this year in a joint memorandum submitted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland and the Incorporated Law Society.  They made it clear that they thought the time had come for a review of the time limits in the making of assessments, time limits which extend back over 44 years. Incidentally, are they entitled to go back beyond 1922?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the 46th year at least is out.  To go back to 1922 seems to me to be quite absurd in present circumstances. That was not the law originally.  Up to 1936 there was a six-year time limit. The law was then changed to enable assessments to be made from 1922-1923 onwards.  That meant the Revenue Commissioners were then entitled to go back 15 years.  Now they are entitled to go back 45 years.  I urge the Minister very strongly that is unreasonably long. It is, in fact, quite indefensible.  On the other side of the water, assessments can be made only for six years, unless fraud is established.  They have found there that the power of going back for six years is quite adequate and I do not understand why, if it is adequate there, it is not adequate here.  The penalty provisions are such that if there is fraud, adequate compensation can be obtained by the State.  Where no fraud has been established, it is unreasonable to have a state of uncertainty continuing for such a long time, for 40 years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The merit of the amendment does not depend only on the submissions made by the two bodies.  It is also dealt <Col N="50" /> with in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation, pages 91 and 92, paragraphs 301 to 305.  It has been suggested that the time limit was extended to enable tax to be recovered because of delay in unearthing evasion. If there was evasion of that sort, there must have been fraud and the ministerial statement of 1936 was not a case at all for this provision.  The Seventh Report comes down flatly in paragraph 305 and recommends that claims for recovery of tax should not be made later than ten years after the year in which the tax is chargeable. That is four years longer than in Britain and four years longer than was the case here in the period from 1922 to 1936.  Bearing in mind that in most cases penalties can be raised which would greatly exceed the tax evaded, there does not seem to me to be any case in relation to the power to go back 45 years.  I would ask the Minister to accept the recommendation made in the Seventh Report of the Commission set up by a most enlightened Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to speak on this amendment.  It seems to me that here is a matter of principle which can be understood by most people.  We have often said that the income tax code, as a code of taxation, is not one that has enjoyed general popularity but I am sure that can be said in relation to any system or method of taxation.  But when one finds, as one finds in this respect, that a system of taxation has features which appear, <i>prima facie,</i> to be unfair to the taxpayer, then we should entertain a suggestion for its amendment. The ordinary taxpayer who, for one reason or another, ignorance, confusion or mistake, has been overcharged in relation to taxation and has overpaid for a number of years is restricted by our present law in making a claim for overpayment to a period of six years.  When that period of six years became part of our income tax code, the Revenue Commissioners were equally restricted on their side to a back date of six years.  When the change was made which means that the State can go back effectively almost to the beginning of time, certainly to <Col N="51" /> 1922-23, which covers the span of most people's earning life, the taxpayer was still restricted to a claim for six years. I do not think that is fair and I would be interested to hear what case can be made for providing an inequality of treatment of that kind as between the State and the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>If the individual can go back only six years, why should it be that the taxation authority should have no such restriction?  Why should it be that the individual taxpayer can never feel that he has settled his accounts with the State?  The taxpayer must always be under the fear and the danger that an assessment can be mounted against him going back into years where, effectively, the taxpayer cannot deal with the matter.  The six year limit which applies in relation to most claims for debt has been found on experience to be very fair and it is felt that if a six year is exceeded, a liability should not remain hanging over a person.</P>
      <P>That is approaching the matter from the point of view of ordinary people looking at a code which, if it is to be maintained, should be as equitable as possible.  In addition to that, there is the strong recommendation from the Commission on Income Taxation referred to by Deputy Sweetman which asks that the almost unlimited right to make a back assessment should be limited to ten years.  Why the Commission recommended that period of ten years is another matter and personally I do not see why they did so.  It seems an unduly long period and to my mind, the difference they make between the rights of the taxpayer and the rights of the Revenue Commissioners does not seem justifiable.  What is accepted as fair for the individual should be accepted as fair for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears as if the Deputy's amendment has a lot of merit.  He says that in this case the State is trying to have it both ways. If the period over which taxation can be recovered by the citizen is six years, then surely there should be a limit on <Col N="52" /> the period the State can recover tax which is considered due?  Another angle which might have a bigger effect on the matter than anything else is that, over the years, the approach by the State to the matter may have altered.  By going back 12 or 15 years, it could happen that a person would not be in a position to prove something which was easily capable of proof at the time and which justified the person in the amount of tax paid or the amount of tax he or she refused to pay.  Such evidence might not be available after a period of years and is a very strong argument in favour of Deputy O'Higgins's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in this House holds any brief for the evasion of income tax.  In so far as the continuance of the powers which we seek to repeal might be necessary in order to curb evasion, our case for repeal would be so much weaker.  In this context, however, I think it is essential to have a look at the entire picture, to look at the developments, based on the recommendations of the Commission, which have transpired in the past few years in regard to strengthening the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with income tax evasion.</P>
      <P>The part of the Seventh Report to which Deputy Sweetman referred dealt with that aspect of the matter.  Their report, advocating restriction on the right of the Revenue Commissioners to re-open cases to ten years, as urged by us, was a corollary of their major recommendation which was that the hand of the Revenue Commissioners should be strengthened.  That has been done.  The need for the continued existence of these undesirable and unjust powers is no longer there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential to have a look at the position in 1936 when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, repealed the six-year limit of British law.  He was concerned about unearthing evasion in the troublesome 15 or 16 years prior to 1936 in this country. I do not think it was in the mind of the Minister for Finance or of the Revenue Commissioners in 1936 that this power should continue indefinitely. I am convinced it was not&mdash;and I read <Col N="53" /> Deputy MacEntee's speech pretty carefully.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is based on the report of the Commission on Income Taxation and is backed by the submission referred to by Deputy Sweetman, the submission made to the Minister by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Incorporated Law Society.  I referred to this matter here a fortnight ago on Second Stage.  I gave the Minister advance word of these amendments.  The Minister then said it had been indicated to the Institute of Chartered Accountants that the practice was, except in cases of fraud, not to go back beyond the six-year period and that this practice has the formal sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, there is no part of the income tax law which provides machinery for the Minister for Finance to indicate formal sanction of what is or is not good and practice, no matter how good, is not legislation. This House must look to its rights.  This is a House of Parliament.  It is our job to legislate.  It is not for a Minister to come along and say what is good practice.  If it were done by statutory order, duly submitted to the processes of the House, it might be quite another matter but there is no such machinery in existence.</P>
    <P>We do not want Government legislation by practice, by promise of Ministers, by undertakings or by formal sanctions.  That is not good parliamentary practice.  It is not good legislation. It is unsound in principle.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why the Minister should resist the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am quite deflated and I do not think I can say very much more on the issue except to repeat that if the Minister was genuinely sincere in what he said on the Second Stage, then he must accept the amendment.  Our proposed amendment, No. 5, comes from the British Income Tax Act of 1952.  I have strong views about copying British legislation in this country but if it has got to be done, then let us go the whole hog and copy it properly and comprehensively. I urge the Minister to accept this very desirable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, just briefly, like to support this amendment.  As Deputy Byrne has said, Deputy Haughey is the first Minister for Finance who is a chartered accountant and we all have high hopes that he will have a more broadminded approach to these problems.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has as yet indicated his intentions in this matter.  I would hope that his training as an accountant, plus his ordinary sense of fair play, will encourage him to accept the amendment rather than resist it.  It seems very unreasonable that the Revenue Commissioners should have the die loaded very much in their favour while it is very much loaded against the ordinary private citizen.  Ordinary justice demands that both sides of the balance get equal play.  If a limit of six years is good enough for the ordinary citizen to claim back from the Revenue Commissioners, then they, in their turn, ought to be satisfied with claiming from the individual in respect of a back period of six years.  If, as the Minister indicated, it is the practice not to go back farther than six years, then, as Deputy Byrne says, we ought to get away from the practice and make it formal by accepting this amendment so that everybody will know where he stands and will have the same degree of security in the situation which is what we have not now got.</P>

      <P>I should like <Col N="55" /> to support this amendment.  Apparently, we increasingly live in an age of bureaucracy in which the State has one right on its side and the ordinary individual is denied rights in return. As I see the position, first of all, no estate under this could conclusively be wound up forever.  There is nothing to stop somebody in the Revenue Commissioners or in the Department of Finance from deciding, for instance in the case of a person who died a great many years ago, that inappropriate tax was paid on his estate so that the whole position of the estate would be brought to life again.  This imposes tremendous expense on those who succeed the deceased or even on the individual who is still living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a small consolation.  However, it is something. In any case, I do not see why the State should have any particular privilege over a private individual. Further than that, if the State owes me money, if I discover I have paid too much income tax&mdash;which I feel I most certainly have done over the years&mdash; after seven or eight years, I have no rights at all.  I cannot get the money from the State because I am statutorily barred after six years.  Here we are asked to legislate to make it right for the Revenue Commissioners to chase a person after six years and take the money from him.  It is unjust and inequitable, and I am very strongly in favour of this amendment.  We should resist the other proposal as much as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be accepted that the ordinary individual has not got a file or a shoal of clerks, officials, or typists to help him.  Anybody who is brought into court or brought back into the arena of having to pay tax in regard to some years ago, is placed at a tremendous disadvantage.  The Minister should consider these things.  It is absolutely unreasonable to take a person back over a period of years and say to him: &ldquo;You did not pay sufficient <Col N="56" /> tax in 1947 and we are now going to bring it up again and bring you into court&rdquo;.  It may be suggested that you committed fraud.  If you are taken into court to argue the matter and you have to seek legal advice&mdash;and I may say that legal advice is not always cheaply obtained&mdash;you have to go to all these expenses.  Are we to know that the State will pay the expenses if they fail to prove their case, or are we to find ourselves in the position that the State is free from any charges imposed on the private individual?  The Minister could very easily accept this amendment. If he does, another deathblow will be struck at bureaucracy which is growing day by day to the detriment of each one of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to Deputies to try, if possible, to see this from my side.  Deputy O'Higgins does not approach this with the right attitude. This is not a game which is played between the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayers.  It is not a question of playing a game according to the rules and everybody being under the same restrictions.  After all, there is a fundamental difference between the Revenue and the taxpayers in this regard.  The taxpayer knows his own circumstances, knows his own resources, income, capital, assets and so on, but the Revenue do not.  The Revenue can only find out and endeavour to assess and collect income tax on the basis of certain limited powers which we confer upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, to begin with, the two parties are not at all equal.  It is not, as I say, a question of playing a game; it is a question of trying to enable the Revenue to do their job, to give them the power to collect the taxes which we need to run the State.  It is not a question of being able to outwit the Revenue Commissioners for six years and then you have got away with it.  It is a simple matter that anybody who is liable to pay income tax, surtax or any other tax, should pay it, and that is that.  Therefore, I do not think there is an analogy at all between the situation of the taxpayer claiming back overpayments from the State and the ability of the Revenue to re-open cases where there has been either fraud or <Col N="57" /> wilful neglect.  That is all we are talking about, cases where there has been fraud or wilful neglect, because it is the unvarying practice of the Revenue Commissioners not to go back further than six years except where they are satisfied that there has been fraud or neglect.</P>
    <P>To refer to what Deputy Sweetman said, as he and other Deputies know, the Revenue Commissioners received a deputation from the Institute of Incorporated Accountants in regard to this matter and the whole business was discussed very fully and frankly.  My understanding is that the Revenue Commissioners made it absolutely clear to the chartered accountants that in no case did they go back beyond six years unless there was fraud or wilful neglect.</P>

      <P>However, I want to put another few aspects of this to the House.  Deputies are quoting the situation in Britain but the situation in Britain is not qute as straightforward or as simple as some Deputies have indicated.  The British authorities evidently found it necessary to bring in a number of amendments to protect themselves.  In particular, they brought in, by section 51 of the 1960 Finance Act, an amendment which extended the time limit for making assessments in cases of neglect &mdash;neglect now, not wilful neglect&mdash; neglect <i>simpliciter</i> which did not amount to fraud or wilful neglect.  We confine ourselves to fraud and wilful neglect.  In 1960 they brought in this provision and they extended the time limit beyond six years where there is simple neglect.  They define &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; in that context as meaning negligence or failure to give any notice, make any return, statement or declaration, or to produce or furnish any list, document or other information required by or under the Income Tax Acts.  That is a very wide and sweeping definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean where there is no return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In any of these cases they say neglect covers negligence or failure to give any notice, make any return, statement or declaration or to produce or furnish any list, document or other information required by or under the Income Tax Acts.  When they brought that in, they said that if an assessment had been raised within the normal six year period, they could go back a further six years dating from the year of assessment.  I mention this <Col N="59" /> to show that it is not true to say that in Britain they do not go back beyond six years <i>simpliciter.</i></P>
      <P>To go back again to the chartered accountants.  They were received by the Revenue Commissioners at my request, and they had long and fruitful discussions about the matter, and my understanding is that they indicated that they would be satisfied if they could have from the Revenue Commissioners a letter confirming that the practice was that cases were not re-opened, other than cases of fraud or wilful neglect, beyond a limit of six years.  That letter has been issued to the chartered accountants stating that in practice cases are not re-opened beyond a six-year limit.  I have no evidence, and nothing to suggest, that the Institute are not satisfied with that assurance.</P>
      <P>Another assurance I want to give Deputies is that there is no question ever of an inspector of taxes making, outside the six-year limit, an additional assessment on the same set of facts simply because he has changed his mind in regard to the facts. Deputies are inclined to look at this from one point of view very largely.  I want to suggest that there is another point of view about the procedure that is there at present.  It is a simple, flexible and well-established procedure, and it enables Revenue to go back and open up appropriate cases.  We think they should be entitled to, where there is a deliberate attempt to deceive.  If we spell out in a statute that they cannot go back beyond six years, we put the onus on them of establishing fraud and that is a very difficult thing to do. As I say, they do not in practice go back beyond six years.</P>

      <P>I want to take up one phrase the Minister used.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Look, the Revenue Commissioners do not go back beyond <Col N="60" /> six years unless it is a case of fraud or wilful neglect.&rdquo; I accept that that is the practice and experience judged from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, but we are legislating here and we are dealing with what the law of the land is.  The law of the land provides that the Revenue Commissioners can go back in effect to any point.  They can go back to 1922 or 1923.  Applying the law to what the Minister says is the experience of the Revenue Commissioners, the fact is that when the Revenue Commissioners decide that this is a case of fraud or wilful neglect, they bring in a back assessment.  That is a decision against which there is no appeal because the power is there to make a back assessment. It may be wrong, unfair, or contrary to the facts, but so long as we permit our taxation code to operate in effect under unwritten laws, the taxpayer has no rights and no remedy.</P>
      <P>The situation is worse because he is then branded as a person who has committed a fraud on Revenue, a person who is guilty of gross and wilful negligence. He has no way of ventilating his case because the machine goes on, and there is a back assessment, and there is nothing he can do about it.  In my view, that pinpoints how unfair this is. If the law said: &ldquo;If there is a case of fraud or a case of wilful neglect, then there will be no time limit&rdquo;, that would mean that before some court or some independent person the Revenue Commissioners would have to say: &ldquo;All right; here is our evidence that this is fraud or wilful neglect&rdquo;, and the taxpayer, in accordance with ordinary justice, would be entitled to say: &ldquo;That is wrong because of A, B, C or D&rdquo;, and someone would decide the issue one way or the other.  I do not see what is wrong with that.  It is in accordance with what the Minister says is the policy of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say this, but this is obviously the point of view of bureaucracy&mdash;and Deputy Esmonde is perfectly correct&mdash;as expressed by the Minister.  I think that, on reflection, he will agree because he said that if we changed the law, we would be putting the onus on the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="61" /> to prove fraud.  Why should that onus not be there?  If we all agree that it is fair and just that there should be a time limit of six years except in a case of fraud&mdash;and there is no disagreement about that&mdash;why should the onus not be on the Revenue Commissioners to prove fraud?  Why should we allow a situation in which someone who is nameless in a back room decides for some reason, never stated, that this is a case of fraud, and the taxpayer can never answer that anonymous person who makes that allegation for reasons which are never disclosed?  Surely that is unfair?</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that there is an obligation and a clear responsibility on the taxpayer to settle his accounts with the State fully and honourably. I agree that it is a responsibility of the State and the Revenue Commissioners, within the framework of the law, to see that everyone discharges his just and due liability for tax.  There is no disagreement about that.  I would have no sympathy for people who feel it is a game, and who pit their wits and by blowing hot and cold, conceal these things.  I am not making any case for people of that kind.  I am talking about the majority of taxpayers, the person who endeavours to discharge his obligations, the person who does not wilfully conceal things, the person who is not in any way guilty of that kind of taxation fraud, but who, for some reason he is not told, finds, as has happened, make no mistake about it, that there has been a back assessment over that number of years, years he is not able to grapple with.  Added to that back assessment, he is told in effect that the reason is that he has been guilty of fraud.  He is convicted and tried in his absence.  That is what I object to.</P>

We will go back beyond six years only if we are satisfied that there is fraud.  All that fraud does is to operate to set the practice aside.  The Revenue Commissioners are then free to abandon the practice and go back over previous assessments.  The taxpayer is still perfectly entitled to defend himself on the facts before the Special Commissioners, the Circuit Court and even up to the Supreme Court.</P>

It is not correct to say that somebody in a back room suggests there was fraud in this case and therefore the person is condemned.  All that happens is that the decision of the Revenue Commissioners that this man is guilty of fraud simply enables them to set aside their standard practice of not going back and bringing the whole law into operation.</P>

      <P>Is that not the same thing?  I shall give an example. I am a taxpayer and have been having discussions perhaps over my tax liability.  I find an assessment is made on me going back 20 years.  I have to find out whether that assessment is right or wrong.  The onus is on me to prove it is incorrect and I endeavour to do it one way or another.  The only issue that arises from the assessment is my liability to the tax involved in the assessment and nothing else.  But in fact the assessment has gone back 20 years because somebody decided I was guilty of fraud.  That charge I cannot deal with.  I have already been convicted of that.</P>

      <P>There it is.  All that is involved is whether the assessment is right and to what extent.  In fact the assessment may be perfectly right.  I make the Minister a present of that.  But the reason I did not pay my tax was a genuine <i>bona fide</i> mistake, something that was not fraud, but I have to pay up.  If in fact the boot were on the other foot and genuinely, through some mistake, I neglected to claim an allowance that I properly should have claimed and I find that for the past 20 years I should be getting such an allowance, there is no question of whether or to what extent my mistake was due to my fault or not.  There is no discretion.  There is an absolute barrier against going back beyond six years.  There it is.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister, but I have to go.</P>

      <P>I should have liked to continue the argument with the Deputy, but no doubt he is leaving an able substitute.  Deputies opposite lay a lot of stress on the situation in Britain.  In fact, as we stand at present, we are more lenient than the British are.  The British found themselves having to have a statutory dependence on fraud.  That is what the Deputies opposite would like, too&mdash; that there would have to be a statutory barrier against going beyond six years unless there was fraud.  The British found themselves in that position.  They had a statutory dependence on fraud being established.  They appear to have found it unworkable and brought in a provision so that in fact in Britain now you can go back indefinitely, providing there is &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;, which is a much wider term altogether than we are using.  We are confining it to fraud and wilful neglect.  They can go back as far as they like in Britain, once they find simple neglect.  Deputies cannot quote the British situation to me <Col N="64" /> in favour of what they are arguing. I have a lot of sympathy with the point of view of the Deputies opposite, but I feel that, unless they can establish that the Revenue are not adhering to this practice and are in fact going back beyond six years in cases where there is not fraud or wilful neglect, they should not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things. There is wilful neglect; in other words, a wilful omission to do something that the taxpayer should do.  A taxpayer is compelled by law to fill in a return every year.  If he wilfully does not do that, conceals his existence or his identity, that is wilful neglect on his part.  Only in that case or in some such case could they go back beyond the six years and make additional assessments. In Britain they can go back six years by statute and back beyond six years if there is neglect.  Neglect is a far wider term.  It is defined as:</P>
      <P>Negligence or failure to give any notice, make any return, statement or declaration or to produce or furnish any list, document or other information required by law under the Income Tax Acts.</P>
      <P>So that a simple omission to supply some form or statement might mean that they are statutorily entitled to go back as far as they like.</P>

      <P>Could I have some further clarification from the Minister?  Is the position that, if anybody in the office of the Revenue Commissioners, maybe a junior clerk, decides that somebody has not paid his lawful dues to the State over a period further back than six years, they can re-open the case immediately? I take it the Minister is arguing the point that it can be opened only in a case of fraud?  Surely any time they go back over six years it is, <i>ipso facto,</i> a case of fraud?  Therefore, it brings in the point made by Deputy O'Higgins. What chance has the individual of defending himself against a charge of fraud?  I cannot see any difference between the assessment being made by the officers concerned.  They say: &ldquo;You have not paid your lawful dues. Therefore, we are going to re-open the whole thing.&rdquo; Again, there is fraud. There is no difference between the two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On that last point, I want to put a very practical point of view to the Minister.  It is not the full use of these powers unjustly which is to be deplored; it is their continued existence. While they remain, they are used <i>in terrorem.</i> They are used to intimidate the taxpayers, threaten them with a full investigation back for donkeys' years: &ldquo;We will establish that there is fraud if you do not settle now&rdquo;, and taxpayers may be bullied into a settlement which would not otherwise arise when dealing with the investigation.  I think it is quite clear that at present on the question of fraud, there is no appeal.  It is fraud &ldquo;in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.  The Minister is endeavouring to give a group of civil servants superior rights to the courts of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that the Minister would at least reconsider this matter.  I do not know whether it would be wise to press him on this particular amendment at this stage because I would hope that he might see some better way of doing it than has been suggested in these two amendments. <Col N="66" /> Like other Deputies, I do much prefer that all tax provisions should be enshrined in legislation.</P>
      <P>I gather now from the Minister that the Revenue Commissioners have no hesitation in giving an assurance that their practice would continue to be that of limiting themselves to a period of six years, except in cases of fraud.  If that assurance has been given without any pressure, it is only reasonable to assume that the Revenue Commissioners are perfectly happy with a period of six years for ordinary day-to-day operations.  There was an intervention about how much money was recovered in arrear and I gather that a sum of £¾ million per annum was recovered in respect of arrears of tax but I do not believe for a moment that any considerable proportion of that sum would be in respect of periods in excess of six years previously.  I doubt very much whether any statistics could be produced to show that this power is of any great value at all.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I cannot see that the proving of fraud would throw all that amount of undue burden on the Revenue Commissioners.  What you are dealing with is a man's sources of income and there is a very limited number of sources of income&mdash;wages, salary, commission, annuities, investments and property.  I cannot think of any others on the spur of the moment and I doubt if there are any which I have omitted.  A person can scarcely be able to be very credible if he says: &ldquo;I did not know that I had a farm down the country&rdquo; or &ldquo;I did not know that I was in receipt of an annuity&rdquo;.  If the Revenue can establish that there was an annuity or that there was property, it is almost an open and shut case that the taxpayer must have known and it would be very difficult for him to prove complete ignorance.</P>
      <P>Here again, I feel that undue power is being given to the collectors of taxes, not because they need it but because in their imaginations, they feel that a situation might conceivably arise where they might conceivably want to use it and I do not like that for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> If we do something along the lines of the two amendments&mdash;although I am not quite happy with them as they stand&mdash;it is quite possible for us to go back and rectify the mistake we have made if in fact it is discovered that we have made a mistake but I do not think we would be making a mistake by withdrawing this power.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I do not believe that this is a game to be played between taxpayers and collectors of taxes, with each one trying to delude the other.  But mistakes can be made in all good faith and it is not really sustainable to say that a new assessment can be made at any time whether there is fraud or not.  If the Revenue Commissioners have been perfectly happy to give an assurance that they will continue to limit themselves to six years except where they are satisfied in their own mind that there is some question of fraud, we should take them at their word and say: &ldquo;If you are so happy with that arrangement, why not let us put it into a Finance Bill?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would hope that we would not have a collision on this particular point and that, at least, the Minister might give us some indication that he would be prepared to look into it further because my whole training, just as his whole training and the training of the other Deputies who have spoken here today, is that we must have certainty in any question of legislation, and particularly where taxation is involved.  I do not like any system which imposes on the taxpayer the horrible doubt in his own mind that an extra assessment may be landed on him without any warning and real responsibility on his part for that situation.  There are always questions of the possibility of a mistake in a return but to say that this must be subject to reassessment at any time during the lifetime of that taxpayer is going much too far.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could say that the powers to go back for a period in excess of six years have been exercised over the past few years at an average of 50 times per annum and that the revenue recovered by <Col N="68" /> reason of going back in excess of six years has averaged a considerable sum each year, I might be prepared to reconsider it, but, as matters stand, I am not happy with section 186 of the Income Tax Act.  I think it does give unnecessarily wide powers to the collectors of taxes and I would ask the Minister to give some further consideration to it.  We have a Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill still before us and even if the Minister cannot reach a decision here at this stage, I hope he might consider it under that heading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to bulldoze the House about this.  I would much prefer to persuade the House to agree with me than to proceed otherwise and I thought I was succeeding somewhat in presuading Deputies that this was not altogether unreasonable. I am afraid that when Deputy Booth got up to speak that hope was shattered because we all know that Deputy Booth is the most reasonable of men and if he cannot be persuaded as to the reason in this, I will have to look at it again.  But I want to deal with a couple of points he made and I will deal with the net issue he put forward.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth says that it should not be difficult to prove fraud.  That is probably the nub of the matter.  This seems to be what drove the British to amend their statutory position as distinct from practice.  It is difficult to prove fraud.  You have to prove <i>mens rea</i> and all that sort of thing.  I do not mind its being difficult on the Revenue to prove fraud when the proving of that fraud would lead to penalties and so on.  I think it is perfectly legitimate that they should have to go to trouble to establish that there was fraud if they are going to punish a man on the basis of the fraud committed but that is not what we are concerned with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned here with a situation where fraud exists and all that does is to operate to relieve the Revenue Commissioners of the restaint they have put on themselves not to go back.  If they want to do anything about the fraud, they still have to prove it fully and comprehensively, <Col N="69" /> and if they want to do anything about the assessment, they still have to prove it in court.  The only thing I am objecting to is that they would be statutorily prohibited from re-opening a case unless they could prove fraud, because fraud is difficult to prove.  Deputy Booth said it is not difficult, but the British evidently did find themselves in difficulty in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are some other points about which Deputy Esmonde was worried, for instance, that some faceless clerks with brown boots in back offices might be taking the vital decision in regard to these matters.  That is not so.  First of all, the ordinary inspector of taxes is not permitted to re-open cases.  It is only the Investigation Branch which can begin to operate this at all.  All cases of this sort, before they can get under way, must be personally approved by the Revenue Commissioners, so there is no question as to the level at which these decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>The Revenue have to operate an efficient administration.  They do not pull figures out of the air and slap assessments gaily around the countryside in the hope they might stick somebody. These cases are based on evidence and information that has come to light.  We all know the usual case where some bank account or some assets have come to light which had hitherto been suppressed.  It is only where there is some material evidence like that that the Revenue Commissioners decide to take any action; otherwise they would be wasting a great deal of time and money.</P>
    <P>I do hope that I can persuade the House that the present situation is reasonable and flexible and operates fairly well.  It is clear practice&mdash;and I am sure Deputies accept that when we say it is the practice it is the practice&mdash; not to go back for other than serious reasons.  If you force me to legislate that the Revenue Commissioners are statutorily prevented from re-opening a case unless they can prove fraud, then I think that would be putting an unreasonable restraint on them.  I do not think it should be pressed.  Perhaps it would be a solution if I were to undertake to the House to discuss this <Col N="70" /> matter again with the Institute of Chartered Accountants between now and Report Stage and see what their present view is about it.  For myself, I am not convinced there is any need to provide this by statute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Would the Minister consider putting a floor on the amount, stipulating that investigation would be made only in respect of a reasonably substantial figure?

      <P>Apropos of what Deputy Booth was saying, I have some more information which may help him to come to a decision on this matter. The annual yield from back duty cases is around £900,000 a year.  It is very difficult to give reliable information on this, but the best information I have is that about half that amount is applicable to the six-year period; in other words, back duty cases outside the six-year period account for about half of that.</P>

      <P>That is a <i>non sequitur.</i> If Deputies had their way, the Revenue would be prohibited from re-opening these cases unless they could prove fraud, and as I say, fraud is very difficult to prove.  Deputy Booth is saying the taxpayer could not conceal the fact that he had an annuity, but the taxpayer could say: &ldquo;I did not know that that income was taxable.  I did not know that receipts from such a source were taxable,&rdquo; and the Revenue would have to prove that he had <i>mens rea</i>, that he wilfully concealed it.</P>

      <P>A person only has to prove taxable income.  For instance, let us take the current topic of builders' profits: the code applies only to income; it does not apply to capital gains.  A taxpayer might affect innocence and say: &ldquo;I thought that was a capital gain.  I did not realise that was taxable income.&rdquo; I think Deputies would all agree that where the Revenue would set out to inflict penalties for fraud, then they should be obliged to establish it beyond yea or nay, but where it is simply a question of giving them power to abandon a restraint they have placed on themselves, then I do not think it reasonable to expect them to prove fraud in that case.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give us any information as to how many fresh assessments were made in respect of a period more than six years previously? I know what he has told us now is that of the arrears of tax recovered per annum about half of the total is in respect of over six years.  To my mind, that is not sufficient, because what I should like to know is in how many cases have the inspectors, with the approval of the Revenue Commissioners, made fresh assessments, say, last year, in respect of a period more than six years ago.  I have a very strong suspicion that in actual fact they have done that.  Cases may be under review or under discussion and the final assessment agreed may date back over six years, but it is quite different from the provision here where a new assessment could be raised in respect of seven or ten years back.</P>

Nobody is trying to cover up <Col N="72" /> the fraud cases at all, and that seems to me completely to make the case for the amendments.  In the unlikely event of the Minister being able to find any valid argument to reject this amendment between now and Report Stage, I would put this to him&mdash;I do not think it is likely he will find any valid argument, but if he can find one and persuade us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The position is that, if it is necessary for Revenue to retain these provisions, and I do not accept that it is, there is certainly nothing to justify the retention of the six-year repayment rule.  The argument the Minister made about the taxpayer knowing what he had, and so forth, is not a valid argument at all.  If it works one way, it should work the other way as well.</P>

      <P>I will try to get any useful information possible.  Deputies who have experience in these matters realise that it is not a very clearcut situation at all.  Usually what happens is that the Revenue Commissioners discover that Seán Citizen has £100,000 tucked away in the bank about which he never told them.  They can establish roughly that he must <Col N="73" /> have accumulated that amount over a period of ten years.  They issue assessments for the ten years to cover that £100,000.  What happens then is that Seán Citizen comes in and makes a clean breast of it and a settlement is made on the basis of agreed figures. From that point of view, the figures of assessments would not really convey very much.  However, I shall see what I can do about it, but I am not very optimistic about getting a clear picture.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Section 480 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the repeal of subsection (6)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the Revenue's right of distraint set out in section 480 of the Income Tax Act. That section has been repealed in part at the behest of the President.  Our proposed amendment relates to the right of distraint in respect of lands not occupied at the time of distraint. Subsequently these lands may be occupied by another person and distraint can then be made on that new occupier.  The property of the new occupier can be seized.  That is a very bad principle.</P>

The position is that, if the collector calls and finds no goods there, then he can come back again, and again, until such time as he finds some goods to satisfy his warrant.  If the land is sold, the collector can do nothing.  He cannot seize any property belonging to the new owner.  That is clearly set out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an anomaly&mdash; to all right thinking people I should think a somewhat shameful anomaly&mdash; in our law.  Leaving aside the question of anonymous cattle, is it not true that under the Local Government Act, if you drive your motorcar up to the door of the defaulting ratepayer, the rate collector can come in and collect your car although that car is registered in your name and it is possible to demonstrate conclusively that the car in question is not the property of the defaulting ratepayer but the property of a visitor on his tenement.  Whether that is constitutional is open to doubt. It is a right which any rate collector has and the Revenue Commissioners have it by the same principle of law if you can call it a principle at all.  I see the force of the Minister's argument that distraint becomes impossible if <Col N="75" /> the Revenue Commissioners are prevented from distraint by the simple denial of ownership by the person on whose land the chattels happen to be. On the other hand, how can he justify the local authorities or the Revenue Commissioners taking property which they know does not belong to the defaulting ratepayer or taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not strictly what is at issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but is it fair that if a man owes Schedule A income tax and it is proposed to distrain against him and he sets his land in conacre and his tenant puts 20 cattle on the land, the Revenue Commissioners can come along, collect his 20 cattle and sell them for the debt due by the owner of the land, although the cattle belong to the conacre tenant?  The Revenue Commissioners say to the tenant that that is his bad luck and that he must sue the owner of the land.  I know that this procedure makes the enforcement of the income tax code simpler than it otherwise might be and I sympathise with the view the Minister advances when he asks us to show him some other way in which the ultimate sanction of distraint can be invoked against the property owner.  The fact that such enforcement is difficult does not justify us in legislating unjustly and in representing the Revenue Commissioners as ravening wolves preying on the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are accustomed to inveighing blandly against the Revenue Commissioners, oblivious of the fact that they are only doing what we are telling them to do.  I do not think we ought to give them the power to do this and if the Minister asks me to tell him how to get the tax without having this weapon, I cannot see why the Exchequer or the local authorities cannot proceed like an ordinary creditor, that is, secure a judgment, register it as a mortgage on property and in due course close the mortgage and sell the property.  The Minister may say that no one will buy the property in such circumstances, but so long as the mortgage remains, the property cannot be sold.  The whole commercial life of <Col N="76" /> the country carries on through the collection of debt by the ordinary processes of law.</P>
    <P>If any of us should get a judgment against our neighbour for £10 or £20 or £100, nobody would suggest that we should have the right to distrain the chattels of a third man which happen to be in our debtor's tenement but we place the obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to do this.  I have not heard any convincing argument advanced as to why the Revenue Commissioners should not proceed in the ordinary way.  It is true that it is not always easy to sell land to realise a mortgage but the man who owns that land will not be able to sell it without discharging the mortgage because no one else will buy it.  It might be difficult to sell the land over the debtor's head but if a third party bought the land subject to the mortgage, I do not think anybody in rural Ireland would object. It would be no harm if the Minister would look at this matter from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners and the local authorities.  I expect that Deputy Sweetman is saying to himself that this is the kind of nonsense that all Ministers for Finance have to listen to from their colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but I think I know also what is running through his mind.  I have had to do with many Ministers for Finance and they are all inclined to think that the Revenue Commissioners have a dirty job to do and that they should be given the means of doing it.  That is the occupational hazard of all Ministers for Finance and they come to realise that the Revenue Commissioners are not Balubas or savages but decent people doing a job of work.  They are conscientious public officials who carry out our instructions but people like Deputy John Costello and I, who are at the other side of the fence, look at these matters with a more disillusioned eye.  I would suggest to all Ministers for Finance that they should stand back from the situation and ask themselves if they think it <Col N="77" /> right that we should authorise the Revenue Commissioners to seize the property of a third man and whether it would not be better to put the Revenue Commissioners and the local authorities on a par with the ordinary creditor who has his remedy in law.</P>
      <P>There is a distinction between the Revenue Commissioners and the ordinary creditor.  The creditor gives credit voluntarily; he creates the debt and no one forces him to do so.  The Revenue Commissioners do not do this.  The Revenue Commissioners find that a debt has accrued under the law with the making of which they have nothing whatever to do.  They have an obligation thrust upon them to recover that debt.  However, fully conscious of that distinction, I still think we ought to invite the Revenue Commissioners to proceed as ordinary creditors do, even if that should involve substantial inconvenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned here with a very net issue.  It is simply that if the collector goes along to a property and finds no goods he can distrain, he may come back again and again and find something distrainable. I think that is perfectly reasonable particularly as there is the proviso that if, in the meantime, the property has been sold for valuable consideration and the original debtor is no longer in occupation there is no power left to the collector to seize.  Subsection (6), as it stands, is a very necessary provision. It is true that it is a complication if the lands have been let in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very desirable amendment for many reasons.  It deals again with the right of distraint with more specific reference to Schedules A and B tax.  This is one of those odd provisions of the 1918 British Act, re-enacted in Section 481, which originally was made applicable to Ireland only.  The very severe powers held by the collector of taxes under this provision were not bestowed on collectors in equivalent posts in the United Kingdom.  I think that is very significant.  It brings us back to a certain approach in Ireland by British Governments to a situation which could be dealt with in a very different manner &mdash;perhaps a much more severe and harsh approach&mdash;in other parts of what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very objectionable provision in respect of tax under Schedules A and B, that is, profits arising from the ownership and the occupation of lands, enabling the collector to distrain the person charged or the occupier of the property charged and all goods and chattels to whomsoever they may <Col N="80" /> belong may be distrained.  This is most objectionable in this country in relation to Schedule B by reason of the system of eleven-month lettings under conacre which is widely operated here.</P>
    <P>A lot of land is let on the conacre system.  If I own the land and let it to Deputy Sweetman on the eleven-month system I am the legal occupier liable to Schedule B tax.  The position could well be that Deputy Sweetman has paid me his rent and then finds himself in the position of having his cattle on the land seized by the collector for my tax.  That is the position Deputy Dillon spoke about so eloquently.  It is an outrageous situation.  It is gravely unjust.  It is one of these situations of inequity which so angers, enrages, upsets and annoys the public at large. There is nothing more to be said on the case.  The machinery of the State and of the Revenue Commissioners can fully and effectively be operated without the continued existence of powers such as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say in regard to this whole matter again, that tax must be collected.  Tax which one taxpayer succeeds in not paying simply falls to be collected from the general body of taxpayers.  We must always keep that in mind.  It is all very well for Deputies to fulminate about the outrageous powers in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners, but we, as responsible legislators, have always got to come back to the fact that people do not like paying taxes and unless the Revenue Commissioners have efficient methods of collecting, then the whole machinery of the State will grind to a halt.  This is a question here of trying to maintain a balance between the rights of the individual on the one hand, and his obligations on the other.</P>
      <P>I want to draw a distinction here. This right of the collector of taxes, or the Revenue Commissioners, to seize the goods of a third party applies only to the two particular property taxes, either Schedule A or Schedule B, and they are, if you like, directly applicable to the property of the individual. The Revenue Commissioners, presumably on that basis, have been given the right to go specifically against the property to collect the tax.  This right to collect and to seize the goods of a third party does not apply in the case of other income tax, surtax, or what have you.  We are only dealing with the goods and chattels of a third party in relation to Schedules A and B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House that we might as well abandon these two taxes if you do not leave with the Revenue authorities <Col N="82" /> this power, or seek to remove from the Revenue Commissioners the right to seize these goods.  The Revenue have found invariably in regard to the other taxes in which they are confined to the individual's own goods that they get a return of <i>nulla bona</i> because the invariable answer which they get from the man is: &ldquo;Oh, this land is let and these cattle do not belong to me&rdquo;, or, if there is any other type of chattel involved, the answer is: &ldquo;I only have that on loan; it belongs to a neighbour&rdquo; and so on.  Therefore, if this system is to work&mdash;and I must emphasise again that it applies only to taxes under Schedules A and B &mdash;we must leave this power with the Revenue Commissioners to seize any goods on the property because, as I say, the tax is leviable on the property and therefore any goods on the property should be seizable in satisfaction of the taxes.  For instance, if you remove this power from the collector, what happens in the case of a man who has property here and lives abroad permanently and refuses to pay Schedules A or B taxes?</P>

      <P>Commonly called occupational myopia and maybe it is, but I cannot see my way out of this problem.  I just do not think it would work.  The Revenue Commissioners could not carry out the administration of these two Schedules if they had to go to the length of registering judgments and mortgages on lands all over the country, particularly in most of rural Ireland.  Whatever about the neighbours being prepared to buy a farm being put up by an ordinary creditor, they certainly are not going to buy it if the Revenue Commissioners are putting it up.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister not compel the Revenue Commissioners to insert an advertisement in the local paper stating that this man's land was now in this position and that anyone putting cattle on it would do so at his own risk?  In this way there would be some opportunity for the innocent bystander to be protected. The Minister's argument is that the Revenue Commissioners must be efficient but they must also be fair. The Minister also said that when somebody does not pay his tax, it must fall on the shoulders of the general body of taxpayers but that would be better than that it should be put on one particular individual.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask one question and make one observation with regard to what I would call the utterly exaggerated statement the Minister made a few moments ago to the effect that if this power is taken away from the Revenue Commissioners, they will not be able to recover taxes.  I cannot imagine anything more exaggerated than that statement.  In order to test the Minister's accuracy, I want to know if he can tell us, or if he <Col N="85" /> will inquire from the Revenue Commissioners, how many times during the past three, four or five years has this power been resorted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish. If as I believe, he will not be able to give me one single case in the past five years, his statement that without this power the Revenue Commissioners will not be able to collect taxes is utter nonsense.  I believe this power has scarcely been invoked.  The Minister said that if they had not this power, the owner of the land could take the cattle or the goods off the land, and they could not be distrained.  That is a position which habitually faces any county registrar trying to distrain goods.</P>
      <P>It is a <i>non sequitur</i> to say that if a third party has an interest in the land, the Revenue Commissioners should have the right to seize property that does not belong to the person who owed the tax.  That is the position which faces the sheriff or the county registrar acting as sheriff not every day but very frequently during the course of the year.  There is a remedy.  The Revenue Commissioners can enter plenary procedures.  They can say: &ldquo;We will interplea&rdquo;, and that would &ldquo;larn&rdquo; him, as they say.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that if the Revenue Commissioners are deprived of this power, they will not be able to collect. Of course they will be able to collect.  I think my colleagues should realise that this privilege was given to the Revenue Commissioners by British Revenue years ago.  It is based upon the old British legal theory that the Crown must be above all law, and must have privileges in the exaction of taxes which the ordinary collector has not. That runs through the whole law.  It applies not merely to the Revenue Commissioners but to all Crown debts, as they used to be called.  It was carried over into our Constitution.  That is the privilege which is being given and there is no reason why it should extend to an interference with a third party's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> Deputy Dillon said that when we talk about bureaucracy and the powers of the Revenue Commissioners, we forget that it is this House that gave those powers.  This is a matter we have to consider very carefully.  I know that civil servants, including the Revenue Commissioners in particular, insist that they want every possible power.  They say: &ldquo;We will never exercise this power but we want it all the same.&rdquo; They want to grasp these powers.</P>
    <P>As I say, this privilege has its roots in the old Crown privileges which were carried over into our Constitution.  This is the privilege the Minister wants to keep here.  There is no reason why the Revenue Commissioners should not be in the same position as an ordinary collector with exactly the same powers of collecting money as the ordinary collector would have.  This is a device which has been resorted to frequently. When a person was threatened with an action for breach of promise, he shifted his cattle to another person's land, or he put someone else's cattle on his land and said they were not his. That is a device which is endemic in the country and it is not confined exclusively to moneys due to the Revenue Commissioners.  We have the courts and there is ample power to collect the money and to prevent an injustice being done.</P>

      <P>The only thing I can say about Deputy Costello's question is that I thought I had already replied to it&mdash;at least to Deputy Dillon.  The very fact that the Revenue Commissioners have this power means that it does not have to be availed of.  Therefore the figures which Deputy Costello asked for would mean nothing.  We have to contemplate the situation which would arise if they did not have this power.  I am quite satisfied that all Deputy Costello's suggestion would succeed in doing would be to clutter up the already over-burdened courts with a monumental amount of additional work.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  To suggest that the Revenue Commissioners should have to sue civilly for every item of taxation owing to them is, to my mind, to approach this whole matter from an absurd point of view. I do not think the Revenue Commissioners should be in the same position as an ordinary collector.  The collection of the revenue of the land is different from any other process.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, an ordinary collector exercises a choice and vets the person to whom he affords credit.  He takes a deliberate decision.  That does not apply to the Revenue Commissioners. They have no knowledge of the people from whom they have to collect taxes.  They administer taxation in an omnibus way.  We could all be wonderfully liberal about this matter and drive a coach and four through the whole revenue code, but I should like to know where we would finish.</P>

      <P>The Minister thinks the Revenue Commissioners should have more power than ordinary people.  I listened in the Supreme Court to counsel on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners insisting that they were entitled to hang on to a sum of nearly £20,000 which they had obtained from a taxpayer and which they admitted in open court they had no right to get or to keep.  The court asked them again and again: &ldquo;Do you say the Revenue Commissioners cannot give it back, or will not give it back?&rdquo; and the answer which was finally extracted was: &ldquo;We will not.&rdquo; Eventually the Supreme Court said they must.  With that attitude taken by the Revenue Commissioners in open court, we are bound to curtail as far as we possibly can these extraordinary powers given in legislation which was in operation before this State was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have so profound a reverence for the opinion of Deputy Costello on almost any topic that I find myself in some embarrassment at having to dissent from his view in any <Col N="88" /> way.  His vast legal experience usually in defending the rights of the individual against the machinery of the State, has naturally given his mind a certain bent.</P>
      <P>As I said in the first instance, the Minister is suffering himself to acquire a Treasury squint too soon.  I am bound to say quite frankly in Deputy Costello's presence that I do not agree that there is no difference between the position of the Revenue Commissioners and the ordinary trader.  There is a fundamental difference.  The ordinary trader makes a choice; the Revenue Commissioners do not.  Deputy Costello has much longer experience of government than I have.  I can only speak of my own experience.  I have met some pretty tough Revenue Commissioners in my day.  I found them to be stiff and unyielding in doing their duty as imposed upon them by us.  I have never failed to advise persons in difficulty about their taxation problems, if they were in good faith, to tell them to the Revenue Commissioners, in the firm conviction that the Revenue Commissioners would not only give them what was their due but perhaps suggest additional advantages to which they were entitled and of which they had no knowledge.</P>
      <P>I believe that if a taxpayer seeks to deceive the Revenue Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners react against him by enforcing the full rigour of the law rather than its spirit.  If I thought the Revenue Commissioners' general attitude was that described by Deputy Costello, I would not hesitate to join with him in speaking very trenchantly of it but I speak only of what I know from my own experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest that something Deputy Costello said earlier is of coercive importance to the Members of this House.  It is true we are not now dealing with the Income Tax (Consolidation) Act.  Therefore, we are not making <i>de novo</i> these offensive provisions or taking them over in a codifying Act.  What we are doing is looking at the Income Tax Act, 1966. We have already amended it in order to make it conform to the Constitution of 1937.  We are now suggesting in the case of the Finance Bill, 1967, that <Col N="89" /> further amendment is necessary if we are to give effect to the terms of the Constitution of 1937.</P>
    <P>That duty devolves on us&mdash;not on the Revenue Commissioners but on us&mdash;so long as we leave in existence a certain power with our direction to the Revenue Commissioners in the last analysis to use that power.  The Revenue Commissioners have to use it if they believe the circumstances conform to the situation for invoking the ultimate sanction for recovery.  As Deputy Costello pointed out, and I think the House ought to consider it, suppose we deliberately adhere to the provision in the 1966 Income Tax (Consolidation) Act, which we know is unconstitutional, on the ground that it is expedient to retain the power, on the ground that it is really held <i>in terrorem</i> and on the ground that it has not been used, suppose we accept all the Minister says&mdash;which I do not&mdash;that a vast amount of litigation would arise if we required the Revenue Commissioners to use the ordinary processes of the law for the recovery of income tax debts under Schedules A and B&mdash;suppose all that were true and still it is also true that this provision is contrary to the Constitution, it is a dreadful injustice to individual citizens.</P>
    <P>For instance, take a trustee of a minor's estate or somebody in such a position that he has an obligation on him to protect the assets in his care. He says: &ldquo;You have seized the assets and chattels for which I am trustee in satisfaction of a debt you say is due by them.&rdquo; The Revenue Commissioners invoke that power and he says it is unconstitutional.  The Revenue Commissioners say it has been fully argued here and we are satisfied it is, where-upon there devolves upon the trustee an obligation to vindicate his interest in the High Court.  The Revenue Commissioners have a corresponding obligation, as a result of our legislation and as a result of the debate we have here today showing we are fully conscious of the problem, to fight the case in the High Court.  If they are defeated, they have a clear obligation to go to the Supreme Court.  The burden of the costs on the individual who finally gets his judgment in the Supreme Court <Col N="90" /> may be in part met by the costs awarded against the Revenue Commissioners in their unsuccessful suit, but will almost certainly not be fully met.  The Supreme Court will declare that our failure to act in regard to this amendment showed our indifference to the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is great power in Deputy Costello's proposition.  He reminds us that the Constitution places on the Legislature an obligation to legislate in the spirit of the Constitution.  Now, surely it is a reasonable proposition on the part of Deputy Costello to say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;With all these questions present to your mind, do you think you have a duty, once your mind has been directed to this, to submit this whole business to the Attorney General and ask him `In your judgment, does this power which the Revenue Commissioners at present have conflict with the Constitution of 1937?  If you certify to me that in your opinion it does not, then I accept the opinion of the law officers.  Of course, that is subject to the overriding authority of the courts, but my duty as Minister for Finance is to come back to Dáil Éireann and to say that the best advice I can get from the law officers is that we are not legislating in violation of the Constitution'?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Once the question is asked by Deputy Costello: &ldquo;Have you sought the opinion of the law officers in this matter?&rdquo; I think the Minister for Finance is put in a position in which I have not seen any of his predecessors put before.  There is an obligation cast on him which I think he has an obligation to discharge.  We want to know the reason why.  In the codification Act, we found we had collided with the Constitution.  We overcame that by a rather odd legislative device into which it is unnecessary to go today.</P>
    <P>Here is another matter which I think is deserving of consideration in this context.  Deputy Costello says: &ldquo;You have to tell the House have you consulted the law officers.  If you have, you are out of the picture.  Now it is for the courts to take the matter over.&rdquo; Suppose the Minister came back to us and said: &ldquo;I have consulted the Attorney General and he says it is unconstitutional,&rdquo;<Col N="91" /> what would we all say?  Would we say: &ldquo;To hell with the Constitution. Let us go straight ahead until the Supreme Court declares the whole Finance Act to be invalid&rdquo;?  If that is so, why does not the Minister for Finance arm himself with the considered opinion of the Attorney General?  Certainly, so far as I am concerned, if the Minister for Finance came back on Report Stage and said: &ldquo;I am advised by the Attorney General that this is in accordance with the terms of the Constitution&rdquo;, I do not think he has any further duty on constitutional grounds but if the Minister for Finance says: &ldquo;I have not asked the Attorney General and I will not ask the Attorney General, because I am not at all sure of the answer I would get&rdquo;, then I ask the Minister for Finance, is he acting in the spirit of the Constitution, are the Government acting in the spirit of the Constitution and, if they do not set that example, how do they expect anybody else in our society to act in the spirit of the Constitution or of the law itself?</P>

I am concerned with the practical business of running the country, collecting revenue, paying the country's debts, and I have not a great deal of time for these fringe areas.  I am quite satisfied that it is a perfectly reasonable proposition to say that where tax is owing on a piece of property, you can go in and seize in settlement of that tax and that debt for tax any goods or chattels on that property.  I have not the slightest hesitation in my own mind that this is perfectly constitutional.

If the House wants to say to me: &ldquo;Let us abolish Schedule A and Schedule B and increase income tax by 3d or 6d, <Col N="93" /> whatever it is, in the £&rdquo;, that is a separate proposition.  As long as we keep these two taxes, we have to ensure that everybody pays them equally and the only way we can do that is to give the Revenue authorities some speedy, efficient way of collecting them, and I do not see anything seriously wrong&mdash; I do not see anything wrong at all&mdash; with the provisions as they stand at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9, in the name of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 482 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I must confess that when the effect of section 482 as it reads was pointed out to me I was quite appalled and certainly it is not as any of us would wish it to be if it means what it says in ordinary language.  This section is the re-enactment of section 163 of the Income Tax Act, 1918 and I think the same section, in the same wording, is contained in section 75 of the British Income Tax Act, 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary meaning of this section is that if I am a creditor of any person and I am in possession of a decree, I cannot get the sheriff to execute my decree which is given in pursuance of a judgment in a court unless I am satisfied myself and can satisfy everybody else that the person against whom the decree is to be levied does not owe any income tax.  That, of course, is nonsense and yet that is what the section means in its literal, parsing interpretation. It would mean, in effect, pushing it to its ultimate conclusion, as it is phrased, that before you put any decree in the hands of the sheriff, you would have to satisfy yourself that the debtor did not owe any income tax. You have no means to satisfy yourself that the debtor does not owe any <Col N="94" /> income tax because, obviously, the Revenue Commissioners could not disclose whether a debtor did owe tax or not and it means, in effect, that this section, interpreted as it is drafted&mdash; and I accept that the drafting has been carried through&mdash;means that no decree can be enforced in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention particularly to subsection (1):</P>
    <P>No goods or chattels whatever, belonging to any person at the time any tax becomes in arrear, shall be liable to be taken by virtue of any execution or other process, warrant, or authority whatever, or by virtue of any assignment, on any account or pretence whatever, except at the suit of the landlord for rent, unless the person at whose suit the execution or seizure is made, or to whom the assignment was made, pays or causes to be paid to the Collector, before the sale or removal of the goods or chattels, all arrears of tax which are due at the time of seizure, or which are payable for the year in which the seizure is made.</P>
    <P>It is not in respect of goods that had been taken in charge by the collector. but it is the ordinary goods that belong to the debtor, and if the debtor happens to owe any income tax, then any seizure in pursuance of a decree given by the court is negatived by this section and can be set aside.  I could understand the situation if it were in relation to goods that had already been taken and charged under the power of distraint by the collector of taxes, but this does not concern those.  It is a phrase that is completely at large, and when one comes back and looks at the note at the side of the section for the purpose of trying to understand it, one finds this reference: &ldquo;Priority of tax over other debts&rdquo;.  However, subsection (1) has nothing to do with any such priority.  Subsection (2) might be properly annotated as being a case of priority.  Subsection (3) appears to deal with the cases where the collector has to distrain for the tax due, and that subsection&mdash;whether one agrees with it is another thing&mdash;is understandable. But as far as subsection (1) is concerned, I simply cannot understand <Col N="95" /> what it means.  I admit at once that it has been there all through the years but the fact that it has been there all through the years does not make it any more right.  When one reads it in its present form, it is quite clear that no decree in pursuance of a direction of the court is operative unless at the time of operation the debtor concerned owes no tax.  No one can find out that and no one can know that except the Revenue themselves, and very often not even they, because the case might be under appeal.</P>

      <P>The preference which exists for the Revenue in this case is analogous to the situation which obtains in regard to a company in liquidation or a bankruptcy.  In both of these cases, the Revenue has a preferential right to one year's tax. That is all that is involved here.  The mechanics of this might be a little difficult, as the wording might indicate, but all that is involved here is the Revenue's preferential right to one year's tax in the case of seizures or judgments against the taxpayer's property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a one section Bill and the arguments made for and against on the Second Stage apply equally on this stage.  The Bill sets out to repeal section 2 of the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1964. In order to refresh memories, it might be no harm to quote that section:</P>
      <P>(a)  the following Rules shall be substituted for Rule 2:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  Every committee of agriculture shall be composed both of persons who are and persons who are not members of the council and the members of any such committee who are members of the council shall not in number&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case the committee consists of an even number of members, exceed, or</P>
      <P>(b)  in case the committee consists of an odd number of members, exceed by more than one,</P>
      <P>the members of the committee who are not members of the council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(b)  in Rule 5 &ldquo;member of the council&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;person&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(c)  the following Rule shall be inserted after Rule 5:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5A.  Every person, other than a member of the council, appointed to be a member of a committee of agriculture shall be chosen by the council for such appointment either by reason of his attainments in the practice of farming or the development of agriculture and rural living in the particular locality in which he resides, or by reason of his attainments in the promotion of agricultural or rural home education and advisory work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the section the present Bill sets out to amend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> The Minister has made no case for the repeal of this section.  He set out to warn us of the evil effects likely to flow from a measure introduced into this House by a colleague of his and supported by both sides of the House.  It was hoped, on Second Stage, that he might deal in some depth with the arguments in support of such a section; instead of doing so, he launched out into an election speech, which was not even remotely relevant. Occasionally he touched on the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the points he made was that five committees had no outside members, no non-council members.  That, in itself, is sufficient justification, in my opinion, for turning down section 1 of this Bill.  I do not believe there is any county in relation to which it can be fairly said that the members of the county council are the best possible people to act on a county committee of agriculture and that, outside the council, there could not be found a certain number of people at least who would be better qualified to serve on such a committee, people who would have a more valuable contribution to make to such a committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister went into some detail to prove to us how wrong the whole concept was in the 1964 amending Bill introduced by his colleague.  He described it as a serious reflection on county committees of agriculture.  The purpose of this amending Bill is to kill agricultural organisation.  That is a very serious step.  A great contribution is being made by organised agriculture. These people know what is needed. They are making a serious effort to find out what is required.  They are prepared to help actively and to give a good deal of their time to do all this and it is very important now to ensure that we do not negative legislation which was designed to ensure that these people would be brought in and be fully involved.  No reason has been given as to why the minds of all in Fianna Fáil have changed since the 1964 Bill was passed.  Some said the change was brought about because county councillors advised that the 1964 Bill was a reflection on them. Apparently that was accepted as a <Col N="100" /> good enough reason for introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for those who serve on local authorities.  I am also quite conscious of the fact that there are many who serve on local authorities who are not the best people to serve on county committees of agriculture. I am also quite conscious of the fact that there are excellent people in relation to the advancement of agriculture who would not be prepared to stand for election and who would not take an active part in politics.  The Minister may say these are not excluded. We have evidence that they have, in fact, been excluded from five committees out of 27 and evidence that only a small percentage have been brought in on another percentage of the total number of county committees of agriculture.  It is a pity, in my opinion, that we do not ensure in every county that outsiders who have taken a leading part in advancing agriculture are brought in on the county committees.</P>
    <P>Another point made by the Minister was that these non-members, leading farmers, might be reckless about the expenditure of the rates.  I have yet to meet a farmer who is reckless in relation to rates.  They are a section of the community who are most concerned about rates because they know how an increase in rates affects them personally. They are the slowest to propose an increase in rates.  For the Minister to suggest they would be reckless and irresponsible in the spending of the rates is an argument that does not carry any weight with me.  I am sure it does not carry any weight with most people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the whole ground again.  It was covered in considerable detail by the various speakers last week.  The subject was also discussed in detail when the 1964 Bill was being piloted through the House. The then Minister for Agriculture made an excellent case for it and he received the unanimous support of everybody in the House.  It is a retrograde step to introduce this Bill with this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was unable to be present for the discussion <Col N="101" /> on this Bill last week but I understand that what I said on 9th June 1964, has been repeated by Deputy Clinton. What I said is reported in column 891 of the Official Report of that date and this is some of it:</P>
      <P>When I heard this Bill was being introduced, I thought the Minister would have gone a long way further on this line.  I had not discussed the matter with Deputy Donegan but I think there is a great deal of sense in what he said.</P>
      <P>It is really too bad that people who do not know anything about agriculture should find their way on to these committees, simply because they are members of a political Party and must be given some kind of position, either because they had been defeated for election to the county council or they have topped the church gate collection.  They must get recognition and the recognition is membership of a committee. Now, that is wrong and I shall be very glad to support the Minister if he devises some other system of appointment.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify that statement since apparently it has been interpreted in two different ways, in one way by Fine Gael and in another by Deputy Corish.  It would be a great pity if the county committees of agriculture should, to put it bluntly, become simply and solely the repositories for political has-beens or political failures who are put into them simply because they must be put into something. Which is the better way of putting people on these committees is a matter on which I had an open mind then and on which I have an open mind now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a feeling that the thinking behind this Bill, it having been amended in a certain way in 1964 so that representation could be given directly to farming organisations, is to rescind that amendment and I would hate to think that this was at the back of the Minister's mind when this short Bill was introduced.  The county committees have been doing quite a good job.  On most of them there are people who know quite a lot about agriculture and there are also on most of them a <Col N="102" /> number of people who know nothing whatever about it, but these generally have the good sense to keep their mouths shut when matters relating to agriculture are being discussed.  The argument that large farmers, if they were members of these committees, would drive the rates sky high does not hold any validity because their funds are strictly limited.  Whether or not this Bill becomes law, the Department of Agriculture and the county councillors themselves should make it their business to ensure that the people who go on to these committees do so because they are really interested in agriculture and not simply for the purpose of remaining attached to one political Party or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We supported the Bill when it was introduced by Deputy Smith in 1946.  Deputy Smith was a member of a local authority for a great many years and he had a wide experience of the working of these committees.  We believed that the amendment made in the Bill of 1964 was an opportunity to take our main industry, agriculture, out of Party politics.  We believed that for far too long our principal industry had been made the plaything of Party politics and that here was a golden opportunity to give recognition to the different voluntary organisations who had been working in the wilderness for so many years.  I am a great believer in voluntary organisations and I know that the NFA, despite what the Minister for Agriculture may say about it, has done wonderful work for the farmers.  The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywomen's Association and other voluntary organisations have shown great initiative, some of them much more initiative than has been shown by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believed then that this was an opportunity to give some recognition and some status in their own counties to these people.  The majority of members of these committees are doing reasonable work for the community but because they are tied to politics <Col N="103" /> and controlled by politicians, they are not doing the excellent work they could do if they were not so controlled.  The Minister has not given us a proper explanation of why Fianna Fáil have somersaulted since 1964.  If they have collective responsibility as they tell us, then Deputy Blaney supported the 1964 Bill when it was introduced and we are entitled to get from him some good reason as to why he has changed his mind.  Is it not a fact that he is afraid that if the 1964 Bill became operative, the members of the NFA would get representation on these committees?</P>
    <P>We know that no matter what the Minister says about ending the dispute, any time there are signs of it dying down, he comes along with his petrol can and throws petrol on the flames. In doing this, he is doing a disservice not alone to agriculture but to the whole country.  This is another example of Fianna Fáil somersaulting and it is being done purely for political motives.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Smith was introducing the Bill, he is reported in column 887 as saying:</P>
    <P>There have been considerable changes in recent times, notably in the emergence of new voluntary rural organisations, the extension of the co-operative movement, the growth of the educational and advisory services and the development of new techniques and ideas generally.  There can hardly be any doubt that committees of agriculture would benefit from some members drawn from the voluntary rural organisations and the co-operative movement or from among prominent local individuals who for one reason or another do not wish to stand for election to the county council.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask what has happened since.  If the county council elections were held, as they should have been held, in 1965, Deputy Smith's Bill would now be in operation and half the representatives on the county committees of agriculture would be from outside bodies, which would be a good <Col N="104" /> idea.  Has the Minister changed his views or does he hold today the same views as Deputy Smith held in 1964 as regards the voluntary rural organisations in this country?  Does he not admit that they have done good work in this country?  Does he not believe that they are entitled to recognition on the county committees of agriculture?</P>
    <P>What we want in this country today is not bitterness, is not fighting, is not quarrelling.  We may be on the eve of making a most momentous decision, the decision to enter the Common Market.  Our county committees of agriculture, if properly formed, can play a useful part and can have a useful place.  As Deputy Smith stated at that time, in those organisations there are men of ability and men who have proved themselves as farmers but, to be quite truthful, as Deputy Tully stated, the majority of our committees of agriculture are composed of politicians and if there are outsiders on them they are there as a consolation prize because they were defeated political candidates and, in many cases, of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It would be much better if we had Deputy Smith's Bill here now and 50 per cent of the people outsiders.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to point out to the Minister that what is needed at the present time more than ever in this country is for the hand of friendship of the Minister for Agriculture to be extended to the rural voluntary organisations.  I would point out to the Minister that he can build a solid foundation in this country on co-operation and on extending the hand of friendship and that the sooner he does it the better.  Instead of extending the hand of friendship, instead of asking the rural voluntary organisations to co-operate, as we should ask them and as we should give them responsibility on these committees, the Minister is making certain now or is at least trying to make certain as far as he possibly can that after 28th June when the county councils are elected the members of the county council will not elect to these bodies members of the National Farmers Association or similar organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith continued:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> I believe that the time has come to re-shape our legislation so that persons who are not members of county councils but who are playing a leading part in the improvement of our agriculture, and in raising our rural living standards, will have a greater opportunity to participate in the membership of committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not now believe that these people in rural Ireland who are members of farming organisations, who give of their time voluntarily to co-operate with the officials of the Department, who co-operate with agricultural instructors, who organise classes for agricultural instruction, should receive some little recognition? He seems to differ in his opinion from that held by Deputy Patrick Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture in 1964.  Instead of showing any little recognition for their voluntary labours and voluntary work over the years the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is now about to shove them out into the cold.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith, in the speech from which I have been quoting, continued:</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the change now proposed will bring to committees a new source of inspiration and strength and that it will lead to a more general acceptance of the educational and advisory services by the rural community.</P>
    <P>Let us admit this.  The farmers of Ireland are supposed to be conservative in outlook and lacking in initiative. That charge is made against them but I do not believe it.  Due to the fact that for 700 years we were dominated by a foreign power, inspectors and instructors, and others perhaps, were supposed to be attached to that foreign power.  For a long number of years, it was virtually impossible to get our farmers to avail of the agricultural services provided by the State. Voluntary organisations such as Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuithe, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the National Farmers Association have done great work over the years <Col N="106" /> in breaking down that barrier that existed for so long.  Because those people did such gallant work over the past few years they are entitled to recognition from the Minister and certainly he should not have interfered with Deputy Smith's Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that when Deputy Smith was introducing his Bill in 1964 he was even thinking of giving their organisations direct representation: he had that in mind.  As reported at columns 1355 and 1356 of the Seanad Debates, Volume 57, No. 16, Deputy Smith said:</P>
    <P>While I am suggesting the rural organisations and the co-operative movement as a likely source of suitable members for committees of agriculture, I have not found it practical to provide in this Bill for giving them direct representation, although I have given a great deal of thought to the matter.</P>
    <P>Here was a Minister with long years of experience as a member of a public body who was even thinking at that time of giving these organisations direct representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time.  Fianna Fáil are very fond of speaking of collective responsibility.  I dare say that this question and similar questions were discussed at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting at that particular time. I should like to know if Deputy Blaney then voiced his opinions against giving them direct representation.</P>
    <P>Further in his speech on that occasion, Deputy Smith said:</P>
    <P>I hope, however, that county councils will keep the rural organisations and the co-operative movement in mind when choosing members for committees, and that this broadening of membership will lead to a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>No matter what we may have said about Deputy Smith in the past, let us admit that here was a very good idea. There was a very good idea in the Minister's mind at that particular time. He wanted to broaden the membership <Col N="107" /> because it would lead to a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the country.  He recognised and knew the valuable work being done by these organisations.  He wanted to give them responsibility on the committees so that there could be and would be a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the length and breadth of this country. We have had that over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister's new legislation may put an end to the co-operation we have had in the past between the county committees of agriculture and the instructors of the various agricultural organisations.  Why should people slave for years at voluntary work, as they did, only to find that, instead of some kind of recognition as Deputy Smith was prepared to give them in his Bill, instead of the hand of friendship, the present attitude of the Minister, Deputy Blaney? Deputy Smith's attitude was: &ldquo;We welcome the work you have done and thank every one of you for it.  We will give you a bit of responsibility and make you a more important member of the community than you have been in the past.  Because you have been a good member of the community and have given voluntary service we shall see that you will be placed on the agricultural committees.&rdquo; Not so with Deputy Blaney, our present Minister for Agriculture.  He wants to keep the fight alive.  He should admit that when the Department of Agriculture were dragging their feet about warble fly eradication, the NFA, the CMSA and voluntary organisations started it in this country and only when it was a year or two in operation did the Department take it up and proceed to administer it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Clinton has said, this is a retrograde section.  The Minister should reconsider his opinion and should have more regard for the voluntary organisations in this country.  Even at this late stage he should put agriculture before his political ideas and ideals because that is what he is trying to put through this House at the <Col N="108" /> present time.  His own petty jealousies have got the better of him because Donegal Fair was a success and now he wants to do anything he can to &ldquo;down&rdquo; these people.</P>

      <P>It would be a wonderful achievement if Deputy L'Estrange practised what he preaches.  We must be candid about this amendment and not try to see in it drastic changes which are in fact not involved at all. The Deputy waxed eloquent about the type of member he would like to see making up the composition of agricultural committees but I should like to ask the Deputy if he had his way, either in Westmeath or Longford, what representation would he give to outsiders on the various subsidiary committees making up the local authority, in view of the fact that he advised his own Party in Longford County Council to disfranchise the elected members of that local authority from all the committees?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently we are now debating a political matter.  It should not be political but on the floor of this House, it is being related to politics and the Deputy goes far outside the scope of the Bill and seeks to drag in the NFA. The Deputy has dragged in the NFA in this House in the same fashion as a dog worrying a bone.  He has dragged it on to every platform in the country and he has made it a bone of contention in his own constituency.  The Minister stated, when introducing the <Col N="109" /> Bill, that he sought the advice of various committees, of the General Council of County Councils, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, and of various other committees for agriculture.  It is a matter of opinion whether Deputy Smith's 1964 amendment was correct in the circumstances or not.  It is open to the fullest debate whether it would work in practice or not.  Certainly if Deputy L'Estrange had power on any county council, seeing what he did in the past in regard to disfranchising the elected members, I would have no&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact that the 1964 amendment made it mandatory on county councils to co-opt 50 per cent non-elected members to committees of agriculture did not indicate that the scheme would work out in practice. It was never tried because of course since then we have not had local elections.  As far as I know, there was nothing in the 1931 Act, the parent Act, to prevent any committee of agriculture from co-opting any non-elected member, nothing to preclude a committee from exercising its right to bring on to the committee someone deemed to have a long experience in the field of agriculture.  This being so, I submit nothing drastic is being done here unless it is to rescind what Deputy Smith proposed doing in 1964 and Deputy Smith's intention in 1964 was never put into practice.  Certainly from my experience of county councils I submit it would not work out in practice.</P>
      <P>Of course the reason members of the Fine Gael Party are making such a song and dance about this matter is simply that there are local elections in the offing and of course the Fine Gael Party are trying to make hay while the sun is shining.  However, it should be made clear to the House and to the country that the lowliest committee of agriculture is quite at liberty &mdash;even if this Bill becomes an Act&mdash;to co-opt anyone it wishes to co-opt on to the management of the committee.</P>
      <P>When we talk about the expertise or the lack of expertise which may exist on the committees as a result of the enactment of this Bill, if it is enacted, we must consider the fact that people elected on to these committees are not supposed to be experts.  The committee has its own expert personnel to advise it on any occasion on any particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use, therefore, in trying to confuse this whole issue and in trying to throw dust in the eyes of the House, or in the eyes of townspeople who may not fully understand the position, or to suggest that anything being done here is unconstitutional, in any way wrong, or inhibits the power of any committee to co-opt anybody it likes.  We should make that point very <Col N="111" /> clear.  It is possibly a coincidence that this amendment is being brought in while the local elections are in progress. It is, therefore, I suppose, an opportunity for Members of this House to try to take advantage of the political aspect of the whole matter.  On numerous occasions the Minister has made it quite clear that there was no political ambiguity.</P>
    <P>We must consider another point. Why should this House, or Deputy Smith, or any other Deputy, seek to make it mandatory on any committee to co-opt on to its management 50 per cent of non-elected members, half of any committee?  After all, there is enough comment at the moment on members of local authorities.  Being in the public eye, I suppose members of local authorities expect this and withstand or try to withstand fair and foul comment at times.</P>
    <P>It is not up to us in this House to advocate the disfranchisement from membership of committees of agriculture of 50 per cent or half the membership of any county council.  They must stand for membership of the local authorities and weather the storm coming, as it were, to become elected members of the premier authority, the county council.  If they are selected, they are entitled to act as members of any of the subsidiary committees.  In this context I submit it is not up to members of the House, or any Minister, to say who will or who will not serve on a local committee.  In fairness, it should be left to the premier body, the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about experts. Sometimes the more I see of experts, and the more I hear from them, the more confused I become.  Any member of a county council is entitled to serve on any of these committees, in my submission. He should not be inhibited from doing so by legislation passed by this House.  That does not mean that the county council, if left to their own judgement, cannot co-opt and should not be able to co-opt, under the parent legislation, anyone deemed to have special experience or long experience in agricultural matters.  This provision in no way inhibits this factor.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter in his reference to Deputy L'Estrange's strong Party feelings and strong loyalties has helped to make our case.  I have no doubt that what he says is correct, and that in the present situation if Deputy L'Estrange found himself in the position described by Deputy Carter, he would certainly ensure that only Fine Gael people would be brought in on these committees.  He would do this because he knows that wherever Fianna Fáil have a majority throughout the country, they do exactly that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not; it does not apply to ours either.  Generally speaking, it does apply.  The fact that Deputy L'Estrange is prepared to have this discipline placed upon himself and members of his Party, indicates that he is quite sincere in trying to ensure that people who have a real contribution to make are not excluded from these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is&mdash;and Deputy Carter knows it&mdash;that in the majority of county councils, Fianna Fáil have a majority, and therefore, there is no question of ensuring that the outsiders would be Fine Gael.  It is quite evident that so long as Party politics can intervene, it will intervene on the side of the politicians and if they bring in outsiders, they will make sure that they are of a certain Party political persuasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that most of the agricultural organisations have rules and regulations prohibiting their leading members from taking an active part in politics.  That automatically excludes them.  For that reason alone, we should ensure that these people can get a place on the committees of agriculture.  There is no doubt that organised farming has done an immense <Col N="113" /> amount to advance agriculture in recent years.  If it did nothing else, it provided a platform for our agricultural instructors, who heretofore failed to get a sufficient number of people together to talk to them. Muintir na Tíre, the NFA, the ICMSA, and all the rural organisations have got people to come to meetings, and they have got the experts in various fields of advisory work to talk to them. In that way the knowledge and advice of these people were disseminated and spread amongst the people.  Thought and consideration are given to scientific farming in a way never previously achieved.  This played an extremely important part and because of the fact that the rules excluded members from taking part in politics, they should not be excluded from making their contribution on the committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Their decision to exclude Party politics was wise for such organisations. On that account I think this legislation is wrong.  It cannot escape the suspicion that is is aimed at organised agricultural groups and not towards any other purpose.  The fact that we have five committees of agriculture with no outsiders proves this point.  It is sufficient to indicate that the case has been made for the retention of the legislation which Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture, in his wisdom, felt it was necessary and advisable to bring in.  I hope the Minister will not persist in going ahead with this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We supported this Bill in 1964 because we believed with Fianna Fáil and Labour that it was a glorious opportunity to take county committees of agriculture out of the realm of purely Party politics.  As reported in the Official Report of the Seanad Debates of 1st July, 1964, volume 57, column 1368, Deputy Smith said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did have in mind one thing, and I believe many people have it in mind in common with me.  County committees of agriculture, in the main, did not seem to be serving the purpose they were intended to serve as well as one would like them to. <Col N="114" /> They did not appear to have the confidence of the people, the degree of confidence they would require to be successful in their work.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask why.  Because there were too many party hacks on the county committees of agriculture. Deputy Carter has made certain accusations against me.  He said I advised my Party to disfranchise Fianna Fáil members.  As far as Longford was concerned, I had nothing to do with them good, bad or indifferent in 1960.  I did not visit the county at that time.  Whatever they did was their own business.  As far as Westmeath is concerned, although Fianna Fáil are in a minority in the county council, they have fair representation on the county committee of agriculture, the mental hospital committee and other committees.  In justice to Deputy Smith, he knew what was going on at the time.  Where Fianna Fáil have an overall majority, nobody else gets a showing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who are first class farmers have been voted off county committees of agriculture simply and solely because they were not members of the Fianna Fáil Party. Take Clare, where Fianna Fáil have a majority on the council.  There are three Fianna Fáil representatives to the General Council of County Councils and three Fianna Fáil representatives to the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  Take Galway, where they also have a majority.  There are three Fianna Fáil men as representatives to the General Council of County Councils and three Fianna Fáil men to the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  No opposition man gets a look in.  Take Meath, where Fianna Fáil had an overall majority the last time.  There are three Fianna Fáil men as representatives to the General Council of County Councils and two Fianna Fáil men along with the CAO to the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1964 Deputy Smith knew what was going on the length and breadth <Col N="115" /> of Ireland.  He knew in his heart that where Fianna Fáil had a majority on a county council or a county committee of agriculture, they did not give a thraneen what brains or ability other people might have but put on their own members to the exclusion of every other section.  He believed at that time that in the interests of agriculture, our principal industry, it was time to take this matter out of the realm of Party politics and to give to the members of rural organisations a slight place in the sun by giving them some responsibility and recompense for their voluntary work.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the present Minister, for party political motives, is now amending that Bill.  We would appeal to him even at this late stage, in the interest of agriculture, co-operation and unity, in the interest of bringing together all farmers' organisations to work for better agricultural conditions, to forget his petty Party politics and agree to the Bill introduced only three short years ago by Deputy Smith.  I assume there was collective responsibility in the Fianna Fáil Party at that time.  If there was, both Deputy Carter and Deputy Blaney were then in favour of that Bill, giving representation to rural and voluntary organisations.  Neither has convinced us that there is good reason for their somersault since 1964.  This House and the country are demanding to know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We do make our decisions collectively, not like the Deputy's Party.  The reason I gave was that in the interim since the passing of this Act two or three years ago, we have had renewed representation from the county councils, the county committees of agriculture, the General Council of County Councils and the General Council of County Committees <Col N="116" /> of Agriculture that the 1964 amendment was not a good thing.  I do not believe it was a good thing and that is why I am here seeking to remedy that situation and to bring us back at least to where we were.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the amendment of 1964, as it stands, to give any member of a rural organisation the slightest right to go on a county committee of agriculture.  As I said the other day, those who select these committees are quite free at the moment to select all outsiders, with the exception of one man, who must be a councillor.  That is all the law requires.  If they see the right people on the horizon&mdash;and there must be right people even in political Parties, despite the fact it seems to be fashionable in Fine Gael to have people who do not belong to any political Party&mdash;they are not precluded from selecting them.  I have had queer experience of these people Fine Gael say have no political Party.  They do not have any politics until the time comes when it counts.  Then they are Fine Gael.  This is the experience I have had in my county since I was small. Fine Gael bring along the most impartial people.  They do not have anything to do with politics.  Politics are not big enough for them.  But when it comes down to some skulduggery Fine Gael want to participate in, do you find them supporters of Fianna Fáil or Labour?  No, they will be Fine Gael supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own county, where for most of the past 20 years we have had a fair say in what committees are elected, our system has been that the membership of committees is selected on a proportional representative basis as between the various interests and parties represented on the county council.  That system has proved a sane and sensible one and has worked quite well.  If Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael want to bring on outsiders in their representation, that is their business.  If they want to have it all councillors, that is still their business.  As I say, this has worked quite well and it certainly does not preclude anybody from being a member of a county committee of agriculture if any person on the council wishes to bring him on.  Such <Col N="117" /> people are certainly not kept off because of their politics.  This does not arise.  If that sensible organisation could work in Donegal for so long, I do not see why it cannot be adopted in other counties and work equally well.</P>
    <P>The point I want to get across is that the freedom which at the moment rests with councils to select their committees of agriculture allows them to put on all outsiders, apart from the one member who must be a council member.  That is all the obligation that is on them.  That being so, how can it be said that by repealing the 1964 amendment, we are, in fact, knocking off people who should be on?</P>
    <P>If there are people today who are entitled to be on or who should be on or who have more to contribute than those who are on, or members of councils, there is no reason why they should not have got on these committees, and if they are not on those committees today, even if the amendment of 1964 were to stand, there is no guarantee or assurance whatsoever that they will get on next month when the new committees are formed.</P>
    <P>Listening to the arguments against rescinding this, one would think that we were taking away some sort of right bestowed in 1964.  We are doing nothing of the sort.  We are merely reverting to what we have been practising up to the moment and I believe that what we have been practising, if practised properly, is as good a manner of composing committees of agriculture as any other and I do not agree that rural organisations and all farming organisations have earned the right to representation on these committees above and beyond the right of those who were elected by the people to be members of the county council or local authority concerned.  They have no more right.  This is what is being preached here today.  I do not concede that.</P>
    <P>There may be cases of persons who have something outstanding to contribute. If that is so, there is no reason why they cannot be brought on at the moment.  They can be brought on, to the exclusion of almost the entire county council membership.  If they <Col N="118" /> are prepared to give three or four days, as county councillors are prepared to give a dozen days in the year, when they might be doing something else, fair enough.  If there are these people, and there are such people, and there are some of them on committees of agriculture, there is nobody preventing them from going on in future.</P>
    <P>I want the House to realise that if we have, as we undoubtedly have, changed our minds about this matter, the change of mind is not doing away with some God-given right or something that we bestowed as a right in 1964.  It is merely reverting to present practice as against the practice proposed in this Bill which I do not think would have done any good in the long run and might indeed, have done harm and, to my mind, is a reflection in a sense, or in retrospect, could be said to be a reflection, on the ability of the elected members to choose the best committees to suit their own needs in each county.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange and others fear the reversion to the present status&mdash; because, remember, we are working now under the old Act of 1931 and not yet under the amendment of 1964. Those Deputies who fear this rescinding of the amendment of 1964 have only to look at the situation at the moment to realise that they have not much to fear because we have had this with us for a long time.  It is working in many other counties very successfully and will work very successfully in a great many counties in the future. The will to work successfully is the main thing, not how it is laid down that the committee shall be formed.</P>
    <P>To compel a council to put in 50 per cent outsiders does not in any way ensure a better committee, nor does it ensure that one of the people from any of the organisations enumerated by the Deputies opposite would find a place on those committees.  So, what is the point of the hullabaloo and blah-blah that goes on about what we are taking from them and the recognition we are now taking from them? They never had this recognition.  It is not bestowed by the amendment of 1964.  By rescinding that amendment, we are not worsening the position, <Col N="119" /> and if they are there&mdash;and they are there in places&mdash;they are recognised in many councils and there is no reason why they should not continue to be so and nothing that we are doing will prevent it.</P>
    <P>I do think that it is right and proper at this time, on the eve of the local elections, that we should let it be known, and should let the people running for local elections know, that this, the parent legislative body in the country, does have trust in those who are running for the local elections and that we believe they are capable people from whom the council will select and when elected by the people who will vote on 28th June, they are quite capable of selecting their own committees to run the agricultural services and the various other services which local authorities run.</P>
    <P>While there can be arguments about the pros and cons of this amendment, I still say that we have local representatives elected by the people and if we are not satisfied with them, we should change the system of local government election entirely.  If we are satisfied with it, then we must assume that the people selected and elected by voters in local elections are capable people who can be trusted to do the best job within their ability and that in regard to their sub-committees, committees of agriculture, vocational education committees, health committees and all the rest they have under our present system, given the freedom councils have been enioving up to now, they will do a good job.  We will not improve matters by imposing on them conditions as to how they should select or exclude persons for these committees.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that people who go on as nominees of political Parties are any less worthy or less useful on committees than others who may be picked from outside because they have no politics.  I have no regard for people who have no politics.  I do not think such people exist in any number. Those who proclaim that they have no politics are usually hypocrites or else have no interest in the community. They can have it whichever way they <Col N="120" /> like.  Usually it is only the oddbod who has no politics.  The majority of our people are vitally interested in politics. They may not publicly participate in politics but every last one of them is a politician and there is no point in a man saying he is not a politician who at the same time wants to participate in public affairs.  To me, the politician is a person who does participate in public affairs, and if these people who are holier than the rest of us because they have no politics want to have a part in public affairs, they must be in some way politicians.  If they claim not to be they are either hypocrites or have no interest in the community, and they have no place on county committees of any kind.  If they are politicians, then they are no better, and probably no worse, than the rest of us who are politicians.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this idea of setting the outsiders apart from those who are elected members of councils is not, to my mind, a good idea at all.  I do not think it would work out well Local elected representatives, regardless of Party, would be entitled to resent its being imposed on them that they would have to exclude their own members, good though they might be, from participation in these committees merely because we in this House say that they must put on 50 per cent outsiders.  If we were to put on 50 per cent outsiders, is there anybody in this House who would tell me that Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil or Labour or any other noted political group will put forward people who belong to a rural organisation as against a person who ran for election in the interests of the Party and who has a lot to contribute to the committee of agriculture? That freedom would still be there if we do not have this Bill at all.</P>
    <P>It is only natural to expect that the Fine Gael Party would in such circumstances choose the Fine Gael man because they know him and know his worth, what he can do, his ability. If he has something to contribute to the committee of agriculture, by all means put him on, even though he was beaten the week before in the local elections.  What is wrong with that?  If we were to exclude anybody beaten in <Col N="121" /> the local elections, we soon would have no competition for local elections and that would be a bad day for the local authorities.  What is wrong with putting on a man who has been beaten if he is a good man?  The fact that he has gone forward for election and was beaten does not write him down to the point where he cannot succeed against a man who will not stand at all, who, according to Fine Gael, even if he did stand, would not get in.  Surely the man who stands up and fights and loses has a lot to be said for him, regardless of what Party politics he may have, as against the fellow who says he has no politics but would like to be a member of the committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is an awful lot of sense following up these things, but it is well to have regard to the real essence of this little Bill here in which section 1 is about the only section; the other one does not matter a great deal.  We have had, as I say, a fairly good Second Reading on the Bill, and we have had a second Second Reading on it now.  I would say that this Bill repealing the 1964 amendment is a good one and, looking back on the time since then, I think we are doing the right thing, and I commend it to the House for that reason.</P>

      <P>Let us get to the essence of this.  The essence is very simple.  In 1964, the then Minister for Agriculture, with the approval of everybody in this House, desired to make a gesture of confidence and to speak a word of encouragement to voluntary agricultural organisations who did not actively participate in politics.  All of us in this House are politicians, and Harry Truman, a former President of the United States, spoke well when he said: &ldquo;If you cannot stand the heat, keep out of the kitchen.&rdquo; There are many people in this country who keep out of the kitchen because they cannot stand the heat, and yet have a very material contribution to make to the technical work of a body such as a county committee of agriculture.</P>

    <P>Here is the essence of this matter: in 1964, it was desired to secure, and it was hoped that it was possible to <Col N="122" /> secure, for the Department of Agriculture, whoever was Minister, the active co-operation of the voluntary bodies representative of the farming community, the NFA, the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  To that end, it was determined by a section of the 1964 Act that the county committees of agriculture whom Oireachtas Éireann set up should be required to incorporate in their numbers 50 per cent outsiders&mdash;persons who in the ordinary course might be described as those who had a contribution to make but who were not prepared to face the heat of politics or to take their part in public election.</P>
    <P>That was not all.  There was an element in our rural community which I certainly thought it was extremely important to get represented on the county committees of agriculture.  I wanted to see agriculture workers on the county committee of agriculture. I thought it was a desirable thing that in some organisation we should have farmers and their workers sitting side by side, having thrust upon them by us, the Oireachtas, the realisation of the fact that it was the common interest of all who participated in agriculture to do their best to make a success of it and to ensure that all who participated in it got an equitable share of the return.</P>
    <P>Now the situation is changed.  The plain truth of this is that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Blaney, has engaged in an acrimonious and, I think, insane, personal vendetta with the NFA.  The Leader of the Government to which he belongs, Deputy Lynch, is frantically trying to put an end to that vendetta.  The Minister for Agriculture is concerned to perpetuate it, and he is concerned to perpetuate it because he has got the detestable idea into his head that it is a good thing to split the farmers into rival organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the purpose of this Bill.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Let us <Col N="123" /> get to the essence of it&rdquo;, and the essence of it is that in 1964 the Government of which he was a member decided it was a good thing to make a gesture of recognition to voluntary farmers' organisations.  In 1967, the Minister for Agriculture wishes to go on notice that whatever the Taoiseach said, whatever gesture the Taoiseach makes to restore harmonious relation between the Department of Agriculture and the voluntary farmers' organisations, he, the Minister for Agriculture, is determined to reverse a decision made by the Government of which he himself was a member, to reverse the decision for which every member of his Party voted three short years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister is concerned in the least degree with the ultimate quality of the county committees of agriculture.  What he wants to do is to ensure that his vendetta against the NFA will be carried on. That is folly.  This House heard Deputy O'Higgins, who I think made a very profound speech on the Estimate, when he said how wrong it was, even in regard to the remedying of grievances, to break the law, how wrong it was to set at defiance the law of one's own country.  But then he went on to say: &ldquo;Strongly as I deprecate that not only for its essential wrongness but for its futility, I much more strongly condemn the individual who provokes them to do that.&rdquo; In my considered judgement&mdash;and I know whereof I speak &mdash;this Bill, the Committee Stage of which we are now discussing, was brought into this House for the purpose of provoking the NFA.  That is coming to the essence of the matter. This Bill was brought in to say: &ldquo;That is what I think of the NFA&rdquo;. There could be no other reason for its introduction at this time; and either the Minister has taken leave of his senses or else he is a much more evil person than I believe him to be, because certainly the interpretation that will be put on that Bill is that the Minister is concerned to provoke the NFA into further activity of a kind which will command the sympathy of no responsible public man in this <Col N="124" /> country.  I deplore the invocation by the NFA or by anybody else of breaches of the law for the purpose of promoting what they believe to be their legitimate interests.</P>

      <P>And which will be debated again, please God, before this day is done.  I implore Deputies to turn their minds from irrelevancies.  That is the essence of this Bill.  No rational Legislature would do anything else but give the decision taken as recently as three years ago a chance to function and, if it did not function satisfactorily, a rational Legislature would then come back to the House and say: &ldquo;Look, this has not worked; we will revert to the old system, which gave satisfactory results.&rdquo; But that is not what we are doing here.  The 1964 Act was so drafted that it did not come into operation until after the next local election.  That was to be held in 1965. It was postponed to 1967.  I am directing the House to the essence of this matter.  This Bill has no purpose other than to provoke and exacerbate the situation, a situation the Taoiseach has sought to end.  I do not know what kind of Government we have at the present moment.  They are supposed to speak and act with a corporate voice and mind.  I detect in them at the present time two rival factions&mdash;one concerned to promote discord in a rather disedifying internal struggle for power and the other, represented by the Taoiseach, trying to restore normalcy in the appropriate relations between voluntary bodies and the Department of State primarily concerned with their interests and affairs. If the Minister is neither mad nor evil, he will drop this Bill.  If ambition has driven him mad, or the desire for revenge has made him evil, he will pursue it.</P>

      <P>Before we let that waffle go unchallenged, I think I had better say something.  There is no division in the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Deputy will be sorry to hear that. There is no scramble for power.  There is no trying to oust the present Taoiseach. Far from it: he is our Leader, elected by us and recognised by all of us.  That is more than can be said for Fine Gael now, in the recent past, or in the Coalition Government.  That is the way it has been in Fianna Fáil. That is the way it always will be and no amount of wishful thinking on the <Col N="126" /> part of Deputy Dillon will alter that fact one whit.  The driving of wedges, which has been the sole preoccupation of Fine Gael for the past six, seven, eight or nine months has been their own undoing.  In actual fact, it is into their own Party they drive the wedges every time they hit them a smack, but they do not realise this, and I suppose I am a fool to point it out to them.  I do not want anybody to be misled by the sort of talk to which we have just listened.  This is a figment of Deputy Dillon's imagination, put across as only Deputy Dillon knows how to put it across.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been represented as portraying a vendetta by me against the NFA, my revenge on the NFA, keeping the trouble with the NFA going.  Would someone in Fine Gael, or in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> someone who has not much to do, find out who has been provoking whom for the past nine months?  Who, since I became Minister for Agriculture, has been doing the provoking and the propaganda? Who has been filling the papers, the journals, the magazines, and everything else day after day, week after week and month after month? It has all been coming from one quarter.  Not from this side of the House, not from the Minister for Agriculture and not from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking about provoking the NFA is a new lark by the Fine Gael Party, a Party who have been crawling along in the shadow of this dispute, not knowing whether to go with the dispute or against it, not knowing whether to join openly in it or stay out of it, but all the time niggling away, hoping it will not be settled, hoping that in some way Fine Gael might get some little political crumbs off the table. This has been the role of Fine Gael right through.  I am not talking now about the recent peace offerings.  I am talking about the earlier ones when, on the verge of peace on one occasion, it did not suit Fine Gael that there should be peace and they did not hesitate to let certain people in the organisation know that it did not suit.  There was another occasion on which, in fact, peace was about to be made and certain people in Fine Gael said: &ldquo;We <Col N="127" /> can do better than that for you; do not settle on those terms.&rdquo; And the dispute continued.  It suits Fine Gael. This is the way in which Fine Gael hope to survive.  I have no objection to them doing these things, provided they do not try to make it appear that it is someone else who is causing all the trouble.  I have restrained myself day after day, week after week and month after month, because I look forward to the time when the NFA will again play a part in the interests of the farmers, the part their organisation was set up to play.</P>

Fine Gael are today obviously afraid that peace is coming and they are trying to stir things up again.  Let them raise rows. The public will see who raised them. Let us have no more of this talk because it is not true that there is any provocation or desire for revenge.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to set a good example and I want to keep to the Bill.  The Minister has sought to make the point that we on this side of the House want to make a case that the 1931 legislation excluded the selection of people outside the membership of the county councils.  We made no such case.  We know it is possible for the members of these councils to select whom they like but we also know what actually happened.  We know, as the Minister has stated, that five county councils refused to do that and that for Party political reasons, they refused to select anybody who was not a member of these county councils. This is itself is sufficient justification for our attitude to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a point that even if we did allow the 1964 legislation to stand, it would not ensure that people from the various agricultural groups would get representation.  That is true.  That was the great regret of the then Minister; it was the great regret expressed by Deputy Tully, and it was the great regret of Fine Gael that it was not possible for the then Minister for Agriculture to find a way to ensure that these organised groups would, in fact, get representation.  It was a matter of regret that the Minister was unable to find a way of ensuring that these groups would get representation. That was the intention of <Col N="129" /> the legislation and Deputy Smith said that he would make it a point to ask the various local authorities to bear this in mind and he said that the only reason he had not tied it up was his fear of narrowing down the description of the persons who could serve, to the detriment of these committees, people such as schoolteachers and farm workers.  That was the regret that was expressed then.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong to say that the Minister has got representations in this matter from the General Council of County Councils and from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture and that is a good reason for it.  The members of these bodies are all county councillors and are all politicians. Inevitably the majority membership is Fianna Fáil.  I am a member of both bodies and I forget when the representations were made, whom they were made to and how many members voted for them.  I suspect strongly that it was Fianna Fáil politicians who made the representations, if the Minister has such representations.  A point made by the then Minister when the 1964 legislation was going through was that he had sought the advice of these two bodies and that while they were not 100 per cent satisfied he had got general agreement from them. What has happened since then to change the minds of these people? We have been told that representations have been made but we have not been told in what way and what sort of majority made them.  I think that is important I will not go back on the various other points as Deputy Dillon has put them to the House in stark reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see what is the objection to this Bill.  I have seen that General Council of Committees of Agriculture and I have seen Deputy Clinton and Deputy L'Estrange very active on it.  They are not politicians at all, I suppose.  They are not politicians at all in the way we look at politicians of the present day.  I have served for 43 years as a member of a county council and for 43 years as a member of a county committee of agriculture. I have seen men there of all Parties <Col N="130" /> and our county council could fill every seat on our county committee of agriculture with farmers' representatives from its own elected representatives. There is no man going to tell me that Deputy McAuliffe or Deputy Michael Pat Murphy could not take their place on any committee of agriculture, or that Senator D.J. O'Sullivan could not do so.  No one can tell me that these men do not know what the agricultural community want, just as well as anybody from outside, and they are elected by the people.</P>
      <P>You are a politician if you go up and have the confidence of your people to elect you but if you go up and are beaten, you are not a politician at all, no matter what Party you stand for. That is a fairly strong committee, the County Committee of Cork County Council.  We have, divided up between us, so many representatives of the Labour Party, so many representatives of Fine Gael, so many representatives of the Farmers' Party and so many representatives of Fianna Fáil: that is the way it is composed.  Our Party, in their wisdom, picked out good farmers, farmers with a decent record, farmers in farmers' organisations, and put them on that committee as well as themselves, and always did.  But this thing of a Bill providing that 50 per cent of the members are to be composed of boys from outside and only 50 per cent are to be elected representatives is so idiotic that I have never heard the like of it in my life and I am talking here quite frankly about it.  How it slipped through this House, I do not know.  I promise you that if I had been here, I would have opposed it even if I had had to do so on my own.</P>

      <P>Have a look.  Deputy Clinton and Deputy L'Estrange make me laugh.  I bet you that Deputy L'Estrange is a member of the county committee of agriculture of whatever county to which he belongs, and so is Deputy Clinton.  I am sure they would not vacate their seats on the county committee of agriculture to make room for anybody else.  What is all the noise about, then?  I think that at present about seven of our representatives on <Col N="131" /> the county committee of agriculture are men brought in from the farming community.  The late Senator O'Callaghan was chairman of our committee for a long number of years. You have men who are not on the county council but men who are in this Dáil from the Opposition side and men in the Seanad from the Opposition side.  You have them, when they are not members of the county council, brought in by the different Parties there.  Each Party can nominate from their own ranks or bring them in from outside.  On occasions, we have brought them in from outside.  They could not come in without the goodwill of all the members of the county council and of the county committee of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Mr. P.D. Lehane, who was secretary of the Cork Farmers Association for a long number of years, was a member of the county council for a few years and was a Member of this House for a few years.  I have never seen Mr. P.D. Lehane out of Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  He is put on it every year just for his farming knowledge, just as the late Senator William O'Callaghan was put on it on the same basis and just as Senator Ted O'Sullivan is on it on the same basis, none of the three members being members of the county council.  Do we now propose to go back on that state of affairs?  If this amendment had not been introduced, I should have had no scruples about doing what I wanted to do under those circumstances.  I get plenty of men who were not members of the county council and bring them in and nobody could stop me under the old Bill: nobody could prevent me from doing so.  To my mind, the whole thing is a bottle of smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see elected representatives here suggesting that 50 per cent of the members here should be picked from outside, from the fellows who have not got the guts to go up, and that they should be brought in here to make the laws.  They want 50 per cent of county committees of agriculture to be composed of people from outside the elected county council representatives.  I ask Deputy Clinton to stand up openly and <Col N="132" /> to say that he is willing to give his seat on the county committee of agriculture to anybody else: he would not.  It would be a strange thing for a budding Minister for Agriculture if he felt he was not competent to sit on the county committee of agriculture.</P>

      <P>These are the matters I should like considered before we proceed any further.  We should see what all the noise is about.  If the Labour Party find they have another good man whom they want to bring in, they can do so with the goodwill and the good wishes of all the members of the county committees of agriculture and he can be co-opted by the county council on to it.  If the Fine Gael Party find they have some farmer who is not completely tainted with Deputy Dillon's brush, then he will get in there too.  If we find we have a good man, we do not care to what Party he belongs, but we shall bring him in and give him his seat and he will be there with full co-operation.</P>
      <P>We want to have democracy in this country.  Democracy depends on the votes of the people in the first instance. If there is any genius outside who thinks he would be of assistance or help in agriculture, let him stand for the county council and be put on and take his chance.  Let him work on that line.  The idea of individuals who are too grand to sit on a county council and who would not go through the indignity of putting themselves up before the people for election but who will afterwards go into the county committees of agriculture is nonsensical. I am absolutely in favour of the Minister's amendment.  It is high time the matter were checked and finished before it does any harm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this section is to go back to the 1931 method of electing committees of agriculture and to confer on county councils the right to elect committees of agriculture composed entirely of county council members, if they think fit.  In 1931, we had not got politics entering into local government <Col N="133" /> to the same extent as we have today. As a matter of fact, it could be said that in 1931 local bodies were largely non-political and public spirited men were elected to county councils, indeed, as they are today, but the same degree of politics did not enter into the picture and politics was not the sole qualification.  That system was in existence for over 30 years and the Minister for Agriculture of the day, and his Government, decided in 1964 to change the system, for some reason best known to themselves.  We should ask ourselves at this stage why the Minister for Agriculture in 1964, and the Government of which he was a member, decided to make it obligatory on county councils to elect to committees of agriculture at least 50 per cent noncounty councillors.  It is a pity that precedent seems to have ordained that retired Ministers do not take part in discussions in this House while the Government of which they were once members is in existence because I should like to hear Deputy Smith in this debate.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Smith was putting through his Bill in 1964, he made a case by which he was able to convince the members of the Oireachtas that it was wise to put through the 1964 Bill and the Bill went through largely as an agreed measure.  One significant thing the Minister for Agriculture said then, and which has not been discussed very much here, was that Deputy Smith and his advisers were not satisfied that the committees of agriculture as then constituted were doing a good job of work.  At column 1368 of Volume 57 of the Seanad Debates for July 1st, 1964 Deputy Smith said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can say to the Seanad that I did not look at this matter with any hostility towards elected representatives or members of Parties in local bodies.  I did have in mind one thing, and I believe many people have it in mind in common with me. County committees of agriculture, in the main, did not seem to be serving the purpose they were intended to serve as well as one would like them to.  They did not appear to have the confidence of the people, <Col N="134" /> the degree of confidence they would require to be successful in their work.  I am not saying all this lack of confidence was justified, but it is true to say that it existed.</P>
    <P>That is the case Deputy Smith made for bringing in his measure, that the committees of agriculture as then constituted were not doing a good job of work.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he agrees with that suggestion. I take it he does not agree with it now. I should like to know whether he agreed with what his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture of the day, put on the records of these Houses in 1964, and if he agreed with Deputy Smith then, what change has come about in the self-same committees of agriculture which were serving then, and which are serving now, to change his mind.  It is important that we should not be chasing hares and we should discuss that net point to begin with, whether the committees of agriculture have done a good job of work, whether they have the complete confidence of the country or not.  As I say, Deputy Smith, and presumably the Government of which he was a member, did not think in 1964 they had.</P>
    <P>What was Deputy Smith's remedy? Deputy Smith's remedy was to broaden the membership, to get new blood in the committees of agriculture, if possible to get people into the committees of agriculture who, while they might have politics, would not be what I would describe as politicians, a totally different thing.  Deputy Smith also said something which is very significant.  He gave us the disease, or the fault, that the committees were not doing a good job of work, and by way of making a case for the remedy he said at column 134 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>I agree that with the great changes which have taken place in rural circumstances since this provision was originally framed over 30 years ago, a change in the requirements for membership of committees is now called for.  I have particularly in mind the emergence of voluntary rural organisations, the extension of <Col N="135" /> the co-operative movement, the growth of the educational and advisory services and the development of new farming techniques generally. It goes without saying that committees of agriculture would derive considerable advantage from the inclusion in their membership of suitable persons from the voluntary rural organisations and the co-operative movement, and also local individuals prominent in the practice of farming or development of agriculture.  There are undoubtedly progressive persons in every county who could make a worthwhile contribution to the work of committees of agriculture but who, for one reason or another, are unwilling to stand for election to the county council.  I consider it desirable that such persons should have a greater opportunity to become members of committees of agriculture. With this objective in view, section 2 (1) (a) of this Bill provides that where a committee of agriculture consists of an even number of members the number of councillors shall not exceed the number of non-councillors, and, where the committee consists of an odd number, the number of councillors shall not exceed the numbers of non-councillors by more than one.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Smith's remedy.  I am not being unfair to him when I say that if he could have found a formula for giving direct representation to the voluntary rural organisations, he would have written it into the 1964 Act.  His whole speech means that he was encouraging voluntary rural organisations to get on to committees of agriculture and that if he and his advisers could have found a way of giving them direct representation, he would have done so because at column 1381 of the same volume, where he was referring to his efforts to give direct representation to voluntary organisation, he said:</P>
    <P>I say that we have tried this.  The organisations themselves have discussed this matter with us.  They appreciate fully what is involved in <Col N="136" /> it.  I know that what is proposed here will not give any firm assurance that a certain thing will happen, but I am prepared to attribute to the elected representatives, in the main, a fair share of judgment and a sense of fair play.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The better the organisations are organised in the districts, the more likely they are to make themselves felt with the county councils in securing representation.  If they have not the standard of organisation, it is their fault.  They have often claimed to me to have, and I am now going to put them to the test and say: &ldquo;You can get 50 per cent one way or another.  It is for you to go after public men and to ensure that you will&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He was saying they ought to have 50 per cent non-councillors on these committees.  He was saying to the rural organisation: &ldquo;Go after the councillors and get your fair share; get 50 per cent if you can.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to any suggestion that politics is a dirty business or that, because people are elected on a political basis, they are automatically unsuited for serving on a committee of agriculture.  What I am saying is this: there are many fine first-class farmers throughout the length and breadth of Ireland who have a lot to contribute to agriculture, and who could make a valuable contribution on committees of agriculture, but who have not the personal make-up, the personality or the desire to get involved in public contests.</P>
    <P>If those men were drafted on to committees of agriculture, they would do two things, in my respectful opinion. They would make a worthwhile contribution on matters purely agricultural, and they would tend, at the same time, to remove from those committees the political atmosphere we find there too often, unfortunately. They would assess matters and approach things on an independent line, not a political line.  This was the case made in 1964, and I do not think the Minister has made a convincing <Col N="137" /> case here that what was done in 1964 was wrong.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> At column 1354 of the same volume, Deputy Smith said:</P>
      <P>In practice, the proportion of non-councillors on committees of agriculture varies considerably from one county to another; some county councils tend to confine membership to councillors while others have shown a more liberal outlook towards the appointment of non-councillors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith wanted to get at the county councils which were not liberal, the county councils which were confining representation to members of the county councils.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister said there are five and he has more facilities at his disposal for checking than I have.  I believe that by electing non-councillors to committees of agriculture, you are getting a wider section of the community interested in public affairs, getting a wider cross-section of the community interested in the advisory services of the Department of Agriculture, and ensuring that it is unlikely that the committees will be composed entirely of active politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister protested that it is unfair to accuse him of introducing this Bill for the purpose of disfranchising the NFA.  He says it is unfair to accuse him of introducing this measure as another step in his attack on the NFA.  All I can say is that when Deputy Smith was introducing the 1964 measure, he made his case on the basis that he was introducing a measure to get more representation from rural organisations such as the NFA, the Irish Country Women's Association, the ICMSA, and so on, <Col N="138" /> on the committees of agriculture.  That was the case made by Deputy Smith and I invite anyone to read the debates and contradict me.</P>
    <P>Surely if the Minister here to-day is repealing Deputy Smith's measure, he is trying to undo what Deputy Smith was trying to do.  In other words, he is trying to go back to the old system whereby rural organisations had not got fair representation, as such, on those bodies.  Apart from the other arguments I put forward, it is a pity that the Minister should do that at this particular time.  It is not in the interests of peace, not in the interests of harmony.  It is not in the interests of the agricultural community or the voluntary organisations which, according to the former Minister, had grown up between 1931 and 1964, and which had according to his thinking and his advice, such a valuable contribution to make to the advisory services and to the local committees of agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister informed us to-night that since the passing of this Act he had got the views of the General Council of County Councils and the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture, and that in their view, what the Government did in 1964 was not a good thing. I am a member of both bodies, the General Council of County Councils and the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  It is a well-known fact that they are composed of politicians.  Naturally, those politicians are jealous of their rights, and their privileges, and do not want to see them filched from them.  I challenge the Minister to inform us when he got the views of either of those bodies or when they passed any resolution on the 1964 Act.  I challenge him to state that they passed any such resolution in 1967, in 1966 or 1965, or that they had discussions on this question since 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seemed very concerned about their views.  They have passed other resolutions in the past nine or ten months as to the Minister's handling of agricultural and farming affairs, but the Minister does not seem to be concerned about their views in that regard.  The Minister also said that <Col N="139" /> there was nothing in the 1964 Bill to ensure that rural organisations would get recognition.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, it was the hope of the Minister for Agriculture at that time that they would.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, if there had been any formula he could have introduced, he would have given them direct representation. I am not going to quote what Deputy Fitzpatrick quoted but I will quote the Minister for Agriculture speaking at columns 1355-56 of volume 57 No. 16, when he said:</P>
    <P>While I am suggesting the rural organisations and co-operative movement as a likely source of suitable members for committees of agriculture, I have not found it practicable to provide in this Bill for giving them direct representation, although I have given a great deal of thought to the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he gave the matter a great deal of thought.  If he could have found a formula for giving them direct representation at that time, he would have given it in the Bill.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>I do not think that a statutory formula could be worked out which could be applied equitably to all counties.  I hope, however, that county councils will keep the rural organisations and the co-operative movement in mind when choosing members for committees, and that the broadening of membership will lead to a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>At that time that was not only the aim of the Minister alone, because I believe there should be collective responsibility in both the Cabinet and the Fianna Fáil Party.  At that time Deputy Blaney was a Minister and Deputy Corry a Deputy.  Both of them, as well as the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party and all the other Parties in this House, were 100 per cent behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>Now we have this Bill as a direct provocation to the voluntary organisations which the Minister for Agriculture at that time, and the Fianna Fáil <Col N="140" /> Cabinet and the Fianna Fáil Party in their wisdom thought should be included in the committees of agriculture. If it was right in 1964 to have the help and assistance of the various voluntary organisations who have done such exemplary work over the past 30 or 40 years, what has happened in 1967 to make the Minister change his mind and introduce this amendment?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated earlier that it suits Fine Gael to keep the agitation going at present.  Deputy Clinton and other members of my Party have stated that, as far as we are concerned, we want to see the farmers get a fair crack of the whip.  We want to see an end to the present dispute which is doing untold harm to agriculture and to this country.  From the earliest days of this State, we have believed in co-operation, sitting down around the table and ironing out our problems instead of quarrelling.  The Minister talked about splits.  Unfortunately, there was a split in this nation in the past which kept our people divided for 40 years.  That is ending now, but, unfortunately, with the Minister's provocation over the past couple of months and with this Bill, which is a direct provocation of one farmers' organisation, there is again danger of having a split which may endure for the next 50 years and which may set brother against brother, neighbour against neighbour and city people against country people.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress, the Parliamentary Secretary had indignantly repudiated the suggestion that a circular from the Department bore the interpretation I put upon it. I admit I was very anxious to accept that assurance.  I asked him, in case my information derived from a newspaper was incorrect, if he would cause a copy of the circular I complained of to be sent to me, which he politely did.  I want to draw the attention of the House to what I think is a revolutionary and disastrous departure by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Department issued, on 22nd May, a press notice to the following effect:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts are being made in some areas to compel milk suppliers to become members of the NFA by interfering with, or withholding facilities for, the transport of milk to creameries.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries wishes to advise <Col N="143" /> any milk supplier who is faced with intimidation of this sort to notify any local officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or the headquarters of the Department in Dublin or the local Gardaí of the facts of the case.  The supplier may then arrange for alternative transport facilities, and the extra cost of doing this will be reimbursed to him by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  An equivalent amount will be deducted from the Exchequer Milk Price Allowance of 7d per gallon payable to the creamery concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister also wishes to inform all creameries that, if milk from a regular supplier is not accepted by a creamery for any reason other than those prescribed in the Dairy Produce Act (i.e. dirty, stale or contaminated milk or dirty vessels), a related amount will be deducted from the Exchequer Milk Price Allowance payable to the creamery.</P>
    <P>That was published in the public press but, on 23rd May, a copy of that press release was sent to each local officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and here is the covering letter:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Enclosed is a copy of a Press Notice issued on 22nd May.</P>
    <P>If you are informed by any milk supplier that he is being intimidated in any way in connection with the supplying of his milk to his creamery, you should obtain full details of the case from him, including details of the alternative transport facilities proposed, and notify the Department immediately by telephone (Dublin 67561).  The matter should be reported to any of the following officers.</P>
    <P>They mention four officers of the Department, with their extension number.</P>
    <P>That is a perfectly proper circular. That circular, so far as it goes, is merely designed to assist the farmer to get his milk to the creamery if for any local reason an attempt has been successfully made to frustrate his lawful <Col N="144" /> right to deliver his milk to his appropriate creamery.  But, here follows a paragraph which absolutely appals me. Remember, this is addressed to each local officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries:</P>
    <P>If it is possible to do so without delaying your report you should inform the local Gardaí who may perhaps be able to supply some further information.  If that is not possible you should in any event contact the Gardaí after reporting by telephone to the Department.</P>
    <P>A written report should also be furnished immediately through your superior officer and this should be sent by him without delay to the Department (Section 3).</P>
    <P>I want to explain to the House, and I put it to the House with profound reluctance, that this paragraph represents a revolutionary and shocking departure from the normal practice of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to do so without delaying your report you should inform the local Gardaí who may perhaps be able to supply some further information.  If that is not possible you should in any event contact the Gardaí after reporting by telephone to the Department.</P>
    <P>If I could construe that to mean that every local source of information should be tapped in order to get access to alternative transport, I would gladly do so but I cannot see how this is not direct incitement to the officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to act as a kind of CID of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are not familiar with the relationship that has been established between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the rural community may not understand that one of the greatest difficulties that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries had to contend with was to establish a relationship of mutual confidence between its officers and the ordinary farmers of the country.  One of the greatest obstacles to progress was that farmers looked upon the <Col N="145" /> officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with suspicion and spoke of them as &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo;.  One of our great achievements was that we gradually overcame that but we overcame it by exercising the most extreme caution and one of the injunctions that applied to every officer of the Department was: &ldquo;If you go on to a farmer's holding occupy yourself exclusively with the work to which you are assigned.  If you are a farm building inspector inspecting a building, inspect the building but do not advert to any other circumstances on the farm and, above all, if you believe that you observe any breach of the Department of Agriculture regulations, ignore it. Your sole function is to attend to farm buildings.&rdquo; Similarly, if a Land Project officer went on a farm his instructions were: &ldquo;Ignore farm buildings and everything else.  Look to your own business but, above all, let every farmer be reassured that you go in as a friend and helper and not as an agent of the Department or of any other Department of State to detect any breach of regulations or, indeed, even of the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that that document has been issued by the Department asking every local officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in the event of his coming up against any case of a farmer being unable to deliver his milk or being intimidated, not only to report to the Department so that the Department may go to the assistance of the farmer who believes himself to be under pressure of one kind or another or obstructed in the lawful prosecution of his business, but to communicate with the local Garda either before or after reporting the matter to the Department.</P>
    <P>I say quite deliberately and with profound reluctance and distaste, that document is a disgrace to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and I do not believe that under any previous Minister that document could have issued from the Department.  That document breathes the strange pathological hatred that the present Minister has allowed himself to become imbued with in this tragic, foolish and unnecessary contest that has been proceeding between himself and the NFA, <Col N="146" /> to something that has now become a scandal and discreditable personal vendetta.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the House fully appreciates the magnitude of the growing paralysis that is spreading through the agricultural industry at present.  I do not want to dwell upon statistics but they ought to be put on record.  The delivery of pigs to factories for conversion into pork and bacon for the 21 weeks ended 27th May, 1967, was 565,000.  For the same period in 1966 it was 687,000.  We are now in the position that we are finding extreme difficulty in fulfilling the quota of bacon we undertook to deliver under the Trade Agreement made by the present Government with the British Government and we are in the ridiculous position that we cannot send out pork because we have not got sufficient pigs to supply the quota of bacon and to fulfil the deliveries of pork.</P>
    <P>As to the price of fat cattle in the Dublin Cattle Market, I do not know what today's figure was but the return furnished on 21st May is 152/- a cwt. The price of the same cattle this day twelve months was 173/6d per cwt. That is a difference of about £10 per beast.  That relates to fat cattle but the decline in the price of store cattle over the same period is even greater and as I mentioned to the House when I last spoke in this debate, in my own personal experience I paid £8 for a calf for which 12 months ago I would cheerfully have paid £16.  The resultant pressure on the agricultural community in the congested areas is catastrophic and whether it is now possible to arrest the catastrophe that is overwhelming the congested areas of this country in so far as the small farmers resident there are concerned is a question open to the gravest doubt.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters to which I wish to refer for the purpose of elucidating, if I can, the mentality which directs the Department at this particular time.  In introducing the Estimate, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Gross agricultural output for 1966, including the value of livestock changes, was slightly below the level <Col N="147" /> of the preceding year in volume and £5 million lower in value.  This decrease was due mainly to two factors.  First, the very unfavourable weather throughout the spring hampered the sowing of crops, affected milk production temporarily and resulted in cattle not reaching marketable condition as early as usual&mdash;a position aggravated not only by the bank strike and the credit squeeze but also by the shipping strike.</P>
    <P>How the credit squeeze and the shipping strike could result in cattle not reaching marketable condition as early as usual is a mystery to me but the interesting thing is that it is clearly implied in that paragraph that scarcity of bank credit during the strike contributed to the decline in agricultural production.  It did emerge when the banks re-opened that £40 million worth of extra credit had been &ldquo;kited&rdquo; by people issuing cheques which they had not the money to meet and which were afterwards met by the banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Secondly, during the second half of the year, difficulties in export markets, arising from circumstances over which we had no control, led to a fall in the price of cattle and since cattle are the major item in agricultural output, this resulted in the value of gross output being substantially lower than had been expected.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that the development in our foreign markets which led to the decline in the price of cattle was 99 per cent due to our own madness in developing a heifer scheme designed to increase the number of cattle without making any attempt to envisage how these extra cattle were to be sold. We created a surplus of cattle which was unsaleable and as the price for the surplus declined, that decline spread through the whole cattle industry of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Crops, however, benefited from the favourable weather during the growing and harvesting period and <Col N="148" /> yields were higher.  With the upward trend in farming expenses continuing, the net result was that total family farm income fell by about £6 million or by about 4½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Is it therefore any wonder that the small farmers are waking up to the fact that while every other section of the community, including the Members of this House, are increasing their salaries and incomes steadily, farm incomes in one year fell by £6 million or 4½ per cent?  They are the only people left in Ireland who are working a seven-day week and would I be exaggerating if I said that the bulk of them are working 70 hours in that seven-day week while the bulk of their neighbours are working a five-day week and resent being asked to work more than 40 hours in that five-day week?  Yet we represent the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>In agriculture, it is always hazardous to attempt to predict what the future will bring&mdash;even in the short term&mdash; but the present indications are that 1967 should be a considerably better year for farming.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Hazardous&rdquo; is scarcely the word. That statement of the Minister's was made ten days ago and the price of cattle has since fallen in Dublin Cattle Market by £1 per cwt. as compared with last year.  Is this evidence of growing prosperity for the coming year?  If we get a good autumn and a good harvest, some farmers engaged in the production of cereals may do well, but we should remember that seven out of every ten harvests are poor and that three out of every ten are disastrous, for the reason that we have an average rainfall of 42 inches, ranging from 30 inches in the east to 60 inches in the west.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>The weather so far has been relatively good and so has the market situation for cattle.</P>
    <P>Is it credible that any man living in this country, never mind a Minister for Agriculture, could commit himself to the statement that the market situation for cattle has been relatively good?  In <Col N="149" /> all my long experience of agriculture in this country, I never remember, except during the period of the Economic War, when the price of cattle was comparable with that of the present time.  At that time there was always the comforting thought that the situation was due to the lunacy of the then Government and that if they recovered any kind of commonsense, the whole dreadful nightmare could be ended overnight.  That is what happened.</P>
    <P>You cannot end an economic war with Britain now.  That ended 30 years ago.  At present we are supposed to be operating under a Free Trade Agreement with Britain which was claimed to confer great benefits on the farmers, including an increase of £7 per head for their cattle.  From that there appears to be no escape.  A steady decline in livestock prices seems to have moved in and I wish I could get Deputies to understand that a decline in livestock prices strikes at the roots of the whole rural society in Ireland. The Minister says:</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we get reasonable weather during the rest of the year the prospects are that farmers will have a good year financially and they should more than recover the ground lost since 1966.</P>
    <P>This sounds very like Deputy Haughey in his &ldquo;golden egg&rdquo; period.  It is so far remote from reality that it makes me despair that such a man should be in charge of agriculture.  How can you hope, in the month of June, that if we get reasonable weather during the rest of the year, the prospect is that the farmers will have a good year financially and they should more than recover the ground lost in 1966 when, in fact, the price of cattle is £1 per cwt. lower than it was, the price of sheep is down, the price of wool is down, and there are no pigs.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say at column 1672 of volume 228 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The complete derating of agricultural holdings of £20 valuation or less will benefit a vast number of farmers in the category most in need of State help and puts the <Col N="150" /> question of rates on smaller holdings outside the realm of controversy.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that the proposal here referred to represented a Golconda for every farmer under £20 valuation.  The fact is that derating has operated as to 80 per cent and the remaining 20 per cent now represents an annuity of aproximately £4 or £5 a year.  The farmer has already lost more on one dropped calf than the whole devaluation of his £20 valuation is worth.  Yet this is held out as a benefit to a vast number of farmers in the category most in need of State help.</P>
    <P>At column 1674, faced with the dismal tale he has to tell, the Minister embarks upon the classic brouhaha of current economics: whenever you run up against a blank wall now, the sensible thing to do is to start talking about the EEC:</P>
    <P>While membership of the EEC would benefit the more important branches of Irish agriculture, it will not of itself provide an automatic remedy for all the problems with which our agriculture has been faced in the past.  The EEC market is highly competitive and only the progressive farmer who is geared to the highest level of efficiency and ready to satisfy the exacting standards of that market will reap the full benefits of membership.  I am confident, however, that, given the opportunity, our farmers generally will be able to measure up to what is required and to adjust themselves to the changes in farming patterns which will inevitably follow on our entry.</P>
    <P>Who the hell believes that this country will be in the European Economic Community in the next five years? What relevancy has that kind of blah to the present crisis in the agricultural industry in this country?  None, except for the purpose of trying to divert people's attention from the disastrous failure which attends the Fianna Fáil administration, holding out this numinous hope that some fine day our problems will be dissipated by our <Col N="151" /> entry into the European Economic Community, something as remote as the realisation of any of the other programmes for economic expansion which the Government have proposed to us and which are now safely ensconced in cold storage.</P>
    <P>I am glad to read at column 1676 that our exports of boxed frozen beef to the USA are reviving.  I remember very well the inauguration of that trade.  I remember forecasting for it a great future.  I was dismayed to read and to learn in recent years of its virtual disappearance.  I rejoice in its return.  I gather it is now worth approximately £8 million a year to our exports.  That is something for which we ought to be very grateful for I believe that, if it is skilfully exploited, it can be maintained and expanded.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not here now, but his Parliamentary Secretary is.  The Minister goes on to refer to the export of 10,000 young feeder cattle to Egypt and 4,000 young feeder cattle to Italy. At column 1677 he says:</P>
    <P>...my Department is at present actively exploring with exporters here and with Italian importers the prospects for continuing this trade.</P>
    <P>Are there any prospects?  If there are, I will rejoice to hear them, but it sounds to me as daft as a sixpenny watch, shipping six-month old cattle to Egypt and Italy, and I think the Minister has an obligation, instead of making a passing reference to an export of this character, implying it will develop into something really valuable, to tell us honestly what are the prospects, because there are people in the Department of Agriculture well qualified to prophesy with a fair degree of certainty as to what the prospects truly are.</P>
    <P>There is then a very Delphic statement:</P>
    <P>Arising out of my recent discussions with Mr. Peart, Irish and British officials met in Dublin last week to examine the possibilities for further measures to introduce more stability into the trade.</P>
    <P>If ever a meeting had a disastrous consequence <Col N="152" /> it must have been the meeting with Mr. Peart because it produced the phenomenon that cattle fell £1 per cwt on the Dublin market while at the same time the price of beef was rising steeply in Great Britain.  The interesting thing is that, since that statement was made in this House, the Minister has become very coy about his discussions with Mr. Peart.  What passed between them? What was the burden of their discussion? How did it come to pass that, after these profitable discussions, the price of beef on the hoof went down on the Irish market while it went up on the hoof in Great Britain.  Certainly, if these kinds of discussions are to continue, the livestock trade in this country will have to take to its prayers in the hope that either Minister will retire from public life, because our people will get very little out of them.</P>
    <P>Here is a most striking development. At column 1689, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>This year I am making provision under Subhead F for £755,500 for grants to county committees of agriculture. In the past ten years the total number of advisers employed by committees has increased from 301 to 482.  While an adequate advisory service is essential to provide the most up-to-date technical advice for all our farmers it is equally important to ensure that the advisory service itself is organised on the most efficient and effective lines.  Accordingly, last autumn we secured the services of two experts from abroad to make an independent appraisal of our agricultural advisory services. Their report was received very recently and as I have already indicated it is my intention to print and publish it.</P>
    <P>In the name of Providence, why do we want to get experts from abroad to tell us how to run the advisory services in this country?  Suppose we sent two of our best men to Rumania or to the State of Dakota to study the advisory services there with a view to telling them how they ought to run them, what on earth do you imagine such Irish experts could do, not knowing the people, not knowing the background, not knowing the circumstances, <Col N="153" /> simply meandering around the country, and then making a report on how to run the advisory services? We have got some of the best experts in the world in our services here, provided they are let do their job. The only thing that has stopped them is the fact that they were not allowed to do their job, largely because Fianna Fáil did not like the Parish Plan and wanted to kill it.  I am glad to see that Fianna Fáil have been converted because at column 1691 of the Minister's speech the following coy announcement appears:</P>
    <P>... The pilot area development programme has been of great value in identifying and measuring the scale of the main problems associated with agriculture in the West, and, more particularly, in demonstrating that considerable improvement is possible even under existing conditions, when the intensive advice and encouragement and the wide variety of facilities and incentives provided for farmers are properly and prudently availed of.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if he would let me have an indication of where the pilot areas, as he is pleased to call them, are located.  He was polite enough to do so.  I asked his predecessor, Deputy Haughey, on one occasion approximately what area was covered by a pilot area.  He looked at me blandly and said: &ldquo;Approximately three parishes&rdquo;.  Would anyone in this House distinguish for me the difference between the Parish Plan as operated by the Department of Agriculture between 1954 and 1957 and the pilot area development programme which at present most happily the Department of Agriculture has set on the way?  The only difference as far as I can make out is that the scheme which was inaugurated 15 years ago by myself and subsequently killed by Deputy Smith was revived by Deputy Haughey and is now apparently going to be carried on by Deputy Blaney. I do not deride him for that.  I rejoice in it.  The tragedy is that the interval of ten years that has elapsed, since 1957 has deprived our people of the services that would have been of <Col N="154" /> infinite value to them in restoring the viability of the congested areas, and it is open to doubt as to whether the plan can give the people the benefits which could have been given to them if they had it at their disposal during the last ten vital years.</P>
    <P>In the particular constituency I represent, County Monaghan, there has been some argument because in that county the new parish plan has been mainly centred in Aghabog which is a poor part of the county; the quality of the land is poor.  Some members of the county committee of agriculture have complained that a pilot area development programme should be located in one of the poorest areas of the county.  I think the members of the county committee of agriculture are wholly mistaken.  It is a very wise thing that the whole resources of the Department should flow into a relatively poor area, but it would be a tragic mistake if the Parish Plan were confined exclusively to poor areas.  It can do great work in the better areas where the land is good. The whole plan began in Bansha close to the Golden Vale in Tipperary, and it was subsequently located in areas some of which contained some of the richest land in Ireland, some of which contained some of the poorest land in Ireland.  It did not matter whether we were operating in North Leitrim or in mid-Tipperary, the results in both types of area brought a dramatic improvement in the economic life of the people who lived in the areas catered for by the plan.</P>
    <P>I can never forget the testimony of one creamery manager operating in those areas who had one half of his milk supply area in a Parish Plan area and one half outside.  The Parish Plan had been operating for two or three years and he came to me and said: &ldquo;If I could get from that part of my supply area which is outside the Parish Plan the same increase in milk production and supply as has developed in the area which is within the Parish Plan, I would increase the intake at the creamery to 3 million gallons per annum, and it would mean that I could pay the farmers 2d a gallon more than I am able to pay <Col N="155" /> them now.&rdquo; It illustrates the extraordinary benefit that can accrue to our people when there are brought to them effectively these services already available from the Department of Agriculture and, above all, when there is constantly at their disposal somebody who is prepared to lead in the organisations and development of co-operation and modern methods in agricultural operations.</P>
    <P>If I were the present Minister for Agriculture, I would be ashamed of my life to face the country, and I imagine that is one of the reasons why he is the Minister for Agriculture.  He has acquired in his own Party, not without justification, the reputation for the brassiest exterior of which any member of the Party disposes.  He is a good political performer on a bad wicket. When we had no houses, when the housing situation was a public scandal before the whole of Europe, it was Deputy Blaney who was put in to bat and defend the Government's detestable record in that regard.  He has now been installed in the Department of Agriculture to explain why cattle are £10 a head lower than they were this time 12 months, to explain why pig supplies are falling, to explain the general black pall of gloom that has descended upon the congested areas of this country.  I suppose for that political purpose he has a use, but having a Minister for Agriculture capable of authorising the issue of the circular to which I referred here this evening, it makes me grieve that a great Department that I believe the Department of Agriculture in the country should be is so prostituted by a Minister responsible for its administration.</P>
    <P>I want to ask a question about a matter in which I have a peculiar interest.  It is referred to on page 35 of the Notes on the Main Activities of the Department.  I quote:</P>
    <P>In addition to the county and general Departmental schemes, special schemes of agricultural instruction and production are operated in the Congested Districts. These include the location of bulls and rams on special terms, the distribution of seed potatoes and seed <Col N="156" /> grain at reduced prices and the establishment of plots to demonstrate proper methods of cultivation, improvement of grassland, etc.  The Gaeltacht Glasshouse Scheme, initiated by this Department in 1947&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mark the date, 1947.  If this scheme had any measure of success, I can claim no credit for it.  I found it there.  It was the brainchild of my predecessor, Deputy Smith, but I described it as appearing to me to be a somewhat exotic enterprise, and every Fianna Fáil cumann in Connemara and in Donegal passed resolutions; flocks of furious Catholic curates came pouring into my office, hotly attended by Fianna Fáil gauleiters from the parish level up, to represent this as one of the greatest contributions ever made to the economy of the congested areas of Ireland, and that indeed without it, Connemara and Donegal would be virtually depopulated in the twinkling of an eye.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to that in a moment.  Let us follow the history of the glasshouses.  There were no rocks at all required to dispose of them because in his report the Minister for Agriculture goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The Gaeltacht glasshouse scheme, initiated by this Department in 1947, is continuing in operation but the number of participants is decreasing according as the houses, now 20 years old, are wearing out.  Under the new general glasshouse scheme introduced by Roinn na Gaeltachta in 1966-67 grants for the erection of glasshouses are available to suitable applicants in any part of the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I should like to know, just for old acquaintance sake, what happened to the glasshouse scheme.  It appears from the Minister's report that the numbers are decreasing as the glasshouses wear out.  I understand they are falling down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know <Col N="157" /> what their financial record is.  I am glad to see that the Minister has not just silently buried them. But, for old acquaintance sake, I should like to know when the next 100 houses will be constructed. How much money have they cost the State?  What real profit was derived by the people who acquired them?  Was it a case of just building the glasshouse and living on the proceeds of its disintegration during the ensuing 20 years?  It was a fraudulent scheme the first day it started.</P>
      <P>I want to put it on record that if the Gaeltacht glasshouse scheme had any merit, I can claim no credit because I thought it was a cod the first day.  Twenty years later, it would appear from the Minister's report upon it that my estimate of its value &mdash;20 years ago&mdash;was not far out.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to tell the House, before this debate concludes, the prospects for the cattle trade in Ireland.  I want to tell the Minister now that, at present prices, it is not economic to produce cattle any longer. I did not believe it was possible for anybody to do that.  I want to remind the Minister that, since 1948 until the autumn of 1965, the production of store cattle was the sheet anchor of our small farmers.  Since the autumn of 1965 to date, the production of store cattle represents a steady loss to those who produced them.</P>
      <P>Sheep have collapsed in price but only within the past 12 months and not so dramatically as cattle.  The diminution in the number of pigs appears to be attributable to the rise in the cost of feeding stuffs without any corresponding rise in the price available for pigs.  It may be that that industry is undergoing a radical alteration which will divorce pig production altogether from the small farmer's economy but remember that a vast number of farmers living on the land of Ireland must produce livestock or nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a long time since I first warned this House&mdash;I want to issue the warning again&mdash;that in a country with an average annual rainfall of 42 inches, varying from 30 inches to 60 inches, you produce livestock or you go <Col N="158" /> hungry.  There is no other form of agriculture that can successfully survive in our climate except a livestock industry founded upon green crops.  I do not believe that even Fianna Fáil will ever fall into the madness again of believing that the growing of cereals provides employment or an end return comparable with the livestock industry.</P>
    <P>People often wonder why it is that we have not annual catastrophies in wet seasons from the growing of wheat &mdash;and remember that the growing of wheat was first introduced into this country to provide employment.  As compared with livestock, the growing of grain provides no employment at all.  It is now done by large contractors who plough the land in spring, sow the crop and close the gate until the time comes for the combine to cut the crop in the autumn.  But, over and above that, we have in our climate a perennial threat of eye-spot which makes us so peculiarly vulnerable to a wet autumn. Whatever chance a barley crop has, a wheat crop has little or none.  Without livestock, agriculture in Ireland will fold up.  The present trends in the livestock industry fill me with foreboding that the time is rapidly approaching when, west of the Shannon, there will be nobody left to produce livestock.</P>
    <P>Do not forget the pattern of the livestock industry in this country.  Its normal pattern was that calves were born in the south-west and moved up through the west into the midlands and then to the sea and exported.  The west and Monaghan and Cavan provided a very essential link in the whole pattern of the livestock trade.  On the present basis, that trade cannot survive.  I believe that that catastrophe has been precipitated by the folly of the heifer scheme without corresponding provision for marketing facilities.  It is the Minister's duty to tell us what the Government propose to do to put right that catastrophe.  It is our duty to warn them that, unless they have effective plans to restore the damage they have done, the small farmers are finished.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I feel a sense of utter impotence in that I recognise that people living in cities, even in the eastern counties, do not understand the <Col N="159" /> gravity of the crisis confronting small farmers in the west.  There are no words I could use too strong to emphasise the enormity of the catastrophe that has overtaken the smallholders of the congested areas.  I have little hope that the Government, with the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, can do anything effective to relieve their state, but it is my duty, as long as I am here, to tell the House what the true situation is and to advise the Government of their essential duty without delay to bring effective relief to that section of our agricultural community which Fianna Fáil have so substantially ruined in the past few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Relative calm. Even Deputy Dillon, for whom I have great respect as an orator, did not provoke from the far side of the House&mdash;for the obvious reason that there is nobody there but the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the sort of storm his speeches usually provoke here.  We should remember when talking about agriculture, about the farming community and about their livelihood, that while this is going on, we have locked up in some of our jails some of the most decent people I know, not because they have committed a criminal act but because they refuse to allow themselves to be branded as criminals. I hold no brief for those who deliberately break the law.  The farmers in the NFA made a number of mistakes in their campaign for a fair deal but there is an old saying that those who never made a mistake never made anything, and for that reason I believe the farmers have learned their lesson and they will not make the same mistakes again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the months and in the years to come, what happened the farmers will rankle in their minds.  The trade unionists were similarly kicked around <Col N="160" /> the streets of this city when they first started to fight for the rights of the workingclass people and because of the abuse they got they learned that they had to do certain things which they did not want to do.  They have reached the stage where I should like to see this or any other Government attempting to treat the trade unionists in the way in which the farmers are being treated.</P>
    <P>Nobody rushes out when a strike takes place to lock up the people involved, not because they would not like to but because the Government know that they dare not.  The NFA, unfortunately for themselves, started as an isolated group and they have been fighting as an isolated group.  They were wrong to blockade the roads from 8 o'clock in the morning to 8 o'clock at night.  They could have and should have, if they desired blockaded them for two or three hours and showed what they could do.  They were also wrong, if they had the money to pay the rates, to delay paying them. Do not forget that they did pay them. It is monstrous that people charged in court for a simple traffic offence should in addition to paying fines have to suffer the indignity of signing a bond to keep the peace.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Minister for Agriculture, any member of the Government, or of the House, would say if he took a chance and parked a car in a non-parking space, as we sometimes do if we are in a hurry to go into a shop, and was subsequently prosecuted for illegal parking, fined £5 and then told he would have to sign a bond to keep the peace before he was let out. The first black mark I would put against the Government is that the instruction to insist on this bond being signed must have come from Government level; otherwise, the district justices, who are normally intelligent, decent men would never have resorted to something like that.</P>
    <P>When the farmers paraded in this city, 20,000 or 25,000 of them&mdash;and I have been looking at parades in this city for a long time and have taken part in some of them&mdash;it was the most orderly group of people I ever saw parading in this town.  The parade <Col N="161" /> dispersed quietly and it was an insult not alone to their intelligence but to the intelligence of the House that the then Minister for Agriculture refused to meet a small deputation of those men to discuss their grievance.  Do not mind the story that he had met them so often in the months before.  This is a second reason why the farmers have a right to feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>Following this, we had all the ins and outs, the going into and coming out of jail again.  Do not let anybody try to put it across that the Government have not been playing a game. The release of the farmers during Spring Show week when the show was collapsing, because of the farmers failure to attend it, was such an obvious trick that it was surprising the farmers did not realise that they were being taken in.  They are ordinary decent people who do not normally look for tricks of this kind and because of that they were taken in.  They were released from jail one week and taken back in the next.  Some weeks ago I was talking to two farmers whose sons were in jail and they pointed to a car which was passing.  In that car was a young lad who had no licence and had no tax or insurance; the car nearly had no tyres, and no brakes.  He had been taken to court and the licence which he had not got was taken from him, and he was fined £5, but on the following Sunday evening, he stole another car, crashed into two cars and a telegraph pole, and he was again taken to court and again the licence which he never had was taken from him for the second time.  He was sent to jail for nine months.  He went up on a Friday and because he had political pull, he was out driving a car on the following Sunday.  Those farmers asked me: &ldquo;What law is there in this country?  Our two sons whom we need on the farm are in jail because they will not sign a bond to keep the peace for six months.&rdquo;</P>

I challenge the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, to deny that the present campaign which the Government are now carrying on is nothing but a trick.  Is it not true that at present the Minister for Justice in particular is screaming his head off about the intimidation which is taking place, with the object of getting the NFA to deny this intimidation and to spend so much time denying it that the Government hope that everybody will lose sight of what the original row started off about?</P>

      <P>I understand that there are files knocking about which are supposed to show intimidation.  I always thought that police files were secret and only to be shown in court but I understand that these files were shown to people who had nothing to do with the police and were made available before these people were tried.  This is justice: this is the way people with a sense of grievance are being treated.</P>
      <P>I do not know what game the Government are playing, but I do know that it is far more serious than they appear to realise, because something which was not in rural Ireland for many years, that is, bitterness amongst the agricultural community, is building up.  I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that not only supporters of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, but also rabid supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party are involved in this.  There is no question of their being anxious to do down the Government as is suggested in some wild statements made by Government spokesmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time all these people are suffering from a serious grievance. They are suffering from what they call the unfair treatment of themselves and their fellow agriculturists.  Bitterness is being built up, and unless a miracle occurs, it will be ten long years before <Col N="163" /> that bitterness sown by the previous Minister for Agriculture and the present Minister is dissipated and cleared up.  That is a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>Rather sneering references were made during the discussion on the other Bill this evening to the efforts which were made at mediation.  Let me put this on record.  I genuinely had no intention of trying to pick up any political kudos.  I agreed to try with two other Members of the House, who both seemed as anxious as I was to have the matter settled, to mediate to see if we could do something about it. I was amused to see the Fianna Fáil member being policed in and out of these benches.  He was not allowed to come in on his own lest he talk to Deputy Clinton or myself.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking situation when a person cannot be man enough to stand up and say: &ldquo;I do not want to have anything to do with this&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I will not have anything to do with it&rdquo;.  It is rubbish to suggest that we were trying to get political kudos.  It was not for that that we wanted to intervene.  That is not why we offered to mediate.  I notice that the mediation which was supposed to be directed by that person with some of his colleagues does not seem to have gone very far.</P>
    <P>I would dearly love to see the dispute in Irish agriculture settled tomorrow morning, but I am firmly convinced that the Government do not want to see that dispute settled.  The only reason I can see for that attitude &mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash;is that having been badly beaten in the Presidential election in both Dublin and Cork, the Government are under the impression that by creating a phony war with the agricultural community, they will in some peculiar way be able to win back the support of the cities and towns which they apparently lost last year.  If that is not the reason, I cannot understand what it can be.</P>
    <P>Now we have the National Agricultural Council.  The NIEC was set up a couple of years ago.  Pleas were made from these benches and from other parts of the House to have our primary industry, agriculture, included, but they <Col N="164" /> were resisted.  The Government said: &ldquo;Maybe we will consider it at a later stage.  We do not think it necessary now.&rdquo; How they expected to do anything for industry while our primary industry was left outside that committee beats me.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  They could not do anything.</P>
    <P>Then the decision to set up the National Agricultural Council was taken.  It was quite evident from the start that this was going to be a Government-controlled body.  There are letters in the newspapers and hysterical outbursts from people on the Government benches about whether or not this body represents the agricultural community, or whether it simply represents the Government.  They say it represents agriculture in general, but does it? Take a look at it and see does it.  Is it not true that the Minister deliberately decided to nominate sufficient people for the purpose of swinging decisions his own way?  He is now the chairman of the committee.  The Taoiseach has the right to nominate 11 people to the Seanad because it is felt that there must be some way of ensuring that the Government have control of the Seanad.  The Minister did the same thing with the National Agricultural Council.</P>
    <P>Why was it necessary to do that?  If there was a desire to help agriculture why was it found necessary to set up this phony body, because phony it is? Why did they not wait and set up this body properly and leave no room for a grievance, so that the matters at issue might be settled?  Why was it not left over until such time as the dispute with the farmers had been cleared up?  Then this body could have been set up and could have worked in harmony.  Apparently from the very start the idea was that if the Government did not control agriculture in every way, then it was not going to be allowed to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I was also rather amused to hear some statements about the Free Trade Agreement.  Hindsight is a great thing. Most people will remember that the decision to ratify that agreement was <Col N="165" /> taken by the Government with the support of Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>If this House had decided against the Free Trade Agreement and voted against it, if the vote had been carried, the Government would have had to resign on such a major issue.  There would have been a general election, and if the Government were beaten, the new Government might not have ratified the agreement.  That is the situation.  Fine Gael voted with the Government on that issue.  Now they say it is a terrible tragedy that the farmers were codded by the agreement.  Of course they were.</P>
      <P>The former Taoiseach and the present Minister for Finance who was then the Minister for Agriculture definitely promised that 638,000 head of store cattle would be taken by Britain, and that the price of store cattle would go up, in Deputy Haughey's words, by not less than £7 per head.  As a matter of fact, in a rash moment, he made a statement which he did not repeat that he estimated it would mean an increase for Irish agriculture of approximately £20 million per annum.  Then we found that the price of cattle went down instead of up, and when they were asked in this House by ourselves and Fine Gael what the farmers should do, should they hold on to their cattle or sell them, the advice the Minister gave was to hold on.  They thought that something would turn up after a while, and that things would get better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did not get better.  The price dropped and dropped and dropped.  It is now an old story that the farmers lost up to £20 per head on their cattle as a result of this stupid agreement. Deputy Dillon talked about the west of Ireland and the big losses in the congested <Col N="166" /> areas, but I can tell this House that I come from an area with the best land in Ireland&mdash;not excluding Tipperary&mdash;and in that county there were very substantial losses.  The only people who did not lose so much were the really big farmers who, if they lost £15 per head on their cattle, recovered it in a couple of weeks on the cattle they were buying in.  They were not so bad, but when you move down to the middle-sized farmer and the small farmer, you find that they got it in the neck.  There is a saying that some of the farmers are in a poor way.  I can assure the House that a number of farmers who have held their heads very high for so long as I have known them are in a very poor way at present.</P>
    <P>There is talk about what happened during the Economic War, but what has happened now is having a far greater effect than what happened during that period.  If there were any hope of an improvement in the position, it might be possible to see brighter days ahead, but it appears that not only is there no hope but also that the Government neither know nor care how the farmers are to be taken out of their present situation.</P>
