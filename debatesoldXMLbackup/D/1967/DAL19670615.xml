    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, there has been a dispute between the Government and certain voluntary organisations for the past eight or ten months.  We have pointed out in the past the valuable amount of work these voluntary organisations have done for agriculture here.  We pointed out it was based on a firm foundation of co-operation, sitting down around the table, threshing out difficulties. It is impossible to have a firm foundation based on the wrangling, feuding, and fighting, which, unfortunately, we have had for the past nine months. Voluntary organisations such as the NFA, the ICMSA, Muintir na Tuaithe, Macra na Feirme, the Countrywomen's Association and others have done trojan voluntary work over the years. We think they are being provoked in this Bill.  There is no denying that the idea of the Bill is to keep those organisations, particularly one organisation, from getting representation on the committees of agriculture.  Since there has been no further escalation, even at this late stage we would appeal to the Minister to withdraw this Bill and let everybody in this country get on with the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are facing a difficult period in the history of our country.  Next week we start negotiations to enter the EEC. We cannot say that will be a bed of roses for our farmers or for our industrialists. But we can all say that if we are to succeed in the future, be it in agriculture, industry or labour relations, all sections of the community should be pulling together and working in harmony.  I hope there is a good prospect now that that may happen.  Now that we have a certain amount of peace and we are all hoping there is an end to this unfortunate business, if the Minister proceeds with this Bill, there is a danger again of his throwing petrol on the smouldering embers and starting the fire all over again.  Nobody wants to see that happening at the present time.  We should <Col N="587" /> appeal&mdash;and it is in the best interests of the agricultural community and of the country as a whole&mdash;to the Minister, even at this late stage, to withdraw the Bill and not proceed further with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would really love to accede to the request of Deputy L'Estrange, particularly when I know that he either does not believe what he says or has changed his mind and will not admit it because he, as a member of a county committee of agriculture, condemned the 1964 amendment and sought to have it removed some couple of years ago. He is quite entitled of course to change his mind as we have changed our mind.  If he has had a change of mind and if he does not now believe what he believed then, there is no harm in saying so.</P>
      <P>The idea that this Bill should be withdrawn merely because there has been a dispute with a farmers' organisation does not make a great deal of sense to me.  Surely the enactments of this House do not have to depend on whether or not there are rows or have been rows with any organisation?  The House passes legislation, and I hope will continue to do so, as it sees fit, regardless of whether or not there are disputes or have been disputes.</P>
      <P>Apart from that altogether, I can see no reason whatever why, if the organisation in question or any other organisation has worthwhile persons within its membership to offer to committees of agriculture, such persons cannot be taken on to the committees and give service to the community and to the country.  There is no barrier being placed against their being taken in.  There is no specific mention in the Bill of any particular organisation.  Why it should be felt that one particular organisation is in any way being pinpointed in the Bill is more than I can understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The freedom of the new county councils to elect their committees of agriculture is a reversion to what has been the practice down the years and, indeed, to the manner in which the present committees of agriculture were <Col N="588" /> composed, that is, freedom to elect all outsiders, with the exception of one councillor.  This is the only obligation that there has been and the only obligation that there will be in future.  Surely, this facility and this freedom is all that would be required? Indeed, if the amendment of 1964 is taken, as many measures passed here very often are taken, namely, that when a figure is stated, as there was in that amendment Act, that 50 per cent of the membership must be outsiders, what is stated to be the requirement very often turns out to be the rule whereas in our present situation the figure might go to almost 100 per cent outsiders, if the council so desires.  This freedom is there and this freedom will continue.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion about aggravating anybody with this Bill, if people like Deputy L'Estrange see aggravation or provocation in it, I am afraid I cannot help that.  The Bill is there.  It is simple.  It is a reversion to what the position was.  I think it is a proper thing and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Rates on Agricultural Land" RHead="(Relief) Bill, 1967: Second Stage">
    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1967: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is intended to give effect to the Government's decision&mdash;announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement last April&mdash;to make available an additional £1.6 million towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The Bill will apply to the <Col N="589" /> three years ending on 31st March, 1970.</P>
    <P>During that period rates relief on agricultural land will be applied in three broad categories.  In the case of small holdings with rateable valuations of £20 or less&mdash;and these comprise the great majority of farms&mdash;it is proposed to increase the primary allowance from 80 per cent to 100 per cent of the general rate in the £, thus effectively derating the land.  Where a holding of land has a valuation of more than £20, but not more than £33, the first £20 of valuation will also be effectively derated and the occupier will be directly liable for rates only on the part of the valuation above £20.  This limited liability can be abated in appropriate cases by the employment allowance, to which I will refer later. Finally, holdings with rateable valuations above £33 will continue to get a primary allowance of 80 per cent of the general rate in the £ on the first £20 of such valuations and a supplementary allowance of 30 per cent of the general rate on the balance.</P>
    <P>During the next three years the employment allowance will be available towards the relief of the entire net rates payable on holdings with valuations over £20.  Up to this the allowance was related only to the portion of the net rates on the part of the valuation above £20.</P>
    <P>The increased rates of allowances under the Bill will bring the total amount of the agricultural grant to almost £16 million in the current year. Ten years ago the grant totalled less than £5.5 million and met 44 per cent of all rates on agricultural land.  In 1962-63, when the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1962, increased the primary allowance from 60 per cent to 70 per cent and introduced a supplementary allowance of 25 per cent on valuations over £20, the grant rose to £8.5 million and met 57 per cent of the rates on land.  The primary allowance was further increased to 80 per cent by the 1964 Act which also raised the supplementary allowance to 30 per cent.  In consequence, the grant increased to £11.2 million in 1964-65, meeting 64 per cent of land rates.  The <Col N="590" /> £16 million grant this year will, it is estimated, meet approximately 70 per cent of all rates on land in county health districts.  As a result of these progressive subventions from State funds, farmers will be in the happy position of paying less net rates on their land this year than they paid ten years ago, in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of the increased grants provided during recent years have accrued in the main to smallholders. The increase to 100 per cent in rate relief provided for in section 3 of the Bill represents the final step in this process by providing, in effect, for the complete derating of all land for farmers in the £20 valuation or under category.  The derating will apply to 77 per cent of all rated holdings of agricultural land in the country.  The benefits provided by the increased primary allowances for the further 10 per cent or so of holdings in the £20 to £33 valuation category will range from almost complete derating at the bottom of the scale to an average relief of approximately 61 per cent of the gross rates at the top of the scale.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill introduces a novel concept into the rating law.  As a consequence of the increase in the primary allowance for holdings with valuations under £20, provision is made in this section for the waiving of small amounts of rates which would otherwise fall to be levied as separate charges in respect of compensation for malicious injuries.  It would normally be uneconomic for a county council to levy and recover these charges on small holdings which are otherwise derated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the making of the allowances will be conditional on payment of the net rates due within the year unless the county council, with the consent of the Minister, decide to waive the condition in relation to any year.  It is proposed to give power to the Minister to extend the time for payment beyond the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill for what is in it, but it does not go far enough.  I remember the time <Col N="591" /> when the farmers were promised complete derating of their land.  At that time the average rate was something between 6/- and 7/- in the £.  The rates now range roughly from 50/- in Meath to over 90/- in many counties in the west of Ireland.  Instead of the promise about derating being kept, the rates have increased more than ten times since that promise was made.</P>
      <P>The Minister states that an additional sum of £1.6 million will be made available to the farmers towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  We believe and it has been our policy over the past five years that derating should be up to £25 poor law valuation.  This sum of £1.6 million will do very little to take the small farmer out of the hopeless position he is in today.  It is a well-known fact that there are over 100,000 small farmers trying to exist on £5 per week or less.  We must also take into consideration the fact that in the past many of these people worked on the roads to augment the few pounds they were getting from the land.  Now we find the Minister for Local Government cutting those grants by 25 per cent, and so many small farmers will not be able to get work on the roads this year.</P>
      <P>In this connection we must take into consideration what has been done for other sections of the community.  We hear much about the 1916 Proclamation in relation to cherishing all our children equally.  In 1964 there were roughly 30,000 civil servants earning approximately £19 million per annum. They got a status increase and the ninth round increase in that year; they got an increase of £11 million, and they are getting it since.  A sum of £11 million is divided among 30,000 people, while a meagre sum of £1.6 million is being divided among 150,000 to 200,000 farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered also that up to the present time four-fifths of the first £20 valuation was derated.  I asked a question here about a month ago as to what was the average these farmers would gain, and I was told it was £3 17s 9d.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the price of the <Col N="592" /> loaf recently went up by 2d and that any small family will use 400 loaves in the year, which takes away whatever benefit the Minister thinks may accrue to the small farmer.  What the small farmer really wants at the present time is not sops or doles.  The vast majority of them are decent, respectable, hardworking people, and what they want is fair prices so that they can stay on the land and rear their children in ordinary, frugal comfort. This Bill certainly does not go far enough.  It will not make up for the loss to the small farmer today, especially in the west of Ireland where he cannot sell his cattle, where he cannot sell his sheep except at a few pounds less than last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that ten years ago the grant totalled less than £5.5 million and met 44 per cent of rates on agricultural land.  When saying this, the Minister should also have said, to be fair, that ten years ago the farmers' costs of production were much less than they are today, that ten years ago the small farmer could make some money out of pigs and buy meal at £26 or £27 per ton.  When the Minister quotes figures, let him give the whole picture.  The small farmer could also get more for his small cattle ten years ago than he is getting today, and the Minister for Agriculture knows as well as I do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It is plain to be seen that the Minister was trying to compare what the Government are doing for the farmers at the present time with what was being done ten years ago.  If that was not the purpose, why did he go back exactly ten years when a different Government were in power?  Why not go back 12 or 14 years when Fianna Fáil were in power?  Why not go back seven or eight years, again when Fianna Fáil were in power?  If the Minister presents one side of the picture then we are entitled to present the other side.  At that time the small farmer in the West was getting 6/-to 7/- per lb. for his wool.  Today he is getting 2/6d.  For hoggets, wethers, poultry and eggs, he was getting a fair return.  Today it is a well-known fact that the small farmer has given up producing these commodities because there is no return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is shortly to tour Europe and it is envisaged that we may be in the EEC within the next few years.  On the Continent of Europe, farmers pay no rates.  Farmers in Britain and in Northern Ireland pay no rates. Is it the intention of the Government to go the whole way and give our farmers complete derating to bring them into line with Northern Ireland, Britain and European countries?  Our farmers cannot be asked to compete <Col N="594" /> with farmers elsewhere unless they enjoy the same terms.  I should like the Minister to give us this information when he comes to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>From the first time I listened to a political speech, as a small boy in my local village, I heard the cry from the stone walls and the barrels for complete derating of agricultural land.  The extraordinary thing is that all Parties seem to be in favour of complete derating of agricultural land.  Yet, when a measure is introduced dealing with derating, we find that the result will be a very small drop indeed in the ocean.  I am not quarrelling with this measure, because we must be thankful, I suppose, for small mercies.  What I am quarrelling with is the song and dance by the Government as if this small relief were something that would save the small farmer.  It is utter nonsense to suggest that the derating of the remaining one-fifth of the first £20 valuation will make one bit of difference to the small farmer.  The fact that he will not have to find the £3, £4 or £5 which hitherto he was required to pay will save him nothing.  Now we are all anxious to save the small farmer.  Billy Graham is only trotting after some of the politicians here when it comes to saving the small farmer.  But when it comes to doing something practical, all we see is this meagre concession; they will have an extra couple of shillings a week.  At the beginning the small farmers did not appreciate that they were getting practically nothing, but they do appreciate it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another angle to which the Minister should direct his attention. On many holdings the houses and outoffices carry a very substantial rate and that substantial rate will continue. Cottiers have been told by Fianna Fáil canvassers, who should know and, if they do not know, they should not be candidates in the local elections, that this complete derating applies to cottiers, their gardens and their houses. These canvassers should know that buildings are not included.  I had an old age pensioner coming to me last week.  She pays a rate of £10 on an acre of land and a vested cottage.  That <Col N="595" /> poor old lady had been told that, because her acre was classed as agricultural land, she would not have to pay any more rates.  She said £10 was not a great deal of money but it was a good deal to her.  As the Minister knows, there is absolutely no truth in this; if people believe it until after 28th June that will be all right.  That is the sort of nonsense to which I object.  It is nothing but a build-up.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange referred to the difference in the rate in Meath and the rate in other counties.  Our land is very highly valued, not because it is better land but because, when Griffith was travelling around, there must have been a very fine summer; he listed as good land land that was growing wheat. Apparently land that grew wheat then, unlike now, was regarded as good land. A good deal of this land is now and has been in living memory under rushes, but there is still a high valuation on it.  It is easy keeping the rate down when the valuation is high. Some Deputies do not seem to understand that.  It is relatively easy to give the appearance of keeping the rate down because the same amount of money is being paid one way or the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the £20 up to £33, a Fianna Fáil back bencher, speaking here the other day, was under the impression that there was a graded allowance from £20 up to £33.  I should like the Minister to go into detail on that when he is replying because, if there is a graded allowance, the Deputy knows more about it than I do.  I cannot find any graded allowance.  The reference is to the employment allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a small step forward and we must be thankful for small mercies, but this will mean very little to the income of the small farmer and the sooner that is generally accepted the better it will be.  The mistake initially was that of the Minister for Finance in announcing this: he did not say: &ldquo;This is a small <Col N="596" /> concession; it is a beginning and we hope to be able to improve on it&rdquo;. What he did imply was that the Government were doing wonderful things for the small farmer; they were completely derating the first £20 on agricultural land.  He made the announcement with his tongue in his cheek obviously because he is the one person who should know that this meant shillings per week and not pounds per week in most cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that:</P>
      <P>As a result of these progressive subventions from State funds, farmers will be in the happy position of paying less net rates on their land this year than they paid ten years ago, in 1957-58.</P>
      <P>I do not know how true that is, but I rather doubt it somehow.  I should like to get an isolated case.  In my opinion, farmers were in a much better position in 1957-58 to pay anything up to £100 in rates than they are to pay anything at all this year.  I do not think the Minister realises what the situation of the farmer is.  Store cattle, for which the farmers in the west of Ireland were getting in the region of £40 to £45 a few years ago, are unsaleable today. If the farmers take them into the fair, they just cannot sell them.  They are not even asked how much they want for them.  The situation is as bad as that and it is quite wrong, therefore, to argue that they will pay less in rates. They may pay less but they could afford to pay far more in 1957-58.  It is a pity the Government did not adopt our policy and have complete derating on the first £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every one of us knows that the income of the small farmer is supplemented by various types of employment. No later than last week notification was sent to each county by the Department of Local Government that road grants are substantially reduced. Particularly in the areas I represent, the small farmer was used to getting employment on many schemes.  It means that the amount of money will substantially be reduced this year and that there will be much less employment for them.  His plight this year and <Col N="597" /> the next year, as far as I can see, will be desperate.  I do not think the Government can pride themselves on the little bit of relief we are giving him in rates.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the community in the West to whom the Minister should try to give some relief at a very early date, that is, the small businessman.</P>

      <P>I suppose it causes no trouble to Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Tully to refer to the disbursement of an amount of money of the magnitude of £1.6 million as a meagre concession, a mere bagatelle, and so on.

      <P>The money must, first of all, be collected and then distributed. That is something Fine Gael have never faced up to.  The question of the collection of the money is irrelevant: I had it yesterday in the Seanad.  The cost of the preservation of old houses is irrelevant according to Fine Gael Senators.  Here, again, to the Fine Gael Party who claim to have a policy of complete derating of the first £25 of land valuation, the question of cost is of course completely irrelevant.  Unfortunately, a Government who decide to do these things, rather than to have them as a so-called policy, have to face up to the question that the extraction of an extra £1.6 million for distribution to the small farmers is not an irrelevant thing which can be brushed aside.  Suitable fiscal arrangements have to be made to collect this money from the people so that it can be given in relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>I think that the raising of the total grant in relief of rates on agricultural land to £16 million is not something of which this Government need be ashamed.  Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Tully maintain that this is very little relief to small farmers.  I do not see that it is possible to do any more by way of rates relief than to remit 100 per cent of the rates.  To do anything more than this would involve an actual payment to stay on the land and, in fact, this is being done also by way of the extension of the unemployment assistance scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, this is additional assistance to small farmers.  I appreciate that, although some Deputies pretend to be in favour of some redistribution of income, in actual fact they are always prepared to sneer at measures such as this.  I am well aware of what is behind the Fine Gael attitude of sneering at &ldquo;sops&rdquo; and &ldquo;doles&rdquo; and advocating that <Col N="599" /> instead of this, there should be subsidised prices.  I am quite well aware of all that.  This is the gambit used by all those who want to use the small farmers in order to get completely disproportionate benefits for those who do not need them.</P>
      <P>Deputy L'Estrange and the other members of the Fine Gael Party appreciate that if, instead of proceeding in this manner, instead of re-aligning the unemployment assistance scheme so that it will, in effect, be an income supplement for small farmers and instead of giving relief to small farmers in the matter of rates, we proceeded by way of subsidising prices or giving increased subsidies on fertilisers, and so on, the bigger farmer would automatically profit to a much greater extent than the smaller farmer.  Deputy L'Estrange and his Party and other people who specialise in utilising the small farmer for their own motives could pretend that they had got this benefit for the small farmer in the knowledge that in fact it is the larger farmer who will benefit.</P>
      <P>Apart from this type of rates relief which is directed mainly to the small farmer, the other assistance such as the unemployment assistance scheme and other assistance to agriculture is naturally related to the productive capacity of the farm.  The result is that the benefits from it accrue to people in direct proportion to the productive capacity of the farm and, therefore, in inverse proportion to the need of the individual for assistance.  I can see nothing whatever wrong in arranging to do something which will, in fact, be related more directly to the need of the person for assistance than to the increasing of production.  I agree that, in the economic context, the increasing of production is important but there are also social considerations to be taken into account.  I can see no more objection to providing some income supplement for small farmers than to providing assistance for industry or to providing subsidy on fertilisers, lime, milk or any other item of production in regard to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy Tully <Col N="600" /> tries to pretend that there is not some graded relief for farms with valuations between £20 and £33.  There cannot be any Deputy who is not capable of making out a simple table for himself showing exactly the position of farmers with valuations of £20, £21, £22 and so on, up to £33, previous to the introduction of this Bill and subsequent to it. If any Deputy will go to the trouble of making out such a table, he will see that the result of this Bill is to give a perfectly graded system of relief in the range of valuations from £20 to £33.</P>
    <P>At present the person on £20 valuation gets relief on 80 per cent of that valuation.  In other words, he pays his rates on £4 valuation.  Now he will pay none.  A person at present on, say, £25 valuation, pays his rates on £4 of his valuation under £20 on .7 of the other £5, that is, £3.5.  In other words, he pays on £7 10s valuation at present. When the Bill is enacted, he will pay nothing on the first £20 and he will pay on the portion between £20 and £25, that is, on £5 valuation.  Here the man with the £20 valuation gets relief on £4 and the £25 man gets relief on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amending Bill is three-fold:</P>
      <P>(a)  to facilitate the serving of warning notices on parents of children who are absenting themselves from school;</P>
      <P>(b)  to provide machinery whereby a child may be produced before the court when the parent will not, or cannot, do so;</P>
      <P>(c)  to raise the maxima of certain fines imposed under the 1926 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1926 Act, before a summons may be served on a defaulting parent, a warning notice must first be served so that the parent may have an opportunity of ensuring the regular attendance of his child at school.  The <Col N="603" /> notice must be served on the particular parent who, in the event of subsequent proceedings, is liable to be prosecuted and in practice this normally means the father.</P>
    <P>The need for personal service of the warning notice was raised in the courts towards the end of 1963 and I am advised that, under the Act as it stands, personal service should be effected in every case.  This causes considerable practical difficulty in the bigger centres of population, such as Dublin.  The difficulty is partly due to the fact that fathers are often out at work and not available during the normal duty hours of school attendance officers and partly to the fact that in some cases&mdash;and usually the worst ones&mdash;the fathers, though at home, will not answer the door.  I propose, therefore, to amend the 1926 Act to allow for service of the warning notice either personally or by registered post.</P>
    <P>The 1926 Act provided that the parent of a child to whom the prosecution relates may be ordered by the court to produce the child before it.  If the parent fails to produce the child he is liable to be fined but the Act provides no machinery whereby the child may be produced before the court on the failure of the parent to obey the court order.  It has hitherto been the practice to issue a warrant for arrest, as the presence of the child in court is considered to be virtually indispensable in cases of incorrigible absenteeism and emphatically so where there is a question of the child's committal to an industrial school.  I am advised that the purpose of the Act would best be served by the introduction of a provision specifically designed to ensure the attendance of the child when required; this I now propose to do.</P>
    <P>After 40 years, it is felt that the scale of certain fines in the Act needs revision, if the fines are to serve their purpose, that is to put ample pressure on parents to send their children to school regularly.  Because of the changes in money values in the interim, the imposition of fines within the maxima laid down in the Act of 1926, <Col N="604" /> would in present circumstances, tend to bring the enforcement of the Act into disrepute.  I propose, therefore, to amend the relevant sections of the Act by increasing the maxima 20/- and 40/-to £5 and £10 respectively.</P>
    <P>In order to tighten up procedure further I also propose to introduce certain drafting amendments, on Committee Stage, to sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill brings the school attendance legislation up to date and tightens up the procedure.  The Minister should be careful about the section ordering children to be produced in court.  I know there are children&mdash;perhaps more in the cities than elsewhere&mdash;whose attendance at school it is difficult to ensure.  Perhaps the Government and those concerned could try to advise parents and encourage them to send their children to school.  It is only as a last resort that children should be apprehended and brought to court.</P>
      <P>In the city there are school attendance officers.  They are probably the best people to deal with children.  It is a pity that service could not be extended to the country because it is a fact that when a garda calls to the house to bring children to school, it has a bad effect, in many cases, on the children.  I wonder would there be any possibility of having that service extended to the country areas?  We agree with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We also believe the Bill is necessary but there are a couple of comments I should like to make.  I am not too happy about the section which gives authority to a garda to apprehend or arrest children without the parents being present.  We have to be very careful about that. Under the law as it stands at present, the parents or guardians would have to be present.  It would be a pity if that were so relaxed that a garda could stop a child on the street and arrest him or her no matter what the age of the child, because he or she was not attending at school.  That could possibly be abused.  I should hate to see a child of tender years being taken <Col N="605" /> into the custody of the law.  There must be some protection in this matter of arresting a child without the parents or guardian being present.  I agree that there are parents who would not open the door.  I also know that there are parents who deliberately keep children at home.  That is something we do not like.</P>
      <P>I also understand that it has become the practice in a certain type of factory which employs juvenile labour not to be too particular about the age of the child when starting work.  Officially they are supposed to be 14 years, but it does occur that they start at 13 or 13½ years.  If the inspection of the school attendance record were not too exact, we could find child labour being re-introduced.  My Party agree with me that the school leaving age should be raised to 16 years and the sooner the better.  The fact that the social welfare provisions do not make arrangements for the insurance of children under 16 years tends to help this sort of thing.  If they had to get an insurance card, they would have to produce their birth certificates.  The employer could not then pretend he did not know the age of the child.  I also understand that in some local authority institutions it is not unusual to find girls of 13 years working as wardsmaids and kitchen helps.  This should not be allowed, and any assistance the Minister wants to prevent that from happening should be given to him by the House, as I am sure it will be.</P>
      <P>With regard to fines, it is only reasonable that the fines should be increased if there are people who care so little about their children's future that they do not insist on sending them to school, or deliberately keep them away.  This is wrong and the Minister is perfectly right in deciding that the fine should be more substantial than it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difficulty arises in the country districts where children may have to travel four or five miles to school.  It is all very well to say that public transport is to be laid on, but this year and next year it will not be possible to supply transport in all areas.  This means that there will continue to be <Col N="606" /> areas in which children will have to travel over bad roads to the nearest school, and there may be a record of these children being unable to attend at school when the weather is bad.  I am sure this could be taken into account if the question of a prosecution should arise, because the parents might be penalised, not for abusing the children or neglecting them, but because they tried to protect them from ill health by refusing to allow them to travel long distances to school when the weather was bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to welcome this amendment of the Act of 1926.  I know that the school attendance officers will welcome this Bill too because up to now their job has been most frustrating.  So far as the Garda and the courts are concerned, this Bill will make the machinery operate much more smoothly.  In my opinion, any parent who denies his child the right to be educated is an enemy of society, and I would not spare him in any way the inconvenience of going to court. This amending Bill is most welcome and I know it will be very well received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I should like to make.  On most occasions when children are kept at home from school, they are ill.  Fortunately it may be only one illness during a year but some children may suffer from chronic illness, such as bronchitis, and they may be ill for one or two weeks and this pattern may be repeated occasionally throughout the year.  Most parents are particularly anxious about such children and in the circumstances mentioned by Deputy Tully, they may be kept at home for a day or two due to bad weather because the parents feel they might get a cold or may have been advised to take particular care of such children in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be necessary to send for a doctor but I can see a pattern arising in which their enforced absence from school for periods througout the year might give rise to the necessity for a medical certificate.  This would place an unusual burden on many parents. <Col N="607" /> As a remedy I suggest that the parents of such children should be entitled to get a certificate stating that the children are suffering from a particular illness because of which it might be necessary to keep them from school for one or two days during a particular period.  I suggest it should be sufficient for the parents to submit this certificate and that this would exempt them in respect of such children, would leave them free to keep such children at home on a bad day and that they would not have to answer for it.  Most teachers know the families in their areas who are anxious to get education for their children and they also know those who are not.  I think my suggestion would help the administration of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the manner in which the House has received this proposal.  On the points raised by Deputies L'Estrange and Tully, I should like to point out that it is only as a last resort that a child is brought before the court.  It arises only when the question of sending the child to an industrial school is being considered.  That is the only time.  I quite agree it should be only as a last resort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The parent might be arrested but we still would not get the child.  If the question of sending the child to an industrial school arises, the child must be before the court because the district justice might require to question the child, to see him, to learn about his background.  It might be a child on whom it would not be necessary to take action.  In any event, I do not think there need be any undue anxiety about this because these things can be done in a discreet way and if the co-operation of the parents exists, there is no probability of the child being arrested and marched through the streets.  He can be told to go and if he does not, a garda can go to the house and bring him up.</P>
      <P>There is an Act to prevent the employment of children before they reach the age of 14 years.  It is true that the Government have come to a decision to raise the school leaving age to 15 years by 1970.  I agree with Deputy James Tully on this point: I should like to see the age raised to 16 years.  However, this matter will be re-examined as to how far we can go.  I think it is everyone's wish&mdash;it was the recommendation of the Commission on Juvenile Employment&mdash;that the leaving age should be 16 years. It is inevitable, and even though we may initially only jump from 14 years to 15 years, we shall eventually raise the age to 16 years when all factors have been taken into consideration. The question of employment of a child after compulsory school leaving age is, of course, outside the scope of this Bill.  It involves a big social problem in which other Ministers and other Departments are concerned.  We all deprecate attempts that have been made throughout the years&mdash;and I am sorry to say are still made by certain employers&mdash;to exploit child labour.</P>

      <P>The only answer is to schedule certain employments into which children will not be allowed even after school leaving age&mdash;jobs <Col N="609" /> such as messenger boys, menial tasks involving the children being out in all sorts of weather.  However this is outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Briscoe for his comments.  In reply to Deputy Gibbons, I do not think there will be any difficulty in accepting the type of medical certificate he suggested.  I agree that cases such as he mentioned can and do arise and I will have a look into his points.  Any reasonable excuse, such as illness, will be accepted for absence.  I should point out, though, that these things could be abused. Medical certificates are not necessary for short absences, only for long ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1967, made by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to deal with the two amending schemes in one statement.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the scheme is to bring the statutory requirement relating to abatement of pension in the case of retired national and secondary school teachers into the line generally with the position which has obtained since 1st January, 1965 in the case of public service pensioners as a result of the provisions of the Pensions (Abatement) Act, 1965.  For this reason also the new provisions in the case of the retired teachers are being brought into effect as from 1st January, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing provisions the pension of a retired teacher who is appointed to a post for which he is paid salary from public funds has his pension abated or suspended entirely, depending on the amount of the remuneration of his new post.  The amending schemes remove the provision <Col N="610" /> for abatement or suspension of the pension in the case of a retired teacher who is employed otherwise than in the teaching service in which he served immediately before retirement.  The relevant paragraph in this respect in the case of the amending scheme for national teachers is 9 (2) and, in the case of the secondary teachers' scheme, it is paragraph 9.</P>
    <P>Other amendments, of a relatively minor nature, being effected by the amending schemes are:</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 7 of both schemes enable a simplification of existing procedures for the award of pensions to be effected so as to make for greater expedition in this regard.  These are purely technical amendments.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs 8 of both schemes place a limit of 40 years to the total pensionable service with which a person may be credited in the two teaching services &mdash;national and secondary.  This is the maximum period reckonable under all single schemes.</P>
    <P>Other amendments relate to the national teachers' scheme only.  Paragraphs 9 (1) and 11 taken together deal with the case of a retired teacher who is eligible for the award of a pension at the date of retirement but who dies without having claimed it.  Authorisation is being given for the submission of a claim for such pension by his legal personal representative.  The provision enables payment to be made of whatever pension might be due from the date of retirement to the date of death in addition to the usual lump sum payable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 provides for the award of pensionable credit to a teacher for a certain period of service given by him in the employment of the Irish Folklore Commission before his re-entry into the teaching service.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to approve these amending schemes which, I am sure it will be agreed, are of a non-controversial nature.</P>

      <P>The same applies with regard to the Labour Party, except for one point.  I am rather interested in this.  I have said this before and it is no harm to say it again.  It appears as if we are prepared to give abatement to those who are going to be employed in a job which they know nothing about but if they are re-employed in a job which they know well, and in which anybody else doing that job would get full pay, the State decides that they must take it up at a smaller salary.  If they are taking up some other post which they are learning, this does not apply.  It is only a comment but it has struck me on a number of occasions that something could be done about it.  Perhaps the Minister on some occasion might get round to changing this.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of serious inconvenience being caused to bus passengers by reason of the transfer or the reduction in the number of bus stops.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the statement by the Minister for Justice in reply to a question by the Deputy on the same subject on 30th May, 1967.  That statement pointed out that while the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, has statutory powers to give directions as to the location of individual bus stops, those powers could not properly be exercised to overrule the wishes of CIE unless it became necessary to do so in order to ensure that a particular bus stop did not create a serious avoidable traffic hazard or obstruction to traffic.  In all other cases, the decision as to where bus stops should be sited is a matter for CIE.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that the alteration in the numbers and location of bus stops is a continuing process and is carried out in conjunction with the Garda and in accordance of passengers is given every consideration and all representations are taken into account.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Government have decided that the grants for farmers' roads, bog roads, and minor drainage works, jointly servicing two or more landholders, will in future be administered under a single scheme.

The rates of contribution from landholders with low average valuations will range from 2½ per cent in the case of valuations under £5.  As this compares with a minimum contribution of 10 per cent under the existing Rural Improvement schemes it will facilitate participation in the new scheme by landholders in the congested western areas on much the same basis as the Minor Employment Schemes.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, the council were notified on 31st March, 1967, of an allocation of £100,000 for expenditure in 1967-68 on house purchase and reconstruction loans and supplementary housing grants.  With the £25,000 approximately which they had available to them at that date, this allocation would enable them to spend about £125,000 on grants and loans in 1967-68 as against expenditure on these services in the preceding year of about £95,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formalities for a loan of £100,000 from the local loans fund for the payment of supplementary housing grants, for which the council applied on 3rd May, were completed by them <Col N="648" /> on 9th June and payment of an instalment of £60,000 was made from the fund on 13th June.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from certain statutory conditions and disqualifications of general application, the eligibility of an unemployed person for unemployment assistance is affected by the amount of his assessed means, the area of his residence and whether he has dependants.  These variables make <Col N="652" /> it impracticable to categorise eligible persons by reference to means and valuation.  Broadly speaking, however, the general yearly means limit is £188 10s but this amount is increased, if there are child dependants, by £26 for each of the first two and £13 for each other child.  Thus, the means limit for, say, a man, wife and four children is £266 10s&mdash;which will, incidentally, become £292 10s in August next on enactment of the Budget proposals for increases in rates of unemployment assistance.  Land valuation affects eligibility only in so far as it is a factor in the calculation of means.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if previously appointed architects, consulting engineers and quantity surveyors to the Cork Regional Hospital were dismissed; and, if so, if he will give deails of (a) the date of dismissal, (b) the manner in which it was effected, (c) the date or dates upon which the persons or firms concerned were informed of the dismissal and (d) the authority under which the dismissals were effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy a couple of weeks ago in replying to supplementary questions, the work already carried out by the consultants employed by the Cork Health Authority for an earlier scheme for a regional hospital has been paid for by that authority.</P>
      <P>The project for the planning and erection of a general hospital is now being dealt with by the Cork Hospitals Board.  The Board recently submitted a recommendation that the decision to proceed by way of an international competition for the selection of an architect should be abandoned.  The final decision taken in that regard and the procedure to be adopted for the future planning of the hospital will have an important bearing on the appointment of consultants for the work.</P>
      <P>I should like to add, as Deputy Barrett is here, that last week I declined to give the information requested as I considered the way in which the question was framed was unfair and left me in the same dilemma as the lawyer who put it to his client: &ldquo;Are you beating your wife?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Minister that at no time did I think he was making the allegation that I was beating my wife.  I quite understood the way in which he used the term, but when it appeared in the Press, it was a source of embarrassment to me.  When the Minister used the term &ldquo;Have you stopped beating your wife?&rdquo; he wanted to convey that I had asked the same sort of question. The question: &ldquo;Have you stopped beating your wife?&rdquo; is very difficult to answer.  If you say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, it means you are still beating her; and if you say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it means you have been beating her.  I am hoping that the Press which published the Minister's statement will also publish the explanation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person in receipt of institutional assistance, including an old age pensioner holding a medical card, may be required to contribute such sum as the health authority considers appropriate towards the cost of his maintenance out of so much of his income as exceeds £1 a week.  In determining the amount of the contribution to be made, the health authority must take into account any standing commitments such as rents, rates, hire purchase payments or insurance premiums payable by the person in receipt of the assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a somewhat similar question on 29th September, 1966 I consider that these arrangements are reasonable and that there is no case for changing them.
