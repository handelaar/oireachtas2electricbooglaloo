    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to appoint a new member of the Government to deal with all matters relating to EEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of the European Economic Community impinge on the responsibilities of many Ministers, and it would not be possible or desirable to assign all matters relating to the Community to any individual Minister.  The question of designating a member of the Government to co-ordinate the negotiations for Ireland's entry to the Community is a different matter, which will be decided at the appropriate time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether as a result of the emphasis placed on associate status with the EEC for this country by the President of France in his recent discussions the Government will now explore this possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While not accepting the implication in the Deputy's question, I must point out that our objective is full membership and that our application for such membership is at present receiving consideration by the Council of Ministers of the Communities. It is clearly not appropriate in the circumstances to be exploring alternative possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="416" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the President of France at that meeting in fact issued an open invitation to the Taoiseach and asked him if he had ever considered the possibilities of associate membership and if the position is that at the moment there would be no objection on the part of the President of France to an application by us for associate membership, is the Taoiseach saying that we, in fact, are not considering this course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, it is not for the President of France to issue invitations to any applicant country.  The decision on membership will be taken by the Council of Ministers representing all the member countries of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true, but the Taoiseach will accept that the President of France plays quite a large part in the application possibilities of any country and I think it is significant that the President of France said that he has no objection to this country seeking associate membership.  In fact, he asked the Taoiseach whether he had explored fully the possibility of associate membership.  If, therefore, the President of France, who is a significant member of the whole affair, issued an invitation to the Taoiseach to explore the possibility of associate membership and if at this moment, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, our possibilities of full membership are receding into the far distance, has the Taoiseach not considered taking up the invitation of the President of France?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated clearly after my meeting with the President of France that he referred to the suggestion made to the British that they might consider associate membership and asked me if we had ever considered that form of membership.  I told him then, and I still adhere to this position, that our application is one for full membership and unless and until the negotiations on that application would seem to be delayed for a long time, we had not considered any alternative form of membership in the meantime. With regard to the suggestion of an <Col N="417" /> interim arrangement, I said that could be considered at the appropriate time but only in the context of full membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is then that it is not, as the Taoiseach's predecessor said, full membership or nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, full membership is what we are going for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If full membership is refused, the Taoiseach will then consider the possibility of association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not considered the position if and when full membership is refused.  It has not been refused and we have not considered an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Taoiseach's mind and the Government's mind is blank to the idea of association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not blank at all. I have said before that the Government have been considering all aspects of our joining the EEC but at the moment our application is for full membership. That application is before the Council of Ministers.  A decision has not been given on that application and unless a decision is made refusing our membership, then we have not yet, or will not until then, consider an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say was this offer of President de Gaulle's rejected at the meeting of the Taoiseach with President de Gaulle or was it rejected in a subsequent statement issued by the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not reject any offer because I did not get an offer.  The President of France asked me if we had considered associate membership in the same fashion as his Ministers had suggested to Britain.  I said we had not, but then it evolved in the course of our conversation that, in the event of the British application being delayed for a considerable time, he would support an interim arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Community. I said we had not considered that because we would have to take <Col N="418" /> into account our obligations under GATT and under the Free Trade Area Agreement and also our desire for playing a full part in the Community and that could only be realised as full members of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>How could our obligations under GATT and under the Free Trade Area Agreement be any different in either form of membership? Surely what is applicable in respect of one is applicable in respect of both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An interim arrangement with the Community would mean negotiation with GATT on tariff reductions. The tariff reductions arranged under GATT have to be extended to all member countries.  On the other hand, we have arrangements with Britain whereby certain preferences for goods which we send to Britain oblige us to give reciprocal treatment to them.  All those arrangements would have to be taken into account.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there as yet any clarification or agreement as to what the President said?  And further, can I take it that the Government are considering two plans, one for full membership and the other for association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said as clearly as my recollection goes, remembering that the conversation lasted over a full hour, what the President of France said to me and what he said in a subsequent speech, which has been published widely, at the luncheon which he gave to my party and to me. If that is capable of interpretation one way or another, it is not for me to say.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked a question by the Deputy and I should be permitted to answer it.  May I repeat again that we are negotiating on the basis of full membership?  I have said three or four times in reply to supplementary questions that we are not <Col N="419" /> considering associate membership at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that was his recollection of what he said and this was his interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not confuse the two.  I have said as fully and as clearly as I can what the subject matter of the conversation I had was and what was said by the President of France.  As far as interpretation goes, that refers to the speech the President made subsequently, which was issued in French to the world press.  If that is capable of interpretation one way or another, that is a matter for the interpreters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state, with reference to the statement issued to the Government Information Bureau on the proposed transfer of certain Government Departments, or portion of Government Departments, to provincial centres, why this statement was not made to the Dáil; and if an opportunity will be provided for discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the speculation in the press on the subject of transferring certain Government Departments to provincial centres, I considered it desirable to take the earliest opportunity that presented itself to announce the Government's decision.  The matter may appropriately be discussed in connection with the Departmental Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Dáil was meeting on the day on which the statement was made, surely <Col N="420" /> there would have been an opportunity for the Taoiseach to make a statement on such an important matter to the Dáil rather than issue the statement in the way in which it was issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the plain fact that the reason the Taoiseach rushed his statement out was that the Minister for Lands broke the painter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come to realities.  If I had made that statement in the Dáil I am sure the Deputy would have listened to the statement and would have asked for time later on to comment on it.  I made the statement through the ordinary channel.  There will be an opportunity for the Dáil, if it wishes, to debate this matter during discussion on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree with me on this?  There is an obvious difference between issuing a statement in the case of devaluation, which was made on Saturday when the Dáil was not meeting, and the day on which this other statement was made, a day on which the Dáil was meeting. The only conclusion is that the Taoiseach did not want a debate, that he is trying to avoid a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate and any objections the Deputy has could be made in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say what staff associations have been consulted, what effect this is likely to have on recruitment and whether personal considerations have been taken into account in regard to those civil servants, many of whom were recruited on the understanding that they would not be transferred from a central appointment?  Can the Taoiseach say what is their position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a civil servant and I assumed on the day I contracted to accept appointment that I would have to go to any part of the country the Government would send me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a net increase of 19 in the number of complaints received by Bord Fáilte about hotel and guesthouse prices in the period January-October, 1967, as compared with the corresponding period in 1966, the number of complaints in these periods being 344 and 325 respectively.</P>
      <P>In all these cases Bord Fáilte took up the complaints with the hotel or guesthouse owner involved.  Where complaints of overcharging were justified a refund was obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy it so happens that Bord Fáilte conducted a survey of travellers in 1966. The question was asked of those of them who had stayed in paid accommodation whether or not they considered the charge reasonable.  Less than ten per cent considered the charge unreasonable.  A further question was asked of British travellers, excluding Irish people resident in Britain, to compare their most recent holidays in Britain and on the Continent with those in Ireland.  The question covered all charges of transport, hotels, private purchases <i>et cetera.</i> The result in respect of those whose last holiday was in Britain was that 16 per cent said that Ireland was much better value, 26 per cent that Ireland was better value, 33 per cent that Ireland was the same value.  Nine per cent said that Ireland was worse value, one per cent said that Ireland was much worse value and 15 per cent made no reply.  In respect of those whose last holiday was on the Continent, 5 per cent said that Ireland was much better value, ten per cent said that Ireland was better value; nine per cent said it was the same value, eight per cent that it was worse value; three per cent said it was much worse value; and 66 per cent gave no reply. <Col N="424" /> In further reply to the Deputy, 82 per cent of the hotel bedrooms in this country are at prices of 40/- or below for bed and breakfast and 90 per cent of guesthouse bedrooms of 30/- or below.</P>

      <P>People are now getting used to answering innumerable questions in relation to facts of one kind or another and this was left to the emotional feeling of the people. One person's idea of worse value may be different from another's.  If the Deputy likes, he can add one to the other and it will still reflect favourably on the hotel price position.  I have already referred to the <i>Financial Times</i> report on the cost of accommodation, the cost of an evening out and the cost of a food basket in some 20 countries. We come well out of that.  It is perfectly possible that there are black sheep here as in other communities.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, does not apply to harbour authorities.</P>
      <P>The Harbours Act, 1946, contains provisions governing superannuation schemes for employees of harbour authorities.  The harbour authorities at Dublin, Limerick and Waterford have adopted superannuation schemes under the Act and the Cork Harbour Commissioners are awaiting actuarial advice in regard to a scheme which they propose to adopt.  Meanwhile, they are paying pensions under earlier legislation. There is no statutory obligation on the smaller authorities to adopt superannuation schemes and none of them has as yet adopted a superannuation scheme under the Act, except the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners who have adopted a scheme in respect of their harbour secretary.  Some of the smaller authorities have <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements for the payment of pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will take immediate steps to have some improvement effected in the television reception in Fermoy town, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement of television reception is a matter for Radio Telefís Éireann.  As I said when introducing the Estimate for my Department on 16th May, 1967, the Authority is aware that reception is still not satisfactory in many small areas comprising about 2 per cent of the country, and plans are being worked out for some of the more populous of these pockets but disproportionately heavy capital expenditure would be involved in filling in many of them and I cannot say how far money will be available for further transposers.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Authority has not yet completed its survey of areas of poor reception and that no plans for additional transposers have yet been approved.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the quality of reception varies considerably in different parts of Fermoy.  Viewers whose reception is not satisfactory should ensure that their sets are properly adjusted and that they have suitable aerials for the location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the House will know that I have asked questions during the past four years about the poor television reception in Fermoy and district.  Would the Minister now say whether the last part of his reply indicates that he is thinking contrary to the thinking of his predecessor, Deputy Brennan, who replied to a similar question 12 months ago? I was then assured there would be an immediate and effective improvement in the quality of the reception in Fermoy and district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor did not promise an immediate improvement in television reception in that area.  He said, on 23rd March, 1966:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Fermoy area, County Cork, is one of a number of <Col N="431" /> areas in the country where television reception is not entirely satisfactory. As I said in answer to a similar question on March 9th, the authority is carrying out surveys in these areas with a view to deciding what further action, if any, should be taken to improve reception.</P>
    <P>In further reply to the Deputy, I have said that only two per cent of the country receives inadequate reception. That is a good standard by comparison with other countries.  There will be an improvement but I cannot say when, because it involves heavy capital expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the television licensees in Fermoy and district will have to suffer on without any hope whatever of getting value for their licence fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say they were without hope of getting value for their licence fees.  As the Deputy knows, there is an enormous capital programme and there are priorities. Besides, 98 per cent reception is not a bad figure.  We are doing our best to improve it.  Booster transformers have been placed in various parts of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>The revised arrangements provide for delivery in Aghinagh commencing at 10.0 a.m. and ending at <Col N="432" /> 1.40 p.m. in the outlying areas.  An improvement of half an hour in these times will be made shortly.  These delivery times are comparable with those which obtain in many other similar areas.  It is not feasible, I regret, to revert to the former arrangements under which the postman was based at Aghinagh and commenced delivery there at 7.35 a.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell me if there were any private discussions or consultations with the people in this parish before the re-arrangement of the services, which means a delay of between three and three-and-a-half hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not any previous consultations.  In fact, deliveries in Aghinagh up to then were exceptionally early for a predominantly rural area.  This came about through the amalgamation of a complete area, giving a general improvement of conditions to an adjoining area.  The position was that the Aghinagh area enjoyed a far earlier delivery service than could normally be expected because the postman, with permission, delivered the mail in his own private car which meant that Aghinagh received exceptional treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is satisfied that all possible precautions have been taken to prevent an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, stringent veterinary controls are operated by my Department at all times on the import of livestock and livestock products, as well as on materials which might represent a disease risk.</P>
      <P>These controls have been intensified and extended in view of the serious foot and mouth disease situation in Britain.  Imports of livestock, including horses, from Britain have been totally suspended, and the importation of dogs and cats from that country has been brought under licensing control.  The importation from Britain of meat products, plants, including raw vegetables, used agricultural or horticultural machinery and equipment, and vehicles and containers which have been used in Britain for the transport of live animals has been stopped.</P>
      <P>The arrangements at ports and airports for the disinfection of persons from abroad who may have been in contact with possible sources of infection have been intensified.  All persons entering the country from Britain and the Continent are required to fill in a card giving information on any possible contacts they may have had with animals or animal products and the extent of disinfection is immediately decided on the basis of the particulars on the card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customs authorities have been alerted to the need for the utmost vigilance in operating the various veterinary <Col N="438" /> import controls, including those applying to used clothing and footwear, straw, and any meat products in personal baggage or in parcels.</P>
    <P>Appeals have been made to the livestock and meat trade interests not to travel between Britain and Ireland during the present critical period and all cattle buyers have been asked to appoint local agents to transact their business for the present.</P>
    <P>Visits to Britain by officers of my Department have been suspended and the universities and State and semi-State bodies who are associated with agriculture have agreed to ban visits to Britain by their staffs, save in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Owners of marts and salesyards have been asked to display warning notices on their premises and to provide disinfection facilities at all entrances and exits.  Special attention is being given to the sterilisation of all meat containers.</P>
    <P>All outdoor officers of my Department and of the county committees of agriculture have been instructed to disinfect themselves before entering and leaving farms or farm premises, and to advise farmers to place a bath of disinfectant or straw soaked in disinfectant at the entrance to their farms or farm premises.  Other Departments whose officers might visit farms in the course of their duties have been asked to issue similar instructions.  All AI station personnel have also been reminded of the need for strict observance of disinfection procedures in the course of their duties.</P>
    <P>Close liaison is maintained with the Six Counties and British veterinary authorities regarding the measures necessary to protect the country as a whole from the threat of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>While these precautionary measures may seem elaborate, I have no illusions about the risks to which this country is exposed at the present time or the appalling upset to our economy which an outbreak of the disease here would cause.  The Government are considering the introduction of further safeguards, but it must be accepted that, with the widespread incidence of <Col N="439" /> the disease in Britain, the danger to us will continue while people can move freely into this country, North or South, from Britain.  Nothing short of the complete cessation of traffic, human and other, from Britain to this country in present circumstances would eliminate the risks to which we are now exposed.  The Government can do many things by way of regulation and restriction, but the ultimate responsibility must rest on the people themselves.  If everybody, and particularly people coming here from Britain, behaves sensibly and carefully, we can still keep this disease out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Agriculture, may I be permitted to ask two questions arising out of Deputy Corish's question and the Minister's statement?  First, and I not right in saying that our dominant danger is straw in any form and is there any means by which the Minister can more emphatically emphasise to those more interested than he and I are of the appalling danger of bringing in straw either as packing, in luggage or in any other way?  Secondly, am I not correct in saying that the decision to slaughter, which has been a common decision of <Col N="441" /> our Government and the Government of Great Britain, has over the long term proved a much more economical and effective procedure than the decision to inoculate which might in the short term be more expensive and in the long term exclude us completely from access to markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the latter part of the Deputy's question or assertion, it is quite true that the slaughter policy adopted here and in Britain has proved in several ways to be better than vaccination and nothing has happened so far to change the view commonly accepted that the slaughter policy is the best in our circumstances.</P>
      <P>In so far as the importation of straw or any such matter is concerned, we have taken all precautions: at least, I think we have.  If anybody is aware of anything I would be very glad of immediate information from any Member of the House who may have found that there has been some slip-up but, so far as is humanly possible, we have excluded the risk of importation of any such matter.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Kyne</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he has received a complaint from the South East Coast Fishermen's Association to the effect that their members are being subjected to unfair competition by the research vessels <i>Cú Feasa</i> and <i>Cú na Mara</i> which, it is alleged, fish commercially and sell in direct competition with the herring fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These vessels are engaged at present in rendering a valuable service to fishermen in locating shoals of herrings and in conducting research into the shoaling habits of herrings in the vicinity of Dunmore East.  The catching of herrings in commercial quantities is incidental to, but an essential part of, this work and I am satisfied that there is no unfair competition with the herring fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that these two boats were employed in order to help fishermen and to advise them where the shoals of herring were.  This they are not engaging in now.  They are engaging in commercial fishing and they are at a tremendous advantage over the ordinary fishermen because they are not entirely dependent on their catch and can, therefore, leave the herring grounds and arrive at the harbour an hour or two before the ordinary fishing fleet; consequently they are in a position to command the best price, and this to the disadvantage of the ordinary fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This in-pair trawling is regarded as a very effective, if not the most effective, method of shoal fishing. It has only been possible this year in Dunmore East.  Undoubtedly two commercial catches were made.  Now what do we do?  Do we dump the fish overboard or do we bring it into port, as we have been doing?  In regard to the <Col N="443" /> two days about which complaint is made, the 15th and 16th, on the 15th out of 700 cran landed at Dunmore East, these two trawlers accounted for 100.  They fetched the highest price. That may have been because they were in earlier than the others.  The price was good&mdash;£7 5s per cran.  All the other crans were sold, and it beats me, therefore, how the sale of herrings from our own two boats could be regarded as unfair competition.</P>
      <P>On the 16th, the trawlers accounted for somewhere around 25 crans.  Again, the 25 crans were sold at £5 14s 0d per cran, which was not as good a price as on the previous day, although the catch was smaller.  However, I presume those are the difficulties inherent in marketing.  Again, it was the top price of the day.  No fish were left unsold.  The total percentage of landings accounted for on these two days was not a significant factor and it is not one the fishermen should, I think, complain about.  Had fish remained unsold as a result of very heavy landings by these in-pair trawlers one could understand complaint, but, at the moment, I am at a loss to understand the complaints, particularly as these vessels are there to help the fishermen.  They have rendered valuable help and will, I am sure, continue to do so.  Other parts of the coast are crying out for these vessels to explore the availability of fish, but I am loath to take them out of Dunmore East merely because someone feels there is unfair competition.  They are doing a good job and it would be wrong to take them away.</P>

      <P>The objects of the National Building Advisory Council are stated in Article 2 of their memorandum of association dated 15th December, 1964.  In brief, they are to survey the volume of work in the building and construction industry, to suggest measures to equate resources and demand and to promote stability, efficiency and productivity in the industry.</P>
      <P>The Council submitted two reports of surveys of the building and construction industry in June and November, 1965, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who was at that time the Minister responsible for the Council.  The recommendations in the larger of these reports are summarised in the reply to Question No. 20 of 16th March, 1966.  The Council have also been responsible for compiling and revising a register of contractors engaged in the industry.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that the Council, in the relatively short period of its existence as a separate body has done some quite useful work, I feel that the steps taken for the merger between the Council and An Foras Forbartha, to which I referred in reply to question No. 16 on 14th November, 1967, will lead to a more co-ordinated approach to the problems involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Statements have already been made by the Taoiseach and myself on devaluation and its effects.  I propose to deal further with the matters raised in these questions in introducing the Estimate for my Department on Tuesday next, 28th November.  The debate on the Estimate will provide an opportunity for discussion of all the relevant issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate, either then or before it, the precise effect which devaluation will have on the cost of certain imports such as oil, petrol and wheat and also the effect of the revised interest rates in respect of housing?  Can the Minister indicate whether the Government have any proposals in mind to ease the problem in respect of the building industry and house purchase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to deal as fully as possible on Tuesday next with all of these matters though, of course, a number of aspects of this matter will take some considerable time to come into full perspective.  I think, however, I should say at this stage that one of the main aspects of the whole matter from our point of view is that of prices. I would point out that the rate of devaluation itself is moderate and there should not be any question of immediate rises in prices.  Most people have stocks of one sort or another.  I would advise everybody engaged in trade and commerce, if asked to bear an increase in price, to satisfy themselves fully that such increase is justified by devaluation.  If they are in any doubt about that, they should refer the matter to my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because price control machinery is still operative on the basis that no rise in price should be permitted unless it is fully shown to be justified by increased costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this matter was to be directed towards the Taoiseach.  Would the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance be able to say now whether or not an instruction has been given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to set in motion immediately machinery to ensure price stability and the prevention of profiteering?  The <Col N="469" /> Minister says he will make a statement on this matter on Tuesday or Wednesday next.  We appreciate that.  In the meantime, certain increases have taken place.  I am informed today that shipping freight charges have been increased.  There was a report in one of the newspapers this morning that certain items of drink were increased in price.  There was no notification to that effect.  Might I also remind the Minister of what he said recently during one of his television appearances, namely, that we should not have devalued if Britain had not done so, that we should not have changed our rate of interest if Britain had not done so?  Is there any guarantee that the Government will ensure that we shall have greater monetary independence in the future or is it the position that as soon as Britain devalues, we do likewise and, as soon as she changes her bank rate, we change ours?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday I was pointing to the inability of the Government to deal with our drainage problems west of the Shannon.  I dealt with the Government's promises to drain the Shannon some years ago and their failure to carry this out when the Roscommon by-election was over.  I also dealt with the proposed drainage of the Suck which has not been carried out and I doubt very much if it will be carried out under this Government.  I was just about to deal with the board which operates as between Roscommon and Galway, the joint drainage board for the Suck. In recent years, this board has spent a certain amount of money on the upkeep of the river.  The thing that strikes one is that it is only in winter that they carry out any work on the river and many people who work on that drainage scheme in wintertime tell me that all they do is go around in boats cutting rushes.  I suppose it is better to have them doing that than to have them sitting at home getting the Government subsidy for doing nothing. This is a very serious problem for <Col N="474" /> people in the West, particularly small farmers, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, if he can, to bring the drainage of the Suck nearer to the top of the list of priorities.</P>
      <P>I should like to see some kind of permanency being instituted for those who work in the Board of Works, particularly those in skilled occupations. There seems to be no permanency at present, and it would be in the Board's interests to have that permanency and it would prove a greater incentive for people to work for the Board.  During the past year, the Board of Works dealt with minor employment schemes, rural improvements schemes and bog development schemes and next year this work will be done by the Department of Local Government and the county councils.  I welcome this move, for the simple reason that last year the Board of Works were completely inactive in Galway as far as these schemes were concerned.  I do not know what amount of money was spent over the past ten years, but in Galway last year the amount was very small indeed.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Board of Works, and to other Government Departments, that as there are many people in County Galway receiving the dole, because the Government cannot offer them employment, it would be better, rather than to give them between 52s 6d and £9 a week for doing nothing, if the Board of Works were to put into operation some of these minor employment schemes, rural improvements schemes or bog development schemes, and to give these people jobs on them.  That would be a lot more sensible than the present system.</P>
      <P>Reading through the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, I see that he says the Boyne scheme will be on exhibition shortly and that he hopes that the Maigue will follow soon.  He goes on to say:</P>
      <P>As the preparatory work on these schemes finishes, technical and other staff will be freed to accelerate the other schemes in preparation, namely, the Corrib-Mask, the Erne, the Suir, the Mulkear, the Boyne, the Owenmore, the Bonet, the Dunkellin and the Lavally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Dunkellin and the Lavally <Col N="475" /> scheme in which I am interested and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give these schemes a push.  If that were done, it would be a great help to the farming community.  Further down, he mentions that works are in progress on the Moy, the Deel, the Corrib-Headford and on the Killimor-Cappagh.  I am most interested in the latter scheme which has just begun.  I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary many questions during my three years here as to when work on this scheme will begin and on each occasion he said it would begin in the new financial year.  The beginning of the financial year coincided with the county council elections.  I am delighted this scheme began, but I object to the fact that it was opened one week before the county council elections to flog the last ounce of political benefit out of it and for no other reason.  Were it not for the county council elections, it would have gone on to the next financial year.</P>

    <P>Regarding this drainage scheme, there is one part of it in a district called Turloughcor, where work was <Col N="476" /> about to start last September.  But, suddenly, an order came from a person or persons unknown that work was not to proceed with this part of the scheme.  The work would have drained approximately 700 acres, 350 acres in commonage and the rest belonging to small farmers.  About 50 small formers are concerned.  It has been stated by a person or persons unknown that if this area were drained it would affect the wild fowl life there.  Was it the Parliamentary Secretary gave the order to stop that work?

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing all my remarks through the Chair to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Somebody in authority asked the Parliamentary Secretary to stop the drainage of this river.  Yet we had local Fianna Fáil councillors saying it should be drained while their representatives here, Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, stopped the scheme.</P>
      <P>It was stated at one stage that it was the gun clubs in the district who objected to it.  It was not.  I have been in contact with them and they say it would be of much benefit to them if the river were drained.  I have tried to contact the Wild Fowl Protection Society, who, I believe, are under the Department of Lands.  I have failed to get an answer from them as to whether or not it was they who stopped it.  I believe it was.  If they are looking for a wild fowl sanctuary, Lough Corrib is about half a mile from here.  It is an area of 68 square miles and there are 365 islands in it. That should provide bird sanctuary acceptable to any wild fowl society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the people in that district to issue an order that work go ahead on this scheme.  If it is being by-passed now, when will it be done? Will it ever be done?  It should be started now.  A few years ago I made representations to the Minister for Lands regarding the Keirnaun estate in that district.  I asked him to acquire it for division among needy tenants.  It was not acquired.  It was bought by a <Col N="477" /> professional man from Mayo and not divided among the people on whose behalf I speak now and who would benefit by the drainage of the Turloughcor. On that occasion it was felt by everybody in the district that the land should have been acquired.  Is the same interest being served now by the fact that you are keeping this land as a bird sanctuary?  I have a feeling it is, but I cannot get proof of it.</P>
    <P>Everybody is talking now about the plight of the small farmer.  Deputies over there make the case that suits them best, but I am making a case for the small farmers in this district.  It is necessary that this drainage be carried out for their good, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary that work be resumed.  I could say many more things, but I feel they would be better left unsaid.  The work would have been carried out now but for the change of Government in 1957.  However, that was the will of the people and we accept it.</P>
    <P>I will conclude as I began.  A sum of £5 million out of this Estimate of £9,174,000 is being spent on a dole in the City of Dublin and the rest in bits and pieces all over the country.  Is it not the duty of the Government to give the opportunity to every individual to earn a living rather than the present system whereby he is paid a few paltry pounds a week and slowly loses his independence? It is a shame that only £4 million is being spent in the rest of the country and £5 million in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on a few matters mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I note that an extra £900,000 is to be spent this year.  This, in itself, is a good thing and an achievement in a way.  I also note it is mentioned that the Special Employment Schemes Office is transferred from the Office of Public Works. I am disappointed in a way that this scheme was taken out of the control of the Parliamentary Secretary's Office and the Department of Finance.  Down in Kerry, at any rate, we got some very good and useful schemes under way through the Office of Public Works and the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Last year approximately £28,000 <Col N="478" /> was spent in County Kerry on these schemes which covered small drainage schemes and the improvement of many private roads and also provided much useful employment during the winter.  The proof as to how much these schemes were appreciated in Kerry is the extent to which they were availed of there.  The small farmers were prepared to contribute towards the cost of these schemes when given any opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>It is a great achievement to have 842 new primary schools provided in the course of ten years or, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, close on three every fortnight.  I also welcome the fact that proposals to develop landing places at various points along the coast were examined by the Office of Public Works at the request of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries during the year.  I know recommendations were made to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and that schemes were carried out in one or two locations in South Kerry.  However, I should like very much if more attention could be given to some smaller areas and the smaller piers such as Waterville, Bealtra, Castlecove, Westcove and Banatra.  I have no doubt there would be a vast improvement in the fishing industry there if adequate landing facilities were provided.  I am very hopeful that more will be done in this regard in the coming year.</P>
      <P>We in Kerry are very grateful to the Office of Public Works for the great job which they did on the home of the Liberator, Daniel O'Connell, at Derrynane. The Office of Public Works carried out some beautiful work on this home.  This should now be a great tourist attraction and should attract many visitors from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a substantial increase in the Estimate for 1967-68 in relation to rents, rates, <i>et cetera,</i> on premises occupied by the Civil Service.  It is unfortunate that accommodation is so costly in Dublin and that many of the civil servants have to work in unhealthy and congested conditions.  I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider sending portion of his Department south where <Col N="479" /> they would have plenty of fresh air and healthy working conditions.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in particular, the proposal to increase the estimate for surveys from £22,000 to £50,000.  I believe one could not carry out half enough surveys.  Without surveying there is no point in making further plans.  I welcome the fact that the Office of Public Works has done so much in relation to coast protection; it is noted that six locations have been planned.  I should like to mention Waterville in South Kerry which is very seriously affected by coast erosion.  It is probably one of the worst areas in which the land is being eaten away, and very soon the county council will have to spend a considerable amount of money on the roads unless something is done to prevent this coast erosion.</P>
    <P>It is also gratifying to note that much more archaeological investigations are being carried out.  I would ask the Office of Public Works to work closely with the county development teams in the counties where they have these teams in relation to the carrying out of these investigations.  In some counties the teams have set up subcommittees to deal specifically with these investigations and I am sure that by contacting the secretaries of these teams the Office of Public Works would get some very useful information.</P>
    <P>I have been puzzled from time to time on a few points relating to the operation and maintenance of drainage schemes which were carried out by the Office of Public Works.  I should like to know the real reason why the maintenance of these schemes is a charge on the rates as a county-at-large charge and why it is not borne, or at least a percentage of it, by the State. There are good reasons for and against; I should like to hear the good reasons for.</P>
    <P>In relation to main drainage schemes, a lot of spoil was left on the banks of the river.  This covered up much ground and rendered quite a few acres useless.  I should like to know whether there is anything to prevent the Board of Works from <Col N="480" /> clearing away this debris or from spreading it more evenly over the land or removing it to parts of the land where it could be used effectively.</P>
    <P>As regards the four parks which are under the control of the Commissioner of Public Works, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Parliamentary Secretary for the manner in which he obtained sanction from the Minister for Local Government to get An Foras Forbartha to employ a firm of consultants to carry out a detailed survey and to make recommendations in relation to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park in Killarney and to the Killarney valley as a whole.  This report set out very clearly most of the problems facing the Government and the country in relation to the development of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, and Killarney in general which means so much to the national economy and the country from the tourist point of view.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that a special parks section should be set up in the Office of Public Works as a matter of urgency to study this report, to carry out further investigations, and to bring at least some of its recommendations into operation.  This section could not be set up half soon enough. I should also like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the courageous step he took in removing the sheep from the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park when it was considered that that was the right thing to do, having regard to the fact that the primary purpose of this park is to provide recreational facilities for the local people, for tourists and for the nation as a whole, and that the park should not be developed primarily as an agricultural centre.</P>
    <P>I should also like to recommend that a biological field section should be established in that park.  It would be an ideal centre because there are various species of flower, fauna, trees and shrubs in the park.  I should not like this park to be developed exclusively for tourist or recreational purposes. I think a model farm should be <Col N="481" /> developed there where there is prime land, well sheltered, well fenced, well watered and a magnificent farmyard and staff.  A model farm could well be developed there and it would be an attraction in its own right.  It would also form a very important part of a national park.  I am very keen on model farms and I recommended this in my speech on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and also my speech on the Budget.  I think a model farm in every county would be very desirable.  There is an opportunity now to develop a model farm as part of this national park.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether there have been any developments in the proposal to erect a cable car system from Torc Waterfall to Mangerton Mountain.  There has been much interest in this proposal and, if it is intended to go ahead with it, will the Parliamentary Secretary say if he is satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the district and the country as a whole that this type of development should take place in an area of high amenity?</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend that the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park should be developed as a national park and extended and that the special park section which should be set up in the Office of Public Works should investigate the scope and extension of this development.  Here there is a vast area of mountains and waste land.  There are also some beautiful valleys and hills.  It would also be worth while investigating the possibility of bringing the major portion of the land into public ownership.  The owners of the major portion of the land might be quite pleased to have it taken over by the State on condition that they would get employment in the park when it is developed.  I can visualise a huge park extending through Kilgarvan into Kenmare, along by Sneem through the mountains into Waterville and through Glenflesk, Shrone, and the beautiful Clydagh Valley, into Cork county, linking up with the State forest at Gloundar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> I should also like to know whether forestry fits into the future plans in relation to the development of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park and the estate in general.  I should like to know whether the forestry division are still expanding and continuing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the park itself 3,500 acres are being used by the forestry division for afforestation.  I should just like to know whether they intend to continue on a purely commercial basis, or whether they are to embark on some amenity planting.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by asking the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works to give priority to the development of this national park, to bear in mind the value of Killarney and Kerry to the Irish economy, to give it primary consideration in deciding what form its future development will take, and to take into consideration the fact that 60 per cent of the foreigners who come to this country every year come with the intention of visiting Killarney and that about 50 per cent see most of south Kerry on their tour of the country.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works, both the indoor and the outdoor staff, for their co-operation during the past year.  By and large, the people of south Kerry are very well satisfied with the way they have operated, and they will probably be more satisfied if they push ahead vigorously with a plan for the development of a national park in Killarney and south Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the Office of Public Works will undoubtedly give the Parliamentary <Col N="483" /> Secretary in charge an opportunity of explaining to the House, and indeed to the country, where his priorities lie in spending the money allocated to him in this Estimate and indeed in all his annual Estimates. The Office of Public Works covers a wide field and a great variety but the main responsibility of that Department must be implementing the legislation passed by this House.  In my opinion the main legislation passed in relation to the Office of Public Works is the Arterial Drainage Act.  I feel that the Office of Public Works are handling the whole question of arterial drainage in what can be described as a piece-meal way.</P>
      <P>A very satisfactory drainage job was carried out on the Brosna river in County Offaly.  Other major rivers followed, including the Corrib, and some time next year we are to commence a comprehensive drainage scheme on the river Boyne.  This drainage scheme on the Boyne is long overdue.  I am very glad that at least a start has been made.  I presume that to drain the Boyne from outside Edenderry to Drogheda will take a long time but the drainage of the Boyne has been the subject of agitation for many years.  I feel that the drainage of the Boyne will be a great asset to the landowners whose lands adjoin it.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what has happened to the river Nore.  Repeated requests have been made over the years by the county councils concerned, all of whom have been asking that some steps be taken to carry out a comprehensive scheme from where the Nore rises in County Laois, down to the city of Kilkenny, through Thomastown and from there to the point where it joins the Suir and the Barrow.  The river Nore, in my opinion, has been responsible for the flooding of thousands of acres of land and unless some practical steps are taken to relieve the landowners whose holdings are adjacent to the river Nore they will be in a very serious plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all understand that it is not possible to have all those major drainage schemes in operation at the <Col N="484" /> one time but surely it is not outside the bounds of possibility for the Office of Public Works to carry out in these areas some minor drainage works in preparation for the major drainage schemes.  I have seen in parts of the river Nore huge trunks of trees resting in the bed of the river.  I have seen the eyes of the bridges blocked, preventing the flow of water.  Surely, pending the carrying out of a comprehensive scheme, it should be possible for the Office of Public Works to set up a new section for the purpose of seeing that at least there is a steady flow of water and that all obstructions are removed, such obstructions as trunks of trees and blocked eyes of bridges.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have no power. The Local Authorities (Works) Act has been scrapped.  There is no legal obligation on a local authority to carry out the works and when complaints are made regarding the carrying out of those important drainage schemes we are told that nothing can be done until the comprehensive drainage scheme is carried out.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider seriously the problems not alone in relation to the river Nore but also in relation to the Barrow where there are similar problems.  By the time the Boyne and the Nore schemes have been concluded it will be time to carry out a comprehensive scheme again on the river Barrow because there are parts of the Barrow which were never attended to.  Every winter there is very serious flooding of all lands in the Barrow valley.  The Nore valley stretches from Mountrath in County Laois to Durrow and from that to Thomastown.  Surely there must be an obligation on some State Department to take the necessary steps to see that farmers' lands are clear of water.  I feel that a substantial sum of money should be provided each year for the carrying out of those works pending the main drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>The Barrow Drainage Board which is responsible for the maintenance of the river is a board comprised of representatives of the county councils and others whose functions are very tied up and very limited under regulations. According to the law, the Barrow <Col N="485" /> Drainage Board can only maintain the river in exactly the same condition as they found it when it was handed over to them by the Office of Public Works.  No works can be carried out in any circumstances.  The river banks can be swept away; the walls and the parapets of bridges can deteriorate with time and age and be knocked down.  The county councils have no authority.  The Board of Works will not permit certain works to be done and the Barrow Drainage Board cannot carry out improvements because these cannot be described in Office of Public Works language as maintenance work.</P>
    <P>I feel the Parliamentary Secretary's Office should be in a position to bring about a greater measure of relief in relation to drainage because they are the only State Department responsible for drainage.  Everybody knows that with the present very high rate of unemployment in rural Ireland the one scheme which will render a benefit to the landowners and provide local employment is drainage.  I have never seen a drainage scheme yet, which could be described as a satisfactory scheme, which did not provide useful employment and leave the lands which were drained much better than they were before the scheme was executed. Therefore, I feel the time has come for a complete and entire reorganisation of the Office of Public Works in relation to drainage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan referred to the drainage of the Shannon.  When the drainage of the Shannon is likely to take place, I cannot tell or what proposals the Office of Public Works have in mind for the drainage of the Shannon, but there is one thing we do know, that is, that the drainage of the Shannon presents many unusual problems.  Numerous promises have been made from time to time, promises of a very sincere character at the time, and, perhaps those who gave the undertakings and the promises were not without the knowledge that those works were not going to be hastily executed.  What is the position in Roscommon and in the district of County Offaly from Shannonbridge <Col N="486" /> right down to the district in the parish of Lusmagh known as the Angler's Rest, where we have continuous flooding every year?  The lands were there are useless for eight to nine months every year.  The landowners are obliged to pay heavy rates and in many instances they cannot put stock on the land because they are afraid of fluke. Fluke, as we know, comes from wet and waterlogged lands.</P>
    <P>Again, we see that in the Shannon Valley there have been widespread losses from time to time.  I have often thought on every occasion on which we have serious flooding in the Shannon that we have the Government reaching a state of panic to see what temporary measures of relief can be provided.  I suggested many years ago, and I think the suggestion is on the records of the Office of Public Works, that a permanent committee be set up to deal with emergencies relating to the Shannon, comprising the counties of Offaly, Westmeath, Roscommon, Leitrim and Longford&mdash;all the counties which are flooded.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it will be before a comprehensive drainage scheme is carried out on the Shannon. I hope I am not foolish enough to presume it will be in the lifetime of the youngest member of this House, on the progress that has been made over the years.  I would like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, when the survey of the Shannon is in progress in his Department, he consider at the same time as the drainage is actually undertaken, either by the Office of Public Works or by the Forestry Department, some extensive plantation along the Shannon Valley.  There is quite an amount of land in the Shannon Valley which is suitable only for plantation.  If there were co-operations between the Office of Public Works and the Forestry Department, a good deal of the unpleasantness which is experienced in the Shannon Valley from flooding could be eliminated. This unpleasantness would be avoided for future generations if good planting were undertaken.  I am sure that before the Parliamentary Secretary delivers the last word on this Estimate, he will make some reference to the drainage <Col N="487" /> of the Shannon.  It will not be sufficient for him to repeat the promises that have been made over the years in regard to it.  We would like to know exactly where we stand, whether it will be done or not.</P>
    <P>I sincerely recommend that a section of the Parliamentary Secretary's Office be established to deal with minor drainage works that do not come within the scope of the arterial drainage programme but which are qualified for inclusion in catchments under the arterial drainage works as soon as steps are undertaken to do this work.  Steps must be taken to drain the land of this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows, and again it is on the record, that one of the priorities of the inter-Party Government, so long decried by the present Government, was drainage, because we believed in drainage.  We believed that the money spent on drainage was money well spent, that the more you employed on drainage, the more work you were providing and the more you improved the land of Ireland, the better the yield.  We believed that any money spent on drainage was a sound national investment.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is handling the whole problem of drainage in a very piecemeal, childlike fashion. That is why I seriously ask the Parliamentary Secretary to sit down with the officers of the Board and to enter into consultation with his colleagues in the Government so that they may have a whole new approach to this question of drainage.  I have the honour to be a Member of this House for 25 years and I venture to say that in the past 25 years, if the records are gone back over, on every second Vote for the Office of Public Works reference has been made to the Nore, the Boyne and the Shannon.  That is a quarter of a century gone in talk. Are we going to sit and talk for another quarter of a century?  An ounce of action is worth a ton of talk and the time has come for us to provide courageously for drainage in an effort to increase production from our land and even to give the ratepayers value <Col N="488" /> for their money.  Proper drainage schemes would provide a great deal of employment in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The second priority of the Office of Public Works, if not ranking with the first, should be the provision of new schools.  It is right and proper to put on the records, a tribute to the architects in the Office of Public Works for their designing of new schools.  We have here portrayed a very fine example of airy, clean, well-designed and apparently well-constructed national schools.  It is only right and proper that a word of thanks should be put on the record to the engineering section and the architectural section of the Office of Public Works for what I consider to be an excellent plan of a good, modern school.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should be aware that one of the most urgent problems we are facing in rural Ireland today is the complete elimination of our hovel-like, insanitary and badly-aired schools.  We are embarking on a general scheme of educational re-organisation but, in many parts of rural Ireland, we still have damp hovels called national schools.  In many areas you have in overcrowded national schools the old dry toilets, and some of the most appalling sanitary conditions, conditions which are beyond description.  The Board of Works should carry out for the Department of Education, with the least possible delay, schemes for the provision of schools that can be described as healthy and modern.  If the Office of Public Works are about to carry out improvement and maintenance schemes of national schools, top priority shourd be given to the provision of proper sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, Sir, the Estimate for the Department of Education might be a more suitable occasion on which to comment on the condition of our national schools.  It perhaps is the most appropriate Department to deal with the matter, but I am aware that neither the Department of Education nor the Office of Public Works have the co-operation they could and should have from many school managers.  That is why I would have hoped that when <Col N="489" /> we have good and progressive school managers, we would not have the odd one lagging behind.</P>
    <P>I may be on the very edge, or outside the bounds, of the debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works. However, they have sent their engineers to these schools and usually there is consultation with the school manager in regard to the cost of repairs and the proposed works to be carried out.  The Office of Public Works, as the agents of the Department of Education, must submit plans, specifications and proposed improvement schemes to the schools manager.  Very often we have the school manager complaining that the Office of Public Works are unreasonable in drafting too elaborate a proposal for him to undertake.  If the school manager does not proceed with such work, the Office of Public Works or the Department of Education cannot compel him to do so.  I doubt that there is any regulation to compel him to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope to take up at another time and in another place the suggestion that every bishop in Ireland should appoint one of his clergy as an inspector of school managers for the purpose of seeing whether there are school managers with schools not up to the required standard, so that the necessary action can be taken.  We cannot allow our children to attend schools in insanitary and unhealthy conditions where the Office of Public Works have proposals for carrying out improvements and where they are not done.  I shall leave it at that because I am sure I have trespassed on the very edge of the debate.</P>

      <P>Yes; I am giving the Parliamentary Secretary food for thought.  Surely he does not <Col N="490" /> expect me to go around and inspect schools but I have done so, and may I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the prompt action he took on any complaints I made?  I repeat that in regard to any complaints I made about schools in my constituency the Office of Public Works did not put them on the long finger.  If certain works were not carried out, I got the reason why.</P>
      <P>There is some driving force behind the school manager preventing him from doing his work.  I am pressing this matter so as to get it in its proper perspective.  I am sorry to say that some of our national schools would not be found in the bush in parts of Africa. Indeed, schools in parts of Africa must be better than they are in rural Ireland today.  I am sure you, Sir, know that there are insanitary schools.  This is the only way we have of seeing that something will be done and that our schools will be put into a sanitary condition.</P>

Many of our ancient monuments are in the custody of the Office of Public Works under the National Monuments Act, 1930, and the amending Act of 1954.  These national monuments are real treasures. Wherever these national monuments are situated, they have for generations been an inspiration for the future and certainly they cast great credit on the great men and women of the past. But the greatest of all these national monuments, in my opinion, is Clonmacnoise.</P>

      <P>Now, if there is not something to be seen in Tara, there is something to be seen in Clonmacnoise. Not alone is Clonmacnoise a great national treasure but it ranked as one of the world's great seats of learning.  How many people throughout the country have never availed themselves of the opportunity of seeing the great Seven Churches of Clonmacnoise, of seeing the burial places of saints, of princes, of bishops and of kings?  It is the last resting place of the last High King of Ireland.  If there was ever a national monument held dear to the hearts of the people of Offaly, Westmeath and Roscommon it is Clonmacnoise. I suppose the same affection obtains in the areas in which there are other great relics of the past.</P>
      <P>I can recall, when dealing with the Estimates for Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce, in relation to Bord Fáilte and tourism, making a complaint that we have never had sufficient publicity to attract attention to our national monuments.  The publicity which our national monuments have got this year does not reflect great credit on those responsible. There are many views as to whether the stones that have been in Clonmacnoise during the past hundreds of years should have been removed to Dublin to be put on exhibition, to let people see them.  That problem applies to all the other national monuments that have been taken from their original sites to the Rose exhibition.  If Saint Kieran had wished to build Clonmacnoise in Ballsbridge he would have done so, but he selected Clonmacnoise for his monastery not Ballsbridge.</P>

      <P>These ancient stones, crosses and slabs have been uprooted and taken up to the exhibition so that certain people could see them.  Why did they not go to see them on their original sites?  The taking of these monuments from their original sites must necessarily lessen their historical value.  There is a difference of opinion on this.  The Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary may say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that we must uproot all our national monuments and bring them up for exhibition and take them back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that an effort was made to bring up some of the national monuments, but because of age and the delicate operation involved in their removal the instructions were cancelled.  Not alone can these monuments be described as relics of the past, but in many parts of rural Ireland they are of great religious significance.  Therefore, it is wrong to take certain stones from churches that were consecrated, stones that were used as part of the buildings, of monasteries which 800 or 1,000 years ago were the centres of religious worship, to satisfy the curiosity of a dozen or two cranks in Dublin who never thought it worth their while to go down and look at them when they were in Clonmacnoise or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The removal of these national monuments has been a national disgrace, has lessened the value of the monuments, has been an endeavour to throw ridicule on them, to lower respect for them.  It certainly has been an endeavour in no small way to belittle the historic value of these relics of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is a little early for the Parliamentary Secretary to give to the <Col N="493" /> House an idea of what the cost of the removal of the monuments was and whether the committee in charge of this exhibition will pay all costs involved. This debate gives the Parliamentary Secretary the opportunity to say whether this will be a frequent occurrence. If some of these ancient stones are to be taken back to Clonmacnoise and places like it and are to be removed again and brought to another exhibition in four years time they will come to disaster.  This handful of cranks who were so curious about our ancient monuments and so anxious to see them did not think it worth their while to go down and look at them where they have been since the establishment of these monasteries.  It was improper of the Government to allow these national treasures to be hawked around the country.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the 1930 National Monuments Act and the amending Act of 1954, great emphasis was laid on the necessity for preserving our national monuments, but the most recent effort seemed, in my opinion, to be an effort not of preservation but to belittle them, to damage them and to undermine the historical tradition behind them&mdash;to ransack and to rob sacred places like Clonmacnoise where these treasures have been associated with the townlands and the districts.</P>
    <P>I suppose other Deputies have done so and others still will do so, but I wish to put on record my strongest objection and criticism of the failure of the Government properly to preserve our national monuments by falling for the request of the committee responsible for this exhibition.  This should be the problem of the National Monuments Advisory Committee.  When permission was sought for the removal of these monuments to Dublin the advisory council recommended against their removal.  What is the purpose of having an advisory council?  What is the purpose of having highly qualified men to give advice on any matter if the Minister takes the opposite line?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here Vote 8&mdash;Office of Public Works.  Subhead E is for new works, alterations and additions.  I have here the Estimate for 1967-68.  What will be the picture of Government spending <Col N="496" /> through the Office of Public Works in future?  The total cost of the extension and alterations to Leinster House is estimated at £660,000 for which a sum of £75,000 is provided in this Estimate. There is a sum of £375,000 estimated to be spent on Dublin Castle, on the State Apartments, rebuilding of drawingroom, bedroom block and entrance. The sum provided in the Estimate for 1967-68 is £75,000.</P>
    <P>What justification is there for spending such large sums on money on rebuilding the drawingroom, bedroom block and main entrance at Dublin Castle when there is such an appalling housing shortage, when there are so many families living in overcrowded and unhealthy conditions?  Improvements to the bedroom block and drawingroom at Dublin Castle might be all right if the housing needs were met but we have reached a stage when housing has become a national emergency.</P>
    <P>Serious thought should be given to our priorities.  Houses comes before the provision of an ornamental bedroom in Dublin Castle where nobody has slept for hundreds of years, where nobody intends to sleep or wants to sleep.  The taxpayers' money is being spent in considerable amounts on this work while there are families, old persons and sick persons living in the most deporable housing conditions and we are told that there is no money to provide houses for them.  Local authorities will not be allowed to provide cottages and there is general uproar and a demand for houses which cannot be provided because of a shortage of capital.  Here we see capital in no small amount going into work of this kind on Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to St. Stephen's Green.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Office of Public Works not to concentrate all their efforts on erecting memorials in St. Stephen's Green. The Green is a very beautiful park.  It is well designed and well kept.  Those responsible for it deserve the highest praise.  If we are, however, to have blocks of concrete here and there these will detract considerably from the <Col N="497" /> appearance of the Green.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to put a stop to these blocks of concrete appearing here and there in St. Stephen's Green.  Surely more suitable places can be found for memorials rather than despoiling this beautiful public pleasure park.</P>
    <P>Last year there was provision in the Estimate for a sum of £20,000 in relation to the state of Thomas Davis. In this year's Estimate a sum of £1,000 is provided under the same heading. None of us today knows what Davis looked like.  I wonder was he really like this statute.  I do not think he was. I think the work is out of proportion. I do not think it looks well.  It may be excellent modern art; I am not a good judge of modern art.</P>

      <P>A crib in modern design was erected at Dublin Airport last winter.  The Archbishop of Dublin ordered it to be removed.  The images could be described as anything but the kind of images one associates with the Christmas crib.  We must have modern art. We must have proper designs for memorials and statues in keeping with the present and the past.  Monuments commemorating the past must resemble the past.  If monuments are designed to look like nothing on earth I do not see how they can pay tribute to the past, the present, or anything else.</P>
      <P>I believe we have good Irish sculptors. I do not know any of them but I trust that they will in future produce a better standard of work than that designed to commemorate Thomas Davis.  The expert on art may find some merit in it.  I am not an expert.  I cannot see anything artistic in it.  I would wager any money that Thomas Davis never in his life looked like that monstrosity down in College Green. None of us can accurately describe what Davis was like but we can all assume that he was nothing like the memorial we have erected to him.</P>
      <P>I want to give a warning now.  If there is to be a memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy, let no mistake be made.  There is nothing here to show what form it will take, whether it is to be a statute or something else. If it is a statue, I hope it will be something that will bear a resemblance and I would recommend that it should not be bronze.</P>
      <P>The Wolfe Tone memorial cost £15,000.  Maybe it was money well spent: I cannot say.  If I had £15,000 to spend, I should leave the memorial aside and I should first provide our people with houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will the Parliamentary Secretary be in a position to furnish the House with particulars of a complete survey of our requirements of Garda stations?  In some parts of the country, <Col N="499" /> gardaí have to work and, in some instances, sleep in conditions that are far from pleasant in big, cold, draughty and insanitary buildings.  It is high time each Garda district had a proper Garda headquarters.  Like drainage, this problem is being tackled in a very half-hearted manner&mdash;a couple of Garda barracks here, there, and elsewhere. The gardaí are the custodians of life and property.  They are an excellent police force.  It is time serious action was taken in the matter of the improvement and the provision of Garda barracks.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána experience many difficulties in regard to housing.  There is a heavy demand on local authorities to provide houses for the working-classes.  Houses are in short supply throughout the country and even more so in the city.  I cannot understand why a suitable site is not made available in every Garda area and a number of houses for gardaí built there.  It would solve the housing problem for members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Many young gardaí are anxious to marry and settle down.  Transfer problems arise on marriage.  It is very embarrassing for gardaí to have to live in rooms, or flats or to share houses. They have to live up to a fairly high standard.  A sum of £65,000 is being provided for houses for married members of the Garda Síochána but that amount is insignificant in view of actual requirements.</P>
    <P>The additional accommodation required in the Land Registry is a matter of extreme urgency.  It is essential to put the Land Registry in offices where the work can be carried out with efficiency.  That accommodation should have been provided long ago.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this matter a few months ago, we on this side of the House said that we appreciated the sentiments which motivated the Mover of the Bill.  I am sure every Deputy realises the leeway we have to make up before we will have what we could describe as a good, comprehensive scheme for the training of handicapped people.  However, if we examine the Bill we will see that it appears to be superfluous in regard to some of its provisions.  We are providing training facilities and while they may not be as extensive as we would wish, nevertheless more than a start has been made.  I want to mention some of the institutions which are providing training facilities for handicapped children and for adults.  Most Deputies give some help to these various institutions in their spare time. One which I help, in a very small way, is the Polio Fellowship.  This organisation has done remarkable work in the past 20 years and it is perhaps an organisation which has the brightest future because the incidence of poliomyelitis is dying out, thanks to the introduction of drugs and the general rise in our health standards.  In County Dublin this voluntary organisation has provided a marvellous training centre to which young people from all over the country are brought to be trained, to return later to their home towns to play an important part in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to disagree with the mover of the Bill in regard to section <Col N="501" /> 5 which would compel employers to take on a quota of disabled people. This would be almost impossible to implement.  Deputy Dunne and myself, and other Deputies, who have had some experience of industrial life know that very often if a man or woman has been out of work through illness and wants to return, the doctor representing the employer, or the company, and the doctor representing the patient often disagree in regard to whether the person is fit to return to work.  How then, could you ensure that a disabled person was certified as being fit for a certain job, unless there was an absolute shortage of labour and employers wanted to take him on?  The kernel of the problem is that no handicapped person wants to be given a job through charity.  Handicapped people want to get jobs because they are able to do them.  They want to go into jobs on their ability to give the employer a return, whether the employer is a private one or a State organisation.  They do not want to be given jobs through a kind of widespread public pity.  This is a weak section of the Bill, even though I know from the mover's point of view it is most important.</P>
    <P>The Bill suggests that consultations should take place between the Minister, the trade unions and the employers. Very often if you try to introduce a disabled person into a certain trade you will get a reaction from the unions and on occasion you would say rightly so, because their members would be affected.  It could be that the employers would say: &ldquo;If I am to remain competent and to stay in business I will have to have people who have ability.&rdquo; Here, I might stress the need for training people.  If I were in a position to do so, I would subsidise institutions like the Polio Fellowship, the Remedial Clinic, the Rehabilitation Institution and various religious institutions like the Merrion School for the Blind and the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb. These are the people who are training the handicapped to enable them to take their place in the community. Anybody who does any work among handicapped people will realise that the last thing they want is pity, but what they do want is help and <Col N="502" /> training.  It would destroy the confidence of the handicapped person if that person were placed in a job simply because a Government Minister, with the help of the employers and the trade unions, had decided that that person should be placed in employment because of his or her disability.</P>
    <P>This country, like most countries, lacks a lot of things but one thing it does not lack is its tremendous desire to help the less well off sections of the community.  The tremendous amount of money raised every year for voluntary organisations, backed in a lot of cases by Government help, has given us the framework for the training of people who have not got their full faculties.  In so far as blind people are concerned there are new developments every year which will enable these people to play their full part in the community.  The Government should provide up-to-date training equipment for handicapped people to ensure that no person will be denied the right to full training because his private means does not allow him to partake of them. We could help tremendously in this way and I feel this would be the right approach.</P>
    <P>By his action in bringing this Bill before the House, Deputy Dunne has pinpointed the desire of many people to do more than we are doing for disabled people.  A tremendous amount more requires to be done.  This State was never actually engaged in a world war but continental countries who have been engaged in world wars have had to improve their training facilities because of the vast numbers maimed in wars.  No country can afford to ignore its handicapped people, even from an economic point of view.  From a humanitarian point of view nobody inside or outside this House wants to ignore them.  They have a great part to play in the community and it is up to the Dáil to provide facilities for them. I do not disagree with Deputy Dunne on this matter but I feel that section 5 could not be operated.  I do not think that any Minister with the best will in the world could force employers to take on people in that way.  I also say that the people whom Deputy Dunne has in mind would be the last people to <Col N="503" /> train people to go into factories or offices and they feel that they are competent, then that alone would help their general health and it would make them feel that they are wanted.  All handicapped people want to feel that they are wanted as members of the community but they do not want to be regarded as objects of pity.  I would support any measure which would provide more money for the institutions I mentioned to be used for extensions and better facilities.  But we should not try to place anyone in employment out of a sense of pity.</P>

      <P>If there is one subject on which the time of this House should be expended, it is the improvement of conditions for disabled persons.  Deputy Dunne's Bill has served the useful purpose of focussing attention on a very important national problem.  I have been associated for a number of years past with a charitable organisation which plays an important part in the rehabilitation of disabled persons.  It is only right to avail of this opportunity to express appreciation of the support, goodwill and sympathy of the general public in the matter of doing something practical for the disabled.</P>
      <P>There are many forms of disablement. There is disablement from birth. God in His goodness sees fit to give many of us the use of our limbs; to others that great gift has been denied. What an extraordinary experience and handicap it must be for a physically healthy person to meet with a serious accident and to find he no longer has the use of his limbs or has the misfortune of losing the great gift of eyesight. We should carry out in every county a survey of the number of disabled persons there, those who through physical disablement cannot provide for themselves.  Comment should be made on their home environment and living conditions.  Training and rehabilitation should be made available to them to enable them, to the fullest limit of their physical resources, to obtain an independent livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a responsibility in this country to all our citizens.  We must <Col N="504" /> have a special responsibility towards the poor.  But we must have a very great responsibility, indeed, towards the disabled.  Disabled persons, because of their disability, may be suffering a certain psychological effect, something which usually goes with being disabled. They may feel they cannot take their place in the community like the rest of us.  A serious effort should be made to break down that feeling and make it known to them, by example and word, that there is a place for them in the community, that they can take their place in whatever sphere of activity they are trained for, and that in that training they will have behind them the full resources of the Government and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is embarrassing to find so many charitable organisations such as the Rehabilitation Institution and the Polio Fellowship, all appealing to the generosity of the public to help provide a standard of living and a place in the community for disabled persons. Tributes have already been paid to such organisations.  There can be no more wonderful work.  But there is a bounden obligation on the State to provide for those who are disabled through no fault of their own.  We cannot close our eyes to our responsibility for training them and, when they are trained, to our responsibility to find suitable employment for them.  There must be many lines in administration today, office work and certain types of factory work, in which disabled persons could fill a place as well as those with all their faculties.</P>
    <P>Disabled persons must have an inner feeling of hardness against the outside world.  Why?  Because they are so often helped as an object of charity.  This must have an inner effect on them, making them feel they have lost their independence, have not confidence in themselves and have not sufficient confidence to take their place with those of their fellow citizens blessed with all their faculties.  Local authorities should be empowered to provide to the limit of their resources for the training and, if possible, the employment of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary how you seldom meet a disabled person in bad form. <Col N="505" /> My experience, and the experience of many, particularly the medical profession, is that you always find a disabled person to be of a most cheerful and happy disposition.  They have accepted their disablement.  In cases where they have been disabled from birth they have not had the experience of the full use of their limbs.  Nevertheless, the happiness and cheerful disposition of most, if not all, disabled persons is astonishing.</P>
    <P>There is no more charitable work which could be undertaken than to assist the State in the formulation of a scheme whereby there would be the fullest measure of support and co-operation between local authorities, charitable organisations and the Department of State that will mainly be responsible for providing an Estimate in this House and seeing to it that the disabled people cannot and will not be described as our forgotten citizens.  Surely there must be some responsibility on the State to provide suitable training centres for these people and to finance these training centres completely from State funds.</P>
    <P>It is amazing to see the number of disabled persons who, when trained in any line of trade, as we have seen from the efforts of the Rehabilitation Institute, can produce an excellent standard of work, and, above all, the change that it has brought about in their mentality.  They feel independent. They feel they can take their place in the community like other citizens, and their disablement vanishes into the background.  There is no amount of money that could bring that great ease and peace of mind to those who are so unfortunate as to be disabled.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to give serious thought to the opinions expressed by Deputies and also to the contents of this Bill, bearing in mind that all Parties in this House have a moral and a Christian obligation in this matter.  However, the main responsibility rests with the Government. They can take action, whereas the Opposition can only focus attention on the problem.  We want the Government to take action to ensure that there will be suitable and ample provision for <Col N="506" /> the training of disabled persons, and that employment and full maintenance will be provided for them to enable them to enjoy a new life, a high degree of independence and a high standard of living.</P>
    <P>A special tribute should be paid to the many firms and business organisations throughout the country who have taken disabled persons into their employment.  I hope and trust that before very long suitable legislation will be enacted which will enable proper training facilities to be set up and, through the Department of Health, suitable employment to be provided, thus making it possible for those of our citizens who are disabled and who are deprived of the great blessings which we all enjoy to take their place in the community as independent citizens able to earn their own livelihoods.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that all members of the House who have spoken here are well-intentioned towards the problem of the disabled person.  It is obvious, too, listening to the last speaker especially, that Deputies have only this way of giving expression to their good intentions and desires for the disabled, either by supporting a law or exhorting the Government of the day to support financially organisations which help the disabled to find employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question which has been put by Deputy Dunne is whether we should legislate for this problem.  This question must be considered by any responsible person dealing with the problem of disabled people or indeed in dealing with other problems.  Some people think legislation solves every problem.  There are areas where the making of a law and its enforcement are reasonably straightforward and easy, for example, in regard to having a lamp on your bicycle or not selling intoxicating liquor outside of certain hours.  There are other examples&mdash;and I am very familiar with them&mdash;where the co-operation of the people affected is required for the working of the law. Indeed, it could be said in certain areas of our social activities that if the law is not acceptable to those affected by it, <Col N="507" /> then the law will not be effective. Again, there are areas of social activity where the objectives which we desire can be achieved by the promotion of voluntary co-operation and where, indeed, the making of laws would deflect many people from their good intentions and cause them to seek to find ways around the laws.  I think this is one of the areas where, if we make laws, we may work to the disadvantage of the people we have set out to help.</P>
    <P>The Bill was presented to us I believe because of this feeling on the part of almost every Deputy that he wants to do something to help disabled people.  Recognising this, I think Deputy Dunne was clever.  He said: &ldquo;If you want to help the disabled, if you want to show the sincerity of your intentions, you can only do so by voting for this Bill.&rdquo;  I yield to no one in my concern for the training and placement of disabled people.  I believe that the task should be tackled by voluntary effort, not by compulsion as proposed by Deputy Dunne.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since he introduced the Second Stage of the Bill.  He quoted from the Proceedings of the Ninth World Congress of the International Society for Rehabilitation of the Disabled regarding the difficulties that are experienced in placing the disabled in a stagnant economy, or during times of depression where there is heavy unemployment.  I should like to quote from the same source about placements in such conditions.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Special attention should be given to the selection of really suitable disabled persons for any work that is available on the basis of their ability to compete equally with qualified able-bodied applicants and care should be taken to see that their chances of being considered are equal.  Vocational training ... should be concentrated on the production of very highly skilled workers for whom jobs might exist ... and who, in any event, would have better chances because of their level of skill....</P>
    <P>Sometimes too, trade unions do not exert the positive influence they <Col N="508" /> might....  Enlightened trade unions can, however, play a leading part in helping with resettlement of the disabled, especially by demonstrating their general support for it to employers. </P>
    <P>This Bill is, as stated by its sponsors, based on the British Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944. Three of the main provisions of that Act are the establishment of a register of the disabled, a compulsory quota system for the employment of the disabled and the designation of employments which should be confined to the disabled.  It must be remembered that the main purpose of the British Act was to cater for people disabled as a result of the war.  I think it is important to remember&mdash;and this was mentioned by Deputy Kitt, I think&mdash;that the disabled persons register in Britain includes many people with heart, stomach and lung complaints whom the ordinary person would not immediately include among the disabled at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with that.  Surely a person suffering from a heart complaint is seriously disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinary people speaking about disablement would not include disablement from illnesses with which people could usually carry on their business.  Because of the inclusion in the register under the British Act of what we regard as illnesses, employers can, if they want to, fill their quota from members of their existing staffs who are suffering from heart, stomach and lung complaints and say that they have already complied with their quotas.  That is a way of getting around the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A publication by the British Information Service on &ldquo;Rehabilitation and care of the disabled in Britain&rdquo; reports that the &ldquo;Ministry of Labour enquiries have shown that the successful placement of the disabled is mainly due to the efforts of Disablement Resettlement Officers and to the helpful attitude of employers&rdquo;.  The general view of these resettlement officers is that the quota system is unnecessary in conditions of full employment and is unenforceable <Col N="509" /> when the supply of labour exceeds the demand or the number of jobs available.</P>
    <P>The power to designate employment specifically for disabled persons has been exercised in Britain in respect of two employments, car park attendants and passenger electrical elevator or lift attendants.  The British Committee of Inquiry on the Rehabilitation, Training and Resettlement of Disabled Persons, 1956 (Cmd. 9883) recommended that there should be no extension of designated employments.  The fact that only two employments have been designated shows that those with experience regard this provision of designated employment as of very limited value in promoting the employment of disabled persons.  This Committee also concluded that it was impossible despite the elaborate British health services to get a full register of the disabled under the British Act.  I think Deputies will agree that the experience in Britain suggests that we should look very carefully at this type of legislation before we consider its introduction here.</P>
    <P>Power to provide for the training of disabled persons is already vested in the Minister for Health by section 50 of the Health Act, 1953.  Health authorities are required to make provision for the training of disabled persons and their placement in employment and they may do this by co-operating among themselves or with other bodies.  In practice, health authorities make provision for training in two ways: (1) a number of mental hospitals have established work shops where patients are employed, some by way of occupational therapy, others by way of training with a view to their eventual return to normal employment. (2) health authorities co-operate with voluntary bodies which provide assessment and training for disabled persons, the health authorities paying training allowances and lodging allowances where trainees are required to move from their own homes.  The courses provided by vocational schools are frequently used for the training of suitable disabled persons.</P>
    <P>The National Organisation for <Col N="510" /> Rehabilitation was formed by the Minister for Health as an advisory body on all aspects of rehabilitation, to co-ordinate the work of voluntary and other bodies and to initiate schemes for the assessment, treatment, training and placement of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>The National Organisation for Rehabilitation operates a Placement Service for disabled persons and a Youth Advisory Service to guide the training of disabled young persons and to place them in employment.  This service was re-organised in March, 1967, and took over placement officers formerly employed by the Rehabilitation Institution.  This has resulted in a co-ordinated placement service covering the whole country for the disabled, with the exception of the blind.  The National Council for the Blind, which is a voluntary body, is involved in the training and placement of the blind. The number placed in employment by the placement officers of the National Organisation for Rehabilitation in the first six months of operation of the re-organised service was 282.</P>
    <P>One of the main bodies in the field of training for the disabled is the Rehabilitation Institution which has training centres in Dublin, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Longford. This institution and other voluntary bodies provide in all 443 places for trainees and the National Organisation for Rehabilitation has put 154 disabled persons into training so far this year.  At a recent date, however, there were no fewer than 113 vacancies for trainees unfilled mostly in the garment making and domestic economy centres.  There are waiting lists for entry into some of the other centres.  These figures do not include the blind who are provided for separately by the National Council for the Blind and the Department of Social Welfare.  The Board for the Employment of the Blind gives constant employment to 70 or 75 workers.  The only training it provides is on-the-job training.  The Department of Social Welfare in co-operation with the Council runs training courses for blind telephonists in Dublin.  Portion of the <Col N="511" /> training is done in the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal in the Bill for the establishment and maintenance of a register of disabled persons, health authorities have power to appoint placement officers to look after the placement of disabled persons or to co-operate with other bodies providing such a service.  The National Organisation for Rehabilitation undertakes placement work for voluntary bodies and others, including health authorities.  In time this service, together with the service for the blind, should have a complete register of disabled workers who are able and willing to take up employment.  The Employment Service of my Department co-operates with these specialised agencies in the placement of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, I expect better results from voluntary methods and, therefore, prefer them to compulsion in so far as seeking to secure employment for disabled persons is concerned.  This is the type of thing where I think that compulsion would not be in the best interests of the disabled. It would probably alienate the goodwill of employers and, judging by experience in Britain, it would be of doubtful value anyway in securing expanded employment opportunities for the disabled.  I feel that for a very doubtful value we would be taking the risk of alienating the goodwill which is already obviously doing so much good and which can be made to do more.  I think that the successful placing of disabled people should be achieved by training them to the full extent of their abilities rather than compelling employers to give them work because of their disabilities.  I would like to quote from a letter I have received from the National Council for the Blind:</P>
    <P>We must secure employment for our blind people not because they are blind and not because of legislation, but rather because, in spite of their handicap, they are suitable for and capable of open competitive employment.  If as a result of legislation <Col N="512" /> or trade union pressure, numbers of unsuitable blind people are forced in through doors of offices and factories, the consequence would surely be tragic.  This might equally apply to any group of handicapped people.</P>
    <P>Contrary to statements continually being made, only a very small number of our blind people are capable of open employment, and we feel that their placement can best be secured by having each placement made a success, thereby convincing an employer that a blind worker can be a productive and useful employee. </P>

      <P>I do not want to shift the responsibility of my decision on to any other group of people.  When I quote groups I quote them, as I have quoted the experience in Britain.  There are people who have been dealing with this problem and have experience of it.  I might add that the reason I did not speak in the debate before the Summer Recess was to give me time to enter personally into discussions with a variety of people and hear their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adequate assessment and training of the disabled and an efficient placement service are the best means of helping disabled persons to find suitable jobs. Consultations with the National Organisation for Rehabilitation and the principal voluntary bodies confirm this view; these bodies are opposed to the principle of compulsion and they feel, to my mind quite rightly, that the introduction of compulsion would be likely to endanger the present fruitful relations which they have with employers.  Compulsion is of course justified in certain special conditions such as, for instance, those calling for the urgent relief of war disabled after <Col N="515" /> a war.  If, after we have done our best in assessing, training and with a well-developed placement service we find that it is not satisfactory then we should have a look at this idea of compulsion again.</P>
    <P>I was in Norway recently studying training centres and other aspects of their labour activities, and I had the opportunity of studying the arrangements there for the training and placement of disabled workers.  I discussed them with the Minister and the people concerned, and I also saw the workers. I found that there, too, the philosophy of compulsion has been rejected in favour of voluntary arrangements. I might add that they are highly successful, so before we reject the voluntary system, we must try it out to the full and give it more help.  Voluntary organisations can be very successful.  Deputy Treacy admitted&mdash;I am quoting him&mdash;that &ldquo;many employers have realised the need and have engaged a number of these incapacitated people and put them to productive work.  Many of these employers pay glowing tributes to the work of these persons when properly trained and put to suitable occupations.  They can be very effective and cannot be regarded as a burden on the employers concerned&rdquo;.  I fully agree with that.  It must be quite a time since I agreed with him.</P>

      <P>Those are in fact the main arguments against a Bill of this kind.  Adequate training and careful placement are the measures necessary to satisfy employers and to enable the disabled to lead contented and useful lives.  Deputy Flanagan was on to it when he said that these people must not be selected for employment merely because they are disabled.  They can be trained and so placed that they can hold their own with able-bodied persons.  Deputy Flanagan made a very valid point there.</P>

      <P>The Bill also proposes that certain classes of employment should be designated as specially suitable opportunities for the employment of disabled persons.  This, in effect, means that certain classes of employment should be reserved for disabled persons.  As I said, in Britain where such power exists and has existed for 20 years, only two types of employment in fact have been designated for the disabled&mdash;employment as lift attendants and employment as car park attendants.  Even though this question has been considered again in Britain, the number of reserved employments has not been extended.  This, I think, shows clearly the very limited value of having powers to designate certain employments for disabled persons.</P>
      <P>We consulted the National Organisation for Rehabilitation on this point, too, and they do not recommend at present that any particular employments should be designated for disabled persons.  A committee which I set up last May has been examining the possibility of improving employment opportunities for the disabled in the central and local government services and in State-sponsored bodies.  The committee comprises representatives of government Departments, Dr. Tom Gregg, Medical Director of the National Organisation for Rehabilitation, Dr. Norman Moore, Medical Director, St. Patrick's Hospital, Dublin, and Colonel Adams, Honorary Secretary, National Association for the Mentally Handicapped. The committee also had the benefit of the advice of Dr. Ivor Browne, St. Brendan's Hospital and of the Chief Medical Officer of the Civil Service.  I received an interim report from them and this is being examined in the Department of Labour at present.</P>

      <P>As I said, I have received an interim report.  The question is still being studied by these people.  They have furnished some information which would seem to answer some of the questions raised by Deputies in the course of the debate on this Bill before the Recess.</P>
      <P>It is not true, for example, to say that the present medical examination for entry into established posts in the Civil Service precludes all disabled persons.  Apart from such an obvious grade as blind telephonist, which was specially created to cater for suitable blind persons, the medical examination permits the appointment of a disabled person whose disability is such that it would not interfere with the performance of the duties of the post which he is seeking and who has the normal expectancy of life.  I suppose it would be obvious to Deputies that a person with a bad physical disablement could be accepted for a clerical post, a desk post, but that he might be totally unsuitable for a post which required a great deal of travelling.  The reference to the ten per cent of candidates for the Garda Síochána and the Army who are rejected on medical grounds fails to take account of the duties required of members of both of those bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too far away to remember the context in which the point was made.  There are not any reliable figures available here of the number of disabled persons or, much more important, of the number of disabled who would be able, with or without special training, to take up ordinary wage-earning employment.  As I have already mentioned, the placement service operated by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation should in time have a fairly complete register of disabled persons who are willing and able to take up employment.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to a figure of 30,000 disabled persons but even if this figure is a fair approximation of the number, a very high proportion of these would, by reason of their disabilities, be capable only at best of sheltered employment.  For example, of the estimated 20,500 mentally handicapped, only 2,000, or one-tenth, are likely to be capable of open employment even after training.  As far as the training for disabled people is concerned, I have already referred to the fact that on average, 20 per cent of the places in existing training centres are unfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Corish who referred to training centres and sheltered workshops as providing occupational therapy only.  The training centres are designed primarily to train disabled workers to take up open employment.  Sheltered workshops, in addition to providing work for disabled workers who would otherwise be classed as unemployable, also serve in many cases as training centres and as a means of re-activation in the final stages of rehabilitation.  In regard to sheltered employment, as envisaged in section 9 of Deputy Dunne's Bill, I am discussing with the Minister for Health, Deputy S. Flanagan, what steps can be taken to <Col N="519" /> make more sheltered employment available and what State assistance can be given to enable this to be done. In particular, the Committee to which I have already referred are considering to what extent central and local government authorities and State-sponsored bodies might provide a level of indirect employment for disabled persons either by placing a proportion of their contracts with sheltered workshops or otherwise buying goods or articles from them.</P>
    <P>As I said a few times tonight, I am convinced that the successful placement of disabled persons lies in proper training.  As the House knows, the Industrial Training Act gives An Chomhairle Oiliúna, the new training authority, power to arrange for the provision of training courses for disabled workers, and this was specially brought into the Bill to highlight the case of disadvantaged workers.  I have asked the Chomhairle to pay special attention to the needs of disabled persons and to work for them in co-operation with voluntary bodies who are now doing such valuable work in this field.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to compulsion.  The bodies which are doing the bulk of placement work for the disabled, and which I regard as being in the best position to speak from experience, are opposed to the idea of compulsion. They are of the view that the answer lies in adequate training and efficient placement.</P>
    <P>The Committee to which I have referred&mdash;that which I set up in May&mdash; have expressed the same view in their interim report.  In fact, they made a positive recommendation that reliance should be placed on the co-operation and good will of employers rather than that they should be required by law to reserve a fixed number of posts for the disabled.  In this, as in other spheres, I am a firm believer in seeking voluntary co-operation.  It would have to be clearly demonstrated to me that such co-operation was not forthcoming or that it was not producing the results we want before I would go over to the side of compulsion by law.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, there are <Col N="520" /> some laws which are clearly accepted by everybody and are easily enforced. Other laws are not willingly accepted and means are sought of getting round such laws.  This would be such a law, and enacting it before we have fully tried the voluntary methods would be to risk the benefits and the progress made in the voluntary field.</P>
    <P>I always ask myself how is it some people believe that if you pass a law you solve a problem, especially if the law passed is to apply to other people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has paraded many hoary and tired arguments against the idea of compulsion. He has ended up on a point concerning unenforceable law; laws which are not accepted are not enforceable but are bad laws, laws which are not accepted by the people it is not possible to enforce them, and so on.</P>
      <P>This is an area of discussion in which one could meander about fruitlessly for the rest of the night. O'Connell said he could drive a coach and four through any law and that is a pretty poor quotation too.  Another little quotation comes to mind&mdash;&ldquo;too foolish, imprudent and dangerous&rdquo;.  I wonder does that ring a bell in the memory of any of the Members of the Army of Destiny&mdash;foolish, imprudent and dangerous&mdash;because it should.  It is the kind of stuff anyone would have heard if he wanted and it is what I often hear propounded on Fianna Fáil platforms when I am going about trying to find out where the truth lies in politics.  As nobody seems to know what its origin is, let me just refresh the mind of the House.  James Fintan Lawlor, who was handicapped, severely handicapped but a very brilliant man said: &ldquo;Somehow, somewhere and by somebody a beginning must be made and that beginning is now and forever shall be foolish, imprudent and dangerous&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the attitude of mind being brought to bear on this modest Bill of mine by the Minister and his Party.  The things which he has said about compulsion will be found, if any Member of the House is sufficiently interested and energetic enough to wade through copies of Hansard in the mid-19th <Col N="521" /> century when eloquent members of the British House of Commons were able to convince themselves, and it would appear convince many others as well, that to introduce laws compulsorily to prevent employers from sending children of tender years down into the bowels of the earth was morally offensive and calculated to bring about the economic ruin of the British Empire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased when I contemplate my contemporary doing me the honour of submitting to imagination.  Our society in the years which lie ahead, in so far as it will be divided politically, will be divided, generally speaking, on the principle of whether we are or are not ready conscientiously to undertake the revision of our society by the introduction of laws to do so, or whether we shall leave the fate of our people to be determined by chance and by the vagaries of a system which is now generally condemned by practically all sections of the community&mdash;the so-called system of free enterprise.  Freedom, how are you?  Freedom, moryah.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard enough for the best equipped citizen to make his or her way in the kind of world in which we live even if he or she has had the fortune to have had a background which could afford education and training, if he or she has had the good fortune to have been born physically and mentally perfect.  Even with these advantages it is hard enough for such a person to go through life and to achieve such an apportionment of happiness as it is possible to have on this planet; but what chance has the incapacitated person in the kind of <Col N="522" /> competition that is being talked about and which we all know exists in society today?</P>
    <P>It may be said in discussing these matters that we in the Labour Party are preaching to the converted, that we are pushing open doors&mdash;and the devil knows what other clichés may be used &mdash;but there is a kind of sentimentalism&mdash;that is the word that properly describes it &mdash; mouthed about these things which is very often used as an excuse not to do anything.  The Minister said everybody is well intentioned towards the disabled.  Sure, and we are all against sin.  Sure, and we are all for good weather, too.  We had better not fight about that.  We all want everybody to be happy.  But how far are we prepared to go to do something about it, to put our political futures, if you like, to the hazard of doing something about achieving the uplifting of all members of our society?</P>
    <P>This is the real test of political integrity, and God knows I am as wanting in that as is the least Member of the House.  I will not make any point on that score but I hold very strongly that a Bill of this kind makes effective what is in the minds and the hearts of the people.  Nobody will deny that if a job is available in any form of employment, in industry or any other kind of work, and two people present themselves for that job, and one is obviously handicapped physically or found to be handicapped or retarded mentally, that person will not get that job in competition with the other individual if the other is 100 per cent in every way.</P>
    <P>This inequality, over which the sufferer has had no control whatever, has come about as a result of causes for which he or she has to pay.  This situation represents the most cruel dilemma of our society today, and God knows there are many examples of cruel dilemmas&mdash;the old people and so on with whose condition we all sympathise and try to do something about, not enough, but something.  This problem has often struck me as the acid test of our social conscience.</P>
    <P>The Act on which I base this Bill is the British Act of 1944.  It will be said that that Act was introduced in <Col N="523" /> England because of the huge numbers of disabled through war action.  It was also, of course, introduced at a time when it was anticipated that a chronic postwar condition of maximum unemployment would develop in Britain. As we know, Britain was sufficiently fortunate to have had a socialist Government after the war and there was not unemployment but there was full employment for the first time in history.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this Act was not put to the test for which it was designed. People who wanted work got it.  As the Minister has said, in a condition of full employment a Bill of this kind would be unnecessary.  I agree with that.  When employers are making money in a booming economy, the more people they can employ the more money they can make.  It has nothing at all to do with right or wrong or with how we deal with disabled people: it is simply a question of making more money.  If employers make greater profits by employing more people, as they can do in a booming economy, they will employ more disabled people because they have to.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if there is recession employers will pick and choose for the purpose of getting into employment only those they consider to be most productive.  That is the rule of life in the world in which we live.  It is the rule of the jungle.  The fittest survive. This lights up the problem of the fittest surviving and the weak not doing so well.  &ldquo;Goodwill&rdquo; is a lovely word.  It is part of the sentimental build-up given to a situation when the attitude of mind really is that if one pretends it will go away&mdash;there is goodwill about&mdash;everything will be all right if we leave it alone, do not rock the boat, the disabled will be looked after by the good decent Christian employers we have in this country.</P>
    <P>Let me say, and let me not be misconstrued, that there are such people. They may be in the majority.  I do not know.  I know a few of them.  I do not know if they qualify under the heading of Christianity but I know and I have my opinions about their capabilities. I should not care to leave the fate of <Col N="524" /> these misfortunate people entirely to their tender mercies.</P>
    <P>Take the matter mentioned by the Minister and in which I am especially interested&mdash;the question of the number of blind telephonists.  How many blind telephonists are employed in the Civil Service?  Does the Minister know? Would I be right in saying three or four?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Six at the outside. How many blind persons are there in the country?  The number is estimated at 7,000 and the total number in employment is 2 per cent of that 7,000 &mdash;the lowest percentage in Europe, if not in the world.  Then the Minister talks of goodwill and his desire to see what the future will bring to encourage employers and so on to employ blind persons.  One would think that this State had only just been founded.  We have been running our affairs for over 40 years.  Have we not had time to do something about this matter?  For many of those years we had a Fianna Fáil Government.  The 2,000 attending at the Mansion House were told that these were the halcyon days.  We have had all these years of Fianna Fáil rule and only now begin to talk about what we will do, or hope for, for the disabled. I admit that the Minister was not in office all that time.  We can take no pride in the fact that of our 7,000 blind persons only 2 per cent are in any form of employment and that only a handful of blind persons are engaged as telephonists in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of this Bill is designed to make it compulsory on the State and local authorities to employ disabled persons <Col N="525" /> in suitable occupations, not at work that they cannot do or in jobs where they would not be able to give an adequate return for the money they would get but on work which they can be trained to do.  One would have thought that switchboard work was eminently suitable for blind persons. Yet, since the late Deputy Norton took the step that he did there has been little or no increase in the number recruited.  Then we are told about goodwill and the desire to do something for the disabled.  It is just not there.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a document which he had received from the National Council for the Blind.  I have here the report of the National League of the Blind.  This is a body which consists of blind persons, the general secretary of which is blind.  This report in its presentation and composition demonstrates one remarkable fact about these people.  The handicapped seem to accept their handicap as a goad to achievement.  The production of such a report, I venture to say, would represent too great an effort for most of the Members of this House.  Here we have sightless persons undertaking work of this nature and accomplishing a task which would defeat most sighted persons. In the course of that report they do me the honour of referring to my effort here in the matter of this Bill. Contrary to what the Minister said when he was quoting the comments of the National Council for the Blind, they have this to say with regard to compulsion:</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret, however, that some of the organisations catering for the disabled are opposed to this Bill on the grounds that they do not like the compulsory element contained therein, nor do they favour State interference.  This is an attitude which it is difficult to understand since there is an element of compulsion in almost every piece of legislation and what they describe as State interference does not seem to worry them when they put out their hands for increased grants from public funds.</P>
    <P>In every law there is an element of coercion.  The Minister talked about <Col N="526" /> laws not being operable unless they had the support of the mass of the people. That is true.  I think he mentioned the licensing laws.  There is quite a respectable body of opinion that would make the most determined effort to circumvent the licensing laws.  At least, we hear of these efforts.  Does that make the licensing laws bad or any better? The fact is that compulsion is inseparable from any legal activity.  So, when the Minister seeks to raise this hare of compulsion and to depict me in the public eye as somebody who wants to hound him with a moralistic whip into doing the right thing, he knows very well that that is not acceptable.  The people of this country have a fair idea that in putting forward this Bill I am speaking the mind of the average man. Everybody one talks to expresses the opinion that not enough is being done for the disabled but few have the time in fighting the battle of life to pinpoint the inadequacies.  This is what I have tried to do&mdash;to underline the inadequacies and suggest the remedies.  I am not making any great claims for this Bill which I have had to draft myself not having the vast resources at the Minister's disposal.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of: Control of Imports <Col N="527" /> (Quota No. 54) (Pneumatic Tyres) Order, 1967. </P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated to the Deputies which explains the main provisions of the Quota Order.  When the Free Trade Area Agreement with the United Kingdom was implemented, it was necessary, under the terms of that Agreement, to terminate quota restrictions on imports of motor tyres from the United Kingdom as from 1st July, 1966.  Quota restrictions on the importation of tyres from other countries were also removed as from 1st July, 1966.  Prior to the removal of the quota, imports of motor tyres had been running at about 4,500 tyres per month but following the removal of the quota, imports increased considerably. In the six months July to December, 1966, imports from the United Kingdom alone averaged 15,400 tyres per month.  Because of the increase in imports a serious loss of production occurred at the Dunlop factory in Cork and a number of workers lost their employment.  Unemployment at the Cork factory would have increased had the situation been allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the British Board of Trade were initiated in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of the Free Trade Area Agreement and it was agreed that quota restrictions should be imposed on the importation of tyres from the United Kingdom, for a temporary period.  The size of the quota was agreed. in consultation with the Board of Trade, at an annual level of 65,000 tyres.  The first quota period was fixed at six months ending on 31st December, 1967.  This quota provides reasonable protection for the Irish product.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement the period during which such restrictions may be maintained is limited to eighteen months, unless the other party agrees otherwise. The Dunlop Company are aware, therefore, that they have a limited period within which to re-organise their industry so as to make their tyres competitive with imported tyres, and I <Col N="528" /> am advised that the company are making every effort to do this.</P>
    <P>I might add for the information of Deputies that tyres were being imported from other countries as well as the United Kingdom.  To restrict these imports a minimum specific duty of £3 per tyre was imposed.  It would, of course, have been pointless to restrict imports from the UK if imports from other sources were permitted without restraint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Quota Order indicates the position in which we find ourselves at this stage in relation to the general lessening of tariffs in order to bring the whole of Europe, and perhaps other parts of the world, into a rhythm of reduction of tariffs eventually leading to the free movement of goods from one country to another.  It is interesting&mdash;sad, in one way&mdash;to see a situation having developed in which we find the Minister for Industry and Commerce stating&mdash;admitting, if you like&mdash;that the removal of the quota as a result of the Free Trade Agreement with Britain has resulted in unemployment in Cork.  This has been stated by the Minister and I, in no sense of criticism of him, or anything else, merely re-state it as a fact.  It is now necessary for us to invoke one of the clauses in the Free Trade Agreement to protect the employment of our workers. It is salutary to reflect that the Minister has also adverted to the clause in that Agreement under which this can be done only for a period of eighteen months unless the other party agrees to extending the period.  The Minister has not said so but, presumably, if there was going to be serious unemployment in Cork it might well be that the British Government would agree to extending the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the task that now faces the Dunlop company, namely that of re-organisation during this 18 months in order to ensure that it will be competitive.  It has been stated many times on this side of the House that a great number of our industries are supply industries for the use of our own people and never designed in the first instance to export. Only now is re-organisation taking place to ensure export.  In a small <Col N="529" /> country like ours the size of the productive unit was extremely limited and all the trends over the last few years have been towards larger productive units, units in a position to produce cheaper as the cost of labour and the cost of living increases &mdash; nobody grudges any man his hire&mdash;but that really means that the larger unit with the lower labour content per unit of production leaving the factory will automatically produce a cheaper product.</P>
    <P>A respite has now been granted to the workers in Cork.  I pay tribute here to the work done by Deputy Stephen Barrett by way of Parliamentary Question and otherwise to draw attention to the plight of these workers and to see to it that the Minister acted as quickly as possible.  There may be criticism that he did not act soon enough.  Perhaps he was not allowed to act any sooner.  Be that as it may, and these are the secrets of the ministerial office, the fact remains that we have been given only a temporary respite.  It is really a case of Hobson's Choice.</P>
    <P>It was Hobson's Choice as far as the Free Trade Area Agreement was concerned and to suggest that such an agreement, once it had been proposed by the British that they would take 75 per cent of our goods, should not have been concluded is just plain lunacy. That does not mean that everybody who voted for the agreement was enthusiastic about the agreement.  Neither was it because they believed there was a land flowing with milk and honey just around the corner.  They voted for it soberly and after consideration because they realised that to stay outside would result in isolating us from the rest of the world.  The only option left in such an eventuality would be to produce goods here solely for consumption by our own people.  There was then no choice other than Hobson's Choice.  If the end result is the entry of Britain and Ireland into the Common Market and the creation of one great United States of Europe, then things will be all right, but it is a sobering thought to realise that one of the strongest companies in the country, a company one would have thought well able to withstand any competition, a company with an international <Col N="530" /> and not just a national name, found itself unable to withstand competition. It may be that dumping was the cause.  When you produce a certain quantity of goods, covering in the process your overheads, labour and everything else, then if it is possible to produce a greater quantity of goods with the same overheads, the same executive costs, fixed costs, repayment of capital costs, it is possible to dump so long as you have supplied at a higher price a certain volume of the goods produced. Perhaps that is the reason.  Perhaps the tyres being sent here were being dumped at less than the cost of production.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has explained that tyres can be produced cheaper in the rest of the world than here.  I think he implies that they can be produced cheaper outside this country. When he says Dunlops now have 18 months in which to re-organise themselves; it implies that Dunlops were not in a position to compete and that, in fact, it was not direct dumping that was the cause of under-selling Dunlops here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not come home with a great bargain.  He will allow 65,000 tyres to come in.  I realise it was no arbitrary decision by the Minister and that he was like a man bringing a bullock to a fair: sometimes you go to a fair with a good bullock and sometimes you go with a bad one.</P>
    <P>The alleviation of the plight of workers in Cork will perhaps be rather a slow procedure.  First, we must work off the quantity of tyres from abroad and then we have the fact that we shall import in the order of 11,000 tyres more than we have normally been doing.</P>
    <P>This Quota Order should be taken as an example by every industrialist here, no matter what sphere of activity he may be engaged in.  It is a red light warning that, if the reduction in tariffs has not yet hit his particular product, he should investigate matters, if he has not already done so, and take suitable steps to equip himself to meet the competition because the reduction in tariffs is going on and will continue.  As the percentages drop, the stage may be reached sooner than an industrialist may think when his product will be in <Col N="531" /> the same position as the well-known product of that very high-quality firm, Dunlops.  It is a sobering thought.</P>
    <P>Industrialists and workers should confer on this subject without delay, that is, if they have not already done so.  For some years past, this House has been exhorting them to do so.  One of the most famous companies in this country that has been established for many years is in this present predicament. Anybody would have thought that their unit of production was such as would enable them to withstand any competition.  A company that was not at any time short of capital, technical know-how or anything else is one of the first to be hit badly, with resultant disemployment of workers.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had to make a bargain, under the Free Trade Area Agreement, in order to protect them against some of the competition from abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not make these remarks in any spirit of criticism.  It simply means that all that has been said from this side of the House and from the Government side of the House about getting ready for competition is true and that the time is now upon us.  This is not just something that might happen or might never happen.  Workers and employers alike must take whatever steps are necessary to abate the difficulty of the reduction of tariffs and the advent in certain areas of almost free trade.</P>

      <P>We agree that the Order is necessary.  I think we can be pardoned if we wonder if this is the wonderful success of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis were told about yesterday by the Taoiseach.  Is this the wonderful success which, according to him, the Labour Party in particular have been caterwauling about in relation to things which might happen but did not, whereas everything has gone as was intended and the Agreement has been an outstanding success by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government?  In one case alone, it has resulted in the disemployment of a substantial number of people.  There <Col N="532" /> has been a very belated attempt to come to terms with the British Government on the importation of so many tyres.  It can last only 18 months, unless the British Government agree to a furtheir revision.  Is this an example of the wonderful benefits which that Agreement will bring this country?  I would remind Fine Gael that they also thought that that Agreement would bring benefits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They have, with hindsight, discovered that what the Labour Party said was likely to happen has happened in this case and in a number of other cases which were not dealt with in the same way.  Some were unfortunate enough not to be able to last long enough.  They were not an international company.  They went to the wall and there was no possibility of rescuing them.  The result was considerable disemployment and such disemployment is growing.  What was the alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no need for the Irish Government to tie themselves up with the British Government with that Agreement.  There were negotiations which resulted in what the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;<Col N="533" /> the present Minister for Finance&mdash; described as a wonderful achievement which, in fact, it was not.  We heard about the big increases that would be got for a guaranteed 638,000 head of store cattle.  That did not come off. The prices dropped.  The 638,000 head of store cattle were not bought and there never was a guarantee that they would be bought.  The British said that if they needed them they would take them, but they did not do so.  We bought a pig in a poke and this present instance of the danger of the almost complete closing down of Dunlops of Cork is one result of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken certain action.  They are not dumped tyres and the foreign tyres, on which it was necessary to put a duty of £3 per tyre in order to keep them out, were not dumped tyres.  If we are not a lot more careful about our trade agreements than we have been, we may end up with a situation in which every country that reduces tariffs can send goods here and we shall have to say to them: &ldquo;Please, we cannot stand up to this competition. Will you allow us to keep your goods out for another little while until we get a breathing space?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of all this.  I do not blame him.  He has done a lot to improve the position. The Irish industrialists have not awakened to the fact that, if they are to survive in whatever free trade is coming, they must modernise their plant and conditions and do their best to meet the competition.  They have to do their best to try to live up to it. They sat behind tariff walls for so long and took their big profits and spent the profits as they got them. They did not attempt to plough back their profits into their industry and the result, when the crunch came, was that they were not able to live up to it.  I know very little about the workings of the Dunlop Company except that when the crunch came for them they were found wanting.  I do not see how in the next 18 months, unless drastic changes are made, they can improve their position so much that they will not have to say: &ldquo;We do not <Col N="534" /> need any further protection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, this brings up again the entire question of our ability to swim in the fast-moving waters into which the Government seem so anxious to throw us.  The Department of Industry and Commerce will have to spend a great deal more time checking on our ability to survive.  The Government, whether it is a Fianna Fáil Government or any other Government, will have to make sure, before we take down any more tariff barriers, that we are not going to throw hundreds more people out of employment, because enough have gone already.  I was rather amused at the Taoiseach's attempts yesterday evening to try to prove that he was the Great White Chief leading his legions to prosperity.  He said that we, and he even mentioned Fine Gael, despite their co-operation, were criticising him and that there was no need for criticism.  This provision which is now before the House is evidence that not alone was there need for criticism but that in his own constituency in Cork there was need for criticism.  I hope he has learnt his lesson from what has happened in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into the House, I did not intend to speak, but having listened to Fine Gael and Labour Party speakers I am moved to say one or two things.  The necessity for this Control of Imports Order in respect of tyres is in itself regrettable but the implications by the Labour Party in regard to the Free Trade Area Agreement are completely misleading. I sometimes wonder what makes the Labour Party tick.  I am sure that when Deputy Tully reads what he said here, he will agree that the facts contradict it.  When the Free Trade Area Agreement was being debated here, the Labour Party opposed it very strenuously. I remember Labour Party members stating repeatedly that the Agreement was going to put industries to the wall and that the Taoiseach and the responsible Ministers concerned in its negotiation had not been careful enough about the manner in which the Agreement had been drawn up.  They said that goods which would flood the country would come in, that goods <Col N="535" /> would be dumped here and factories would be put out of business and considerable unemployment would be caused.</P>
      <P>This type of argument was used by them all through the debate, despite repeated interjections from the Minister in the House stating that there was provision in the Agreement that any industry which was gravely affected by the reduction in the tariffs could be safeguarded by the introduction by this type of control of imports which would allow the industry to meet the situation and allow the Government, as in this case, to come to the assistance of the firm and help them to meet the increased competition.  In other words, if a cold wind began to blow on any particular industry, it would not blow it out-of-doors immediately, the industry would get protection and a period in which to re-adjust and try to meet the increasing competition.  It is rather two-faced of the Labour Party to come in now and try to object to the implementation of that particular clause which was included in the Agreement to protect the odd industry which would feel the pinch.  When the Free Trade Area Agreement was being drawn up they said this clause was not in it and they tried to put it across that the Agreement was incomplete and was unsatisfactory from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>If Deputy Tully wishes to go back and look at that long and tedious debate on the Free Trade Agreement, he will see that in the speeches which he and his Party made they said repeatedly that dumping would force some industries out of business and that they said that provision should be made in the case of dumping.  I am glad to see that the Minister has acted in this instance, regrettable as it may be.  This being a large firm, it is difficult to understand why they should not have been able to compete equally with similar manufacturers in other countries.  I only <Col N="536" /> hope that with the assistance which the Government are giving them and with the breathing space of 18 months which they are getting&mdash;and which can be extended again at the end of that period by consultation and agreement between the two Governments&mdash;there will not be any need for the Government to come to the assistance of this firm for a second time and seek an extension of the period.  As I said, I did not wish to intervene but I did so, having listened to the double talk on this point from the Labour benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get the record straight.  Deputy Tully at one stage was inclined to think that we had voted for the Government motion ratifying the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain but then he realised that that was not a fact.  The fact is that when this motion came before the House, the Free Trade Area Agreement was a fact and we in the Fine Gael Party realised it was a fact and that it was something that would have to happen.  Those who were in the House at the time will recall that we tabled an amendment suggesting that the Free Trade Area Agreement must be, but regretting the manner in which it was entered into and warning the country of just the sort of thing which seems to please Deputy Tully so much that he is ready to smile, that unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would be caused in certain sections of the community. There is no double talk about this. Deputy Tully may well remember that when the Free Trade Area Agreement was first mentioned in the press, this House was in recess and it was not the Leader of the Labour Party who called for an immediate recall of the House so that the situation could be discussed and the perils inherent in such an Agreement investigated.  The Labour Party at that time were silent but now they are very loud in their condemnation. They seek to get the best of two worlds.  They say that it is a very bad thing that the Free Trade Area Agreement hit Dunlops but they also say that <Col N="537" /> it is a very good thing that this happened because it will make management pull up their socks.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the moral in this is entirely confined to management There is a moral which is applicable to every section, to management and workers alike.  I believe that the message has gone abroad and has been appreciated.  I hope it will be more and more appreciated as time goes on.</P>
      <P>In reference to this Order before us, I notice under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement, the period during which such restriction may be maintained is limited to 18 months unless the other party agrees otherwise.  I would be glad if the Minister would indicate whether he intends to approach the British Board of Trade with a view to seeing whether the period in this particular case could be extended should the circumstances so warrant.</P>
      <P>When our amendment to the Government motion in respect of the Free Trade Area Agreement came before the House we did, as I indicated, regret the manner in which the Free Trade Area Agreement had been introduced.  We felt there should have been more discussion with Irish business interests, more discussion in this House, more discussion up and down the country. That was not done.  If the Government had entered into discussions with Irish industrialists, which they should have done, we would not have had the position in which, quite suddenly the importation of British and foreign tyres took such an amazing jump that in the year 1966 nearly three times the value of tyres was imported as in the year 1965.  Naturally, the foreseeable result in my constituency was that there was very grave unemployment in this long-established firm.  It is all very well to say that they should have &ldquo;pulled up their socks&rdquo; and should have done this and that.  The fact was that the manner in which the agreement was entered into by the Government was so slipshod that this was the result.  In 1965, £221,000 worth of tyres were imported, an all-time high at that stage.  In 1966 the figure was £619,406.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of the rise in tyre imports not related to the matter we are discussing here. The impression might go forth that the only difficulty about tyre imports is the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  That is not so.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question I elicited the information that there has been a dramatic rise, although not as big as the rise in imports from Britain, in the imports of tyres from other countries. For instance, imports from Belgium rose nearly four times.  In 1965 we imported tyres valued £1,184 from Belgium and in 1966 the figure was £5,396.  Similar increases, and in some cases more, are shown in the imports from other countries such as Luxembourg, Germany, France, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Saudi Arabia and Israel.  These are not covered by the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
      <P>While it is true, as the Minister pointed out, that there has been a minimum specific duty of £3 per tyre imposed, I should be glad if he could tell us whether he considers that this step is sufficient, whether, in fact, it is going to halt the flow of tyres from other areas which could be quite damaging to Dunlops' interests.  I would ask the Minister, although I realise it is possibly outside the scope of the motion before us, to deal with that situation.  It is one of particular relevance to my constituency, but it is also one which affects the country in general.</P>

      <P>The matter before us is not one for smiling about.  Rather should the Minister and the Government come to us in sackcloth and ashes.  Without doubt during the discussion here on the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain it was described to Deputies and workers generally as a golden opportunity.  There was not the slightest indication from the Government side that within 12 months workers employed in an old and, I presume, reasonably efficient undertaking would find themselves out of employment as a direct result of the effects of this Agreement.  I presume the owners of this industry listened to the exhortations emanating from the Government benches over a number of years.  Certainly, the workers in this industry, like those in many other industries, made more than their fair contribution to the progress and modernisation of the industry by co-operating in schemes for improved productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders whether we still have existing the situation described to us here on one occasion by a former Taoiseach and former Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he said that the owners and managers of industry and commerce here were not awake to the realities of the situation and were still living in the Twenties or Thirties; but even were this the situation, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in seeking the approval of this House for the imposition of this quota&mdash;which of course he has already imposed but for which he is seeking formal approval&mdash;has told us that prior to the Free Trade Area Agreement, the importation of tyres amounted to approximately 54,000 for a 12-month period, and for the six months immediately following, the importation <Col N="540" /> increased to 92,400, almost 100,000.</P>
    <P>One wonders what the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and the other members of the Government were doing when they were discussing this Agreement.  Did they not visualise that there would be this substantial change and that it would result possibly in serious unemployment of the workers employed in that industry?  Not only that, but we have not got as yet from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his report here any indication of the number of tyres imported from December, 1966, to July, 1967.  The figures he gave are for the previous six months.  I hope the Minister, in reply to the discussion on this matter, will give the House this figure.  Is it 100,000, 120,000 or 130,000?</P>
    <P>While I would not accuse the Minister of a deliberate attempt to mislead the House, the figures he read out could be misleading.  Under the Free Trade Area Agreement, there is reference to a period of 18 months for which quotas can be imposed, and after that period, they can be imposed only provided the other party voluntarily agrees to their imposition. However, that 18 months is not 18 months from November, 1967, and the Minister, I am sure, will correct me if I am wrong.  The first part of that quota period commenced in July, 1967, and terminates in December, 1967.  Is that not correct?</P>

      <P>It is 12 from now.  It may well be that the owners of this undertaking are aware that it was 18 months from last July, but the impression which could readily be taken from the contributions so far is that they have 18 months from now.  The Minister has clarified that.  I hope the Minister will also give the House some definite information as to the total number of tyres imported in the six months December, 1966, to July, 1967, because the quantity imported during this six months, together with the 100,000 imported in the previous six months will undoubtedly have a very serious effect on the prospects of that company putting itself in a position to meet outside competition.</P>
      <P>One of the questions that arises from the introduction of this matter into the House is this: how many more workers and industries may be facing the same situation in the next few months?  The Labour Party, in being very strongly critical when this Free Trade Area Agreement was discussed in this House, were critical because there was a complete absence of adequate guarantees against this Agreement resulting in unemployment in many industries.  During the discussion, there was a lack of clarity, an attitude adopted by the Government spokesmen and, to some extent, by our friends here on the Fine Gael benches, that things would be very nice indeed, that there would be this windfall as far as the agricultural community was concerned.  This rosy future to which the experts in that field referred time and time again has not materialised and once this angle of the situation had been ventilated, they did not appear to be too greatly concerned about the possible situation facing workers who were in employment in industry in various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation which developed in Dunlops in Cork has been given fairly substantial publicity.  A large number of workers were affected, people who have worked for many years in an industry that was apparently unshakeable, and to find that they were without employment was a matter of concern not only to themselves but to people outside their immediate circle. <Col N="542" /> What of the position of workers in other industries, industries that are not as much in the public eye, industries that have not got an international flavour about them but yet in which workers are employed and on which workers depend for their livelihood? If the Minister cared to survey the situation over the past 12 months, he would find that quite a large number of workers in various employments have been faced with unemployment as a result of the failure of their industry to maintain full competitiveness in many cases with larger units across the Channel.  Not being of international standard and not having the eye of publicity upon them, jobs were not there and the workers went to sign on at the employment exchange or followed many thousands of others in a search for employment across the Channel.</P>
    <P>No doubt the House will support and endorse the proposal to impose this quota.  In doing so, the House will properly indicate its view that not only did the spokesman for the Government fail to indicate in real terms the possibilities for workers from this Free Trade Agreement, but also that the Minister for Industry and Commerce who must be indicted in this regard was somewhat lacking in dealing with this particular problem because the tremendous increase in the importation of motor tyres did not just take place in 1967.  The fact that there was a substantial increase in the number of tyres imported must have been available to the Minister through his Department very shortly after the Free Trade Agreement was debated in this House.  The Minister did not have to wait until January or February to know what the trend was.  I think it is fair to say that the Minister is capable of adding two and two together.  If the monthly average for the importation of tyres increased substantially from 4,500 in the period prior to the Free Trade Agreement, in respect of the months after the Free Trade Agreement it was quite clear to the Minister what the eventual situation would be.</P>
    <P>We are faced with having to take steps to remedy the situation in this industry or to attempt to repair the <Col N="543" /> situation to some extent over a short period.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate in his reply to what extent Messrs.  Dunlops have been able to assure him or his Department that in the next 12 months they will be able to meet the type of competition they faced in 1966-67, that they have examined the situation fully and are satisfied that they are in a position to meet that type of competition within a period of approximately 12 months from now.  Will it continue to be necessary to impose a special charge of £3 per tyre in respect of tyres from countries outside the Free Trade Agreement?</P>
    <P>The Minister represents a Party who for many years were the apostles of protection.  In recent years, the Minister's predecessors have been issuing statements from time to time exhorting the managers of industry to face up to the economic effects of coming changes.  One wonders whether the steps taken by successive Governments were adequate, or alternatively, whether those who own industries have paid any real heed to those exhortations. It appears from the evidence in many cases that there are still sections of industry that consider they can operate almost in a vacuum and without regard to what is happening elsewhere. On the other hand, are those sections of industry which have endeavoured to face up to the future getting the assistance they need?</P>
    <P>In regard to the problem before us tonight, it appears that the Minister will certainly get the support of the House in imposing this quota for the period which is permissible under the free trade arrangement.  I do not think he can escape criticism for his failure to foresee the problem and endeavour to take steps in the matter at an earlier date.  We in these benches are concerned with the future of Irish industry. We are concerned with it primarily because of the employment of workers in Irish industry.  We are concerned because of the fact that in the many Irish industries progress has only been made possible because of the contribution by the workers employed and because of their investment.  The investment of the workers in Irish industry <Col N="544" /> is the highest possible investment.  In this House and outside it, many references are made to the investment of finance <i>et cetera</i> in industry but those who invest their lives are the principal investors in any industry, as they are in agriculture, and they are deserving of every assistance and every protection that can be given to them.</P>
    <P>When placing on the record of this House our view that in the case of Dunlops the possibility of unemployment following large-scale importation of motor tyres appears to have been to some extent overlooked, we should also place on record the need for more attention to the possibility of a similar situation developing in other industries where workers are at present employed.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's proposal. We hope that the Minister and the Government will learn a lesson from the development in Cork and take steps accordingly to carry out their duty to the workers of this country and not to have to come before us again in three or four months time and tell us a similar story.  I will again ask the Minister if he will tell us, if he has the information, how many tyres were imported between December, 1966, and July, 1967, and if he will then give us an estimate of whether or not there is a surplus quantity of tyres in the country as a result of such importation and will Messrs.  Dunlop still be faced with an economic problem between now and 12 months from now?  The sum should be simple enough: 50 four thousands for 12 months, 90 four thousands for six months&mdash;in other words on that basis an equivalent of two years importation. How many thousand for the second six months and for the six months from July to December?  Thirty 2,000s are permitted under the quota and if that continues we will have 65 000 so that for this period from July, 1967, to December, 1968, there will be imported in accordance with the new quota restrictions, 90 000 because I take it the tyres imported between December, 1966, and July, 1967&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the interruption, I was telling the Minister that I take it that the tyres imported between December, 1966, and July, 1967, will not be affected by the quota imposed as and from July, 1967.  Therefore, you will have in the first six months nearly 100,000 and in the second six months, 100,000, 200,000 for a period of 12 months against a figure of 54,000 for 12 months.  It looks as if without anything else changing, we imported almost four years supply of tyres.  Add to that the 90,000 for the quota period and you have almost five to six years supply of tyres imported taking up to December, 1968.  I would be interested and I am sure the Deputies who represent the city of Cork would be interested to get some information from the Minister, if he has it, as to how Dunlops will deal with the situation, put themselves in a position to meet competition from outside the country under the Free Trade Agreement and with other competition from countries which are not at the moment within its scope and who send tyres here.  How will they perform this near-miracle within a period of a little more than 12 months?  Not just the Deputies from Cork, not just the Members of this House who are concerned with the workers but I am sure the workers in Dunlops would like to get some concrete information from the Minister when he is replying to the discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although not having the honour of representing Cork city, like my colleague, Deputy Barrett, I feel I must say a word on the situation which has arisen in Cork.  I presume this is just an early blast <Col N="546" /> of free trade which has caused the very serious situation in what can be described as one of the best organised, best managed Irish industries, the firm of Messrs.  Dunlop of Cork.  I have said many times in this House that I am a believer in Irish industry.  I believe in financial investment in industry and I believe in the investment of manpower in Irish industry and because of the critical situation that has resulted in the unemployment in Dunlops of quite a number of workers, I feel that this is a matter which concerns not alone Deputies representing Cork city but every Deputy representing both urban and rural areas who is interested in the employment of our workers in Irish industry.  It is right on this order we are now debating that we should place on record that it is an order dealing solely with this particular situation and with one industry, Messrs.  Dunlop of Cork. I venture to say that in the directory of industries, there is not any mention of a well established industry with such a good record for producing extra production as Messrs.  Dunlop of Cork. There is no industry in this country which has treated the workers more favourably, and which has taken such a pride and a delight in providing employment and in providing additional employment than Messrs.  Dunlop.</P>
      <P>We now find that as a result of the importation of tyres, resulting from the Free Trade Area Agreement, a number of workers lost their employment. When this has happened to one of the best and one of the most efficiently managed industries in Ireland, what will happen to the industries which are less efficient and what will happen to the industries that have not even made the preparations Messrs.  Dunlop have made to meet free trade?  If the Minister thinks our Irish industries of today are geared to meet free trade, I am sorry to say he is living in cloud cuckoo-land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but here is one instance in which tyres <Col N="547" /> manufactured by Messrs.  Dunlop of Cork of as good a standard, if not beyond the standards, as any tyres that can come into the country have come into difficulties.  May I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce what is really wrong?  Surely Messrs. Dunlop of Cork are able to manufacture, and are manufacturing, sufficient tyres to meet the home market in this country, or is it the situation that our Irish people here are buying imported tyres in preference to the tyres manufactured here in Ireland by Messrs. Dunlop of Cork?  I find it very hard to believe that this takes us back again to what we were speaking about the other night when we were dealing with the Shannon industries and other industries, that you have motorists, farmers using tractors, the owners of lorries and other vehicles who must be using imported tyres on their vehicles.</P>
      <P>Would it not be a step in the right direction, in order to cut down the import of tyres, and in order to ensure that there will be a continuous manufacture of tyres by Messrs.  Dunlop, if efforts were made to initiate a campaign, as has been done in the case of our Irish industries, for the use on all vehicles of tyres manufactured within the country?  Surely if we have an industry manufacturing an excellent article, we should buy that article.  I venture to say that if it goes to a panel of experts, they will express the opinion that the tyres manufactured by Messrs.  Dunlop of Cork are of a very high quality and that they are equal in quality and standard to any tyres that can be imported.  Therefore, when we have an excellent product made by our own workers in Cork city, by a firm who, in my opinion, have a very efficient industry, who have put a good article on the market, I cannot understand the mentality of the Irish consumers, if we can describe them as consumers, the purchasers of tyres, who will buy imported tyres in preference to a superior and high quality tyre made available to them by Messrs. Dunlop of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give us, as Deputy Larkin rightly asked him, some further helpful statistics.  This, <Col N="548" /> in my opinion, is a very important matter.  Has the Minister any information at his disposal in regard to the home market for tyres, about whether imported tyres are purchased by the Irish public in preference to tyres manufactured by Messrs.  Dunlop of Cork?  If it is the case that the purchasers of tyres in Ireland, whether they be for tractors, lorries, motor cars or other vehicles, are purchasing the imported article in preference to the home produced tyre, I say it is a disgrace and a shame on them that they do not realise their responsibility to Irish industry and the men employed in making tyres in this country.  Those men will be placed on the unemployed list if the people in Ireland are purchasing imported tyres in preference to the Irish produced tyres.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  It is a matter which affects Messrs.  Dunlop today but what other Irish industry will it affect tomorrow?  When Messrs.  Dunlop of Cork have felt this slight breeze&mdash;it can be described as a very slight breeze&mdash;of free trade, when this highly organised and highly efficient concern have had to suffer the serious effects of imported tyres, may the Lord help those industries which are not prepared as Messrs.  Dunlop.</P>
    <P>I feel there was a duty on the Government, not today, not last year but many years ago to do something about this.  We heard the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, saying that years ago he had been keying up industry to meet competition from outside, that he had been keying up industry for free trade, that he was convinced that all our Irish industries could meet any competition which could come from outside.  Here we have one of the most efficient and one of the most highly geared industries which felt the slight breeze of free trade and this has meant the loss of jobs to workers in Cork city.  I am concerned with the employment of those workers equally as much as Deputy Barrett, who has the honour to represent them.</P>
    <P>The men employed in this industry are specialists in tyre production; they have received a considerable training <Col N="549" /> and they have a special skill for the manufacture of tyres.  When those men are thrown out of employment, it means there is no other suitable work available for them.  This is a very serious matter.  It is a very serious matter for their wives; it is a very serious matter for their children; and it is a very serious matter for the people of Cork.  The very short debate which we have had in this House for the past few hours regarding this matter gives representatives representing constituencies other than Cork city food for thought.  This may have a serious effect on other Irish industries.  That is why I say it is a very serious matter.  It is now within 13 months that Messrs.  Dunlop have been asked to re-organise and to make an effort to meet and compete against imports of foreign tyres into this country.  I am afraid that one of the first steps we must take is to appeal to the patriotic sense of our people to support our own industries, to support our own workers, in the knowledge that by buying Irish they are keeping their own people in employment in their own cities.  I have always been a believer in that and I feel the Minister shares my views.  The more Irish goods we buy the more Irish people we keep in employment.  It is far better for us to buy Irish tyres manufactured in Cork than to buy tyres manufactured by Irish people in parts of Great Britain; it provides work at home and that is what we want.</P>
    <P>The purpose of establishing industry in the first instance is to provide industries and employment for our own people.  In so far as Dunlops are concerned, I know of no other industry in this country that is so efficiently managed, so highly organised, who are such good employers or who are so considerate of their workers.  It must have caused the management of Dunlops very serious concern when they had to dispense with the services of many of those who were trained and skilled in the manufacture of tyres in the Irish industry.  What more can Dunlops do for the next 12 months to help them meet the challenge which will be repeated?  That is a question I should like the Minister to answer.  Has he told Dunlops what they will do in <Col N="550" /> 12 months time or are the workers employed by the industry in Cork just living on a month to month basis?</P>
    <P>At the end of 12 months&mdash;13 months to be accurate&mdash;they will again be faced with the position of tyre imports. I should like to know what more the industry can do.  What more is expected of them?  As this is an unusual situation brought about by a trade agreement to which the Government was a party, what practical steps will the Government take and what financial assistance, if any, guidance or advice will the Government give in order to help Dunlops meet the situation that will have to be met in 12 to 18 months time?</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter and I hope the Minister realises it.  I am afraid he is living in cloud cuckoo land if he thinks we are prepared for free trade. I do not think we are.  Here is an example of one of the most highly-organised industries in the country.  Is the Minister satisfied that a duty of £3 per tyre is sufficient?  What results does the Minister expect to come from it? Does he feel that this duty will result in a cutting down in the import of tyres as against the purchase of Irish-manufactured tyres?</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the mentality of Irishmen or Irishwomen in industry, or in any sphere of activity, who when they require the products of industry do not first seek to purchase the Irish product.  After so many years of Irish industry we are still suffering from an inferiority complex with regard to what we can produce.  Because an article is made in Ireland many people still say that it cannot be any good and that they prefer to buy the imported article.  I wonder is that said about tyres.  I have never in a quarter of a century used any tyre except a Dunlop tyre and I have never used a car except a Ford.  The purchase of our own goods in our own country keeps our people in employment.  I feel strongly on this and I assure the Minister, with regard to the difficulties he is now meeting in relation to Dunlops of Cork, that he has no guarantee that he will not be confronted with the same situation in other industries in the future.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied and convinced <Col N="551" /> that by the end of twelve months Dunlops will be sufficiently organised?  I doubt that they can be organised to a higher degree than they are.  What help will the Government give them to meet this new situation, created by the Government, mark you, and I emphasise that?  The Minister must accept responsibility.  It is his job to protect Irish industry.  It is his job to see that there is no redundancy, no unemployment, and to see that every effort will be made to safeguard workers and protect the children and the wives of all those engaged in Irish industry who find themselves in uncertainty and doubt.  They cannot plan for the future.</P>
    <P>You have employers like Dunlops probing in the dark and they will not know where to start when they are deluged with a flood of imports in 12 months time.  This is a matter to which the House should give the gravest consideration.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has come to the House having taken steps helpful to Dunlops of Cork, a firm which I believe is worthy of help, co-operation and support.  They are one of the few Irish firms of international reputation of which we can be very proud. We are proud of the workers who have been trained in Dunlops and of those who have been engaged in the firm in Cork.  They have in my opinion excelled themselves in efficiency and in the skills in which they are now trained, skills which will be of little use to them in any other branch of Irish Industry.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure the House that at the end of 13 months we will not again be in the same position in Cork and that the firm of Dunlops can look forward to a future in which they will not be faced with unfair competition from outside, competition that will come from abroad under conditions of free trade?  I doubt if our industrialists are geared to meet it.</P>
    <P>We have had in the past a lot of talk.  An ounce of action is worth a ton of talk and there has not been enough action to prepare Dunlops for the consequences of a flood of tyres into this country.  The competition is <Col N="552" /> unfair and could not properly be met by them.  I hope the steps now being taken by the Minister will make re-employment possible for all the workers in Cork city who through no fault of Dunlops have been thrown out of employment, and that steps will be taken by the Government to see that this situation will not again arise.</P>
    <P>If the Minister sees there is a danger of a recurrence of this situation within the next 13 months, when this Order expires, will he keep in touch with the British Board of Trade?  His job is, as leader of Irish industry, to protect Irish industry, to protect employment and to protect families and homes depending on Irish industry.  We should not allow the British, or any other outsiders, to flood our country with imports.  We should take the necessary steps to see that our workers and our industries are protected.  What plans has the Minister for those workers and their future? The workers want to know about the plans.  They want to know what the Minister is doing to ensure that the workers of Dunlop and of other undertakings affected by the slight breeze of free trade will not find themselves out of jobs.</P>
    <P>A word of thanks is due to the Minister for what he has done in this situation.  It called for action.  I have knowledge of it because while in Cork I spoke to those people and I should like to put on record my appreciation &mdash;I feel sure this applies to the Minister also&mdash;of the work undertaken by Deputy Barrett particularly, and by the other Cork Deputies.  This has been of great concern to all the workers in Cork, to their wives and their families. I should like the Minister to tell the House what he has in mind if and when this arises again at the end of 13 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with only a few aspects of this matter. I know the situation in the Dunlop firm as a businessman.  As the managing director of a cloth firm, I have supplied the company with cloth.  I know the place and the people and I should like to point out that it is not today or yesterday that Dunlops became <Col N="553" /> aware of the problems.  They are associated with the English Dunlop company, a very big company.  I know their costings are given to them in Cork from Manchester.  They knew in Cork, when free trade was mooted, exactly where they stood.  It was not a question of 13 months but of three or four years. They are quite aware of the situation, or they should be aware of it.  There is the question of Irish-made cloth in free trade conditions and surely, if we want to get into Europe, we must be competitive.</P>
      <P>I regard the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement as a trial and Article 19 as a kind of warning shot across the bows of the Dunlop management.  In conditions of free trade, Dunlop could get their cloth from any part of the world and the Irish mills could sell their product to any part of the world.  In the tyre industry, there are world standards. I am as concerned about the future of our workers as are Deputies Larkin and Flanagan.  I am also concerned because I know that Irish workers will not exist without competitive industry. Messrs Dunlop know what is coming. I do not wish to tread outside this Quota Order but there are plenty of things that can be done, like readaptation, integration and marketing techniques, things the Dunlop company are capable of managing.  It may be of interest to the House to know that Dunlop make Goodyear tyres under licence.</P>

It is up to them to diversify and to take other steps.  It is not up to the Minister.  The Minister has given them this handout; they have had three years, not 13 months, and the Minister would not be doing his duty if he did not bring in this order.  The breath of free trade has been blowing during the past three years and we must face up to it.</P>

      <P>I will come to another question and I hope it is in order.  Why have we this Order before us tonight?  We have it mainly because the Government now admit that this Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement was not all they made it out to be at the beginning. Secondly, and maybe this should have got pride of place, we have this before the House because on 8th November last, in the Taoiseach's constituency, the vote of the Taoiseach's Party dropped by more than 3,000 as <Col N="556" /> compared with the general election of 1965 and the vote of the Labour Party increased by 3,000.</P>

      <P>You overlooked the point that it was not Deputy Murphy who brought in this question of the Free Trade Area Agreement. That is brought in here in the Minister's statement and this matter arises directly from it.  If you will bear with me I will point out to you where it is mentioned that discussions with the British Board of Trade were initiated in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  So that, it is not Deputy Murphy who is bringing in this question of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  It is brought in in the Minister's opening statement and, that being the case, I understood that the Rules of the House permitted me to refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy's rules of the House are totally different from the rules I have to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, Sir, the main fact as set down in the statement is that after 1st July, 1966, a very short time after the introduction of the Trade Agreement to which you do not like me to refer, we found that when tyres were allowed to be imported without the restrictions which had obtained previously, employment dropped and Irish industry was not able to cope with competition from outside.  That is a very important issue. It is saddening for Members of the House that that should be the position in the case of a firm such as Dunlops, the qualifications of which have been <Col N="560" /> elaborated on by Deputy Flanagan, and which is a firm well and capably managed.  If such a company, that is efficiently managed and that has, as Deputy P.J. Lenihan told us, world-wide connections, cannot compete with outside firms who sent tyres into this country when restrictions were removed, how can other firms so compete? This is evidence beyond doubt that the statements made from the Labour benches were justified.  It is, indeed, unfortunate that the Government were so shortsighted as to tell us a few years ago when speaking in support of the Trade Agreement that after a short time we would be able to stand on our own feet, to enter the Common Market and to meet open competition with the countries of Western Europe and any other continental countries so far as goods and commodities were concerned.</P>
      <P>That has been proven false.  Cognisance must be taken of it in view of the many statements made by the Taoiseach and other members of the Government in relation to our entry into the Common Market.  If we succeed in getting into the Common Market will we get there the same consideration as we are now getting from the British Board of Trade?  Perhaps not.  I understand they are not anxious to allow more than a five-year transitional period.  Mark you, I am afraid that five years will not be nearly sufficient to put us into a position to compete with the other countries of the Commission.  This is very important. It is saddening news to hear, after a Government of Fianna Fáil for almost 30 years constantly telling us how they developed industries and gave grants towards development, how they imported technical know-how, how capably managed our industries were under their guidance and how they were acting as a kind of fairy godmother to Irish industrialists in order to allow them to develop so that they could compete with any country in the world, after this period of guardianship by Fianna Fáil that the main industry in the country, Dunlops of Cork, could not compete with outside competition and, as a result, Dunlop's workers had to leave their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> This is a short-term policy.  Every one of us likes to see the workers in Cork continued in their employment. As Deputy Flanagan said, we know what it means to their wives and families when they are out of work.  We know that it is unlikely alternative employment will be available for them and, as they are skilled in this particular industry, it may be difficult for them, particularly those of advanced years, to acquire other skills.  Naturally the Labour Party supports this Control of Import Order and we would like to hear from the Minister now has he had any discussions as to what will happen when the 18 months expires or are we leaving the future to look after itself?</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement the period during which such restrictions may be maintained is limited to 18 months unless the other party agrees otherwise.</P>
    <P>The other party in this particular case is our old enemy, Britain, the country we said we could live without; if there was a wall built around Ireland we could live without Britain and &ldquo;Burn everything except their coal&rdquo;.  We find now, in 1967 that we can do very little without Britain.  We cannot even make an independent application to the EEC. The Taoiseach now admits our application is hinged on the British application. There is no other way of doing the job.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by virtue of his functions, will have to approach the British Board of Trade again in the not too distant future seeking a further exemption from the President of the Board of Trade.  Let us hope that further exemption will be granted.</P>
    <P>If I interpret the views expressed by my friend, Deputy P.J. Lenihan, I believe he indicated the Dunlop company in that they had an extended period to consider what the impact of the removal of restrictions would be and they did not make good use of the time.</P>

      <P>The results of the steps are that we must now impose this Quota Order and a duty of £3 on tyres from countries other than Britain.  This order speaks for itself. As a Cork Deputy, I repeat that the Government must carry the full blame. Their shortsightedness, their inefficiency and their lethargy will, I am sure, bring home to the Minister and to the Taoiseach the necessity for taking a general look at Government policy so far as imports and exports are concerned and so far as the removal of tariffs is concerned.  What has happened in relation to Dunlop workers in Cork will be helpful in making the Government review their policy generally.  I am thankful this order holds out hope of continued employment for workers in Cork.  I conclude by asserting once more that the people who are mainly responsible for this measure are the people who voted for the Labour candidate on 8th November in the Cork by-election.</P>

      <P>I think I know as much about Dunlop workers as any Deputy and I know the reaction when they found the Government had taken the action it did.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Flanagan pay tribute to the skill and ability of the Cork workers. I am glad he met them on his visit to our city.</P>
      <P>Dunlop has world-wide ramifications and is not looking for money for development, research and so on.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled discussion on the Free Trade Agreement out of order in this debate and all I want to say in connection with that is that I do not regret any part I took in that.  I am sure the workers of Cork will not regret it when they know the full ramifications. I have every confidence that under good management and with the finances the Dunlop international company have to expend, there can be no doubt about the future of Dunlop's in Cork.  What has happened is a temporary set-back.  Many people in Cork believe that improvement has already taken place in the quality of the product produced to meet international competition.  As a motorist, I can now buy tyres which I could not buy 12 months ago because they were then for export only.  They are the best tyres I have ever driven on. They are made by Dunlops.  I have never driven on anything but a Dunlop tyre.</P>
      <P>I hope this measure will not have to be repeated when the time expires. When the time comes, I am confident the Dunlop factory and the Cork worker will be able to meet any competition they may get from anywhere.  I have much more confidence in the ability and skill of the Irish worker than Deputy Murphy has.</P>

      <P>I want to ask Deputy Healy if he told the Dunlop workers that this Quota Order lapses at the end of 12 months from today.  Now, I have no doubt whatever that he made the welkin ring with the news that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, confronted with the arrival of 15,400 tyres per month from Great Britain, rushed into the gap, armed to the teeth with the provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement, and imposed a quota controlling the imports of tyres to 65,000 units per annum.</P>

I do not want to challenge a new Deputy who has just come into this House but I wonder if Deputy French even knew these facts?  I wonder if he believed that, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had the right, indefinitely, to restrict by quota the import of any commodities from Great Britain which he was able to persuade the British Board of Trade would constitute a menace to an existing industry in this country.</P>

It is true that he was in a dreadful dilemma.  I think Deputy Healy is too honest a man to tell the people a lie but if he mentioned it and told them the truth he would have been torn to pieces by his colleagues and Deputy French, instead of being the minority Deputy for Cork, might not have been a Deputy for Cork at all. Is that true or is it false?</P>

The Dunlop tyre factory in Cork is exporting motor tyres to Great Britain and lo and behold the people who are rushing to buy the Dunlop tyres from Cork suddenly take it into their heads to ship 15,400 tyres per month, 180,000 per year, to us.  Can anyone explain to me how we sell tyres in Great Britain at a time when we are obliged to invoke Article 19 of the Trade Agreement to protect our domestic industry <Col N="570" /> from British exports of tyres for a period of 18 months by leave of the British Board of Trade?</P>

      <P>Is it not fascinating?  It is a situation which I do not think is any harm to debate in this House because not until we know how and why this mysterious situation came to pass can we with propriety approve of a quota order which, by the Minister's own statement, ends 12 months from today, subject to whatever rights he may retain to consult the British President of the Board of Trade.  By heavens, Deputy Wyse has arrived. This is a most interesting thing.  We have been debating this quota order from relatively early this evening and it is astonishing that for the greater part of the debate hair or hide of Fianna Fáil Deputies from Cork we could not see.</P>

When Deputy Healy was speaking, he ignored Deputy Lenihan's intervention and pledged his word that throughout the course of the by-election campaign in Cork city he never mentioned the quota order relating to tyres, so doubtless Deputy Wyse will make his contribution in due time in the light of those interventions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Barrett discharged a very useful public duty, to reveal to the public the true meaning of what this quota order means.  Mind you, it is pregnant with meaning because it provides temporary protection for a very great industry which, mark you, was not established today or yesterday in Cork.  It is a long time since Dunlops opened their factory in Cork. It is one of the oldest industries in this country.  It is not Fianna Fáil that put them there, in case they should be suffering under the illusion it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this device is necessary to save so venerable an industry, so well-run an industry, so experienced an industry as the Irish Dunlop Company, what must we apprehend under this agreement in respect of other industries when their turn comes?  I want to speak tonight only of the problems that lie ahead in respect of this Order, which relates to tyres produced by the Dunlop Company.  The best hope Deputy Healy and Deputy Lenihan can give us is that in the course of the next 12 months this company will find this kind of protection no longer necessary. Deputy Healy, Deputy Wyse and Deputy French may be nursing to their bosoms the comforting thought that, as the currency of this Order runs out and as the possibility looms above the horizon that the President of the <Col N="572" /> British Board of Trade will say: &ldquo;No, I will not agree to any extension beyond the 18 months provided in the original agreement for quota orders of this kind,&rdquo; we in Ireland may have recourse to other devices to facilitate the export of the produce of this factory until such time as it can meet the blast of foreign competition, whencesoever it may come.</P>
    <P>Have they forgotten that last week we adhered to GATT?  Have they forgotten the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? Have they forgotten we are only now at the beginning of the exercise of bringing duties down?  Have they forgotten that when we devalued our pound to match the devaluation of the British our costs for rubber went up overnight by 14.3 per cent?  How much of a tyre consists of rubber?  How much of a tyre consists of cotton?  Have the Deputies from Cork paused to ask themselves where the cotton comes from?  The man who spins it, Deputy Lenihan, has disappeared.  They have got him out of the House at last.  It is a pity.  If he had stayed much longer we would have got closer to the truth. They have sent him home to bed.  They did very wisely.  Few Deputies realise that in the last two or three days our capacity to compete elsewhere than in Great Britain with a commodity of this kind, all the raw materials of which come from countries who have not devalued their currency, is shrinking hour by hour and day by day.</P>
    <P>I imagine it is to meet a situation of this kind, arising from this quota order and its inevitable termination in 12 months' time, that we passed recently the Redundancy Bill.  There are going to be more made redundant in this factory.  Have they been told, or have they been told on the lines of Deputy Lenihan that: &ldquo;All is well.  You can leave it to the management of Dunlops?&rdquo; Every trade agreement must of its very nature mean that there is giving and taking on both sides.  I believe Ireland is no exception to that general rule.  If we want a trade agreement with Great Britain which is the agreement we refer to in this Order, we have to give if we hope to take, just as <Col N="573" /> the British said to us: &ldquo;We are prepared to give in consideration of what we hope to take.&rdquo;  We got very considerable advantages in the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  We should not close our eyes to the fact that we got free access to the British market for a variety of products, agricultural and industrial, produced in the County Cork.  But one of the things we had to give was access on certain terms to British manufacturers to the Irish market.</P>
    <P>I do not in the least regret the decision taken by this House in regard to the Trade Agreement which contains the appropriate provision for this Quota Order.  But I do regret the failure to tell the people what it truly meant, the failure to tell the workers &mdash;the management already know&mdash;in the Dunlop factory that this kind of protection is for 12 months, and the utter failure of the Government to tell either this House and the electors in Cork city during the last three weeks what they propose to do thereafter in respect of the employment provided in this factory down through the decades in which Dunlops have constituted part of the industrial life of Cork. Mark you, I think it rather odd and not in character with Deputy Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that knowing the quality of this undoubted problem he should have participated in the Cork campaign and, either by silence or by careful ambiguity, withheld from the electors something they were entitled to know. It lowers the whole standard of our public life.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy not know&mdash;I have already told him&mdash;that <Col N="574" /> when this Order was made and published there was a public statement to the effect that this was of limited duration?  I cannot say precisely but my recollection is it said &ldquo;not exceeding 18 months&rdquo;.  It certainly made it clear that it was of temporary duration. This is a fact to which I have referred before.  Why does the Deputy persist in arguing it and building up a case about lowering the standard of public life?  This is an important matter and I do not think the Deputy should indulge in this kind of activity lightly and without regard to the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if I did, the Minister would be a hundred times justified in reprobating what I did.  It would be sheer hypocrisy on my part if I took a lofty line to make capital at the Minister's expense by expounding a falsehood.  However, I do not think the Minister is being honest with himself. I do not charge him with being dishonest with us, but he and I are long enough in public life to know that Quota Orders published are understood by 99 per cent of those who read them to represent a physical limitation on the future imports of a certain commodity. They do not read the small print.</P>

I am saying a public statement issued explaining this not in terms of a quota period order or in quota order language, but in ordinary language; the matter got a good deal of publicity and was certainly clearly understood by the workers in Dunlops. I am saying this is a fact and the Deputy should be aware of it as a fact before he goes on to build an argument based on a presumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the force of the Minister's case.  He can say: &ldquo;I feel that when the fact of the strictly <Col N="575" /> limited period for which I have the power to make a Quota Order had been frankly stated last July, it is going beyond the limits of what any ordinary politician should be required to do, that I should go down into the Cork by-election campaign and say: &ldquo;Boys, did you read the small print?&rdquo; He is entitled to say: &ldquo;The thing was done in public.  The record is there for anyone to read and it is not a topic on which I propose to dwell.&rdquo;  I can understand that, but when Deputy Barrett challenged the Minister and his colleagues, as the Minister says Deputy Barrett did, and said: &ldquo;As regards the statement you made six months ago, no matter how detailed it was six months ago, the people here in Cork do not know that 12 months hence they are going to meet exactly the same dilemma and you have a duty to tell them if you are in a position to do so.&rdquo;  What will the Minister do when this order runs out?  He knows I was not at the by-election campaign for reasons into which it is unnecessary to go, but the Minister tells us that Deputy Barrett put this matter in issue and he derided him for doing so.</P>

Digest what he has told you. Consider the implication of the warning he has offered.&rdquo;  On the contrary, I think they talked of the resolute promptitude with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce acted to protect this industry in Cork.

      <P>A very prudent precaution, because I want to keep the record straight, too, and the record I am trying to keep straight is this: what are the facts?  Does anybody know?  I would have thought from what the Minister said and from the statement he was good enough to hand us&mdash;it <Col N="577" /> was very short&mdash;that the sum and substance of this order is &ldquo;quota protection for a period of 18 months beginning the 1st of last July, but not thereafter except subject to the consent of the President of the Board of Trade in the event of my being authorised by the Government of the Republic to approach him again.&rdquo;  Is that not a fair representation of the Minister's statement? I think it is, in fact.  The Minister has an understanding with the President of the Board of Trade that there may be three quota periods each of six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have said this Quota Order operated for the last six months, will operate for the next 12 months and that at the end of that period further consultations will be had with the President of the British Board of Trade and if he enters an absolute caveat under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, the Minister will feel himself debarred from having recourse to quota protection after the approved 18 months.  It would appear from the Minister's interjection that that is the position, that he has secured the agreement of the British Board of Trade to a six months quota and that he anticipates that the agreement with the British Board of Trade will be forthcoming for two further quota periods of six months each, each permitting the import of not more than 65,000 articles, but that thereafter he can give no warranty, or even an informed prophecy, to the House as to what the situation is likely to be I wonder did Deputy Healy know that until I managed to extract it. Certainly Deputy Lenihan said in the <Col N="578" /> House that they have had three years and now they have another year to get their affairs in order.  He rebuked Deputy Flanagan who, he said, appeared to pass the responsibility to the Minister.  He said it is not his responsibility, that he has done his part and that it is now for the management of Dunlops.  Who is speaking the truth?</P>

      <P>We are in this deplorable situation.  I read&mdash;not only heard but read as every other Deputy did&mdash; the Minister's statement introducing his own Quota Order.  Certainly Deputy Lenihan, his own supporter, does not understand it.  It appears now that I do not understand it.  Poor Deputy Healy is looking bewildered because, I suspect, he does not know either.

      <P>No; it is the night of revelation.  This is a matter about <Col N="579" /> which Deputy Wyse does not ring a bell.  There are other topics on which he has been ringing a bell for the past two days.  If this were a permanent quota protection for Dunlop's factory, I wonder would Deputy Wyse's bell have been so silent?  On the contrary, it would not be a handbell he would be ringing.  He would be swinging out of a rope.  The Bells of Shandon would have nothing on him.  Now he is not even able to borrow one from an altar boy because this order is not one about which Deputy Wyse desires to ring a bell.  Why?  Why does he not desire to ring a bell?  Is it because he is afraid the people might understand what it means?  Why does Deputy Wyse not ring a bell about this order?  Was it not his duty as a Deputy for Cork, asking the people to vote for Deputy French, to ask them to come and listen to him while he expounded to them on this order which is so vitally important to the people whose votes he sought?

      <P>I do not find fault with the Minister for his reaction to the dilemma in which he finds himself, but I do find fault with him because I do not believe he took the precaution of telling the people the true significance of what he was doing, or what he was in a position to do.  I do not think the Deputies who support him from Cork were honest with their supporters because I do not think they told them either.  If you went to the ordinary workingman in Dunlops tonight, he would say: &ldquo;What was all the talk about the Quota Order?  What was all the debate in Dáil Éireann about the Quota Order?  Everyone appeared to want to save our jobs.  Why talk so much about it?&rdquo; None would know that the reason is that the Quota Order drops dead 12 months from today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does the Minister believe they know?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They know this.  They have been told this in public.  I do not know where Deputy Dillon was when this happened but his whole case is based on a false premise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the management of Dunlops since before the Minister was born and I am as certain as I am standing in this House that there is no more efficient management in Ireland than the management of Dunlop's factory.  Let us be clear about it. If the management of Dunlop's factory is not good enough for the world in which we live, then there is no management in Europe with any prospect of survival.  I do not believe that the kind of management Dunlops has sat on their hands for the past three years, trusting to God, like Mr. Micawber, that something would turn up.  I do not believe that the management of Dunlops never spent a penny in order to enhance the competitiveness or the efficiency of the factory over which they preside and of the factory which provides the livelihood of hundreds of workers in the city of Cork.  I am perfectly certain that the management of the Dunlop factory did all that reasonable men could possibly do to meet the requisitions made upon them by the Minister and his predecessor and those who spoke for the Government.</P>
      <P>Is the case made here tonight that this whole problem of the arrival of tyres in this country at the rate of 15,400 a month is due to any laches or failure on the part of the management of Dunlops?  Is that the Fianna Fáil case?  If it is, it is time they made it.  If that case is to be made, let it be made so that it can be challenged.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has recently referred to the eloquence of silence and compared it with the eloquence of words.  Up to now the only positive explanation of the situation that has been provided has been provided by Deputy Lenihan, senior, and he says he supposes that Dunlops did what they could in the past three years, &ldquo;for they have had three years&rdquo; he said &ldquo;to adapt themselves, and doubtless they will do still more in the year that lies ahead&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> Let us all agree that the management of Dunlops did all that a competent, diligent, effective management could do for three years.  Deputy Lenihan, who claims to know the inner workings of the Dunlop factory says that, to his knowledge, they were keenly aware of the problems that lay ahead and that, to his knowledge, they were doing all in their power to adapt themselves to that situation.  Let us all agree that this is so.  Deputy Wyse is here from Cork to correct me if I am wrong, and Deputy Healy is here.  Do they allege that Dunlops did not do their part? All my information goes to show that the management of Dunlops did all in their power to bring the efficiency of that factory up to the highest level to which it was possible to bring it and they were dealing with a situation in which they had not an inexperienced staff.  They have as well trained a staff as there is in any part of Ireland, France, Italy or Britain.  I mention the three larger countries as the three great tyre producers in Europe: Goodyear, Dunlops and other British combines in Britain.  The net result of the three years exercise which we all agreed had been made was that tyres were coming in at the rate of 15,400 a month. What does Deputy Healy or Deputy Wyse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, I shall talk about tyres.  We all agree that Dunlops did what they could, the management and the men, and are faced with a crisis now.  Deputy Lenihan, speaking for Fianna Fáil says: &ldquo;Let the management do their best for another 12 months and if they do not succeed then, do not blame the Minister.  Do not ask the Minister for an explanation.&rdquo; What I want to know is: have the men been told?  Are they going to be told, because they will want an answer to this question.  It is not enough to tell us at the end of 12 months when this Quota Order reaches its conclusion.  We want to know what is going to happen hereafter, and when you prepare your story, do not forget that full publicity has been given to our adhesion to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but it is not understood in all its details by every workman in Dunlop's factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever we propose to do when this Order comes to its end, we will have to do in the context not only of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement but of GATT as well.  I have not heard anyone tell me here tonight, and I am as quick to hear as the next one, what the Government proposes to do.  I think so large a body of men, so large a number of old established families in Cork are entitled to have at least 12 months notice wherein to plan their future.  If we are in the position to give <Col N="585" /> them the good news that there is no abridgment of the permanence of their employment and that they can plan on the assumption that no lesser volume of production or employment will be available in the Dunlop factory than has been heretofore, then we ought to give that assurance here and now, because nothing can be more cruel than to hold such people in the unendurable suspense as not knowing from month to month or from week to week what their future and the future of their families is to be.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - County Donegal Transport Services.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Today I asked the Minister for Transport and Power a question in relation to the inadequate air and sea transport services to and from County Donegal.  The reason I raised this matter and my reason for raising it on the Adjournment is the general unrest in County Donegal, due to the recent announcement by an air company serving County Donegal from Eglinton, County Derry, known as Emerald Airways.  This small company have announced that presently they are going out of business for certain reasons, mostly financial.</P>
      <P>I feel, as a public representative representing County Donegal, that I would be failing in my duty if I did not ventilate the seriousness of the bad transport services now in existence in County Donegal.  Let us examine the position as we find it.  I am told that some 40 years ago we had better services to and from County Donegal than we have today.  We had a railway service second to none.  I am told that in 1936 the express train could leave the City of Derry, collect the passengers from the towns of Inishowen and north County Donegal at Derry, collect the passengers at Strabane from the eastern parts of Donegal and be in this city in three hours.  That service has been withdrawn because of the constant and deliberate policy of the present Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> Some 12 months ago or more, the boat service, which was very much appreciated by the number of people who, out of necessity, because they cannot earn their living in their native county, must migrate to the northern parts of the British Isles, to Glasgow and the southern parts of Scotland, was withdrawn.  When a question was addressed to the Minister by my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, on 26th July this year, he said the withdrawal of that boat service would in no way affect the tourist industry in County Donegal, nor would it affect in any way the ability of the people to move to and from Scotland and Donegal because of the fact that a service was now being provided at Eglinton, Derry, by Emerald Airways.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on a native Government that, because of deliberate policies outlined by them, implemented by them, now many of the mothers in Donegal are asking: &ldquo;How is my son or daughter going to come back for Christmas?&rdquo; Most people working in Scotland from Donegal come back for Christmas and come back for the summer months.  Most of them have booked with this air company.  All arrangements have been made to come home for Christmas.  Now, the only alternative is to use the service provided by British European Airways into Belfast.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power calmly stated here on 26th July that the services provided at Eglinton were ample, adequate and acceptable to him and would serve the people of Donegal without any protest from either Deputy O'Donnell or myself in relation to his lack of interest in the withdrawal of the boat service from Glasgow to Derry.  I feel that the least any public representative can do is to make an earnest appeal to the Minister to concern himself urgently with this problem.  We now are faced with the situation that we have neither sea, air nor rail services out of Donegal to the northern parts of the British Isles, namely, Glasgow and the southern shires of Scotland or to our capital city.</P>
    <P>Basically, the argument I am making here today is focussed on the transport <Col N="587" /> arrangements which most people in Donegal use to travel between Glasgow and Derry.  It is not just good enough that a Minister for Transport and Power should state in this House that he is not at all interested in what goes on in relation to providing those services, the services being provided by an outside body.  They made an appeal to an outside government for financial assistance and I am told that something may develop on those lines.</P>
    <P>This is one of the main reasons why I tabled this question to the Minister and why I make this appeal to him.  If he is as anxious to co-operate, as indeed he and other Members of the Government would like us to believe, with the northern authorities, here is an opportunity; hear is a case crying out for urgency.  Here is a case where he can say to his counterpart in Belfast: &ldquo;I am concerned with the problem because of the bad services for the people in County Donegal.  I am prepared to go along with you in backing Emerald Airways, or any other company, which is prepared to give the services in or out of Eglinton, which will serve us, or give a service to the people in County Donegal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last night I attended a meeting of the Inishowen executive at Carndonagh. The result of this was the sending of a telegram to the Minister for Transport and Power to take action on this with his opposite number.  Those people were all of the same political persuasion as I but were a cross-section of the community.  Every one of them was of the opinion that something must be done.  If the boat service is not to be restored between Glasgow and Derry, then the air service must be restored, or the alternative, as Deputy Cunningham will verify, is for the Minister to go out on his own and provide some airstrip in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am not terribly concerned whether the airstrip will be in Donegal or whether it will serve counties Derry, Tyrone and Donegal.  All I am concerned with is a good service.  Admittedly, as a Donegal man, I would prefer to have it in Donegal but if <Col N="588" /> economics dictate that the best way would be to have it at Eglinton airport, which was used by the British Air Force but which is now a civil airport, then I am prepared to yield and ask the people, who might be more parochial than I am, to agree with that and allow that service to be developed for the decent people I represent.</P>
    <P>I know on very good authority that this service is quite satisfactory.  It is a paying proposition.  When they studied the venture, I understand they calculated, and were quite prepared to accept that approximately 10,000 people would use the service.  The official figures show that 17,000 people have used that service in the past 12 months.  Of those 17,000 people, I am told that approximately 12,500 were travelling to or from Donegal. This suggests that the Minister cannot stand idly by and allow a service which has been developed to some degree to disappear notwithstanding my interest and that of many of my friends as well as, perhaps, Deputy Cunningham's.  Certain of Deputy Cunningham's colleagues in Donegal County Council expressed the opinion that they were standing by with a certain amount of excitement, watching the development of this small airport.</P>
    <P>I visited the airstrip and saw how the people there went about their business.  While people travelling were prepared to accept the primitive conditions at the beginning, they were satisfied that, as time went on, this defect would be overcome.  This has been done and without any contribution from the Government of the Republic.  Now, if this air service is to go because of the inactivity of our Minister for Transport and Power, it is only reasonable that I, and any other Member of this House representing people who find this a disadvantage, should make an appeal to the Minister, and indeed, dictate to the Minister, that his duty to this House as Minister for Transport and Power is to help to provide a service, as in this particular case, to serve people whom he as a Member of the Government represents.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to co-operate with the Northern authority <Col N="589" /> and if he is prepared to say: &ldquo;I have no responsibility,&rdquo; as he often does in reply to many questions addressed to him which are more his concern than Emerald Airways, I want to know what his alternative is and the people of Donegal want to know.  If the Minister is not going to provide, or co-operate in the provision, of this service from Eglinton to Glasgow, then is he prepared to come out on his own and develop an airstrip in County Donegal? If he does not think it is feasible to have an airstrip in Donegal, is he prepared to ask the Burns and Laird Line to provide a boat service?  Is he prepared to ask the B &amp; I to put on a service from Moville to Glasgow or from Buncrana or Rathmullen, to service migrants and emigrants, who, of necessity, must go to the industries in the south of Scotland to earn a living.</P>
    <P>This is an issue of major importance in County Donegal, not alone to the migrants and emigrants but to the tourist industry as well.  I am sure Deputy Cunningham will agree with me that one of the main causes of the fall in tourists to Donegal in the last tourist season was the withdrawal of the Glasgow boats.  I have heard it said in the seaside resorts in County Donegal: &ldquo;You do not hear the Glasgow slang any more.&rdquo;  At one time when one walked down the streets of Moville or, say, Buncrana, one would think one was in the suburbs of Glasgow city.  That was not noticeable in the last tourist season.  All businesses have expressed their concern about the urgency and seriousness of the situation and something will have to be done to provide a service to bring back what we call the Glasgow and Paisley fairs.  The Minister has done sweet Fanny Adams about providing a service for, first, those people who, of necessity, must travel on these routes, and, secondly, for the tourist industry for which he is responsible through Board Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell wants to say a few words so I should just like to recap. Before I was born, I am told by an age group a generation older than I, I am sure, that people could travel much faster and with much more comfort to the city of Dublin by rail service <Col N="590" /> than they can on the service we have today.  When they wished to go abroad, they could use a sea service from Lough Foyle to connect with a ship to America.  They could use a boat service to Glasgow and Liverpool and Derry, which they have not now. The only link they have with the outside world, unless they go to the expense of travelling to Belfast or Dublin Airport, is the link which was developed by an outside authority at this small landing strip at Eglinton.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister plays a prominent part, that will now go by the board.  I hope my appeal to the Minister will not be without results.  I ask him, first, to contact with the minimum delay his opposite number in Belfast with a view to co-operating in the restoration of this service.  I can assure the Minister that any assistance I can give towards having the service restored will be given with a heart and a half.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make two practical suggestions to the Minister.  A survey is being carried out of the possibility of having a proper ferry service from Eglinton to Belfast. This survey is being carried out jointly by Donegal County Council, Tyrone County Council and the City of Derry. All three bodies have made contributions towards it.  Donegal County Council have put up £500.  It is the responsibility of this committee to have the report of the survey brought forward as soon as possible I would suggest to the Minister that when the result of this is known, and I think we can impress the urgency of the matter on those concerned in view of the closing down of this experimental service which operated for the past 12 months or so and which, I think, closed down because it was not a financially successful proposition for a private company <Col N="591" />&mdash;these things generally are not&mdash;some assistance should be given by his Department towards any service which is feasible.</P>
      <P>On the other point of transport to Donegal, I would suggest that efforts should be made to revive, at least, the tourist trade on the Glasgow-Derry boat service which was abandoned last year.  There is a financial problem here.  If we must have a boat service to Derry which would benefit our county in certain ways, and in our development plan it is recommended that Derry be used to the utmost as a port of export from Donegal, then I think the Minister's Department should come in and help towards the establishment of any future boat service to the county.  These are the only two suggestions I wish to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Deputy is being unusually polite in the House I shall resume.  We have been anxious about the closing of the Derry-Glasgow service.  Bord Fáilte have been in touch with and are to meet the company concerned in December to see whether this service can be resumed.  I cannot, I will not, offer subsidies to every kind of transport service throughout the country.  We never could afford it.  We must face up to the realities of the changing pattern of transport and must realise that, when a service closes down, it is because other forms of transport have become more practical. Bord Fáilte have given subventions to help to get services going for short periods, to encourage a new type of service in the hope that it will be economic.  I dare say Bord Fáilte would be prepared to give assistance to any new Donegal service likely to pay its way in the future.</P>
      <P>I have made efforts also to see whether any service could be provided to Enniskillen airport.  There were proposals for limited services but it did not pay.  There was a plan to have a regular airline use the airport near Enniskillen but it was found it would not have paid.  As the Deputy may know, airline traffic has to be guaranteed. I am hoping the survey will prove it will pay to establish an airport but not within a close distance of Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been examples elsewhere of this situation.  Take the Dublin to Liverpool air service.  It barely pays Aer Lingus in terms of overheads.  One <Col N="594" /> must take into account that the shorter the distance, the less profits the service will make because of the overheads and the landing costs at either end in return for a comparatively small fare. The main thing I wish to emphasise is that this survey is in operation. Bord Fáilte will be seeing the Burns and Laird Company in December.  I cannot hold out any great hopes but I should like to refer again to the many new types of service from Scotland to the North and onwards to Donegal.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons, at least, why these two services have closed down is the fact that traffic by private motor car, even in the case of people with modest incomes, has expanded enormously.</P>
