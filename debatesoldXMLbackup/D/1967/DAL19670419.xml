      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that most co-operative creameries are paying up to 3d per gallon more for skim milk to farmers than are the Dairy Disposal creameries; and what steps he proposes to take to rectify this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement in the first part of the Deputy's question is not correct, according to my information.</P>
      <P>The price which any creamery can afford to pay for skim milk is governed by the outlet which the creamery has for the product.  Some of the larger co-operative creameries which have well-developed diversification activities are able to pay up to about 6d per gallon for skim milk but these creameries are in the minority, and some other co-operative creameries pay no more than 2d per gallon. Many creameries do not, of course, purchase skim milk at all from their suppliers.  The average price paid for skim milk is about 3d per gallon and the Dairy Disposal Company's price is at that level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if the development of the port area is to be confined to the deep-sea end as recommended in the Myles Wright Report on the Dublin region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> The Advisory Regional Plan and Final Report for the Dublin Region submitted by Professor Wright is an outcome of an assessment by the consultant of long-term requirements for land-use and development in the area. Part 1 of the Report has already been published.  Part 2, which describes the information on which the Plan is based and the various studies carried out, will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Apart from the particular planning framework recommended, the Report raises a number of very important and complex issues, including the question of the future size of Dublin and the question of port development, and will have to be considered by the various interests concerned.  I have invited the views of Government Departments, local authorities and other interests on the Report, to facilitate a full assessment of the consultant's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the Report is an advisory one and that there is no commitment to it at this stage.  It was commissioned as part of a programme of regional planning studies covering the entire country, which is not yet completed.  One of the purposes of this programme is to help in the identification of regional centres of economic and social growth outside the existing main centres in order to counter the excessive draw of Dublin and to bring about a more even distribution of population and employment. It is in this broad context that the question of the probable and desirable size of Dublin 20 years hence has to be considered.</P>
    <P>It is premature, therefore, to think at this stage in terms of a decision on the Dublin report.</P>
    <P>Immediate planning provision for development in the Dublin Region is a matter for the local planning authorities concerned.  All planning authorities are at present actively engaged on the preparation of their statutory development plans under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Pending further consideration of regional objectives it is envisaged that the main emphasis in these first plans <Col N="1901" /> will be on provision for the accommodation of development in the years immediately ahead.</P>

      <P>While these Reports are under consideration, would the Minister <i>ad interim</i> remove the provision in his regulations which exempts demolitions from the control of the planning authorities, because if he does not, the likelihood is that a great deal of demolitions will be done which in the light of the over-all plans should not be undertaken?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

I understand further that the report included a statement of an understanding with traders in the areas as to the basis on which compensation would be assessed by reference to market value, and that the scheme is in line, in general terms, with the advisory scheme prepared by the corporation's urban renewal consultant for a more extensive area.</P>
      <P>The fixing of development objectives for areas within their jurisdiction is a matter for the corporation as the planning authority and is not subject to approval by, or consultation with, my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I said, the Report included a statement of an understanding with traders in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>This is a very serious matter.  The Moore Street traders are a tourist attraction and an asset to the city.  It would be regrettable if any of our cross-Channel planners were not aware that their interests have to be looked after too. Any continental city is proud of its street traders, and so should Dublin in the case of the Moore Street traders.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of Defence Forces Regulations awards of the medal can be made by the Minister for Defence only on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  The case referred to by the Deputy was examined by the Board. The Board did not, however, recomment the award of a Medal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces Regulations are abided by in this matter.  The four members of the Military Board had themselves served in senior appointments in the Congo and they had a good broad knowledge of the circumstances obtaining there.  It is not necessary that a man should be on active service in the Congo to get one of these medals.  It may be awarded in recognition of individual or associated acts of bravery, courage, leadership, resource or devotion to duty arising out of or associated with service in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>While it is true that leadership may be displayed in a noncombatant fashion, is it not somewhat remarkable that many tributes were paid to the participants in the particular ambush in which this person lost his life?  Does it not seem strange that at least two medals were awarded, that I know of, where neither of the persons was engaged in any particular form of combat, while, on the other hand, this person lost his life?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that there is no necessity to engage in combat to merit the award of the medal.  All the applications were very fully investigated by this Board.  I do not think the Deputy would make the case that I myself should intervene in the award of a medal in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is strange that the particular appointees can in fact award a medal to those who appoint them.  Should the matter not be further investigated to see that the type of advisory body set up is such as will warrant confidence in the recommendations made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making the case that that is why a medal should be awarded.  I understand that the Deputy is saying that this man served in the Congo and was killed there and that, by virtue of that fact, a medal should be awarded posthumously to him.  I am explaining to the Deputy that the four members of the Board served in the Congo themselves <Col N="1910" /> and that that is an indication to me that I should have confidence in them because they know what happened there in a general way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that an Army driver of many years experience has failed his civilian driving test; if he will say what training is given to Army drivers; and if, having regard to the damaging effects which failure in civilian driving tests has on the reemployment of ex-Army drivers, he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <P>The failure of a person to pass a driving test carried out by the Department of Local Government would not come to my Department's attention and I have no information, therefore, about the particular case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>All military drivers undergo a comprehensive driving course after which they are examined by a board of officers of the Supply and Transport Corps.  Personnel who pass the examination are issued with a certificate permitting them to drive military vehicles. The course of instruction and the subsequent examination cover all aspects of driving and the standards of competency, etc., laid down are similar to those required in the case of tests carried out for the issue of driving licences under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and regulations made thereunder.</P>

      <P>In the case in question, an Army driver who had the lives of up to 60 soldiers in his hands every day in this city for many years has failed to pass the driving test conducted by the Department of Local Government.  Would the Minister have <Col N="1911" /> discussions with the Department of Local Government with a view to finding out in what respect they consider that this Army driver failed to qualify and, if necessary, amend the requirements for Army driving so as to ensure that they conform with the requirements of the Department of Local Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the Commissioner of Valuation increased the rateable valuation of many properties in Dublin city this year without having any inspection made of the properties in question; and if this is customary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the valuations of a number of properties in Dublin city were this year increased by the Valuation Office without inspection.</P>
      <P>There is no obligation in law to inspect properties listed for revision of valuation by the local authority, although it is customary for revising valuers to do so in cases where the nature of revision indicated in the listing suggests that a further survey of the property may be required so as to update the information already on record in the Valuation Office from previous surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in reply to a question by the Deputy on 6th April, about valuation increases this year in certain districts of Dublin city, a frequent reason for increases is that houses formerly valued as family dwellings were found to have been subdivided into flats, apartments or bedsittingrooms.  Listings in Dublin city for this reason were much more numerous this year than in previous years.  Where entry into any of the premises listed in this category could not be arranged at a suitable time, it was necessary, by reason of the statutory obligation on the Commissioner to issue the revised valuation lists to the rating authorities for publication on 1st March, each <Col N="1915" /> year, to revise the valuations without internal inspection, and by reference only to information furnished by Dublin Corporation about the manner in which they are occupied.  It is a function of the rating authorities to furnish the Commissioner of Valuation each year with particulars of changes in occupation of rateable properties.</P>
    <P>I may add that any person aggrieved by reason of an increase in valuation has the right of appeal, initially to the Commissioner of Valuation and subsequently, if still dissatisfied, to the Courts, in accordance with the procedures and conditions laid down in the Valuation Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it fair that valuations should be increased without an inspection, particularly where no change has taken place in the user of the premises? Because of the new valuation, innocent people who have not made changes are forced to undergo the worry and expense of a valuation appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  I am asking the Minister about revisions without inspections. I am asking the Minister to consider the position in which increases are made without inspections and where they are not justified which obliges people to suffer the worry and expense of an appeal.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that in future revisions will not be carried out without inspections.  In this year alone there have been several cases where increases have been imposed, even though the people had not converted their premises into flats.</P>

    <P>The pension book was sent to the post office for re-issue to the widow following receipt from the Deputy on 21st February last of information that she had returned home from hospital.

As it thus appeared that the book had been lost in transit, the normal action in such cases was <Col N="1920" /> taken, including stopping payment.

      <P>The cheap fuel scheme for which grants are made by my Department operates each year from November until the following March.  The arrangements which some local authorities make for the delivery of fuel to recipients are not subject to my approval.</P>

Further, there is the question of the fuel not being delivered in a container. Is the Minister aware that when the fuel is delivered to an old person's single room, it is dumped on the floor and the old person must store it?

      <P>In the city of Dublin, it is the practice, and I have had many cases of this kind, that the turf is delivered bang in the middle of the floor and the old age pensioners themselves must store it away.  Surely it would be possible to get some uniformity into the manner of delivery in the different local authority areas.  It is a very small thing but it is the difference between bureaucracy with a heart and bureaucracy acting in a stupid fashion.</P>

      <P>There is no sequestration or direct accretion to the Exchequer by reason of increased social benefits in the United Kingdom. Where, however, a person is applying for a non-contributory pension, which as the Deputy is aware is based on need, all income in cash, with certain exclusions specified by law, is taken into account as means.  British pensions are not excluded.  The position has been so since responsibility for payment of old age pensions was taken over by the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These facts are well known and have been explained a number of times.  As the Deputy has asked me to make a statement, may I say that I make no apology for having concluded a deal with the British Government which not only secured the handsome additional sum of £800,000 a year from the British Government for Irish pensioners but enabled us, without additional <Col N="1925" /> charge on the Irish taxpayer, to provide a further £200,000 for social welfare.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state for each of the years 1960 to 1967 inclusive (a) the wholesale prices per unit of fertilisers manufactured in this country, including superphosphate, nitrogen, potash etc.; (b) the duty or tariffs on imported fertilisers and the prices of these f.o.b. Irish ports; and (c) the increase, if any, in the State subsidy or grant on fertilisers paid to the farming community.</P>

      <P>Information is not readily available regarding the wholesale prices of fertilisers or the prices of imported fertilisers f.o.b. Irish ports.</P>
      <P>I understand that in June, 1961, the subsidy on potash fertilisers was increased from £4 per ton to £5 per ton, and that from 1st November, 1966, the subsidy on phosphatic fertilisers was increased from £5 4s per ton to £5 12s per ton to offset increases in manufacturers' prices.</P>
      <P>As the particulars of the Customs duties on imported fertilisers are in the form of a tabular statement, I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate the statement in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the letter mentioned by the Deputy. Virtually all the medical attention given to the patient concerned was by private practitioners and I would, of course, have no power to inquire into the treatment received by him.  It would appear that for a period the patient also attended outpatient clinics at a county hospital but I have no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there was negligence in the manner of the treatment given to him there.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a complaint made by this man who is making a definite charge against an officer employed by the Department of Health and that the man concerned claims to have evidence to prove that his statements are correct? Under the circumstances would the Minister personally inquire to find out if, in fact, the statements made are true or false?  If they are true the man has been treated scandalously and if they are false he should not be allowed to continue making those allegations.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this man claims to hold certificates to prove that over a period of 12 years he was treated in a scandalous manner by one medical practitioner in particular and a number of others he also consulted?  Since this is such a serious allegation would the Minister not consider that it is a matter which should be investigated?

      <P>Those allegations were made by this man who said that following a car accident he was treated by a doctor who seemed to be more interested in getting a friend of his who was a solicitor to deal with the case rather than having the man attended to.  This man states that after ten years he still had the effect of injuries received in that accident because of the neglect of this doctor.  If this is true, surely the Minister should have this matter investigated and if it is false surely the Department of Health should agree that it is in everybody's interest to have this matter clarified?

Reasonable maintenance of existing dispensary buildings is not, of course, excluded.</P>
      <P>I referred to the specific case of Ardfinnan in replying to the Estimates debates.  Following further discussion with the health authority, I now expect that arrangements will shortly be made to substitute better rented accommodation for the present unsatisfactory dispensary.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that arising from the issue of the White Paper on Health Services, many local authorities, including the authority I represent in this House, abandoned the erection of dispensaries and the renovation of outdated buildings? Would the Minister clear up the confusion that seems to exist in the minds of authority managers, that they have not responsibility for the dispensaries we are talking about until such time as the Minister makes up his mind in regard to the erection of the dispensaries in question?  It has gone on too long and in the meantime the people are suffering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; amendment No. 11 is consequential on amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> Section 2: In subsection (4), lines 32 and 33, &ldquo;or a separate and self-contained flat, being a house or flat&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;the rateable valuation whereof exceeds ten pounds, being a house&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill in this House, I moved an amendment, which was accepted, to transfer from the protection of the Rent Acts to the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Acts any future tenancies of unmarried persons between the ages of 21 and 65. The object of the amendment was to reduce, as far as possible, under-occupation of the present stock of rentcontrolled houses.  Under-occupation is an undesirable feature of rent control, which arises because controlled rents are well below economic levels. Accordingly, controlled tenants will tend to remain on in accommodation which has become far too large for their requirements, because it is more economic to do so.  This is a wasteful use of dwelling space, particularly at the present time when there are large families in urgent need of such accommodation and who can pay the economic rent for it.</P>
    <P>This is the thinking behind the amendment, which was accepted in this House, but it was pointed out in the Seanad that this might lead to some cases of hardship in the case of bachelors or spinsters in self-contained flats or in low valuation houses.  Such dwellings could not be described as under-occupied, as larger houses could be.  It might therefore be preferable to exempt such persons out of this desirable amendment &mdash; having for its purpose the maximum utilisation of what accommodation is available&mdash; who may come into occupation of self-contained flats and houses under a valuation of £10.  I think it is a reasonable exemption and I would recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What puzzles me about this is that I find myself in sympathy with the Minister's references to under-occupation of available accommodation in the circumstances set out by him and with his desire to encourage people who are hanging on to excessive accommodation &mdash; owing to the <Col N="1946" /> artificial rent they are paying &mdash; to move to adequate accommodation of a smaller character, thus making available the large area of accommodation at present reaping artificial rents for two or three families where in fact only one at present exists.  I find it extremely difficult to reconcile that sensible anxiety on the part of the Minister for Justice with the action of his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, who makes a regulation permitting a property speculator from Soho to come in and buy the very kind of premises the Minister for Justice is talking about and knock it down without reference to anybody.  How can you reconcile these two things?</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for Justice might say: &ldquo;Here you have a great big house which could easily be divided into four commodious flats and make room for four families, without upsetting anybody.  Therefore, we want to encourage an elderly person who is living there on a low rent to move to a small bungalow or a small flat, which would be ample for him and where he would be much more comfortable at a reasonable rent.&rdquo;  At the same time as he persuades the occupier of this excessive accommodation to move out, a Soho speculator can move in and instead of dividing it &mdash; as the Minister wishes to see it divided &mdash; into four units of residence for four families, he can knock it down with a steel ball and then go to the planning authority and say: &ldquo;Will you allow me to erect an office building on this site, because if you do not, you can send down the corporation to cut the weeds because there is no house at all there; I have knocked it down&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister, if there is to be any coherent policy amongst the Ministers of the Government regarding the accommodation of the homeless, that he ought to approach his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and say: &ldquo;Look, if I stop this hole in the fence, and if I succeed in getting a number of large houses evacuated, in order to convert them into three or four flats, accommodating three or four families, <Col N="1947" /> will you take the necessary step to prevent them being knocked down?&rdquo; At the moment, they are evacuated because I do not think the House realises &mdash; and I doubt if the Minister realises&mdash;that under the Town Planning Act, we believed, when we were passing it through this House, that demolition of such houses as the Minister speaks of could not be undertaken, except with the approbation of the town planning authority and that, subsequently, acting under his general powers, the Minister proceeded to make very sensible regulations excluding from the town planning authorities trivial matters such as painting the windows or putting a new knocker on the door, things which ought not to take up the time of the planning authority.  But in that regulation, which set out all these minor trivia which he properly excluded by order from the jurisdiction of the planning authority, two words were added&mdash;&ldquo;and demolition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We can see in Dublin all around us fine, solid residential houses that could be sub-divided into commodious flats and which would release housing for the very poor.  What is actually happening is that some fellow who wants to force the planning authority to give him the permission he thinks the planning authority would not give him if the house were standing, buys the house, calls for a fellow with a steel ball, knocks it down, and then goes to the planning authority.  The planning authority then sees the crane arriving and remonstrates with the land speculator and the land speculator says: &ldquo;Go fish; by order, the question of demolition has been removed from your jurisdiction.&rdquo;  He then goes back to the planning authority, when he has knocked down the structure, and says: &ldquo;Now, will you give me permission to erect the kind of structure you indicated to me you would not permit me to erect so long as the house was standing?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister says to me: &ldquo;My colleague, the Minister for Local Government, is going to amend his regulation and restore to the planning <Col N="1948" /> authority its demolition jurisdiction,&rdquo; then I think the Minister is following a logical and reasonable course of conduct, but, as things stand at the moment, it seems to me the two Ministers are vying in opposite directions, with the added evil the Minister for Justice is trying to prevail upon elderly people, our own neighbours, to adopt a reasonable course of action, with the kind of qualifications he is now asking us to accept from the Seanad.  But he is allowing the Minister for Local Government to be frustrated in the realisation of exactly the same end by speculators from abroad who are presenting him with a <i>fait accompli</i> and then saying to him in that situation: &ldquo;Will you now allow us to erect the kind of building which manifestly you would never have allowed us to erect if we had not got in under the demolition clause and cleared the site?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the submission by Deputy Dillon in this regard because it conveys to me a clear indication of the lack of consultation and cohesion within the Government.  Quite obviously there is great need for something positive to be done in regard to this matter.  If this Bill is to bear any fruit, the obvious thing is to ensure we take every conceivable precaution that it be successful.  Whatever we do in connection with this measure, it will be restricted in its operation by reason of the activities of another Minister.  There is no denying the fact that the planning authority did have the desired powers but that subsequently they were nullified by ministerial order.  It is obvious to anybody interested in the wellbeing of this city or any other part of the country that, when we make regulations, we should ensure that they can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the Minister for Justice should have consultations immediately with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that the latter withdraws this particular order.  At present we have many people speculating as to what should or should not be done with this city of Dublin.  One of the most abhorrent things in the city is the situation where you have people acquiring property rights and <Col N="1949" /> indiscriminately smashing down buildings, which in some cases have been proved not to have required smashing down at all.  This is done purposely because these people have something else in mind.  Be they speculators from within or outside the country, they should be conditioned to the wellbeing of the people.  It is not enough for somebody to create a derelict site and say afterwards: &ldquo;What can you do about it now?  In order to ensure it does not remain a derelict site, you will have to give me my way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This highlights the problem.  I would entreat the Minister to have regard to the seriousness of it and arrange to have the situation rectified by ensuring that this ministerial order is withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Not only that, but let us know where we are going.  There is little use introducing legislation today if we are to have it nullified by another Department tomorrow or the next day. That is what I mean by saying that there is an absence of cohesion and consultation.  It is a clear indication of the absence of consultation between one Department and another and between one Minister and another.  In saying that, I am not trying to score off the Minister for Justice.  I welcome his good intentions, but I abhor what is behind the intentions of the Minister for Local Government.  I hope the Minister for Justice will have second thoughts about this matter and will set it right.</P>

      <P>This whole question of redevelopment, particularly as it relates to housing, has been the subject of comment by the Minister for Local Government very recently.  I am aware that the problem referred to by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mullen, particularly as regards speculation in the city of Dublin, has been engaging the attention of the Minister for Local Government.  I am certain that remedial action will follow his investigation of the matter.  However, I will bring what has been said by the Deputies to his notice; but, as I say, I am aware that he is fully alive to the problem already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> As we all know, flaws occur in legislation from time to time and come to light when that legislation is put into operation.  Regulations are evaded.  This can happen under any legislation passed by any House of Parliament. The matters referred to by the Deputies have come to the notice of the Minister and he has referred publicly to this whole question of redevelopment, property speculation and the need for rehousing.  I have every confidence that he will adopt the necessary remedial action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear unreasonably tendentious with the Minister for Justice, but I cannot permit him to say that this is an evil that has arisen as a result of some lacuna in an Act passed by this House. This is not so.  The House provided that demolition was a subject reserved to the planning authority.  But they left the Minister for Local Government a general power to exclude trivia from the general overseeing of the planning authority so as not to make his task impossible.  The order to which I have referred, and to which Deputy Mullen has made reference, is a perfectly sensible order up to the last two words. The order excludes from the planning authority's jurisdiction painting of windows, changing door knockers, repairing gutters&mdash;the ordinary trivia of house mending.  Then there are added at the end two words: &ldquo;and demolition&rdquo;. It is like passing an Act of Parliament here dealing with the treatment of mange in horses and adding &ldquo;and TB and the public health&rdquo;.  Most of us would say it related to the medical aspects of animal life in this country.  It is perfectly manifest that the words &ldquo;and demolition&rdquo; are as far removed from the rest of the topics mentioned in the order as animal diseases would be from human health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am constrained to say &mdash; it is my duty to say &mdash; that I believe the Minister for Local Government who made the order either made it with reckless irresponsibility, or else allowed himself to be influenced in his judgment by vested interests who should never have had access to his ear.  In that I am passing a deliberate public stricture <Col N="1951" /> on the conduct of the Minister's colleague who made this order.  The House ought to face up to this fact. I want to say the order made in the circumstances I now describe and on which I animadvert is at direct variance with the purpose which the Minister for Justice asks us to serve in the amendment he has before us now and which was presented to him by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to hypocritically accept the Minister's explanation.  I do not accept it.  I am undoubtedly animadversive on the point of the Minister for Local Government adding the two words &ldquo;and demolition&rdquo; to a statutory order which, except for these two words, was unobjectionable and was clearly in accordance with the intentions of this House in regard to the general powers conferred on the Minister.  I would say that the words &ldquo;and demolition&rdquo; were never intended by this House and could only have been incorporated in such an order either by reckless carelessness or by allowing the influence of a vested authority to bear upon him in a way that no responsible Minister should have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the expressed intention of the Minister for Justice in connection with this matter, and let us hope that what he intends to do will bear fruit.  It is merely a matter of bringing the other Minister's attention, as the Minister said, to the views expressed in this House.  We must remember, however, that this is not an old-fashioned business.  The order to which Deputy Dillon and I have referred is not old &mdash; it is recent &mdash; and the activities of the speculators are not recent but fairly old by comparison. One can say that the order was made in the full knowledge of the behaviour of the speculators.  That being so, what we have been saying here this afternoon is an expression of the urgency of this whole matter. Maybe it is a case of locking the stable door when the horse is gone, but at least let us do something positive about this matter.  It may be also that the people who are trying to make a <Col N="1952" /> kill have already been satisfied, but it still does not prevent our doing the obvious, that is, removing this horrible restriction which prevents what the Minister for Justice is attempting to do.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a situation where, if necessary, the Minister for Justice will have it out with the Minister for Local Government.  This would be good democratic procedure. If the present situation is allowed to continue, we are merely giving lip service to legislation.  We are creating a contradiction if we pass legislation here and then allow it to be contravened. Certainly the people in the country are sick and tired of the speculators riding roughshod over the people's desires, irrespective of where these speculators come from.  Unfortunately the majority of them are found to come from outside.  The ones we have within the country are afforded a certain amount of protection. We are inclined to regard those who come in as innocents until we find them out, and then it is too late.  I hope that not only will the Minister for Justice bring this important matter to the notice of the Minister for Local Government but will fight tooth and nail with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that the obvious will be brought about.</P>

      <P>There was a question down here yesterday from Deputy O'Leary on this matter.  The Minister for Local Government in reply to him said he was considering an amendment to the Exempted Development Regulations to which the Deputies referred. The amendment would bring the demolition of certain categories of buildings, including dwellings, under control and would deal with the difficulty referred to by the Deputies and particularly the words referred to by Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>It is reasonable enough to regard a landlord owning 100 houses as being in the category of a large landlord in the context in which it was discussed before.  I am not terribly keen on making the change, nevertheless, because at the time it was discussed here in the Dáil, I think the Minister had&mdash;I forget whether he mentioned them in the House&mdash;particular concerns in mind, and we were discussing the amendment on the basis of knowing who the concerns were, knowing the particular type of business they carried on, knowing that they were conscientious and all this kind of thing, and that they had particular difficulties because of the vast amount of property they held.  I do not know what further evidence the Minister has had since to induce him to cut this down by two-thirds, but it would seem to me offhand&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that it would let in some further concerns which no one had in mind at the time.  If it can be shown that they are in the same boat, that they have proper maintenance teams, that they look after their property but do not itemise the work house by house, then a case should be made for it in the same way as it was made for the others.  Possibly that case was made in the Seanad, but it has not been made here.</P>

      <P>One city firm came to my notice since the Dáil amendment was passed.  It was for that reason I reduced the limit to 100 houses.  The three cases already covered were in the city, and one of the three was just over 300, but there was one under three hundred, so I think it is better to keep it that way.  One saving feature is that the provision as to averaging repair costs applies only to expenditure incurred up to 8th June, 1966.  That is an important matter.  As far as the future is concerned, these people now know that they must keep their accounts itemised and, if they do not do so, they will be in jeopardy whenever we have another Rent Bill. But before 1966 these companies were not on notice that they should itemise such accounts and it would be unreasonable to deny them the increase merely because of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be right in that, but I am not altogether happy about it.  I am referring now to amendment No. 9.  The position under section 11, as it is stood, was a considerable improvement on the law up to now because we were providing in section 11 that there would be implied covenants with regard to repairs on the part of the landlord and the covenants were &ldquo;to keep in repair the structure&rdquo;, etc. and the only exclusion from these covenants was where the tenant had &ldquo;covenants in writing to carry out any or all of the repairs&rdquo;.  In that event, the implied covenants being imported into the arrangements between the landlord and tenant obviously went by the board.  We are being asked now to get away from the very clear wording of the section which required the tenant to covenant in writing to do the repairs before the implied covenants of the landlord would go and, instead of the section reading &ldquo;Where the tenant has covenanted in writing to carry out any or all of the repairs&rdquo; the Minister suggests we should put in &ldquo;Where there is a covenant under which the tenant is obliged&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At first glance that may seem to amount to the same thing, but I do not think it does because we are now going to get into the area in which you have the possibility of implied covenants by the tenant as well as clearly implied covenants which are being imported by statute into the responsibility of the landlord.  As the section stood, it seemed to me to remove doubt.  The position was quite clear; the landlord had to do the repairs unless the tenant covenanted in writing to do them.  By getting away from that wording we are, I think, now entering into an area of doubt and legal argument may exist as to whether or not the tenant was obliged under some other implied covenants, under possibly a verbal agreement, to do the repairs.  As the section was worded, there was no doubt; it had to be a covenant and it had to be in writing. Why are we getting away from that unless we want to diminish the strength of the requirement?  I am not at all keen on this.  There may be a good answer to it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I was not strictly fair to the House in saying this was largely a drafting amendment. There is a little more to it.  It can be argued &mdash; representations were made to me to this effect &mdash; that the reference to the tenant in the section as it stood might not be adequate to cover the predecessor in title where he may have covenanted in writing to do particular repairs.  It is arguable as the section stands that it does not apply to a subsequent tenant.</P>

      <P>Not alone that, but the Minister will appreciate that the position is that the notice must expire on a gale day and that may be to the benefit of the person on whom the notice is being served because if the particular gale day has passed and it is a three-months notice, that may in fact convert it into five months notice because it must go on to the next gale day, so that it is of importance in that sense.  By providing that a notice may expire on any day specified in the notice while you are ensuring that you get the particular notice given, you my very well be cutting down on the original provision.  I am not arguing that it might not be better to be definite and if you have a three months notice, everyone should know that that is three months from the day the notice is served.  Possibly it is better to be definite about it but I think we should recognise that in some cases we may be diminishing the period by departing from the gale day requirements.</P>

      <P>As the Bill stands, it was pointed out to me in the Seanad that the right to a new tenancy being given to decontrolled tenants was not limited to those tenants but could be availed of in the future by any tenant taking out a fresh tenancy of the premises, irrespective of the length of time he would be in occupation.  For example it might happen that a decontrolled tenant would avail himself of the right given by this section to obtain a new tenancy under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and then surrender the tenancy.  Some years afterwards the <Col N="1962" /> landlord might make a fresh letting and it could be said that the new tenant would automatically receive the right to renewal immediately the new tenancy was created.  This would be an undesirable anomaly because, as the law stands, other tenants have to have certain prescribed periods of occupation or of carrying on business before they can qualify for renewal of their leases.</P>

      <P>In page 2, after line 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; 'client' includes (unless the context otherwise requires) a person to whom a refund of a deposit is due;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Its object is to transfer to the definition <Col N="1963" /> section the references to the meaning of &ldquo;client&rdquo; that are now to be found in the body of the Bill.  I think that the other consequential deletions which follow from this throughout the Bill are obvious enough to the House.  I think it will make it easier to understand the Bill if you have these provisions set out in the definition section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading, I made the point that there did not seem to be any definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo; in the Bill.  I still think that this is so.  In the explanatory memoranda issued in connection with the amendment, there is a reference to transferring to the definition section references to the meaning of &ldquo;client&rdquo; that are to be found in the body of the Bill.  That is right.  There are references in the body of the Bill, but, to my mind, none of the references is such as to constitute a definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  We are told in different places throughout the Bill that such and such a person shall be deemed to be a &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  One could go on endlessly, deeming this, that and the other to be clients, if one does not put down a definition of client in the Bill.  The Minister proposes to remedy that by including in the definition the words &ldquo;client includes, unless where the context otherwise requires, a person to whom a refund of the deposit is due&rdquo;. With respect, I do not think that is sufficient if it is to be taken as a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit there should be a definition in the Bill of what we mean by &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  I want to put this point of view to the Minister. As a result of the amendment, and indeed in the Bill as it stood, there were different types of cases where the person was to be deemed to be a client of the auctioneer, a person to whom refund of a deposit is due.  Largely, it is true to say that the meaning of the word &ldquo;client&rdquo; is associated with the holding by the auctioneer of a deposit. <Col N="1964" /> My colleague, Deputy Flanagan, will correct me if I am wrong in this.  I think an auctioneer is entitled, and I should be greatly surprised if he were not, from time to time to do work on a commission basis which might not be associated directly with the purchase or sale of property.</P>
      <P>For example, auctioneers may be approached for the purpose of finding a person who is prepared to invest money in a venture.  An auctioneer may be commissioned by a person who would be a client to expend money for that person in a particular way.  All these cases should be covered by the definition of client in the Bill.  If there is an obligation being imposed by the Bill on an auctioneer to pay deposits paid to him into a bank account which has to be designated as a client bank account, moneys sometimes may be paid to an auctioneer which are not intended in discharge of fees or commission or expenses but which are paid by a person on account of some particular transaction either for the person himself or someone else &mdash; I take it this would be the desire of the Auctioneers' Association&mdash;and they should be covered by the provisions of this Bill and paid into the client account.</P>
      <P>On Second Reading, I made clear my attitude, saving that I regard this measure by and large as the measure of the Auctioneers' Association, the measure which they want, and I do not regard it in any way as being controversial.  However, I think we should look at it carefully to make sure we shall not run into snags.  One of the snags I foresee is the absence of a comprehensive definition of client.  As I pointed out on Second Reading, in the Solicitors' Accounts Regulations, from which a large part of the inspiration for this Bill seems to have been drawn, one of the first things done is to define who is a client.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to what Deputy O'Higgins has stated.  Perhaps the Minister will avail of this opportunity to make this very clear.  If a client is a person to whom a deposit is to be <Col N="1965" /> refunded or made payable, the Minister must bear in mind that auctioneers handle numerous sums of money other than deposits.  We want to make sure that the Bill covers not alone deposits on sales of land or house property or whatever the auctioneer may be handling. An auctioneer also handles substantial amounts of money in respect of farm clearance sales, furniture auctions, meadow sales, meadow lettings, conacre lettings and grazing lettings.  If the auctioneer is to account for his clients' money in reference to deposits which he holds, surely it is the intention of the Minister and of the Bill &mdash; I can assure the Minister it is the intention of the Auctioneers' Association&mdash;that all moneys handled by the auctioneer in discharge of his duties as auctioneer must be covered by the Bill because the intention behind the Auctioneers' Association in asking for this measure was primarily to protect and safeguard the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the auctioneer is to account for the deposits which he holds on behalf of his clients surely the Bill should also cover all moneys, for whatever purpose they are received, because if the auctioneer is to keep proper records he must include the proceeds of clearance sales, furniture sales, meadow, grazing and conacre lettings. Auctioneers have separate registers which contain all the transactions in relation to meadow sales and lettings, conacre lettings, furniture sales and so forth.  He has one register for each type of business.  On inspection, I presume the auditor will wish to inspect these separate registers.  In such an inspection it will become evident that not only has the auctioneer substantial sums which he holds in trust for his clients but in addition he will have in his client bank account various sums in connection with clearance sales, furniture sales, meadow sales and lettings, conacre and grazing lettings. On occasions he may also have a record of the work he has performed as a valuer.  That work will naturally involve only the auctioneer's own money because in his capacity as a valuer he renders services for which he is paid and once he has rendered the service he is entitled to payment. <Col N="1966" /> The amount he receives as a valuer will be his own money and will be lodged in his own personal account.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I trust the Minister will make it clear in relation to the moneys which are with the auctioneer in safe keeping, in trust for his client, that they are covered by this measure &mdash; that the funds he holds in this way will be covered and described in the Bill as clients' moneys.  They are not the auctioneer's moneys.  They are moneys which he has for the time being on behalf of the person to whom he is rendering a service, and such a person is described in this Bill as a client. Therefore, apart from the deposit, he has these other miscellaneous sums of money which I presume are also covered in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan's presumption is correct.  This whole matter could possibly be dealt with by referring to amendment No. 3, although we are not considering it now.  We will be considering it in greater detail later on.  Amendment No. 3 deals with section 5 (10) (b) which reads:</P>
      <P>(b) references to a deposit paid to an auctioneer or house agent as a stakeholder or otherwise paid to him in connection with the purchase or renting of property where a right to money has not passed to a client.</P>
      <P>We are transferring that by amendment No. 3 which is not properly before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to consider it in relation to what Deputy Flanagan has been talking about.  I do not think it goes far enough.  In the case Deputy Flanagan spoke about of an auctioneer who is conducting a furniture sale, he might get a deposit when it is knocked down.  The purchaser the following day or that evening will certainly pay the auctioneer the total.  There is no question of a deposit having been paid by the auctioneer's client.  The client is the person for whom he is selling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House would look at amendment No. 3 they will see that it is fairly global.  In effect it will delete the matter referred to in <Col N="1967" /> section 5 (10) (b) and substitute a new subsection which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) References in this Act to money for a client include (unless the context otherwise requires) references to a deposit paid to an auctioneer or house agent as a stakeholder or otherwise paid to him in connection with the purchase or renting of property where a right to the money has not passed to a client.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we are including lettings.  Lettings of land and meadowings form a very important part of an auctioneer's business.  Surely the Minister knows that in the case of a grazing letting, once the client has signed the agreement for the grazing letting half of the money is paid down, and on whatever date is specified in the conditions of sale &mdash; be it 1st October of the following year or 1st November of the following year &mdash; the remaining half is paid.  Half of the agreed sum is deposited with the auctioneer on behalf of the vendor.  The vendor is the person who sets the grazing.  I presume that even though it is not covered in this amendment we may take it that moneys which are in the hands of the auctioneer for lettings of conacre and grazing will also be included here.</P>

      <P>It does not cover the case where the purchaser pays the entire amount to the auctioneer on buying furniture at a furniture auction.  There is no question of a deposit there.  Amendment No. 1 also refers to a deposit.  This is more restrictive because it refers only to the refunding of a deposit where a deposit is paid back to the person who made it.  It does not seem to refer to a case where a deposit is released and paid ultimately to the vendor.</P>

      <P>I should prefer to leave it open.  We know who the auctioneer is.  He is the person who takes commissions from a client, and a client is a person on whose behalf he takes commissions and executes them.  For the purposes of the Act we set out specifically the duties he has in regard to moneys he holds on behalf of a client.  I would suggest that between amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 3 we meet the specific point made by Deputy Flanagan in that we define in amendment No. 1 that &ldquo; `client' includes (unless the context otherwise requires) a person to whom a refund of a deposit is due&rdquo;.  In amendment No. 3 by using the words <Col N="1969" />&ldquo;purchase or renting of property&rdquo; we cover the other type of case, including both sale and letting, with which Deputy Flanagan is concerned.  Perhaps I could look into the matter between now and Report Stage with a view to having a more positive definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be obstructive in any way but it seems to me that in many ways this is the kernel of the Bill, because all the arrangements envisaged in the Bill relate to the regulation of the auctioneer's affairs in relation to clients' money.  The requirements regarding the keeping of accounts and the lodging of clients' money in a clients' account in the bank, depend on who is the client. The Minister refers to amendments Nos. 1 and 3.  I take it we can discuss them together.  That seems to be the sensible thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1, as I pointed out &mdash;I doubt if it is intentional, I think it possibly was not intended at all&mdash;on any strict interpretation can be taken only as referring to money which is going to be refunded to the person who paid it.  Normally speaking, that is not the way that business will be done. Let us take an example in relation to a deposit lodged with an auctioneer. I am buying a house for which Deputy Flanagan has the sale as the auctioneer. For the purposes of the example the Minister is the vendor.  I pay a deposit to the auctioneer and ultimately when the deal is closed that deposit will not be refunded to me by Deputy Flanagan.  It will be released to the Minister who is the vendor.  A question of a refund does not come in.  There is no refund for me.  It is never intended that there should be a refund to me except in a case where for some reason the deal falls through.  I am entitled to get my deposit back.  In fact, strictly speaking amendment No. 1 would cover only cases where the deal falls through and the deposit has to be refunded.  Then you go to amendment No. 3.  As the Minister said, amendment No. 3 is not exclusive.  It sets out to include specific cases in the definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  It says that references in this Act to money for a client include <Col N="1970" /> ... unless where the context otherwise requires references to a deposit.  It is quite clear, when we get to that stage, that this refers to money which is paid by means of a deposit only and not to any other money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;... or otherwise paid to him in connection with the purchase or renting of property....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is qualified by &ldquo;stakeholder or otherwise....&rdquo; It is all governed by &ldquo;deposit&rdquo;, both in amendment No. 1 and in amendment No. 3.  The money referred to is the deposit, not other money.  Amendment No. 3 reads:</P>
      <P>References in this Act to money for a client include (unless the context otherwise requires) references to a deposit paid to an auctioneer or house agent as a stakeholder or otherwise....</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; there means otherwise than as a stakeholder.  It does not mean money, other than a deposit, paid to him.  Under amendment No. 3, it must be paid to him &ldquo;in connection with the purchase or renting of property where a right to the money has not passed to a client&rdquo;.  It is further limited to cases where &ldquo;a right to the money has not passed to a client&rdquo;.  Again, as I say, with a deposit you are dealing with a deposit which is paid to the auctioneer in connection with the purchase or renting of property. You are not dealing with a case where no deposit is paid but where the entire is paid.  You are not dealing with a case where, for example, (1) the deposit has been paid and (2) the balance of the purchase money has been paid to the auctioneer.  In that case, under these two amendments, the auctioneer is required, under the definitions here &mdash; under this Act, anyhow &mdash; to deal only with the deposit.  As regards the balance of the purchase money, he is not obliged to lodge it in a client account in the bank, and so on.  The Minister should have a closer look at it.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Minister should take the two together but amendment No. 1 sets out &mdash; putting it broadly &mdash; to define &ldquo;client&rdquo; and amendment No. 3 sets out &mdash; again putting it broadly &mdash; to define a client's money.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1972" />&ldquo;Client&rdquo; means any person on whose account a solicitor holds or receives client's money;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Client's money&rdquo; means money which a solicitor receives as a solicitor or agent or in connection with his practice as a solicitor on account of some other persons, but does not include, (a) money to which he is, or in the case of a firm, one or more of the partners are, alone entitled; or (b) money held or received on account of a trust of which the solicitor is a solicitor-trustee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 30 and 31, to delete &ldquo;section 15 of the Principal Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 11 (3) (b)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The substantive amendment here is No. 18.  The others, 9, 10 and 15, are really incidental to that end and therefore I would direct the attention of the House to amendment No. 18 which is really the nub of the issue.  This amendment proposes to replace subsections (1) and (2) of section 15 of the 1947 Act governing the payment of claims out of the deposit, and also section 11 of the Bill, governing the freezing of bank accounts.  This is what Deputy O'Higgins was thinking about a few minutes ago.  It is not just a straightforward replacement because it also proposes another addition in order to provide a more equitable distribution of the available assets if an auctioneer gets into difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As matters are at present, if word <Col N="1977" /> gets out that an auctioneer is in such a position, those who are well advised can rush in with their application to the court as soon as possible and it is roughly a case of first come first served.  The person who is in first in the High Court can get the whole deposit even though another person may apply a few minutes later and this second person would be left with nothing.  This has resulted in inequities in the past and it is a situation I should like to remedy in this Bill.  The amendment is designed to put an end to this type of scramble and it means that when a claim is made the judge will inquire whether it is likely that there will be another claim.  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; he will not allow any claim until the situation has been clarified.</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides that a judge may, at his discretion, proceed to adjudicate the auctioneer bankrupt. The deposit, of course, is with the High Court so that the High Court judge has jurisdiction in this aspect. It is fair to leave this discretion to him. It may appear wide but it is fair to leave it to the judge before whom the application is made.  By giving him this discretion we get rid of the situation which we had heretofore where, as I said, a client could collar all of the available deposit.  It is far more important that the High Court judge should freeze any dealings which would be affected and ensure that there will be fair and equitable distribution of the deposit among all creditors who properly make a claim before the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an improvement of the present position as the Minister has pointed out.  The position obtaining now is that it is very much a case of first come first served but not only have you to keep in front throughout the race but get to the winning post first.  It puts the solicitors in a particularly difficult position if any of these cases arise in that they have to be very careful that they do not lose a day at any of the jumps, whether it be Beechers or any <Col N="1978" /> of the others, and they have to go right up to the finish to get there first. The only thing I would query &mdash; and I do not know whether this can be overcome and at the same time try to mete out equal treatment to all creditors &mdash; is the possibility of unnecessary delay, that is delay which subsequently proves to be unnecessary, occurring in relation to the claim of an applicant. I have in mind a case where it transpires that no other claims are advanced but where the position might have been uncertain when the initial application is made to the court and the court decides that what it will do is freeze the auctioneer's bond or deposit. Then the person who has brought the application has to wait until it has been ascertained whether or not other claims are going to come in.  Ultimately it may be found there are no other claims and he is going to get his money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what delay is likely to ensue between his application and payment being made to him in that kind of case but in some cases this question of delay can be of considerable importance to the person waiting for his money.  I do not know how the Minister could effectively deal with this kind of case and at the same time ensure the type of equal treatment which he desires for all applicants.  In regard to the discretion of the court to adjudicate the auctioneer bankrupt, I can see, for the reasons mentioned by the Minister and those set out in the explanatory memorandum, it is desirable to have that discretion vested in the court.  I am not entirely clear &mdash; perhaps the Minister would fill in the picture for me &mdash; whether under the amendment the court requires to have the same type of evidence to support the adjudication of the auctioneer as being bankrupt as he would if a petition for bankruptcy were filed by a creditor.  In other words, will the court require proof of commission of an act of bankruptcy or can the position obtain under this amendment, if it becomes law, that the court can adjudicate the auctioneer bankrupt when, in fact, no insolvency existed and when the position would be that when under the existing law there were <Col N="1979" /> no circumstances in which the auctioneer could have been declared bankrupt in the event of someone initiating bankruptcy proceedings?</P>
    <P>I can see the necessity for protecting the estate for the benefit of creditors but it would not seem to be desirable under any circumstances that we should carry into our legislation authority for any court to declare a person bankrupt when the person is not, in fact, bankrupt.  If that position were likely to come about under the amendment, I think it would be preferable to veer off that track slightly and while giving the court power to freeze the bond or the deposit, also give the court authority to appoint a creditors committee or a liquidator without taking the formal step of declaring the auctioneer bankrupt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Deputy is concerned about is contained in an amendment of section 11 (6) (a):</P>
      <P>In addition to or in lieu of an order under subsection (4) the Court, notwithstanding anything contained in the law of bankruptcy or the law relating to companies, may, of its own motion and after giving to the defendant, and to any person to whom it considers it reasonable to give notice, such notice as it considers reasonable, by order adjudicate him bankrupt or, if the defendant is a company, make an order for its winding up and for the appointment of the Official Assignee as liquidator.</P>
      <P>It will be for the court then to assess the position and notify the auctioneer. If the auctioneer wants to go through the whole bankruptcy procedure otherwise that is a matter for himself but he will have full notice of what the court proposes to do before the court can make the order envisaged by the section.  To that extent he will not be prejudiced.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(iii)  that, in relation to the business of auctioneer or the business of house agent (as the case may be) and any other business in which he may be engaged, he is solvent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is one of a group of clarifying amendments that have been suggested by the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with an auctioneer who has fallen down in the matter of keeping proper records, as required by the Bill.  He has to satisfy the court that, although he has failed in some respect to observe the statutory requirements relating to the keeping of records and of separate accounts, he has now mended his ways and that nobody has suffered loss.  He is also required to satisfy the court that he is solvent and the amendment makes it clear that solvency in this context covers all his business affairs and not <Col N="1986" /> just that his client accounts are now in order.  This deals with the auctioneer who is going back to the court to renew his licence and the requirements we are now placing on him in respect of which he must satisfy the court before having his licence renewed.</P>

      <P>How often can this happen?  Suppose we have an auctioneer who slips up occasionally. Will the court tolerate frequent failure to keep records or proper accounts? Will the court take the auditors' certificate into consideration in granting a licence on all occasions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not too happy about this when I first read it because I thought it could be a means of driving a coach and four through the whole Bill, that a way out was being given for the person who might otherwise not fully comply with the provisions of the Bill and that this might enable him to get a certificate from the auditor which he might not fully deserve.  I do not suggest that the auditors will give a certificate unless they are fully and completely satisfied that separate accounts are kept and that the accounts are accurate but the Minister said that this amendment is being put in at the request of the accountants' association &mdash; is that not right?</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say for what purpose did the accountants' association recommend these amendments to him?  Can he give us an outline of where they were necessary?  I thought the Bill was much stronger and more favourable to the auctioneers without this amendment. Does the Minister say that this amendment is really necessary?  Is he quite satisfied that it is necessary?  I feel it is inclined to take the sting out of the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was going to say in another way what Deputy Flanagan has said.  I think it is generally recognised that if you make a simple statement, such as that in the Bill at the moment, that the court has to be satisfied that the auctioneer is solvent, that is sufficient.  You then go modifying that by saying he has to be solvent in relation to a, b and c.  It is implied, therefore, that there may be some things in respect of which he is not required to be solvent.  If you leave it as it is, that he is required to be solvent, that covers everything.  It is now being suggested that he should satisfy the court that he is solvent in relation to the business of auctioneering, that he is solvent in relation to the business of house agent or in relation to any other business which he carries on.  The amendment either means something in addition to what is in the Bill already or else it does not mean anything in addition to what is in the Bill already.  The Minister should tell us if it means something in addition to what is there already or if it does not. If it does, why put this in?  It will be taken as condoning their entitlement not to have to do what is already there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Higgins reads the amendment in the context of section 12, he will see that, if it makes any change, it widens the obligation which was placed on the auctioneer and in fact strengthens the Bill.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants made representations to me asking whether, as the section stood, it only obliged them to inquire into the person's solvency in relation to the clients' accounts.  In the amendment we are making it quite clear that the solvency we are speaking of applies in relation to the business of auctioneering, house agent or any other business in which the person may be engaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister did not accept that argument from the accountants' association. Unless I am looking at the Bill entirely wrongly that is what is there already. It does not say solvency in relation to the keeping of accounts.  It is a blunt, simple, all-embracing statement that <Col N="1988" /> the person must show he is solvent. You are either solvent or you are insolvent. You cannot be partly solvent or partly insolvent.  If you start by saying he has to be solvent in relation to his business as auctioneer, that he has to be solvent in relation to his business as house agent, then it appears that you are trying to cut it down.  I know that is not what is intended.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister realises that a person cannot be solvent and insolvent at the one time.  I think the Bill as we had it originally was much stronger and much better than it is with the amendment.  I feel very strongly about this amendment. Unless the Minister has a very special reason for those amendments and in order to have general approval and general agreement, I would ask the Minister very seriously not to press them.  As a member of the council of the Irish Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Association, I would ask the Minister not to press this amendment. As a matter of fact, I was in touch with the Minister yesterday regarding this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Unless the Minister has some grave reason for doing so I would ask him not to press the amendment. There is no harm in discussing it but I feel we in the Auctioneers' Association were far happier with the Bill as it originally was than when we saw the amendments when they were circulated yesterday.</P>

      <P>It is precisely on this that the accountants' association were not satisfied.  After all, they are the people on whom we will be dependent.  We will want to have properly furnished certificates before the court on which the court can make a decision whether or not the auctioneer should have his licence renewed.  When the accountants' association mentioned this matter to me it placed an onus on me to ensure that the Institute of Chartered Accountants was fully <i>au fait</i> with its responsibilities and the responsibilities of its members in this regard.  In this bald statement &ldquo;that he is solvent&rdquo; in section 12, subsection (4) (a) (iii) you are only told you must satisfy the district justice that the auctioneer is solvent when he makes application to have his licence renewed.  That is all this bald statement says.  The accountants' certificate has to refer to that bald issue.  When the accountants' association came to me they said: &ldquo;We do not know how to furnish a valid certificate giving full information on that until we are enabled to know to that the solvency is directed.&rdquo;  The particular accountant must be enabled to know into what solvency he is investigating and give a certificate.  We heard their representations in this respect and decided to draft amendment No. 19 which pins down the requirements. This is in line with what we are seeking to do in this Bill.  Amendment No. 19 clarifies the position for the accountant when drawing up this certificate.  We substitute for the bald statement &ldquo;That he is solvent&rdquo;, which is there at the moment, the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>that in relation to the business of auctioneer or the business of house <Col N="1990" /> agent (as the case may be) and any other business in which he may be engaged, he is solvent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, I can see a case for this point of view but I still think that a greater duty was imposed on the accountants as the Bill stands at the moment in that they have to inquire <i>simpliciter</i> whether the person is solvent or insolvent. I think if under those circumstances they were able to give a certificate to the court, then the court would have no doubt that in all respects the applicant was solvent.  I think I am right in saying that in the Minister's amendment that requirement is being modified, is being toned down. I have said all that before and I think I am right.  On reflecting on the position, I think it is probably right that it should be toned down, for the reason that you may have, say, a young auctioneer who has obtained a large mortgage on his house but it is purely a personal thing, having no relation to his position as auctioneer, or house agent or any other business in which he is engaged.</P>
      <P>If for any reason the value of the premises were to diminish, the fact that there is a mortgage on the house would mean that he might find himself in the unfortunate position where the outstanding amount of his mortgage is possibly even greater than the value of his premises.  While he is protected in the sense that there is a mortgage, and he is all right so long as he keeps up his mortgage payments, possibly an accountant looking at it from a purely balance sheet point of view might say: &ldquo;This man has a mortgage for £5,000; the market value of his premises is only £4,000; therefore, on that he is insolvent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could see that kind of situation arising and I can, therefore, see the reason behind the case apparently put up by the accountants, that their attention should be specifically directed to the business carried on by the auctioneer, or house agent, or any other business he is engaged in, and that they should be relieved of any responsibility of inquiring into the purely personal responsibility of the auctioneer, once he is solvent in these <Col N="1991" /> fields.  It modifies what is in the section already.  It relieves the accountant to a certain extent but I agree, on reflection, that there may be a case for it.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.  Surely the auditor investigating the accounts of the auctioneer will most certainly satisfy himself as to the total of the deposits and moneys held by the auctioneer in keeping for his clients. It will not be considered, nor will it be the business of the auditors, whether the auctioneer has a mortgage on his house or not.  The auditor's business will be entirely to satisfy himself as to the solvency of the auctioneer.</P>

We also have an obligation to auctioneers as an important section of our business community.  It would be wrong if in the discharge of their duties, the auditors appointed for the purpose of supplying the courts annually with certificates in order to obtain licences went into any other degree of business undertaken by auctioneers.  There are people who may be publicans, or undertakers, who have an auctioneer's business as well and they have been very decent, honourable and straightforward.</P>

When the auditor goes to investigate the solvency of the auctioneer, he will investigate his record and ask for his bank account only in relation to his business as an auctioneer.</P>

      <P>If we have an investigation into whether an auctioneer has a mortgage on his house and whether he has other business &mdash; maybe the undertaking business, the licensed trade, a grocery and hardware business &mdash; I think it would be wrong.  I would express the opinion that it would lead to a certain amount of uneasiness, if the auditor of the auctioneer's business were to go into every other sphere of activity carried on by an auctioneer.</P>
      <P>I agree that it is quite all right in the case of auctioneers who have no other profession or means of livelihood. However, fortunately, or unfortunately, we have a number of people carrying on what has been described as a most successful and thriving auctioneering business in conjunction with other businesses.  If the other businesses are to be the subject of a certificate of solvency, there may be some degree of hardship on certain auctioneers who have conducted their business in an honourable and trustworthy manner.  Can the Minister satisfy me that the reason for the amendment is to ensure that the auditors' certificate will only be in relation to the auctioneer's business as an auctioneer?</P>

      <P>That is what worries me.  In so far as most auctioneers are concerned, they have no other business.  But, let us take the case of the auctioneer who is running a grocery, hardware or undertaking establishment &mdash; and we have many such people throughout the country.  What happens in that case?  Is the certificate of solvency to cover all his other businesses?  For instance, there may be an auctioneering firm and we have a number of them in the country, who <Col N="1993" /> are hardware traders.  I have a few in mind and they have been in the auctioneering business in many cases for half a century.  A number whom I know in the midlands have just come to my mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Deputy Flanagan is raising is a valid <Col N="1994" /> one.  I did not want to appear to raise any controversy with regard to this idea of the accountant's certificate.  My own view &mdash; which I expressed to Deputy Flanagan before &mdash; was that I think the auctioneers' association are unwise, in my judgment, in inviting the position where their livelihood, as auctioneers, will depend on a certificate from any other profession.  I think they should be content to deal with themselves, their regulations in the court.  However, the solicitors' profession have adopted this particular idea of accountants' certificates; the auctioneers are now doing it, but Deputy Flanagan has argued that the requirement in relation to the inquiries to be carried out by the accountants should relate specifically to the business of the auctioneer only, as auctioneer; in other words, his business as auctioneer and house agent.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment goes further than that.  In amendment No. 19, the solvency requirement is:</P>
      <P>that, in relation to the business of auctioneer or the business of house agent (as the case may be) ...</P>
      <P>those two&mdash;</P>
      <P>and any other business in which he may be engaged, he is solvent.</P>
      <P>Therefore the obligation on the accountant, under this amendment, is two-fold: he must satisfy himself that the auctioneer, as auctioneer or house agent and in relation to any other business he carries on, is solvent.</P>
      <P>I know, as Deputy Flanagan and most Deputies I am sure in this House know, a great many auctioneers in rural Ireland, in the country towns&mdash; this does not apply to any great extent in the city of Dublin at all, but certainly in rural Ireland &mdash; very often the person who has an auctioneer's licence is also a shopkeeper; he may be a farmer, he may own a garage; he carries on some other business.  It is clear that under the Minister's amendment, the accountant must investigate solvency not only in relation to the business of auctioneer and house agent but also in relation to any other business carried on by the auctioneer, whether it is that of a publichouse, that of an undertaker, a farmer &mdash; whatever you like.</P>

      <P>The Minister realises &mdash; unfortunately, to the regret of many in this country&mdash;and many of the general public realise that all too often insolvent persons were granted auctioneers' licences; that an auctioneer's licence was too easily and readily obtained.  Is that not true, and the Minister agrees with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of the Bill is that the Irish Auctioneers' and Estate Agents' Association want, first and foremost, to raise the standard.  In an effort to raise the standard, we have asked for this Bill as a threefold effort; firstly, to raise the standard of the profession; secondly, to safeguard the general public, and thirdly, to prevent insolvent persons obtaining auctioneers' licences which could become a serious liability on their clients because of the fact they were insolvent.  It has been known to the association down through the years that quite a number of persons who had no qualification of fitness, no qualification of solvency, or no qualification of character in many cases, obtained auctioneers' licences.</P>
      <P>Here is a case in which it is now necessary to submit a certificate of solvency to the district court in order that the licence may be obtained.  In the case of the certificate of solvency, it is important that all applicants for licences should have that certificate; that the accountant should be completely and entirely satisfied they are solvent, and solvent to a very high degree, before they are allowed to practise as auctioneers.  All too often we have seen it; we can describe them as the mushroom auctioneers who sprang up overnight into the business, On many occasions, we have seen the general public suffer serious financial losses because they entrusted their business to firms or individuals, as auctioneers, who were not solvent. The certificate of solvency is absolutely necessary.</P>

        <i>(Dublin):</i> I believe this is a very fair amendment. <Col N="1996" /> I cannot see how any accountant could give a certificate of solvency, without inquiring into all one's business.  It would be quite possible for any trader to transfer part of his assets &mdash; no matter what trade he is pursuing &mdash; across to the auctioneering business. He could show solvency in his auctioneering business but this money, which he has got from other sources, may put him in a solvent position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 26, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  A certificate for the purposes of paragraph (b) shall not be deemed to be insufficient by reason only of the fact that &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  an interval has elapsed between the issue of the certifimer <Col N="1997" /> cate and the time of the application: provided that the interval does not exceed one month, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the certificate, in so far as it relates to paragraph (a) (ii), indicates only that the accountant has no reason to believe that a client has suffered or is liable to suffer loss,</P>
    <P>or by reason of both such facts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, again, is an amendment suggested by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and, like the previous one, deals with a special type of case, where the auctioneer has failed to keep proper accounts.  I want to emphasise that we are dealing here not with a general accountant's certificate &mdash; which is provided for in the main part of the section &mdash; but with the special case where the auctioneer has failed to keep proper accounts and has come to the court to show that he has mended his ways.  I do not think this emerged clearly from the discussion on the last amendment.</P>
    <P>The main point of the amendment is to make it clear that the supporting certificate from the accountant need not be expressed to relate to the date of the court application.  If the provision were to be interpreted in that way, it would be almost unworkable. The amendment spells out that the certificate may be given at any time in the preceding months.  The accountants made the point that their certificate may have to be drawn up a week or so before the actual date of the court and, as the drafting stood, it might be held that they were certifying to what was the position at the actual date of the application, which would be a physical impossibility.  To give it more flexibility, it now refers to a certificate from the accountant which relates to the position of the auctioneer at any date within a month prior to the application.</P>

In the early part of <Col N="1998" /> section 12 we deal with the certificate which will be submitted by the accountant and which will cover, as Deputy Flanagan says, the previous 12 months.  What we are considering here in this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

      <P>We are considering here the situation where the auctioneer has not complied with all the regulations to keep separate accounts.  We are considering here, if you like, the bad case.  We are providing for a more stringent type of examination in regard to solvency, which does not arise at all in the previous case.  In subsection (4) we are providing for the case where the applicant has omitted to comply with the regulations concerning separate bank accounts, where he has omitted to do what is set out here in the Bill. In these cases we say the District Justice may, at his discretion, grant an application if the applicant conforms with certain conditions.</P>
      <P>The main one is the one we discussed the last time, that the auctioneer is solvent in regard to his auctioneering business and his general business.  In this amendment we say the certificate must be up to date.  As the section was phrased, it might be a certificate as on the date of the court application. All we are doing now is relating it back to within four weeks of the court application.  It must still be an up-todate certificate from the accountant setting out for the Justice the correct position of the auctioneer.  That is separate altogether from the more general certificate we are obliging the auctioneer to present to the court every year, in which he will furnish an accountant's certificate stating that separate bank accounts have been kept, and setting out that he has performed all the duties he is obliged to perform under the Bill.  The two matters are separate.  We are dealing now with a bad case who has not complied with the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 12 is the section dealing with the requirement that the auctioneer secured his licence <Col N="2000" /> each year on the basis of a certificate being furnished by an accountant that he is keeping separate accounts and that he is in a proper financial state. That is dealt with in subsections (1), (2) and (3).  Now we come to subsection (4).  That was put in at the request of the Irish auctioneers' association. I shall read it:</P>
      <P>(4) (a) The District Justice may, at his discretion, grant an application for a certificate of qualification notwithstanding that, because of failure to comply with the provisions of the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1967, relating to the keeping of accounts and to the opening and keeping of client accounts, the applicant is unable to furnish the certificate required by subsection (3) of this section, provided that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the District Justice &mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that he is, at the time of the application, complying with the said provisions and has taken all necessary steps to comply with them for the future;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that no client has suffered or is liable to suffer loss in respect of any transactions during the period when the said provisions were not complied with; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  that he is solvent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we have done here is to amend &ldquo;solvency&rdquo; in the previous amendment which was passed, so as to ensure, as far as the accountant is concerned, that in giving a certificate it will be solvency related to the auctioneer's business as an auctioneer or any other business he is carrying on. All we are saying in this amendment now before the House is that such a certificate shall be a certificate prepared by the accountant within one month prior to that application.  The only slight amendment we are now suggesting here, by the last amendment and this amendment, in what has been agreed to by the Irish Auctioneers' Association is that we further pin down solvency so that the accountant can draw a proper certificate and we further state that this certificate must be furnished within one month prior to the application.  We <Col N="2001" /> are therefore making only two slight amendments to a principle which has been recommended and agreed to by the Irish Auctioneers' Association.</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress <Col N="2003" /> last night, I had mentioned all the good things in the Budget that would help the small farmer and the poorer sections of the community. Everybody seems to be worrying about the small farmer for the past 12 months or so, the NFA and other organisations, and we were all glad that the small farmer got recognition in this Budget.  Great play was made last year about cattle prices.  Cattle prices were bad for a few months of the year, but it was the small man who suffered most.  The big farmer was able to recoup his losses.  In the rural constituency I represent there is a great deal of praise for the Budget among all sections.  The Opposition have said that the benefits were given so that the Fianna Fáil councillors would be returned to office.  It must be a good Budget or the Opposition would not adopt that attitude.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The small farmers will welcome the grants for milk coolers.  However, most Deputies know very well that a water supply is the most essential requirement where quality milk is concerned and many small farmers lack this amenity.  In some areas they have not got electricity and that would be a handicap to them.  This 2d a gallon for quality milk, including the extra penny since 1st April, makes a nice figure at the end of the year and in the monthly cheque.  I wonder can anything be done in the Department about increasing the grant for the water supply.  Before the farmer can get a cooler he must have water.  The majority of the large farmers will qualify for the cooler grant because they have the water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputies would like to see the small farmer on a sound footing.  I have often suggested &mdash; and I should like the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission to consider it &mdash; that when holdings are being divided the small farmers nearby should be given extensions to their holdings.  This is necessary if they are to increase production, increase their cattle herds and so on.  At present one sees them paying £23 or £24 per acre for conacre. It was the small farmer who suffered <Col N="2004" /> most when cattle prices were low because he was not in a position to hold on to them until the prices improved. The big man did not lose much; if anything he gained.  I know of some of them who bought cattle last November from the marts and who in five weeks' time made a substantial profit on them.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been criticising the imposition of a penny on the pint and 2d on cigarettes.  Nobody likes taxation, but considering we have been able to do so much with so little taxation, I think it is a very good Budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy, from the Labour benches, said yesterday it was a very dark year for Fianna Fáil.  In North Tipperary, it was a fairly good year. For the tillage farmers, it was the best year they had for ten or 12 years.  They had not a bad harvest last year.  A question was put down asking that the price of wheat be increased.  There is a good price for wheat and the people who harvested it last year were well rewarded.  On the question of feeding barley, one section here will be asking for the price to be increased, but I am sure Deputy Coughlan will be talking about keeping it down for the benefit of the pig feeders.</P>
    <P>It is easy to see from the attitude of the Opposition that this is a good Budget.  It will not be a nice thing for them to have to admit outside church gates during the local election campaign that they voted against the old people getting the 5/- increase, or against the small farmers getting complete de-rating at £20 valuation, or against the other benefits to be given to the social welfare categories.  They will have to answer for all that.  There is no doubt that it is a very good Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Fanning, I am half convinced that he believed what he was saying, but when we consider this Budget, we must bear in mind that it was introduced solely and entirely with one target in view, the local elections on 28th June.  This is a gimmick Budget. Not alone is it a gimmick Budget but it is despicable, in my opinion.  We have now reduced the small farmer to the status of the pauper and the souper; <Col N="2005" /> he can now go to the labour exchange all the year round.  Pearse was not far wrong when he said that the British had bought one half of us and intimidated the other half.  That is what this Budget is doing, in my opinion.  I have experience of both urban and rural Ireland.  I know what the people want. What the Irish always want is independence and not soup.  But that is what is being ladled out to one half of them in this Budget.  We had the same thing before with the free beef.  This is nothing new.  It has always been the policy of Fianna Fáil to intimidate one half and bribe the other half.  That is what they are trying to do in this Budget.  We are told that the small farmer is being helped.  He is being helped, but not in the way he wants to be helped.  He wants fair prices and a chance to make a living on his holding.  Our forebears bought the land dearly.  They intend to hold on to it.  They do not expect soup from the Minister for Finance, but that is what he has given them in this Budget.  There is no provision here for the other ringmaster we have in Education.</P>

      <P>There is no provision for the educational schemes that have been thrown out to us.  Schemes were thrown out to us also under the Health Act not so very long ago; they have all gone by the board, but they were thrown out to us.  Schemes for education are now being thrown out to us.  We are to have free postprimary, free secondary, free technical, free vocational and free university education, with perhaps a miniuniversity <Col N="2006" /> for Limerick.  Where in this Budget is there provision for all that free education?  Let the people realise the position now; that provision will not be made until after 28th June.  We will then be faced with another supplementary Budget to cater for this expensive experiment.</P>
      <P>It is not so long since the former Taoiseach at a meeting in Letterkenny on 21st March, 1965, said:</P>
      <P>The Government had given a great deal of thought to the local rates problem and had set up a number of committees to examine the possibility of providing for local authorities some other source of local revenue, to consider the desirability of transferring from local rates to central funds some part of the cost of local services and the feasibility of devising a method by which the burden of rates could be equalised as between one county and another.</P>
      <P>I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 22nd March, 1965.  That is the statement of the ex-Taoiseach, speaking at Letterkenny in March, 1965.  Following that statement, I tabled questions here asking what had been done and all I got was the evasive reply that the committees were still considering the matter.</P>
      <P>No provision has been made in this Budget to ease the burden of local rates.  In the city of Limerick, we are faced with a sum of £15,500 for unemployment assistance, £2,300 for criminal injuries, £6,000 for industrial and reformatory schools, £6,500 for school meals and £26,850 for home assistance. Home assistance should be the responsibility of the Government.  Why should the ineptitude of the Department result in casting this burden on us?  Not a week passes in which I do not make two or three phone calls to the Department because people are held up in their unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  All these things should be a charge on central funds.  I do not know what the figures in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere are, but I am sure the story is pretty much the same.  These charges should not be levied on the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Minister for Local <Col N="2007" /> Government declared war on us &mdash; there is a letter on the records of this House &mdash; and told us that, if we did not raise the rents on our tenants, our housing subsidies would be withdrawn. In today's papers there is a statement by the present Minister for Local Government &mdash; a statement I can neither parse nor analyse &mdash; to the effect that he has no function and that he will not interfere.  Where do we stand?  Who is the Jeykll and Hyde in all this?  We know what will happen in July.  The rents will be increased because of a ministerial order by the Minister's predecessor. The Minister met a tenants' association yesterday and made a deliberately deceptive statement about increasing rents.</P>
    <P>We are delighted the old age pensioners will get a dollar a week.  God help us, to stretch a dollar now from Monday morning until Saturday night one would want to be a magician in this year of 1967.  We have, on the other hand, this Taca brigade which was formed lately.  At one time we used to call them Broy Harriers; we can now call them Haughey Harriers.  I am wondering whether membership has been closed.</P>

      <P>That is the position as far as this Budget is concerned and as I see it. We have the tragic situation in the city of Limerick where the oldest bacon factory in Europe has closed down.  No assistance has been given. Deputations have been received from the curers, the directors of the company and the workers.  Promises were made, but they went home with one hand as long as the other.  That factory, which was over 100 years in existence, is now closed.  They sold their lorries late last week.  Men who served for 50 years with a knife in a bacon factory are now walking up to the labour exchange in Limerick.  What is being done to save it?  They talk about the small farmer.  That is the way to save the bacon factory: let the small farmer get value for his money and value for his work instead of ladling out soup to him which he does not want from the labour exchanges.  Is that not our independence that was dearly bought?  The policy of Fianna Fáil from the days of the free beef to today has been to buy half of them and intimidate the other half.</P>
      <P>This is not confined to Limerick.  In a bacon factory last week, there were ten pork butchers laid off and were it not for the good fortune and the enterprise of Clover Meats, we would have one of the biggest bacon factories in the country closed up.  What are the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance doing about this?  It is not today or yesterday this bacon industry matter was raised here.  Two, three and four years ago, the Minister was warned and told in advance by one who comes from one of the best bacon curing centres in Europe, Limerick, what was going to happen, but no, he knew it all; he will bring them to the labour exchange instead and that is what this Budget has put before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are faced with this consortium <Col N="2009" /> of builders.  I suppose it will be consortia before another six months &mdash; it will be pluralised.  We have set up this consortium, the members of which are all Taca men.  They were going to set Ireland free.  They are going to reduce the cost of building and going to do all the planning.  I wonder what it cost to be a member of this consortium for the building.  In another six months we will have consortia all over the country for everything.  This is the intimidation of one half and the purchase of the other.</P>
    <P>This is a despicably mean Budget.  It is something that was not introduced last year because we postponed the local elections.  It is introduced for one aim and one aim only, that is, 28th June, local elections day.  After 28th June let it be understood and let the people of Ireland realise that we will be facing another Budget.  The hairshirt will be brought upon us then.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister for Education or the Minister for Finance of the difficulties that we in local authorities are faced with because of the burdens that are placed on us which I believe should be central charges.  We had it here at Question Time today with regard to valuations. We all know how valuations are arrived at.  There is one thing about the whole question of valuations: there is not a qualified valuer in Ireland and there is no means of being a qualified valuer.  The rate collector comes along and he makes his charge.  You can appeal by 1st April but in nine cases out of ten, the appeal is rejected.</P>
    <P>We voted for this Budget not because we agreed with it but because we saw some consideration for unfortunate people.  Indeed the five bob they gave will not send anybody home in a taxi on a Saturday night, even from Deputy Fitzpatrick's premises.  I am sorry he is not here.  It is about time we all realised &mdash; we have seen it &mdash; that the gimmick merchants, the Taca brigade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have been intimidating unfortunate people and deceiving them every day, telling them: &ldquo;If you do not vote this way you will lose your pension; you will be cut off; there will be an inspector down on top of you.&rdquo;  This Budget is typical of that sort of thing and from the Labour benches, I want to deplore it.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always interesting to hear Deputies make elaborate pronouncements about the heavy burden of rates, about how much the Central Government should bear of the cost of municipal and other services.  They never propose the taxes that would have to be placed on the community at large if a greater volume of local authority expenditure were transferred to be the responsibility of the central Government.  In fact, the Government have gone a very good distance, adding to the percentage of total local authority expenditure which is met by the central Government in successive years.</P>
      <P>In the case of my constituency, the Government pay something between 62 per cent and 64 per cent of Monaghan County Council's costs for roads, housing, health and other services. This includes the total expenditure by the local urban councils at least, it cannot be said that the Government have been negligent in that respect.  In so far as Monaghan is concerned, in the year 1966-67, the farmers were paying about five per cent more in agricultural rates on land than they were paying in the year 1956-57, and that was before the recent arrangements were made, which will be introduced this year, for a derating of farms under £20 valuation &mdash; another contribution by the Government towards relieving local authorities as far as possible from burdensome rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> Undoubtedly rates in towns have gone up very much in recent years.  I made a calculation to see whether there was anything desperately unfair about it and as the House knows, there is continuing inquiry into the whole rating situation, but it is significant to know that in 1965-66 compared with 1958, the total rates in the urban districts had not increased any more than the national income.  Of course, that does not mean that everybody in the town experienced a rise in income equivalent to the national average but it means there was nothing extraordinary, no distortion, in the picture of rising rates even though they fall heavily on certain sections of the community. However, certain sections of the community have received social benefits of many kinds to meet that contingency.</P>
    <P>I mention that in passing because one hears such irresponsible talk from people like Deputy Coughlan.  He made all sorts of reckless charges, accusing the Government of corruption and saying that the Irish people could be intimidated by alleged corruption and that by intimidating them, they could be induced to support the Government.  It was a very reckless charge made against what could be regarded as the ultimate integrity of our people.  I was surprised to learn that Deputy Coughlan's opinion of the people is so low, as, I have no doubt, the people of Limerick will be surprised when they read of his allegations.</P>
    <P>He suggested that the Government are associated with a vast amount of political patronage.  It is just as well we should bear some facts in mind. There are only about ten countries in the living world where such a huge proportion of appointments in the central and local service are effected on the basis of merit, as are here. There are very few countries in the world where there are so few appointments which in fact are in the gift of the Government or on a political basis. That situation has been maintained and has not been altered in any way during the very long period in office of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Long may it remain so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> Deputy Coughlan referred to certain appointments where he knows very well that whatever may be political aspects of the appointments, in general, the people who have a great deal of family responsibilities, in lower paid posts and who are fully qualified, get appointed regardless of their political affiliation. Deputy Coughlan should go abroad and he will undoubtedly realise how very proud we can be not only of the incorruptibility of the Fianna Fáil Government and their antecedents but of the relatively small amount of patronage that is exercised here. Patronage is inevitable in every democracy but whatever our problems, we need not be ashamed of our position in that respect.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with Deputy Coughlan's scurrilous assertions and with his comparison of a contribution of £100 to political funds with the social welfare services, which went up by £1 million this year, I may now proceed to examine the Budget.  I add my voice to those of other Deputies in rejecting utterly the ridiculous statements suggesting that the Government have for the first time come to the aid of the West because there are local elections impending.  The Government, since they took office in 1957, and indeed in their previous periods of administration, but in 1957 after a period of unparalleled emigration and unemployment, have constantly provided increased State grants for production, have constantly stimulated the development of the economy and have come to the aid of farmers while increasing social services.  These additions took place in practically every single year of our office since 1958 and have varied in quality and quantity.  Aid has been provided for farmers, big and small, on a basis never before seen in the history of the country.</P>
    <P>Total farm aid in all forms amounts to about £60 million this year.  In 1956, it was at the level of £15 million or £16 million.  That indicates very considerable progress.  Aid is continued in regard to agriculture, to tourist capital development, to the promotion of tourism.  It is continued on an upward <Col N="2013" /> basis for rural electrification, for the development of our roads and, as I have said, the idea that we abandoned the West until this Budget and that now we have contributed to some small extent, is utterly ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to go to Galway the other day to speak on a political occasion and I wanted to see for myself what had been done for the people of County Galway since 1956, the last year of the Coalition Government, in order to refute suggestions that were made there that Galway has been abandoned, that nothing has been done to bring economic and social development to that very typical western county.  I found there were 20,000 farmers in the county and that since 1956, 20,000 acres of land have been added to the existing holdings of just about 1,600 small farms.  That is a costly business, and it indicates progress in land settlement.  We would like to have made more progress but that indicates a very considerable change in the structure of the farms in Galway in a period of just ten years.</P>
    <P>We find that in Galway, for example, 22,000 acres of trees had been planted, that is, roughly 70 square miles of forests had been planted, again indicating a contribution to the county which can be illustrated in other counties all over the West.  This is merely a typical example of the sort of contribution that has been made continuously during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The Government, through a wise policy, have surfaced the county roads. This is something which in fact I had the privilege of initiating back in 1946 when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and it has resulted in the tar surfacing of 1,000 miles of county roads in Galway alone, since 1957 &mdash; again indicating very great progress.</P>
    <P>I could continue in that vein for a long time, illustrating the progress which has been made and pointing out that some of the new incentives in grants and increases in the price of milk this year are all part of a continuous campaign to bring help to the small farmers in particular and to encourage economic and social development <Col N="2014" /> in the 12 western and northwestern counties.  I wish we could find another name for the West because Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim are included in the counties which urgently need development.</P>
    <P>I was calculating the other day for my constituents the actual contribution in terms of cash by way of subsidies to maintain farm prices in my constituency.  Including the amounts to keep down the rates on land and including the price supports for pigs &mdash; and Monaghan has seven per cent of the pigs in the country &mdash; and including the price supports for dairy products and the sow headage grants and the fertiliser grants, I worked out that the 6,800 farmers in Monaghan received help from the Government last year to the amount of something between £800,000 and £1 million.  That was for one county.</P>
    <P>Monaghan farmers have to work very hard.  A lot of the land is rather cold and wet.  They have to face all the hazards of wind and weather and they deserve that kind of aid because of the difficulty of maintaing farm incomes about which the House has full knowledge.  Nevertheless, this indicates that the Government made some contribution to stimulate greater farm production and bring an economic income to the farmers.  In a small county like that, the farmers who complain of the aid given would be in a very serious position if that £800,000 to £1 million ceased to flow into the county.  I hope that more and more aid will be given in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a great many people yet realise the difficulty of transferring income from the non-farming community to the farming community in a country where we have not yet established sufficient industries.  This was referred to very briefly in the magnificent Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance but it seems to me that it has to be repeated over and over again in the hope that just a few thousand more people will read what is said, appreciate it and understand the problems we have to face.  We have pointed out that the incomes of the farming population have gone up by about 70 per cent per head since 1958.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> A considerable amount of that increase is due to migration from the land.  It is very interesting to read in the Report on Full Employment the figures for migration from the land for the OECD countries published in the appendix. We can see that migration from the land has proceeded just as rapidly in almost every other country in Europe as it has here and that it is a universal factor in economic development.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the income of the farming population has gone up 70 per cent per head and the income of the rest of the community has gone up roughly the same amount, or perhaps a little more, since 1958.  The difference in income between the two communities places us just about halfway down a list of a number of European countries.  There are a number of European countries where the income per person in agriculture as a percentage of the whole economy is less than it is here and there are some where it is more.  We are about halfway down the list.  Naturally all of us would like to see us higher up in the list.  I have the figures for some years ago only.  Probably they have not changed very much.  They may have improved slightly as a result of the coming into operation of the agricultural system of the European Economic Community.  Non-farming incomes grow so rapidly that every country has found it impossible to bring the incomes of the farming community level with those of the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>In a recent year the income of the Irish farming community per head was 68 per cent of the income of the average economy.  The figure for Denmark was 73, for West Germany, 50 and for France, 51 per cent, showing again that we were in a comparable position.  It is very unfair for people to deride the Government for not doing more to reduce the difference in incomes without at the same time pointing out that our industrial resources are insufficient.  We have heavy taxation in order to shift the balance in the right direction.  We have heavy taxation in order to provide price supports for the farming community <Col N="2016" /> which last year were valued at between £17 million and £19 million.</P>
    <P>One way to examine this is to look at the non-agricultural resources available in the various countries to support an equal amount of agricultural output in each of the countries.  Taking Irish non-agricultural resources as 100 &mdash;that is to say if you have 100 units of non-farming resources here to be taxed in order to transfer income to the farming community, what is the same number of units in a number of countries which have had their freedom for a great deal longer and many of which have more industrial raw materials and where industrial development has proceeded on a much more extensive basis than ours, although we are advancing &mdash; we find that in an agricultural country like Denmark which had the advantage of freedom at a very early stage, democracy and a splendidly run system of finance, although that appears to be an agricultural country they have twice the non-farming resources from which to transfer income to their farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give all the figures but the British have 8½ to nine times our resources; France has over three times our resources.  This provides a very great problem for any Government earnestly desiring to break down the difference between the incomes of the farmers and the non-farming community. We can only hope that as industrial development continues steadily year by year and as tourist development continues, while we are not in EEC and have to find subsidies to aid farmers by supporting their prices, we shall have to continue this aid at an increasing pace.  When we join EEC, there may be increases in our cost of living which, in itself, will be a kind of taxation, which will be of assistance to the farming community. I believe people ought to recognise these facts because they cannot be got around.  Any Government who want to help the farmers will always have to look at the amount of non-farm resources which can be taxed.  I said some time ago that if the cost of living goes up because of increases in the price of food and people want to remocrac <Col N="2017" /> compense themselves by having increased wages they may do so but they will find that the Government will almost inevitably have to tax them in order to find money to transfer to the farmers.  I said we should not regret increases that arise in the price of food as a result of the farmers securing higher prices for their produce.</P>
    <P>I was speaking of the increased grants and facilities offered in the Budget.  I wanted particularly to speak on some matters which concern my Department.  I am quite certain that, in certain regions of the West, tourism will play the greatest part in increasing the incomes of the people there and in attempting to stabilise the population. I doubt if the population of the West can be stabilised in the very near future.  I believe the Government should do their utmost to provide centres of growth in the West by the stimulation of agriculture, industry and tourism in order to offer the greatest possible opportunities for employment so that the largest number of people possible will be retained in these western counties.</P>
    <P>As I said, I think there are certain areas where tourist development will play a very major part.  For example, I could mention the fact that in Counties Kerry and Cork, the tourist income in a recent year amounted to some £7½ million.  The effect of tourist income is not immediately apparent.  It is not like opening a factory and employing 200 people where the workers go every day and receive their wages at the end of the week.  It is an all-pervasive income spreading over a large variety of people.  If that income of £7½ million ceased in that area, then the people there would realise the immense value of the tourist industry for those two counties and, indeed, for the whole of the western counties in general.</P>
    <P>In this Budget, we have provided very considerable increases in the grants for new hotel accommodation. We hope to channel these grants to a great extent to hotels and extensions of hotels in the western areas, that is, areas where development is required, where tourist centres would have still further help in expanding their hotel <Col N="2018" /> resources.  The Bord Fáilte grant for accommodation development is being increased this year by some £200,000 to £700,000.  We need some 2,000 extra bedrooms a year between hotels, guesthouses and private houses in order to achieve the target of a 100 per cent increase in the volume of tourist income based on 1960 prices. We are very nearly up to target.  We are a shade off target as a result of the seamen's strike last year.  This is a particular economic development which is up to target to a greater extent than any other that we have at present.  I felt it was most essential to continue this development because it spreads money among a very large number of people.</P>
    <P>The <i>Economist Intelligence</i> reported to Bord Fáilte &mdash; an Opposition supporter is very closely associated with that body &mdash; that about 160,000 people were directly or indirectly employed as a result of the tourist industry.  The report indicated that the tourist industry has the effect of adding ten per cent to the population.  If one assumed that the tourists remained here permanently, then it would be the equivalent to the income spent by an addition of ten per cent to the population.  Tourism also has a very important effect on expanding Government income through taxation. Every £ spent by the tourist and every £ spent on development helps to provide income for State services and, in turn, for the development of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat, in rather more detail, what is being done this year to help in the extension and the growth of hotel accommodation throughout the country, particularly in the West. New hotels in the 12 western counties can now get, at the discretion of Bord Fáilte, grants of up to 35 per cent of total construction costs as compared with 25 per cent previously.  One of the reasons for giving these increased grants has been the recent inflation, the growth of building costs, the cost of building new hotels, particularly in the remoter parts of the West because of the carriage of the materials.  Another reason is the fact that the season is relatively short.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> There are many places in the West with magnificent scenic amenities where it is simply impossible to get functional business in the winter and hotels and guesthouses may have to close even though the season is steadily growing. Quite a number of hotels in Connaught in completely isolated districts remained open last year until 15th November.  Everything is being done by Bord Fáilte to extend the season so that it will be easier for hotels to pay their way and so that employment will be for a longer period.  Hotels adding bedrooms in the West can qualify for grants of up to 50 per cent compared with 40 per cent elsewhere.  New hotels, not getting total construction grants, can get 30 per cent grants in the West towards dining areas, kitchens, and so on.</P>
    <P>Then there is the very essential development of caravan and camping sites.  Bord Fáilte are going to register caravan and camping sites to ensure that they are of the right standard. They have been consulting with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that, from the point of view of sanitation, the standards are agreed.  It is very important that caravan parks should not destroy the scenery.  It is very important that they should be placed properly.  It is very important that that should be done as a result of the decision of the local planning authorities.  When they are placed, the amenities should be such as not to detract from the total appearance of the area where they are located.  Bord Fáilte is giving a 50 per cent grant towards site development costs and that, again, will be a help in the West.</P>
    <P>Guesthouses also can get grants provided that there are at least five bedrooms on completion of the work. Then, for some time, we have been considering what we could do to help farmhouse development.  The number of farmhouses that offer accommodation to tourists has been growing steadily.  I think the figure for this year will be something between 700 and 1,000 bedrooms.  I cannot remember the exact figure but it is somewhere about that for the entire country.  We have been trying to devise some <Col N="2020" /> method by which we can encourage farmhouse owners to develop their premises.  The scheme will be announced later &mdash; costing about £100,000 this year.  It will apply to the 12 western counties.  I think it will be partly on a co-operative basis.  Bord Fáilte will select an area where there is an attractive beach, lake or river, a tourist area, and then will arrange for some local development association to be formed.  Having assessed the number of empty houses in good condition which could be let to visitors if they were improved and the number of houses in which visitors can be accommodated and catered for, they will set about making arrangements for providing assistance towards the better furnishing of these houses, providing furniture of a suitable kind so that visitors will be comfortable.  At the same time, arrangements will be made for catering courses to be given where required, as is already done in many towns where angling development is taking place.  At the same time, there will have to be an examination of the roads structure in the district.  There may be a hostel built in the area.  This is a scheme which has been tentatively worked out and may begin on a modest scale and may result in what for want of a better term we will call tourist centres being created.  They will be created around a sufficiently good tourist amenity in order to attract tourists.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested already, for example, that the Glencolumbkille area, where Father McDver is doing his splendid work, would be a suitable area for development of this kind.  Bord Fáilte have been examining a number of areas in the West.  I might add that they must have the choice of these areas.  It is no good people pressing me to decide that some place should be included in the scheme.  They are to be given the authority and they will have to begin on a modest basis and learn by experience what is the best method of development.  Bord Fáilte have made a splendid success of the resort development scheme for which this year the grant has been doubled. They have improved amenities at a great many resorts and have certainly <Col N="2021" /> developed hotel accommodation on a successful basis.  I have no doubt that they will use the same imagination and resourcefulness in going ahead with the farmhouse scheme.</P>
    <P>The Budget also provides some urgently needed funds towards transport development of various kinds.  For example, cargo has grown so much in volume at Dublin Airport that we need a complete new cargo terminal of the most modern type to carry the hugely increasing volume of cargo exported to other countries and imported here by air.  As a result of the growth of Aer Lingus, we need an entirely new catering building at Dublin Airport.  I mention these to illustrate the kind of developments that are taking place.  I am very glad to note also that the estimated projection for traffic at Cork Airport has been grossly exceeded.  We are extending the catering area at Cork this year, again an example of this Budget's contribution towards economic development.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to announce that the credit squeeze which affected rural electrification development has been relieved in the Capital Budget and that the capital allocation for rural electrification in this year is nearly £2 millions compared with £1.3 millions last year. The halt that took place in rural electrification last year has now ceased and the development of this work will continue on a steady basis.  The present scheme, we reckon, will end by 1970 and 1971, and we hope by that time a very considerable proportion of the entire rural community will have been joined to the network without having to pay extra fixed charges or will have to pay only a very modest increase in the normal fixed charge.  As I stated to the House before, it is a fact that 96 per cent of all rural dwellers can be joined to the system without paying excessive fixed service charges, and if we are able to do that, we will examine the position of the remainder.</P>
    <P>I can say, looking at the picture of Europe as a whole, that if by 1970 and 1971, we have joined 96 per cent of the people to the system, we will compare quite well with countries with an even higher standard of living and higher incomes per head than we have.  That <Col N="2022" /> does not necessarily mean that everybody will want to join.  Out of some 377,000 rural dwellers, there are 27,000 who could be joined to the system without paying any additional fixed charge.  I merely mention that in passing.  We are examining what we can do about the remaining four per cent about which I have had many representations in regard to people who feel they are living in areas where they are surrounded by people with electricity, who already have power, and who are offered connection at very burdensome supplementary fixed charges.  We are going to examine that to see what can be done towards the completion of the campaign.</P>
    <P>In this year's Capital Budget the Government naturally have to give consent to State companies engaging in capital development and I just want to mention how glad I am that the B &amp; I have placed an order for a car ferry for the Dublin-Liverpool service.  This will be a very fast vessel which will be able to do a number of trips each day.  It will have seating capacity for 1,000 passengers and accommodation for 220 cars.  The company are financing this project out of their own resources and have been permitted to engage in this capital venture which I hope will be successful.  I should mention in passing also that the new bulk carrier for Irish Shipping of 34,000 tons deadweight will be delivered in October, 1967. The company's fleet will then consist of 14 dry cargo vessels totalling 162,000 tons deadweight and these vessels will include a high proportion of ships that are relatively modern.  I do hope that Irish Shipping will be able to meet more successfully the very low freight rates that have existed throughout the world for the past few years.</P>
    <P>Again, in connection with modern economic development, the capital grant for the Post Office telephone programme has been increased this year and I hope we will be able to go ahead with the laying of more cables and circuits, which in turn will enable more telephones to be installed and more exchanges to be converted to the automatic system.  I might add that there has been an explosion in telephone development.  The Post Office had to <Col N="2023" /> compete with other services for capital, there has been a fairly large number of applications on the waiting list, but other countries also have their waiting lists.  The number has been fairly large here but I hope that we will be able to reduce it to 8,000 by 31st March, 1968. That would be a considerable reduction as compared with previous years.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to deal with all the people who have been waiting for a very long time for telephones, particularly those in the country.  I have continued to press the policy of my predecessor that we simply must not keep people in rural communities waiting because we know it will require more manhours to connect them than to connect people in the towns.  People in the country, particularly those who are increasing production and who need the telephone for personal or social purposes, and people on the priority list, should be connected as rapidly as possible.  I hope that programme will continue.</P>
    <P>As I said, I wanted to show that in the case both of tourism and transport this Budget has given aid for further development and we are overcoming some of the backlog of work that resulted from the credit squeeze and the difficulties which our country and others encountered in the last two years.  I particularly wish to speak also about the pilot farm scheme.  We have not heard half enough about that scheme from Deputies on all sides of the House.  Probably it will prove to be the greatest scheme of all for encouraging the ambitious farmer in our community to extend production and use modern methods.  It is very interesting that the pilot farm scheme, by its success, has disproved a great deal of cynical comment that is made about Irish farmers in general.  It is true that farmers here, as in the case of farmers in Scotland, are not particularly keen on the full-blooded type of Danish co-operative system and co-operative development, while excellent in many areas, has not proceeded on the same splendid basis as in Denmark.</P>
    <P>It is true that the previous Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="2024" /> strengthened the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Organisation Society in order to show what can be done to bring about the best from what I might call the full co-operative system which one finds in certain areas now.  But a great many people would not have said it was possible for all the instructors and Government officials concerned with farm production to get neighbourhood groups together and discuss in common with them what could be done to improve production in their area, what schemes could be devised, how the whole area, apart from the individual holdings, could be improved so that there would be greater stock density and an increase in production. The scheme devised by the previous Minister for Agriculture has succeeded very admirably and I should like to stress the importance of the decision by the Minister for Finance and the Government that the pilot farm area schemes can be extended this year and I hope they will grow.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in that connection to get some particulars of the success of the scheme in Galway county where in the pilot farm area no less than 11 neighbourhood groups were formed.  In the one area some 607 acres of land were limed and manured through the fertiliser credit scheme and the capital fertiliser scheme by which the whole of the land receives capital, big application for fertiliser over a period of three years and the cost is put on the annuities.  It is a scheme that is not publicised sufficiently and those members of my constituency who adopted the scheme found it of great value particularly in the case of a young man who inherits a farm which is badly run through the illness of the father or the indifference of whoever owned it before.</P>
    <P>In the one parish nearly 2,000 tons of limestone fertiliser were applied apart from this capital application of fertiliser in respect of certain areas. Also, 82 farm building projects were completed in this single parish area. What was very interesting is that loans totalling some £20,000 were taken by the farming community and it was interesting to note that when farmers <Col N="2025" /> come together and discuss their problems and meet all the advisers and all those concerned with helping them, greater progress can be made than if they considered these matters purely separately and apart from each other. The success of the scheme indicates that the Minister for Agriculture can think more intensively on the same lines.  The scheme is succeeding in my own constituency in the Aghabog area and I hope everybody will examine what is being done.  The giving out of more credit is interesting because in the report from the rural economy division of An Foras Talúntais there was an analysis of the extent to which farmers took credit.  The investigators found that incomes on farms where they had taken medium credit were about one-third higher than in the case of farms where no credit had been used.  They also pointed out that in the western areas very little credit and very little money had been borrowed by farmers for productive purposes. One can see in practically every one of the pilot area reports a big increase in the amounts borrowed for productive purposes on the advice of all people concerned with the project.</P>
    <P>Along with the pilot farm area scheme the Government have also provided more money for the Land Commission to see what can be done to improve the land structure in these pilot farm areas.  One can notice in every one of these areas that there is considerable fragmentation of farms. The farms are scattered, but apart from what we call traditionally the rundale system, in a great many areas the farms are not compactly situated and there is also quite a considerable area in each of the pilot farm areas owned by people who are unlikely to make progress in farming, old people living alone whose children have gone away.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see more money provided for the Land Commission in order to bring about growth in the size of viable farm units and to assist in ending or eliminating fragmentation in these areas.  We have not been given the full details of the incentive bonus scheme as proposed by the special <Col N="2026" /> committee set up by the Minister for Agriculture, but again, that is a scheme to assist farmers to produce more and I hope it will succeed.  I also hope that the scheme can somehow be integrated with the pilot farm area scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope every member of the House will read from cover to cover the Report on Full Employment which I think in some ways is the most important document issued in this country since 1948.  It is a document to which both employers and trade unions have subscribed and the most important parts of it are not the endless statistics which are of a purely speculative type in that the authors of the Report do not pretend to devise a plan for full employment, but the paragraphs which refer to the national attitude of our people towards development.  They make it clear that no matter how perfect a Government may be in developing the economy and providing the necessary capital aids, providing education, retraining workers whose occupations must be changed as a result of inevitable changes in industry, that ultimately it will be the attitude of the people that will enable us to progress towards full employment.  The Report refers to the necessity for a very great increase in productivity in industry and in agriculture if we are to see a sufficient number of our people employed in this country.  It refers rather grimly to the fact that almost inevitably some 101,000 people will leave the land between now and 1980.</P>
    <P>In making this statement the Report refers to the average rate of migration from the land in the whole of the OECD countries over a period of years.  The Council members cannot see this inevitable migration from the land ceasing.  They make a rough estimate of what they think it will be, which of course means that employment in industry will have to be accelerated.  The report makes it clear that it is possible that money incomes will inevitably rise but if they rise faster than what would provide for competitive exports there is no hope of securing full employment.</P>
    <P>In fact, the report confirms what <Col N="2027" /> a great many people, economists and Ministers of my Government, have been saying ever since the beginning of the inflation in 1962.  I myself felt very relieved when I read the report prepared by trade unions, employers and others which confirmed the many realistic statements my colleagues and I have made about how perfect the position of this country was from 1958 to 1961 in regard to our being free of inflation.  During those three years employment increased, exports increased and real incomes increased without any inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is inflation in other countries.  We have to face the fact that the British people who managed to exist and have their standard of living grow tremendously on the basis of being able to borrow £1,000 million from their neighbours and their trading associates have now come to the end of their own capacity to permit further inflation.  We are trading partners with them and will continue to trade with them on a majority basis until many years after we join the European Economic Community. We were able to suffer inflation because the English economy was suffering inflation.  That has stopped and whatever action the Labour Government there take in order to restrain incomes, whether it is by some form of compulsion or agreement they simply have not the reserves ever again to engage in the deadly inflation which they experienced in the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We started our period of severe inflation and now for the moment it is over.  If we begin inflation again, as we did from 1961 onwards, we will have no hope of reaching full employment and no hope of taking advantage of the money available in this Budget for economic and social development.  It is interesting to see <Col N="2028" /> that this fact is now confirmed by the nine principal trade union leaders of this country who have warned that money incomes of all kinds must not rise faster than dictated by increased production and if we are to have full employment we must make certain that our own national attitudes are correct.</P>
    <P>The Report on Full Employment is interesting because it takes the searchlight glare off the Government, at least to the extent that whether the Government act rightly or wrongly, whether our policy is perfect or as in the case of most Governments they do their best for the community, that the future of the economy depends on the people. It will depend on the national attitudes of the people and on their attitude towards the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an opportunity of debating this report some time in the Dáil because it is a completely impartial report prepared without any Party bias and signed by some of the leading people in this country.  It is a report which treats inflation and everything associated with it as a deadly menace. I hope it will be studied by everybody concerned.  The fact is that we have made progress since 1958 but that progress was delayed from 1964 onwards because of causes over which we had no control, such as the universal credit squeeze, the import levy imposed by the British Government, by the British difficulties and also by our own refusal to accept the rules which are printed in black and white in the Report on Full Employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely concerned in this Budget to find what is in it for the people of North-Central Dublin, the people I represent here. North-Central Dublin is mainly made up of working people and to be quite frank with you, in this Budget I cannot see any concessions or any reliefs for those people.  It does not matter from what part of the country Deputies come, they all know that the main bone of contention in Dublin at the moment, and the greatest need which exists at the present, is adequate housing.</P>
      <P>It has been repeated several times in this House that in order to get a house from Dublin Corporation, a man, his wife and three children must be living in one room.  Therefore, the ordinary person looking for a house has not much hope of getting one from Dublin Corporation for many years to come.  Now take the case of the man who is determined to buy his own house.  Does this Budget give him any incentive that has not been there before?  The maximum loan such a person could get from a local authority is £2,700.  If he has to buy a house, it will cost him £3,700.  Very few people, at least the people in North-Central Dublin, can hope to have a deposit of £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget has not done anything to ease the position of those people.  It has not given any encouragement to them.  It has not even increased the <Col N="2030" /> amount which local authorities could agree to give by way of a loan.  We were told by the Minister for Local Government that one of the greatest needs in Dublin at the present time is land for housing, that Dublin Corporation are land-thirsty at the moment and that whatever land is available is unfortunately controlled by a few individuals. We know that some of those individuals are prominent supporters of the Government.  Dublin Corporation have been exhorted to use all their powers, even compulsory acquisition, to acquire land.  Recently Dublin Corporation tried to operate a compulsory purchase order in the very area which the Minister for Finance represents out in the Kilbarrack-Swan's Nest area. The application was sent to the Minister for Local Government for sanction and he sanctioned practically one-half and that was left to private developers who are known to be in sympathy with the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ESB allowance for old age pensioners, last night when Deputy Flanagan was referring to this, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was sitting opposite and cynically remarked: &ldquo;I suppose you will claim credit for that, too.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, there are no members of Dublin Corporation here at present.  If they were here, I am sure they would agree that two or three years ago, a Fine Gael member of Dublin Corporation brought this matter before the corporation and gave instances of people in his area who had their ESB power cut off because they owned bills of 12/- to 14/-, of which 11/- was meter charge, which meant that the actual amount of light they consumed amounted to 2/- to 3/-. This Deputy took it on himself to go to the ESB to see whether anything could be done to help these people or relieve them of this charge.  He was told by the ESB that it was not possible to devise any means of surmounting this obstacle.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Fianna Fáil Party have now come around, and that the Minister for Finance has succeeded in devising a way whereby old age <Col N="2031" /> pensioners will be relieved of this charge.  Indeed, very few people will use these 100 units free of charge.  They will not use it in lighting and I think that anybody who knows the old age pensioners of Dublin will agree that 90 per cent of them do not cook by electricity, so that they cannot use it for cooking.  Ninety per cent of them use gas but they will still have to pay for the gas, unless the Minister is prepared to supply them with electric cookers.</P>

      <P>They will not get free gas.  Quite recently I was in touch with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Transport and Power asking him whether it would be possible to issue free TV licences to old age pensioners. He sent me an acknowledgment and said that he would consider the matter and would communicate with me later. After some considerable time, he wrote again.  I have not the letter now but the gist of it was that he was in entire sympathy with the idea.  He was very sympathetic but the major difficulty in this proposal lay in deciding how to operate it.  Now that the Minister for Finance has found a way of operating a scheme of free electricity for old age pensioners, he will have to decide who will be entitled to it.  Is that not a ready-made solution if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wants to give free television licences?  He will not have to devise any new scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to free travel for old age pensioners, that was advocated here some time ago.  In fact, the Labour Party put down a motion here asking for free transport for old age pensioners and the Fianna Fáil Party voted against it.  Now they come up with the idea that they can operate it.  Deputy Clinton stated that Dublin Corporation advocated this.  Not alone did they advocate it but they were willing to raise the money to pay for it.  They approached CIE to see how much it would cost and CIE stated that they could not operate it and even refused to give an estimate of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> Again, the Minister has found a way of overcoming this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase of 5/for old age pensioners, that 5/- has been referred to by many people as the invisible 5/- which they were granted last year, which many thought they were getting but never got.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question which I put down to the Minister for Social Welfare, he informed me that as a result of increased pensions in Britain and by applying the means test here and readjusting the old age pensions, there would be £152,500 saved.  Not alone did he not give the 5/- last year but he actually took £152,500 from these people.  If the Minister is really worried about those people, it is time he increased the personal allowance.  I believe the allowance before interest is assessed, for income tax purposes on capital, is £25.  That amount is there since 1908.  The idea was to have it for the burial of old age pensioners. If £25 was regarded as necessary then, surely it should be a lot more now.</P>

      <P>The payment of this 5/- was rigidly controlled last year.  I know of a case who because she had 10d per week income over and above was deprived of the extra 5/-.</P>
      <P>With regard to the relief being given in income tax for hospital bills, I think even Deputies opposite will agree that that is something which Deputy Byrne has had as a pet subject for many years.  He harped on this on several occasions.  Seeing that Deputy Byrne and the Minister for Finance are from the same constituency, I am sure the people of North-East Dublin will regard this not as something which the Minister gave out of the generosity of his heart but as something which Deputy Byrne has forced on him by continuously advocating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I read in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 12th April, the day after the Budget, an article by the political correspondent.  He stated that <Col N="2033" /> one of the main benefits of the Budget meant:</P>
      <P>that 150,000 farmers will not pay any rates at all, except on some buildings, while farmers above the limit of valuation will not pay any rates on the first £20 of valuation,...</P>
      <P>I do not believe this is entirely true and I think the people I represent in Dublin North-Central would be very annoyed if they thought that the extra taxes which they are called upon to pay were going towards relieving farmers whose valuations are above £20.  As a matter of fact, according to that report, they could be up to £100. I do not believe this is the true position and I should like the Minister to clarify it.  The ordinary worker in Dublin is called upon to pay extra tax on drink and cigarettes.  I am not clear &mdash; perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell me &mdash; as to whether the increase in the price of milk will mean dearer milk in Dublin?  I do not know whether it will, but I presume it will, and, if milk is to be dearer, I presume we will also have dearer butter.  Therefore, the workers of Dublin will have to pay increased prices for milk, butter, drink and cigarettes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that in his opening statement.  He mentioned the price of milk and butter and, as far as I can recall, he said there would be no increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, the worker in Dublin will have to pay increased tax on drink and cigarettes.  Some people have argued that the increase in drink and cigarettes is an increase on luxury goods.  I do not know whether that is the view of the Parliamentary Secretary but it has been long quoted, and was actually quoted by none other than the present Taoiseach many years ago, that drink was no longer a luxury as far as the worker was concerned; that it was a necessity.  I do not want you to take my word; the present Taoiseach's words were that drink is a necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget confers absolutely no benefits on urban dwellers and, while <Col N="2034" /> I shall not go into the merits or demerits of this derating on £20 valuations &mdash; I leave that to the country Deputies to discuss &mdash; it is a remarkable coincidence that in Dublin &mdash; and I regret Deputy Moore is not here because he instanced several cases at Dublin Corporation meetings of increased valuations&mdash;this year seems to be a remarkable one for increased valuations.  Therefore, the people in Dublin, instead of getting any reliefs, good, bad or indifferent, in rates, are having them increased.  In many cases of houses which were let as flats there were enormous increases in valuations which, in turn, led to increases in rents.</P>
    <P>Last night, again, Deputy Flanagan referred to the small shopkeepers in Dublin who had had their valuations increased and nothing was being done for them.  I am glad to see that Deputy Nolan of the opposite side was in complete agreement with Deputy Flanagan.  He told of several cases where small shopkeepers had carried out repairs, which were necessary if they were to try to keep abreast of the times and seeing that they had to compete with the supermarkets <i>et cetera</i>&mdash; if they had any hope of survival, they had to carry out repairs &mdash; and many of them had even to go into debt to do so. I have known of cases of a couple of shopkeepers who were actually requested by Dublin Corporation to renew the fronts of their shops because they were in a dangerous condition. These people had to borrow the money because, if they did not do it, Dublin Corporation would, and they would have to pay for it.  They had to borrow money to do so and, no sooner had they done it, than their valuations were increased.  That is placing an enormous burden on those shopkeepers who are barely struggling for an existence. While, again, I shall not question the merits or demerits of derating for farmers, a very strong case could be made for many of those small shopkeepers getting similar reliefs and I would say they would have been just as well qualified to be derated.</P>
    <P>There is another point I forgot about the social welfare classes.  I was listening to Deputy Mrs. Desmond make a case for widows who were not being <Col N="2035" /> allowed for children, once they came over the age of 16, even though they were still at school.  I had a case &mdash; again from the Minister's constituency &mdash;of a widow who had a young son going to school.  I was actually approached by the school authorities who said that this young lad was brilliant and it would be a pity if he were denied the opportunity of education. I wrote to the Department of Social Welfare about the case and received a reply from them, part of which read:</P>
    <P>As Mrs. X's child, Dominick, is over the age of 16 years, she is not entitled to an allowance in her widow's non-contributory pension in respect of him, even though he is still attending school.  She is also no longer entitled to the statutory deduction of £39 in her means assessment in respect of this child.</P>
    <P>The pension of 26/- a week at present in payment to this woman is based on the assessment of her means derived from her net income from subletting and from the yearly value of her capital.  Where the yearly means of a widow, who has not a qualified child, exceeds £78 10s, but does not exceed £104 15s per annum, a pension at the rate of 26/- per week is payable.</P>

      <P>When these cases exist, we cannot claim great credit for our social welfare system.  Actually, I have been informed that if this woman were in the salaried class, if her husband had been a salaried person or employed in some State or semiState concern, she would receive the allowance for her son who had attained the age of 16 years while still at school. But, just because she is an ordinary worker, she will not get anything for him, even though he is still at school; she will get nothing for him once he has attained the age of 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget is entirely an election Budget.  Just as the first Budget last <Col N="2036" /> year was a Presidential election Budget, this is a local elections Budget.</P>
    <P>We are told that the allowance the Minister has decided to give, for income tax purposes, for children under the age of 11, is a great concession; but I should like to refer again, if I may, to a statement by the present Taoiseach, contained in the Dáil Debates, Volume 150, column 895.  It was the year the inter-Party Government were in power and we were told the country was at rock bottom, the year in which Deputy Burke said we had not the price of a bag of cement. In that year Deputy Sweetman, the then Minister for Finance, granted an allowance of £15 for each child and not just for those under 11 years.  On that occasion the present Taoiseach said, at column 895 of volume 150:</P>
    <P>The relief of £15 for each child is of some help in connection with the family man's net yearly income. There are many people who have no families who expected some increase in the personal allowance. Having regard to the fact that more people are being caught up in the income-tax code every year as a result of increased wages surely the Minister could have given some extra relief this year.</P>
    <P>In the year in which everything was supposed to be at rock bottom, the present Taoiseach told the then Minister that he should be able to give direct reliefs, despite the fact he was giving a relief of £15 for each child. This year we are expected to believe it is a great concession to give £15 for each child under 11 years.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that there is any benefit to be derived from this Budget by the ordinary working people in Dublin North-Central.  They have nothing to gain because the vast majority of them, if they are married and have children, unfortunately do not earn sufficient money to pay income tax.  Therefore, they do not get any relief there.  In fact, they are going to have to pay more by way of extra taxation on drink and cigarettes.  I do not think they get any encouragement to pay up more cheerfully from the knowledge that this extra tax is helping to pay for the derating of farms under £20 valuation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> Speaking here last night, the Minister for Social Welfare said we were one of the few countries where the old age pension was paid at 70 and that it was something he would have to look into.  I suppose the implication was that we should give it at an earlier age. I must give credit here.  Thirty years ago Fianna Fáil were telling the people they were going to give the old age pension at 65.  I do not know whether they will have the same reasons for giving it at 65 now as they had then. The then Leader of the Party told the people he had a very sound reason.  It did sound sensible enough.  He said that any man, no matter how brilliant he was in any field, should realise that when he came to the age of 65, he should retire.  He should retire, not because he had outstayed his time or outlived his usefulness, but to make way for the younger generation.  He owed it to the younger people coming up to get out, and let them come in and play their part.  As well as the change of mind about giving the pension at 65, I think recent events have more than amply proved that this same man changed his mind about retiring at 65.  He thought 65 was not an opportune time to get out and do as the Fine Gael Party asked him to do &mdash;to make way for a young man to take up the position he occupies.</P>
    <P>The Budget is designed solely to try to win the local elections.  I only hope the Minister, when concluding, will give a guarantee that he will not come back in a few months' time with another Budget and ask, as his predecessor, the present Taoiseach, asked, what went wrong with his previous Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The first remark I think I should make in reply to Deputy Belton is this: even though it may be 30 years since somebody decided we should get out of this place at 65, I feel there are some people who would like to think it would be 30 years before it is absolutely decided you cannot come in here after 50.  Having made that remark, I suppose it would be repeating what has been said very often to say that this Budget is very welcome, and particularly welcome to the people <Col N="2038" /> of the West.  In that part of the country, we have been left with a problem, not due to economic reasons but due to history, due to the fact we lost all our important battles.  Having done so, our conquerors exploited us to the fullest, confiscated our good lands, killed whatever industry did not suit them and, as a result, the people were pushed into the bogs and mountains of the West.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This means we still have very many families on too small farms.  For many years those people accepted a low standard of living, supplemented at times by the immigrant members of their families.  Following the War, a change in this pattern took place.  The people then &mdash; due to economic and other reasons over which we had no control &mdash; decided they were not satisfied with that standard of living and, instead of depending on their immigrant members to supply it for them, decided they would emigrate and seek it themselves.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that one of the biggest tasks facing any Government in this country is to provide a standard of living for the small farmers, one that will be comparable with that of the man in industry and the man on the large farm.  It is a difficult thing to do, but down the years the Fianna Fáil Party have tried to do it.  This Budget shows once more that they are still prepared to keep at the task.  They do not consider it a hopeless one and they are prepared to try any and every worthwhile means to help the people in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the agricultural side, we are getting many benefits from this Budget. The first I should like to refer to is the £200,000 for the reformation of the land structure in the West and in the pilot areas.  Any sum spent for this purpose is money very well spent.  By now everybody must know what the small, progressive farmer wants.  He wants to become a big farmer, and this is the main answer to his problem. Having watched the system for a few years, I feel that the Land Commission <Col N="2039" /> have not got sufficient power to deal with this land problem in the congested areas.  Time and time again the Land Commission wished to get land.  They found they have not the power to do so.  They went into auctions and bid for it.  It was bought at a price higher than the Land Commission could pay.  They could not buy because the allotment would be of no profit to the allottees, and as a result had to withdraw from the auction.  A change of law is necessary here, a change whereby the Land Commission will be able to say: &ldquo;This is a congested area; we want this land&rdquo;.  If there is no agreement about the price, an expeditious system of arbitration should be established to decide on that price so that the Land Commission can get the land.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that the Land Commission should be in a position to take over more land from the big farms.  There is an optimum amount of land which one or two men can farm.  I understand it is in the region of 150 acres.  This should be enough for any one person and his workman, depending on the farming he intends to do on it.  Most of the farming done on the larger farms has not a big labour content.  If by any chance a farm of 400 or 500 acres comes on the market, a person should be allowed to buy 150 acres, the remainder going to the Land Commission at the same price and being divided among the people who need it badly.  I appreciate this requires a change of law.  This idea may have been threshed out when the 1945 Act was going through, and probably it will be said that this is an attack on private property, fixity of tenure, free sale, <i>et cetera.</i> People will protest against it, particularly the democrats within the House.  However, I have never heard anybody in the House protest when the private property of professional men such as doctors and lawyers was interfered with by the laws passed by this House. The position is such now that if there is a social need, the people demand that this need be met.  In the West, there is a social need and it should be met in the way I have suggested.  This may not be democracy as we know it, <Col N="2040" /> but I think it is true to say democracy has now changed its definition somewhat. Democracy now gives us but the right to decide what kind of socialism we shall have for ourselves in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Erin Foods. This link-up between Erin Foods and the Heinz organisation is very good news.  Such an industry would provide a wonderful outlet for the produce of small farms in any part of the country and should go a long way towards solving the problem of those small farms that can avail of it.  This whole industry for processing vegetables reflects great credit on the man who conceived the idea and who nursed it through its infancy.  We should congratulate those who brought about the marriage and I hope that in future years this marriage will be a fruitful one.</P>
    <P>This Budget also provides an increased guaranteed minimum price for pigs.  This, too, will be welcome. But one wonders, in view of the history of pig numbers in this country and throughout the world &mdash; they seem to be going up and down like the puppet&mdash; how far we shall get with this.  This is one industry in which there should be co-operation, co-operation between the producer and the processor, based on a contract of some kind or other.  That should be of immense advantage to both.  I understand that such a system works with the beet producers and the producers of corn in various parts of the country.  We are coming to the time when it should be tried out in the pig industry so that the producer will have his guaranteed market and the processor will have his guaranteed raw material.</P>
    <P>Milk is a very important commodity, particularly in the part of the country in which I live, because the land, it appears, is not suitable for anything else.  The increases in price here must be of help, particularly to the people who are able to avail of the quality milk bonus.  The grant which the Minister has offered for coolers may be only a small thing but it is of advantage to the small man, and it is also another break-through in this policy of encouraging the small man, even to <Col N="2041" /> the extent of helping him to mechanise his farm as much as possible and as much as it is worthwhile.  There is another matter which may seem insignificant but it is a situation that exists for some farmers, that due to the bad surface on their roads, the quality of their milk is damaged by the shaking on the way to the creameries.  No matter what they do, they are going to lose.  This is a problem to which we shall have to advert through the other Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this milk problem which I wish to put before the House is in relation to the outlet for skimmed milk in the north-west.  Although he has this outlet, the producer of milk there cannot get the full price for it which is to be got in other parts of the country.  This is an aspect of the dairying industry which those who are responsible for it must face up to in the near future, so that the people to whom I refer will have the same advantages as the others.</P>
    <P>I should like also to make reference to this incentive bonus which I think is an innovation and must excite interest.  We have not heard much about it.  It has been mentioned in relation to the question of two-tier milk prices, but it appears to apply to all productive activity on the farm. I hope it will be used widely and that it will go as far as the drainage problem. I hope that the man who wishes to drain his land will be considered for this bonus, which will contribute to the productivity of his land.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, there is the allocation of £250,000 to county development teams.  That is a good thing. These teams are doing good work and this extra money will be of benefit. There is one point in relation to which I am not quite clear: will this money be used for the small industries we hope will be developed by the Department of Industry and Commerce?</P>
    <P>In relation to free depreciation, the Minister has made it clear that this will not be available for mobile property. He mentioned, in particular, motor vehicles.  That is a pity.  There may be some good reason for it but, in applying it to the West and, at the <Col N="2042" /> same time, not applying it to motor vehicles, we are losing something.  At all the seminars and symposiums about the West, we are always told that one of the reasons we are so backward is that we are remote: we are too far removed from the big consumer market on the east coast, too far removed from the ports on the east coast which have access to the British market; the goods we produce have so much added to them in transport costs and the raw materials coming in have so much added to them and transport costs, therefore, play a very important part in the competitiveness of goods produced in the West.  It is a pity this free depreciation is not made available on motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance has been criticised for various reasons.  It is only fair to say it has met with criticism outside the House as well as inside it. The fact remains that it is very important to the man who will get it and who will depend on it throughout the year.  No matter what view one takes, it will mean that he will have more purchasing power.  Derating will add to that purchasing power and shopkeepers and business people will ultimately benefit by that increased purchasing power.  Indirectly, then, they, too, will benefit as a result of this Budget.</P>
    <P>There are various organisations trying to help the West and a great many people are doing very good work there.  This Budget will encourage them.  We hear too often about &ldquo;Save the West&rdquo;.  We are tired of the slogan. It is time it was changed to &ldquo;Develop the West&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This budget goes a step further towards developing the West.  I hope that trend will continue. Some people believe the West is the Cinderella of the Republic.  That is not true.  It is not such a bad place, but no one will live in it except those who are compelled to live in it.  Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Agriculture, took an interest in the pilot areas.  He encouraged them and helped them along.  They are now proving their worth.  As Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2043" /> and now as Minister for Finance, he has helped to foster industry in Strokestown; as a result of his interest, industry has survived and is now in a position to develop.</P>
      <P>The West will benefit as a result of his first Budget as Minister for Finance. It is only right that we should be grateful to him for this and I hope that we will prove worthy of his generosity and his confidence.</P>

      <P>This is the fifth day of this Budget debate and it is very difficult, therefore, to find anything original to say.  There are a few points, however, I should like the Minister to clear up when he comes to reply.  With regard to derating, there is a sliding scale in the case of valuations of £33. Will the first £20 of that £33 be completely derated?  There is a certain amount of confusion about this.</P>
      <P>An impartial assessment of this Budget does not lead one to believe that the benefits conferred are as great as some would have us believe.  There is already derating of agricultural land because the agricultural grant covers a farmer up to 80 per cent of his valuation. As I said before, the small farmer is the backbone of this country and to me these aids look very like the rather futile exercise of locking the stable door after the horse has gone, because these aids are ten years too late.  In the past three, four and five years, many thousands of our small farmers have left the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree entirely with the dole for small farmers.  They are the most hardworking section of our community. But the pig industry and the poultry industry are gone.  Only last year I urged the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to give help to the small farmer different from that given to the bigger farmer.  In the past the greatest proportion of the moneys allocated for agriculture have gone into the pockets of the larger farmer. But giving the small farmer the dole will act as a disincentive to increased production.  Some other type of income should be provided, such as the two-tier price system for milk, which was advocated by the Irish Creamery <Col N="2044" /> Milk Suppliers Association.  That was a suggestion worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism, there is a big potential in farmhouse holidays. Many tourists from large cities and towns are anxious to spend a quiet holiday.  In the town in which I live, very little help has been received from Bord Fáilte but a local development association has done splendid work. The farmhouse holiday scheme has been developed and this year 17 more farmhouses will be available to tourists.  The Government could help in this farmhouse holiday venture.  Any development here is bound to bring increased benefits to small farmers.</P>
    <P>I listened last night to the Minister for Social Welfare speaking in relation to the benefits conferred on the small farmer.  I want to say that this country is blessed by the fact that we have the best farmers, I would say, in Europe because any time a price inducement is offered &mdash; the most recent one was the in-calf heifer subsidy scheme&mdash;production has corresponded immediately but there is then the problem of providing a market.  This is where the Government have completely failed.  If we had a proper market for the farmers' produce we would not have the unrest and agitation that we had a few months ago from the members of the National Farmers Association.  This year was an exceptionally hard year as far as the farmers were concerned.  It was a time when the price of cattle, particularly the smaller and younger cattle, was at an all-time low level.  I believe farmers have gone through a very difficult time in the past year.  I hope that some of the benefits we are led to believe have been given to small farmers will eventually find their way into the pockets of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Transport and Power today speaking about the £60 million aid provided annually by the Government towards agriculture. This was also referred to by the Minister for Social Welfare last night.  I should like to ask any Deputy or any Minister in the Government what amount of that £60 million finds its way into the pockets of the farmers of this country.  I should like to warn the <Col N="2045" /> Government at this stage that in rural Ireland today the population is dying and going at a rate never before equalled in the history of the country. I come from a constituency that is largely a rural area where there are farmers, road workers, forestry workers and creamery workers.  I am also a member of a local authority.  The number of people that I have had in the past six months trying to find employment in forestry or road work is alarming.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Lands today when he would find it possible to divide two holdings in a part of my constituency among the small farmers adjoining those two farms.  In all, the acreage of the two holdings is 214.  Does it not seem ridiculous that those two holdings have been the property of the Land Commission for the past two years and that over the fence from those two holdings there are a number of small farmers who are drawing unemployment benefit.  I cannot understand for the life of me how it is that when the Land Commission acquire land they cannot set about immediately dividing it among the uneconomic holders in the area.  This, to my mind, is a way in which the standard of living of the small farmer could be improved &mdash; to divide the land and place him in a position to support his wife and family.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said here that the imminence of the local elections had a certain amount to do with the presentation of this Budget.  Knowing the Minister as I do, I am inclined to agree with that suggestion.  I believe that the Budget has conferred some benefits on old age pensioners who are, to my mind, the weakest section of the community. They have got, I am glad to say, an increase of 5/-.  I have no doubt that this increase will find its way into the pockets of the old age pensioners but the old age pensioners were misled by the Minister 12 months ago.  Every Deputy here was swamped with appeals from those old age pensioners to make representions to the Department of Social Welfare on their behalf. It was annoying to find, as I did in at least one case, an old age pensioner living in a small corrugated iron-roofed house free of rent deprived of the 5/increase. <Col N="2046" /> To my mind this pensioner was completely destitute.  I do not like quoting individual cases here but I give that as an example of the many old age pensioners who were deprived of the 5/- increase.</P>
    <P>Even though the small farmers have benefited to a certain extent there is nothing in this Budget that will ease the unfortunate housing situation.  Any member of a local authority will know that over the past 12 months or two years there has been practically a complete close down as far as the building of houses is concerned.  In the area I represent on the Cork County Council there are people and families living in shocking housing conditions.  They are sadly disappointed that there is not some extra provision made towards the building of houses in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the case of the urban ratepayer and the small shopkeeper.  I believe they are burdened and completely crushed out of existence by rates.  There is no doubt that the small shopkeeper living on the side of the street is very disappointed with this Budget.  I know of one case where a wife and her four children living on the side of the village pay £38 rates and her husband must support his family from London.  The Government have a responsibility as far as they are concerned.  I believe it is high time that something was done for people living in towns and cities particularly those small shopkeepers who have had their livelihood taken away by the introduction of the supermarkets.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Health is here.  A great problem that has confronted many members of local authorities and health authorities is the question of hospital accommodation. Many of our social welfare recipients, because the allowance provided by the State for them is not adequate to keep them in their own homes, have no alternative but to be accommodated in some institution.  I believe that the great problem today is the fact that the dependency ratio is so high in this country.  Our hospitals and institutions are full of old people.  The middle-aged people have emigrated and the <Col N="2047" /> younger people and the older people are the only people left.  Increased benefits to social welfare people would be a step in the right direction.  The present system is penny wise, pound foolish.  Coming back to the case of the small farmers, we have their problem in relation to roads.  There are many farmers who have been waiting for two years &mdash; as a matter of fact, the applications are not being accepted now in the Special Employments Office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to draw the Minister's attention to the plight of small shopkeepers and small business people.  They are in a very bad way because the livelihood of many of them has been taken away by the advent of the supermarkets.  Further, I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that when the local elections have been held, we shall not have a supplementary Budget.  This is something the people are asking down the country. It happened last year, and I hope we shall not have a repetition this year when the local elections are past.  I hope the imminence of the local elections did not have as much to do with this Budget as we are led to believe.  A Minister for Finance should come out, face the problems that confront the people and present an honest Budget, ignoring the imminence of the local elections.  The sooner we have a Minister for Finance and a Government who are prepared to tackle the problems that confront the people the better.  The sooner the better there is a realistic approach in relation to housing, water, sewerage, hospitalisation and social welfare.  I hope the local <Col N="2048" /> elections did not have an influence on the Minister.</P>

Donegal is, of course, part of that vast district which constitutes the neglected areas of this country.  It is an odd thing that the effects of this Budget will not bring any reliefs to the people of Donegal, despite the fact that they should get some relief from Fianna Fáil because they have been so consistently misled by that Party and yet have supported that Party so consistently over a long <Col N="2049" /> number of years.  One would have thought the ordinary laws of gratitude and compensation would have prevailed. But not at all.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>A good Budget is a Budget that brings solace and prosperity to the people of this country but we have had such a succession of disastrous impositions by this Government that any little glimmer of relief at all is hailed as if it were a new dawn of economic prosperity.  Five shillings for the old age pensioners.  Do you tell me that is a good Budget?  The Government had to do something, of course, to try to retrieve the betrayed trust of the many foolish old age pensioners who voted for their nominees and who last year were put under the very distinct impression, as indeed were we Members of the House, that they would get an increase of 5/- a week. Not one in 50 got the increase.  As was demonstrated here by Deputy James Tully, old age pensioners who had the fortune to own the bed, the frame of the bed on which they were lying, were deprived of the 5/-: they did not qualify because they were deemed to have an income by virtue of the fact that the bed was valued at 1/- a year. Something had to be done to correct this grotesque but essentially true image of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been done for the old age pensioners in this so-called good Budget?  Five shillings a week.  When does it start?  In August &mdash; not now, not next week, not next month, but next August if they should live so long.  Live old age pensioner and you will get the usual mean and miserable dollar.  We are told this is a good Budget and that we voted for it.  If we had not would we have been voting against giving the old age pensioner 5/a week more?  Deputy Cunningham is very <i>jejune</i> in his approach if he thinks <Col N="2050" /> that kind of interruption is to have any point, when one considers that at the moment 5/- hardly represents more than one ounce of tobacco for an old age pensioner, or a few cigarettes for a person who smokes.  So far as my recollection goes from when my acquaintance with such places was more frequent than it now is, it would not buy very much of the spirituous stuff. Will it buy a glass of decent whiskey for an old age pensioner?  Of course it will not.  How many pints will it buy, especially now after the increase in the tax on drink?  After the publicans have finished with the increase in the tax on drink, how many pints will it buy?</P>
    <P>How much will it buy in terms of bread and butter, milk, sugar, tea, and any of those things?  Five shillings! You should be ashamed of yourselves talking about 5/- and your good Budget.  I have said time and time again that any Minister for Finance should be ashamed of talking about 5/- in connection with old age pensioners.  This is something one would give away to a child.  There are some school-going children today who get more pocket money than the old age pensioners receive from this beneficent State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, this document is in its way a kind of minor work on economics.  The first criticism I want to make of it is one which I have been making on occasions such as this since I became a Member of the House, that is, the incomprehensibility <Col N="2051" /> of the terms used in many parts of the Budget Statement. Is it good enough that in matters of such great importance as we are dealing with here, which have to do with the very existence of the country, those matters should be discussed in words and phrases that are Greek &mdash; aye, even less understandable than Greek &mdash;to the average man in the street?</P>
      <P>The first quarter of this document consists of extensive dilations upon all kinds of things such as capital expenditure &mdash; a phrase which is readily understandable to most, I assume&mdash; and it goes on into a kind of labyrinthine jungle of terms used by economists. It often strikes me that they invented a language whose sole purpose is to baffle, bemuse and bewilder the common people of the country. Within these thickets of prose which few understand, one will find the odd phrase appealing to the workers to work harder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In common English, of course.  That message must be got across: &ldquo;You are not doing enough&rdquo;. It does not matter about the Gresham Hotel and Taca with which I will deal at some length, not perhaps tonight, but which I intend to deal with on another occasion.  The idea is: &ldquo;Let us fasten on the workers because they are so obvious to everyone.&rdquo; When the workers stop work and there is a strike, they become the butt of lectures, sermons, abuse and some condemnation.  At all times they are made out to be the villains of every industrial piece.  Of course, this is all a device used by the Government and by those who support them, by the Establishment or those who might be generically described as the Irish Establishment, this new sector of our society which consists of monopoly patriots.  Other countries have monopoly capitalists but we have monopoly patriots.  Indeed, monopoly capitalism very often has its origins in what is called the right of inheritance and we have got monopoly patriotism by this so-called right of inheritance. I remember some years ago hearing <Col N="2052" /> of an old farmer who went to a solicitor to make his will in a small rural town.  The solicitor asked: &ldquo;What do you want to do with your property?&rdquo;&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I will leave the land to the eldest, and I will leave the stock to the daughter, and I will leave my Dáil seat to the youngest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have this situation and no reference at all is made by Government spokesmen to the responsibility for the economic conditions of this country which rests primarily upon those who control the organs of production, upon those who control credit and upon those who control wealth.  The people who control those three elements are most definitely and assuredly not the workers.  They are easily identifiable and can be described as the Establishment, as I have described them.  They court the Government.  At the moment they court Fianna Fáil and I am quite certain they would court any other Government.  They are encouraged by Fianna Fáil.  They are given authority, position, power and, indeed, it can be said that Fianna Fáil are now the mouthpieces of this element in our society.  They are the mouthpiece of the element who control the wealth and the sources of production.  Upon that section of our society, the Establishment, consisting of the Government and the people I have described, must rest the responsibility of seeing that we have a country which is fit for people to live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, this Budget does not have the impact of the bite of a horsefly on the essential and fundamental problems which face this nation.  It is based upon the concept that there must always be people who can exploit the masses and the rest of the people, that God ordained it so.  We dispute that. We do not think it is any ordinance of Divine Providence that there must always be those who are trodden upon, those who are treated in the manner in which, for instance, the old age pensioner is treated and the manner in which a person on a very low fixed income is treated, the manner in which the underpaid worker is treated or, indeed, the small farmer about whom we have heard a great deal over the <Col N="2053" /> past 12 months or so.  We do not think it right that that situation should continue to exist.  We think it exists because this Government, as this Budget clearly demonstrates, accept the proposition that a society which is described by economists as <i>laissez faire</i> is the proper kind of society for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It was not for this kind of Budget that so much effort and toil was exercised by the people of this nation over the years that have gone by.  It may very well be said that we have made some progress but it is progress which has come our way by dint of international economic forces and largely by accident.  I remember, some years ago, trying to figure out in my own crude, unlettered way how it was that there seemed to be such a surplus of money in the country.  There did not appear to be any great development of industrial activity.  Unemployment seemed to be increasing, as it is now. The only answer I could find was that we were enjoying the overspill of European prosperity which was apparent at the time.  I think that is the situation in which we have been living and have been fooling ourselves.  Anybody who has thought otherwise has been fooling himself.</P>
    <P>The first piece of folly which came to our notice &mdash; I claim, with all due modesty, to be the first person to draw to the notice of this House that it was a piece of folly &mdash; was that tale of mystery and imagination, the First Programme for Economic Expansion, followed, of course, by the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  At that time, the Government produced a document which, it was claimed, had inherent in it the answers to all the economic problems we were facing. Not many people read the document, any more than many people read the Second Programme for Economic Expansion or read the Report on Full Employment or the NIEC reports.  I wonder how many have read this document which we got this week, the White Paper on European Communities?  I know well&mdash;nobody knows it better&mdash; that the Members of this House are given scarcely enough time to read their letters, let alone to read weighty <Col N="2054" /> documents of this kind.  It is a matter to which I hope some enlightened administration in the future will give some attention.  This House is a legislative organ but it is not, in fact, to any great degree, much more than a letter-writing academy.</P>
    <P>This document has a bearing upon the Budget.  It describes the conditions upon which the Common Market operates.  I have not had a chance to go through it.  I doubt, if I had a chance, that I should be able fully to absorb all that is in it, being as limited as anybody else in Dáil Éireann in matters of this kind.  I doubt very much if there are many in the country who can speak with authority on many aspects of it, either.  It is in this euphoric condition of economic ignorance that we have been proceeding&mdash; wishful thought.  Wishing should be the theme song of this Government &mdash; do you remember the song <i>Wishing</i>?&mdash; because that is all they have indulged in.</P>
    <P>There has been no plan.  Not alone has there been no plan but they have made a kind of a boast of the fact that they have no plan.  It is to be found in several of the documents which I had to peruse &mdash; not an enjoyable recreation at any time.  I found several statements both by NIEC and the Government that in no circumstances was the particular document&mdash; whether it was an NIEC report or the Report on Full Employment &mdash; to be regarded as a plan.  The Government are completely planless, which brings me back to a thought that, some years ago, the former Taoiseach, who is nothing if not an able politician &mdash; he has possibly one of the most acute political brains we have had in this country: there is nobody with whom I could ever compare him for political ability apart from the late Deputy Norton: he has an antenna for the way political winds are blowing&mdash; talked about going to the left. How many remember that?  Why, I remember a time when the mention of that phrase would be used to summon the mob and to secure that you were thrown over O'Connell Bridge into the Liffey.  Any such things as a planned society would be regarded as synonymous <Col N="2055" /> with charging down a street in Barcelona, torch in hand, intent upon setting fire to the nearest sacred edifice.  We are talking about these things now.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which cannot be stopped, which cannot be prevented, that is, the advance of enlightenment. Thanks be to God that the advance of knowledge is something that cannot be stopped.  People's minds will be inquisitive. They will inquire, read, find out and begin to make up their own minds.  Of course, as time has gone by, it has been perfectly obvious to those of us who have lived over the past 25 to 30 years that there has been a great advance in the thinking of young people, particularly.  People have taken to a re-examination of old shibboleths and have thrown them aside.  They have taken to a re-assessment of Irish history, which is a very necessary thing, let me tell you, and, as time goes on, it will become more able and analytical and, as it does, there will be some queer tales to be told.</P>
    <P>However, this has been happening and, to relate it to what I was saying about the former Taoiseach, I would suggest that the former Taoiseach sensed this and felt he must make some gesture towards this new idea and, in his best rousing and rasping manner, he announced a quick left turn, but there was no left turn.  If anything, the turn was in the other direction.  The result of it all now is that we have a Government in power who, to some extent, claim to have the youngest Cabinet in Europe, though one would not think so by the activities of some of them.  Without wishing to be unkind, I sometimes fear that I can discern symptoms of premature senility in a number of the members of the Government.  Be that as it may, one has to be charitable and not mention too many names, as my learned colleague from my constituency would say.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons spoke tonight.  Let me say, in passing, that he makes an excellent speech.  He had it to say that democracy gives us the right to decide what kind of socialism we shall have <Col N="2056" /> for the future.  There was in that a great deal of truth.  It certainly shows that at least one member of the Fianna Fáil Party is thinking about what the facts of life are in the modern world in which we live.  Whether you like it or not, that is the road upon which the sophisticated kind of societies which have developed in Western Europe are being forced.  Poor James Connolly and James Larkin, God rest them, were branded as anti-Christ when they talked about that.</P>
    <P>However, to get back to the Budget, because I do not want to impose on the patience of the Chair, I should like to talk about the facility with which the various proposals were placed before the House.  First of all, the increase of 5/- which I have sufficiently categorised for what it is, a thing of no account: I do not think there will be many members of the Fianna Fáil Party, though there may be some, who will have the hardihood to write to old age pensioners whom they know to tell them about this 5/- increase and explain the details to them.  I received from County Kilkenny a postcard which tells its own tale.  It is outside my constituency but then that may be explicable, too.  It is an anonymous card and says:</P>
    <P>Would you inquire by question are there any relief from the means test, any modification, for non-contributors, in this Budget?</P>
    <P>It is signed &ldquo;A Pensioner&rdquo;.  The Minister can answer that if he wishes.  There are not any, of course.</P>
    <P>This is a card which was written by an old age pensioner, addressed from Kilkenny and posted in Waterford city. Why was it anonymous?  It was because that person was afraid that if he signed his name to it, the investigation officer would come after him and take from him the few miserable shillings he has.  Everybody who deals with old age pensioners knows that what I am saying is the truth.  The great fear existing in the minds of old age pensioners is the fear of losing the few shillings which stand between them and the cemetery&mdash;it used be the workhouse but now it is the cemetery; the workhouse has been removed to shorten the journey.  That is the fear <Col N="2057" /> that exists in the minds of old age pensioners, the really down-trodden people, the oft-rejected by their own in the cruel way of the world, the unwanted waiting for death.  That is the legacy this administration has bequeathed to the old age pensioner.</P>
    <P>A government with a true acceptance of their responsibility to the aged, even if they were in such a tight trap financially that they could not pay more than a small amount by way of pension, could at least take some of these investigators by the neck and say to them: &ldquo;Look, you are dealing with the real people of this country and anything you have to eat, anything you are wearing, you owe to them.  The house you are living in was built by those people with their sweat and their blood and many of them died from exposure and as a result of their efforts to do so, and treat them with some degree of humanity&rdquo;.  They are not treated with humanity.  That is what is to be learned from that card.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance, whom I do not regard by any means as an ogre, although he has been so depicted by certain sections of our population in the past, to give his attention to the manner in which the payment of this 5/- increase will be administered.  I recall during the days of the inter-Party Government&mdash; and here again the passage of time and a sense of enlightenment is going to bring a light of reality, and is already beginning to do so, as to the achievements of those years&mdash;a Labour Minister instructing those in his Department to administer the law with humanity.  He said that the law was made for use by the people, that God did not create people simply to make them amenable to what is written down in statute books, that the law was a mechanism to secure modes of behaviour and above all, and in all things there should be humanity.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to apply the same attitude and in so far as it is possible for him to do so to try to inject a similar feeling into some of the members of his Cabinet.  With some it would be utterly hopeless: time will deal with them, as it inevitably does. <Col N="2058" /> It might be possible for him to impress upon those who have not completely lost touch the need to deal with the aged and with what are described in that cold phrase &ldquo;the social welfare classes&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which I hate to use &mdash;not always in strict accordance with the letter of the law but rather in accordance with its spirit.</P>
    <P>The whole economic picture has been touched upon by the Minister in his very lengthy Budget speech.  It is true that most people who understand the problem, those to whom I have been talking&mdash;and as one who only meets the scholars, I have to take their word for it&mdash;say that increased production is one of the basic needs if we are to secure a higher standard of living. There can be no dispute about that; there can be dispute about how the fruits of production are to be divided. This is the essential question.  Is it to be thought that all the energies of this nation are to be harnessed and speeded up simply for the greater glory of the Establishment to which I referred earlier?  If it is, I am opting out from participating in that idea.</P>
    <P>We have never achieved in Ireland a situation in which it could be said that the workers are receiving a just wage.  We may have been in the position, and possibly are, of saying that that would be true in relation to some isolated sections of particular operatives but at this moment the average earnings, including overtime earnings, of an industrial worker, for instance, are £12 per week.  This is not a propagandist guess; it is a cold, factual figure produced by the agencies which are established to discover such things. I do not think anybody will argue that is sufficient.  That is extravagant of me because there are some who will argue that it is enough; I know there are some who would argue that even half that would be too much for workers.  I know that mentality is represented but, thank God, only to a very minute degree, even in this House.  But £12 per week to the ordinary person in itself is a demonstration of the inadequacy of the social system under which we live.</P>
    <P>The whole trend of population referred <Col N="2059" /> to in the Budget seems to be inexorably citywards.  Certainly, there is an apparently frantic urge upon great numbers of people to get as far away as they can from the land of Ireland.  This is not entirely a peculiarly national problem; it seems to be found in most countries.  I suppose it is difficult to expect that young people, their imaginations fired by adolescents and by stories of the bright lights and the better life beyond the hills, will not gravitate towards the cities and towns, but it is undesirable, because in the heel of the hunt, as we all know, such people when they do leave the land and go to work elsewhere in the towns and, as happens in this country, to work in the large cities of England, experience the disillusion with that kind of life and the frustrations it brings and inevitably they come back to their origins.  They want to come home and live in the countryside.</P>
    <P>How far Government policy can affect what seems to be a natural process is debatable but there is an obligation on the Government to encourage people to remain on the land.  Is encouragement being given by this Budget?  I do not think so.  Such things as a fractional remission of rates is not, in my view, to be represented as a serious contribution to this grave problem.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in another place&mdash;and Deputies will be familiar with this fact &mdash;that since 1926, one million people have left Ireland and that at a time when the inducements to go were not, perhaps, as great as they are now.  It seems that with the development of technology and improvement of living standards in the cities, the temptation to young people to leave the rural areas will increase rather than otherwise and that position being as it is, there devolves upon the Government of the day a very grave responsibility to ensure that the country will not fall a victim to the fate which now seems so obviously to be staring us in the face, that is, nothing more or less than a vast pasturage, with here and there a large conurbation.</P>
    <P>This particular concern is a grave <Col N="2060" /> one, made all the more grave by the imminence of the Common Market. The Common Market has been widely advertised here as a great opportunity for us to develop, as something in fact if one were to believe all the encomiums about it, that will bring a golden age&mdash;to use a phrase used by the Minister for Finance in another context when he said that the Irish economy was entering upon a new golden age.  This is the kind of prospect the Common Market is represented as being to us.  Of course, there is no certainty that this is so at all.  Farmers have been told, and I think by people who have not really given much thought to the problem, that no matter whose lot is improved, they will be better off, that this is a great chance for the farmers.</P>
    <P>Reading this document, the White Paper, which we have not yet had time to masticate, let alone digest, Members will see that the Common Market can mean quite the reverse for the Irish farmer.  Instead of prosperity, there appears to be in it evidence of a positive danger to the agricultural community. Bad and all as we are, we might be worse off.  For instance, it is provided, I understand, under one of the regulations of the Treaty of Rome, as interpreted by the Commission, which is, in turn, an organ of the Council of Ministers&mdash;one would nearly need a map to follow the ramifications of organisation that exist in regard to this body and the maze of complexities which it implies, so far as the manner in which they handle various economic problems is concerned&mdash;that aids to agricultural production relating to acreage, prices, quantities and so on would be regarded as incompatible with the organisation of the Common Market and should therefore be automatically prohibited.</P>
    <P>In other words, guaranteed prices which farmers now&mdash;I shall not say enjoy&mdash;have, might very well disappear and the produce of their toil could have to go into this vast market in competition with the produce of farmers from other countries which have had nine years of membership of the Common Market already and nine years' experience <Col N="2061" /> of intense competition, which, naturally, in order to exist in that time, has made them sharpen their methods as well as their wits.  The Irish agricultural community going as it were red raw into such a situation need not, and should not, be misled into an absolute confidence that the day the Common Market becomes a reality their condition will be made immensely prosperous. It is by no means certain.</P>
    <P>So far as the industrial community are concerned the facts are there.  They speak for themselves.  We have the example of the motor industry.  This industry, as we know, employs some 3,000 to 4,000 people.  It is said that with the disappearance of the tariffs those 3,000 to 4,000 people will no longer find work in the motor assembly industry because the cars will be driven off the boats on to the streets and up to the taxation office.  The statements after dinner in various hostelries up and down the country made by the Government indicate that there will be arrangements for retraining and redundancy. I want to ask what has been done up to now regarding this?  As far as we can see nothing has been done at all.  There has been a lot of talk and no action.</P>
    <P>The Budget Statement makes reference to the European Economic Community, commonly known as the Common Market.  That is why I avail of the opportunity to make those references of mine.  On page 59 of the Budget Statement the Minister for Finance had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Government regard competition as the most effective way of guarding against excessive profit margins.</P>
    <P>I think the last man to give expression to that was probably Gladstone because it represents the kind of mentality which dates from that age.  One would have thought that the notion that free competition would bring a natural balance was long dispelled from the minds of rational men.  That does not seem to be the case so far as members of this Government are concerned.  The point I want to make above all in my remarks is that in the Budget the <Col N="2062" /> Cabinet show no appreciation whatsoever of the fact that unless we make immediate preparations for a planned economy we run dangers which are truly incalculable.  We run the danger of going into a highly sophisticated and highly organised cartelised Europe.</P>
    <P>We seem to be only talking about making the beginnings of preparations. This is not good enough.  This occasion should have been availed of by the Minister to announce concrete steps to prepare the nation for what is ahead of us.  Surely the obligation is on the Government to do this.  It may be said that the Common Market was not an issue and has not been an issue at elections. That is beside the point.  The Common Market will dominate the lives, as far as we can see, of those of us who are now on the earth and if we are not equipped to survive it is just too bad.  What the Redcoats did in days gone by will be as nothing to what the effect of free trade will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of attitude we adopt&mdash;a Castlebar sort of ballad.  We will need to meet the situation not by singing ballads and harking back but by plenty of hard work. We will have to put our minds to what is needed.  We have not a mind in Government because it is not a Government who believe in a planned economy.  They believe in loose talk, what should be, what might be and what is going to happen in the future but no positive blueprint as to what is to be done to harness the country to meet the harsh reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have touched on something which I do not think I could touch on too often, either here or elsewhere.  I appeal to Deputies to tell their people the need for communication, the need for the people to understand, to give them the chance of understanding what is going on in the economy of the country, what the country is facing, the need to strip the problem of all this confusing verbiage and to present the facts simply, the need for a massive campaign to inform the public in <Col N="2063" /> relation to the economy of the country. We should present the facts to them as far as we can in relation to the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also in his Budget speech touched on the question of an incomes policy.  In any society which lays claim to be dedicated to the ideal of justice for all an incomes policy, that is a policy which consists of a formula which in turn predetermines a method whereby the incomes of various sectors of society are related, is an absolutely essential thing.  It is not an easy thing to achieve. I do not know if it has been achieved in any country in the world.  I have failed to find any country where it has been achieved.  It is an end which must be striven towards.  It is unreasonable to think that those engaged in the hard grind of industry&mdash;need I add those are the workers, whether they be in the fields, the workshop floors, the streets, transport or offices&mdash;it is unreasonable to think that this huge mass of people will undertake greater and greater burdens, just for the sake of carrying the load. There must be, in commonsense, the promise of greater reward.  In the past it had been the great sin of the capitalist system, as we have known it, and indeed whatever was before the capitalist system and every system we have known up to now.  No doubt this applies to other systems&mdash;authoritarian and dictatorial&mdash;in such Communist countries where bureaucracy seems to be the only answer they have to the problems.  In every country this question has been at the very nub of the problem of human degradation and the struggle for human uplifting.</P>
    <P>An incomes policy is not inviting in its title but it is something to which more than lip service is due.  I do not feel confident that we have reached a stage of analysis of our economic situation which would enable us to say, for instance, next week what the relationship should be as between the fruits of the labour of one section of the people or another.  I realise full well that it will take a lot of time to reach <Col N="2064" /> that condition of things.  But I do say it is essential that that should remain in the forefront of our minds and that every effort should be made by whatever means are available to us to secure that end.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget speech also referred to the question of banking legislation.  I hope this gives me an opportunity of coming to a very important aspect concerning the basis of our economic plight.  Is it good enough, I wonder&mdash;indeed, I do not wonder; I merely ask the question in a rhetorical sense because my mind is made up on it&mdash;that the resources of a nation, which are needed for the development of the country and for the welfare of the people, should be placed, as it were, at the complete disposal of a small group of people who, however well intentioned they may be, must none the less be motivated, not by the things which concern a parliament but by the idea of making the maximum amount of profit they possibly can by way of interest on deposit?  Is it just that in so doing, they can restrict credit, that they can bring considerable hardship on many people in the community by such restriction of credit?</P>
    <P>I know that in theory there is a Central Bank which is said to lay down policy guidelines in a very general and vague way in matters of this kind; but I am not talking about that aspect, that relatively minor aspect, of the problem.  I am talking about the need of a Government to be able to call upon credit, and the right of the Government in the name of the people to be able to call on credit.  By that, I mean money and its use in the interests of the people at any time.  We have not yet, apparently, accepted that principle here.  The common good is not yet triumphant in Ireland.  The common good is something subscribed to by writers very often in flowery prose, and, indeed, poems are written about the rights of the ordinary people, but the basic essential, the control of credit, for instance, is not one that is accepted in this country as yet as being a desirable governmental activity.</P>
    <P>In many other countries it is.  We in the Labour Party feel, and I feel, <Col N="2065" /> that it has been touched upon slightly in this Budget.  I want to take the opportunity of saying that no policy of any Government can be fully effective in tackling problems which beset the country until this problem is tackled adequately and until the common good, the good of the greatest number, is made the measuring stick by which credit, and the issue of credit, are determined.</P>
    <P>The Minister also touched on the possibility of the decimalisation of currency.  This might seem a minor matter to many, but a change of methods of exchange is of very considerable importance, as we have seen from its progress in Britain.  It is another example, of course, of the fact that there has been a complete recanting of the Fianna Fáil dogma that we could go it alone and that it did not matter what Britain did, that we were a nation completely independent of her.  Years have shown that there is a degree of economic interdependence between these two islands which at times calls into question, amongst those who think about it, political activities over the last century or more.  Notions and ideologies which were adumbrated as eternal verities and absolute truths have been pronounced as so much air.</P>
    <P>It was thought by many of us&mdash; I thought so when I was a chap and before I got sense&mdash;that if we were left to ourselves alone &mdash; sinn féin amháin &mdash; we would not have to bother about what went on in the outside world and that we could live on what we produced ourselves. Poor Arthur Griffith believed it and many others as well.  Has it not been shown that this was &mdash; to put it mildly &mdash; a complete misconception?  Mind you, it is a pity it is so because, when one loses these illusions, one loses a great deal of one's life and youth. Those of us who did not make too much of a boast of our love for country and about our republicanism were those of us who, when we did open our mouths about it, were speedily put into a place of seclusion and nobody listened to us anyway. But the principal advocates of separation <Col N="2066" /> at one time were the founding fathers of Fianna Fáil and has the wheel not swung the full circle when they, voluntarily, went over last year &mdash;or was it the year before&mdash;and surrendered the shreds of our economic independence in Downing Street?</P>
    <P>Decimilisation of currency is just another step along that road, an inevitable step, it would appear.  The Minister has said he proposes to take steps, next year, to begin examination of the position in relation to that matter.  I hope, when the day comes that the currency is changed &mdash; I merely say this as an aside &mdash; some greater artistic talent and thought will be given to whatever is depicted on the face of the currency than we see on the existing currency.</P>
    <P>Despite all the warnings contained in the NIEC examination of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion &mdash;and I hate to use the term, because it is really a piece of bluff, a colossal piece of impertinence and bluff and only for use at chapel gates, perhaps, as I mentioned before &mdash; the Minister said in his Budget speech that the outlook is promising.  He is a very agile young man and is not to be blamed, I suppose, for making the best of a bad job.  He has gone through his own share of suffering in recent times and one does not want to be too hard on him; but I would ask him not to impose too much on us by saying that the outlook is promising.  The only promise existing in this country are the promises of politicians preparing for local elections: I would emphasise, Government politicians &mdash; and we know what validity they have.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back on things past, because it is a cruel and, indeed, pointless exercies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no mention here of drainage of the Shannon, not a word, and I assure the Chair I shall not pursue it but, to say that the outlook is promising at this stage in our lack of development, is imposing on the people, and nothing less, because this tale of mystery and imagination, the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, estimated there would be <Col N="2067" /> an increase of something like 7,000 jobs per year.  In fact, there has been a re-estimation and the figure has been reduced.  In practice, of course, it was found that this was complete distortion and the actual figure of the number of new jobs provided was merely a fraction of that 7,000.</P>
      <P>The green-covered document called &ldquo;Report on Full Employment&rdquo;&mdash; and green, you know, with a significance for the readers, I suppose: to symbolise the readership &mdash; says that to attain full employment by 1980 &mdash; which is a long time away&mdash;we must have 11,500 new jobs created per year.  The NIEC Report, which examined the second programme of mystery and imagination says that the most we can hope for this year is 1,000 more employed.  What reality is there, then, in talking of full employment, because there is a certain amount of special pleading in all these documents which go out; they do endeavour to create &mdash; despite the fact that the membership of the NIEC is representative of a number of different interests in the country &mdash; the impression that this is the Government speaking. It is an impression which should be dispelled.  Very often, where criticism might usefully be made by the NIEC, as a body independent of the Government, it is not made, quite apart from the kind of language used, the confusing language to which I referred.  New jobs then, this year, according to the experts, will not exceed 1,000 and the Minister for Finance says the outlook, in the face of that, is promising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side, even if these 1,000 news jobs do appear from somewhere or other &mdash; and there is no guarantee they will &mdash; there will be the vast annual emigration, which will reduce still further the number of people in employment. There will, it appears be&mdash; and I am not hoping this will happen; I am dreading that it will happen &mdash; the unemployment created by the full impact of the Free Trade Agreement and by the steps which may be taken by Irish industry, a great deal of which considers, as far as I can see, that the only way you can secure greater efficiency is by creating unemployment, and that the only way you can secure <Col N="2068" /> greater production is by sacking one man and making the other fellow do his own work and that of the man who has been sacked.  That does not apply to all industries, however.  We have had in one semi-State Body possibly one of the most progressive and enlightened industrial brains to be found anywhere in Europe.  I refer, unashamedly, to General Costello.</P>
    <P>But there is that mentality abroad. It stems from the years of protection, when these so-called industrialists were the darlings of the Fianna Fáil Party, when they were performing the functions which the younger guard are now placing on the shoulders of the new <i>cosa nostra,</i>&ldquo;our thing&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance had the hardihood to suggest that the outlook for 1967 is promising.  He goes on to say on page 7 of his Budget Statement:</P>
      <P>On the external front, the Free Trade Area Agreement will assist the expansion of exports, no longer impeded by the British import surcharge.</P>
      <P>I suppose you cannot blame him for trying but that is an effort to retrieve what, to my mind, is an impossible situation.  Far from assisting the expansion of exports, the likelihood is that this country will see a great importation of goods produced from across the water more cheaply than we could produce them here, to the detriment of employment here and to the detriment of the national economy. I would suggest that is a far more realistic appreciation of what the Free Trade Area Agreement connotes than this kind of airy-fairy wishful thinking the Minister goes on with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> This step taken by the Government of dropping tariffs at this particular moment in time leaves us with little choice but to go into the Common Market.  There are those who argue that membership of the Common Market for Ireland need not be an inevitable step.  But it does seem to me we are not left with any other alternative, although some people make the argument that even if Britain is in, we need not necessarily go in.  But there is not much realism in that because of the extent to which we are tied to the British economy.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the cumann meetings.  They would believe anything. The ex-Taoiseach is not in the House, so we will not go into what he said at that time.  In any event, it does not seem we are left with any alternative but to go along, as I was saying when I was interrupted by my distinguished colleague.  The newspapers today reported very considerable support for the British efforts to join the EEC by the continental trade union movement, which is a powerful element, although they expressed at the same time concern about Common Market arrangements as they affect labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reading some of the literature we get in our letterboxes concerning the Common Market.  One of their productions indicates, perhaps not intentionally, that the provisions for the treatment of workers in the Common Market are nothing like what we might imagine them to be.  The amount set aside in respect of redundancy and matters of that kind represents only a fraction of the amount which might be necessary.  This is merely something I have read but it suggests to me some confirmation from what has been stated elsewhere &mdash; that far from the Common Market objective being the general improvement of the living standards of <Col N="2070" /> the 280,000,000 in Europe, its real objective is the establishment of a massive market to enable the great continental cartels to dispose in the most widespread possible way of their products, notably the cartels which exist in Germany and France.  I am not in a position to judge that.  I am not going to say whether it is right or wrong.  There may be people in this country who are, and their comments on it would be very welcome.  I only mention that the Common Market people in their own publication indicated, from my reading of it anyway, that things were far from right so far as the social activity of the Commission, as they call it, is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that Irish manufacturing industry unit wage costs went up by seven per cent compared with a rise of about five per cent in the United Kingdom. This comparison with the United Kingdom is again a spurious one.  I remember looking at a discussion on Telefís Éireann in which a large number of people in the studio were talking about the green-covered document on full employment. One of the professors there talked about wages here being higher than in Britain.  But it so happened there was in the audience a tradesman home on holidays from Britain, who was able to say that was not so.  He said: &ldquo;I can go to work in England and make sufficient there to send home to keep my family here.  I make much more in England than I do here.  The wages are much higher in England.&rdquo;  This was a man actually doing it.</P>
    <P>I want to relate that to what appears on page 8 of the Budget Statement where the Minister said that unit wage costs in Irish manufacturing industry were up by seven per cent compared with a rise of about five per cent in the United Kingdom.  Thinking in terms of what that young man had to say, it means simply that a five per cent rise for an English worker represented much more in actual pounds, shillings and pence than the seven per cent rise the Minister complained about as far as the Irish worker is concerned.  There we see another instance of special pleading and the fallacy of figures.  The <Col N="2071" /> employment of percentages in the matter of wage negotiations has long struck me as being a device with only one purpose &mdash; to keep down the remuneration of the mass of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers on page 23 to market outlets as offering considerable prospects for Irish industry and producers &mdash; market outlets secured by the Minister as a result of trade agreements. We had the example of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Can anyone tell us what market outlets it provides which help industry in this country? Has the reverse not been the case? Quite apart from what arguments may be made in its favour, has it not proved to have been harmful to the economy? Was it not stated the farmers would benefit greatly before the end of the year?  In fact, they did not.  I hope to have an opportunity of expanding at some further length on this Budget tomorrow. I feel far more credit has been taken by the Minister and the Government for what it contains than is their due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt compelled to raise the subject matter of Question 69 in my name on today's Order Paper by reason of the unsatisfactory, disdainful and irresponsible manner in which the Minister dealt with this question today.  I have been forced to advert to the scandal of the dispensary system in my constituency on a number of occasions, with particular reference to the appalling condition of many of these dispensaries.  The question is of very great interest to a large number of my constituents who are obliged to go to these places many times per week to meet their doctor and have medical attention. They are, of course, in the main, medical card holders who have not the means to avail of private practitioner services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These dispensaries present an appalling picture of dilapidation and virtual ruin in many instances.  Our <Col N="2072" /> health officers have condemned as unfit for human habitation very many dwellings far superior to these premises. Many of these dispensaries are in old houses, houses which were condemned a number of years ago.  These old houses are small and dingy.  They are an eyesore from outside, and are a subject of concern to all those who are interested in the appearance of our towns and villages, especially those engaged in the tidy towns endeavours.  The inside of the dispensaries will be found to be completely unsuited to modern requirements. They present an appearance of absolute neglect.  These dispensaries have not had a hand's turn done to them for a long number of years: no repairs, no painting, no improvements of any kind have been carried out. They do not provide even the minimum of comfort or privacy to the unfortunate people who are obliged to go there.</P>
    <P>These premises are used for many purposes.  They are used by our dispensary doctors and local nurses.  They are also used as places where people collect their home assistance.  Therefore, the matter of privacy is allimportant. There is no privacy for a patient to meet his doctor or for a person facing an interrogation by a home assistance officer.  The ordinary decencies of life simply cannot be observed in these circumstances.  The privacy between doctor and patient cannot be observed, and it is particularly uncalled for that the very poor and the destitute who have to go to these places to seek home assistance are obliged to bare their hearts and reveal the innermost secrets of their lives within the hearing of all those other people who congregate in these dingy rooms.  May I say that home assistance officers are not renowned for their beside manner, and it is often one hears the argument going on between the home assistance officer and the person being interrogated? This is not at all satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Many of the premises to which I refer do not have a seat for a patient: others do not even have a hallway where people can stand.  In many cases the people are obliged to queue up <Col N="2073" /> outside, irrespective of their health condition or the inclemency of the weather prevailing at the time.  This is the kind of suffering endured by many of my constituents in South Tipperary and West Waterford.  This is the predicament of the people of Ardfinnan, Ballingarry, Kilsheelan, Ahenny and many other places.</P>
    <P>The blame for this situation rests solely on the Minister for Health.  The blame cannot be attached to the members of the health authority or the manager.  The health authority I represent, South Tipperary, had plans made for the erection of a number of new dispensaries, particularly at Kilsheelan, Ballingarry and Ardfinnan.  These plans were at the final stage and had been approved by the Minister for Health. In the case of Kilsheelan, the contract for the erection of a new dispensary and doctor's residence had been placed in the hands of a contractor, whom I know personally.  Other proposals were well in hand for the renovation and repair of other dispensaries.</P>
    <P>All this important work was suspended in mid-air by reason of the implementation of the White Paper on the Health Services.  County managers, as much as members of the Fianna Fáil Party and other gullible people, accepted the White Paper on the Health Services, issued in January, 1966, as the Bible and something which was going to be implemented within a reasonable time, having particular regard to the fact that this White Paper adumbrated a choice of doctor for our people, which would involve the abolition of the archaic and outmoded dispensary system as we knew it.  The managers and the health authorities are not altogether to be blamed for their action in terminating this important work.  They had the strict instructions of the Department of Health in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record in his reply on his Estimate this year, in reference to my complaint in relation to this matter, that the Department of Health had advised the health authority of the South Tipperary County Council not to proceed with the erection of this new dispensary in the light of what was proposed in the White Paper.  It was <Col N="2074" /> for that reason this important work stopped.  That was some two years ago.  One can readily understand the very bad state of these dispensaries when one remembers that they had been condemned for a number of years and that new buildings had been approved.  One can easily appreciate the deterioration that has taken place in these buildings in the interval.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes credit for the fact that, instead of erecting a new dispensary at Ardfinnan, steps are being taken to provide alternative accommodation. Neither the Minister nor the County Manager can take any credit in this respect.  My colleagues and I were obliged to invoke section 4 of the County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, in order to direct the manager to proceed with the erection of a new dispensary at Ardfinnan.  That is how that came about.  That motion was passed by a large majority of the members of South Tipperary County Council but the manager stated that, even though the motion had been passed, he could not act on it because money would have to be provided first. Again, I was compelled to invoke section 4 in order that the necessary money would be provided to enable the manager to proceed with the erection of the dispensary at Ardfinnan. The manager informed the chair that the motion was out of order because it was a function of the members to provide money, as if I were putting this motion before some outside body and not before my own local authority.  It was hoped the money for this project would be provided in the estimates this year.</P>
    <P>It was not provided and could not be provided because of the very high rate burden.  It is that situation we have now to contend with and my question today asked for clarification of the whole position.  If we are going to have a choice of doctor then, please, let us know when so that those who are afflicted at present may struggle on, with a little more patience and endurance. On the other hand, there is talk as to whether it is feasible and practicable to give a choice of doctor in certain areas, particularly isolated, remote rural areas, such as Ballingarry. <Col N="2075" /> Perhaps Ardfinnan might be included in such a scheme and likewise Kilsheelan, Ahenny and these other places to which I have referred.  If we cannot provide a choice of doctor in these areas there is a moral obligation on the Minister to see to it that adequate dispensary facilities are provided.  It is no wonder we cannot get doctors in our county at the moment.  The post in Ballingarry has been vacant since 1955.  Where one cannot get even one doctor it is scarcely likely that one will get two, so that there can be no question of a choice.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department must now make up their minds with regard to the erection of a new dispensary at Ballingarry in the clear knowledge that over the next few years it will certainly be impossible to provide for a choice of doctor.  In the case of Kilsheelan it was intended to provide not merely a dispensary but a doctor's residence as well.  This is an area in which we find it very difficult to secure a dispensary doctor. There has been, as the Minister and his Department know, a great interchange of doctors there.  One of the reasons for that is that doctors cannot find adequate housing accommodation. Indeed, one doctor lived there for some time in a caravan. Because of the proposition adumbrated in the White Paper the people of Kilsheelan have been denied a new dispensary and a proper residence for a doctor.  That important area is now being served by a doctor from Clonmel.  A similar position obtains in regard to Ballingarry.  These doctors are over-burdened because of the number of patients they have to serve.</P>

      <P>It is.  I resent deeply the attitude adopted by the Minister towards my questions on today's Order Paper.  These questions were not tabled lightly.  It was only after every endeavour had failed that I decided to raise the matter in the House by way of question.  No Minister should deal with questions in the disdainful, brash manner in which the Minister <Col N="2076" /> deal with my questions.  Ministers have a responsibilities and the Minister had a responsibility for these unfortunate people obliged to attend these unsuitable premises every week in order to get medical attention or home assistance.  It is not good enough for the Minister to hide behind a White Paper.  We want to know when the proposals in the White Paper will be implemented.  In the introduction to the White Paper there is an indication of how many years it may take to resolve this problem.  It is pertinent to point out that the changes suggested are both complex and costly.  That alone rules out any question of their implemention in the near future.  That being the case, the Minister must ensure adequate conditions for those involved.</P>
      <P>I regret I have been slightly carried away by the unfairness of the position. I had hoped to allow my colleague, Deputy Hogan, to make some observations on the matter, he being a man with high medical degrees and a member of the same authority.  I apologise to Deputy Hogan for allowing myself to be carried away.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister, I understand, has not departed from the principle in the White Paper with regard to free choice of doctor.  As I understand it, he will introduce this free choice when economic conditions permit.  There is a genuine grievance in having dispensaries left vacant and I would make three suggestions now to the Minister.  His predecessor suspended the appointment of dispensary doctors.  If there is to be a long interval before the introduction of free choice, then the Minister might introduce a system of short-term appointments; I would suggest three to five years in urban areas, seven years in rural areas, and permanent appointments, even now, in isolated areas <Col N="2077" /> in which it is obvious men will have to be paid to go in anyway.</P>
      <P>As regards building of dispensaries which has also been suspended by the county managers, I would suggest (a) leasing, where possible and (b) building in isolated areas, again where it is obvious a doctor must always be paid to stay.  Repairs have in some cases been deferred.  I think this is incorrect.  We should carry out essential repairs so as to provide reasonable comfort and privacy for patients attending dispensaries and also to ensure that, as part of our housing property, they will be preserved.  Those are my three suggestions to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to Deputy Hogan for his brief and very helpful intervention in this debate.  May I say straight out that I did not attempt to deal in any disdainful manner with Deputy Treacy?  I do not try to treat Members of this House in that way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy talks about moral obligation.  He also talks about denying people their rights in a dispensary.  It seems like a vague memory to me that members of his Party in particular have been crying about the demerits of the dispensary system and saying that it is an imposition on the poor, a relic of longforgotten days of tyranny and that it should be superseded with great rapidity.  Therefore, there seems to be some disparity between Deputy Treacy's approach and that of his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that my reason for declining to answer Deputy Treacy this afternoon was simply that I regarded his attitude as an abuse of parliamentary procedure <Col N="2078" /> and privilege and the parliamentary process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>In the course of his supplementary questions, Deputy Treacy contrived to bring in statements with regard to my intentions which were completely unfounded.  It seems to me that in asking a supplementary question a Deputy should confine himself to asking a question and should not broaden the scope of his privilege by trying to make allegations that are entirely unfounded against me, or any other Minister.</P>
      <P>With regard to particular dispensaries, Deputy Treacy raised a question not merely today but on other occasions when I certainly did not attempt either to evade my responsibility or to be in any way disdainful. I dealt with the position in Ardfinnan and the other dispensaries but specifically in regard to Ardfinnan in regard to which the Deputy raised his main complaint and in the course of my reply on the Estimate, I said:</P>
      <P>I am advised that in an effort to remedy the position there, the local authority have advertised recently for the purpose of acquiring alternative premises for use as a dispensary, pending the implementation of the choice of doctor scheme.  They have also undertaken to examine the position in regard to the other dispensaries I have mentioned, with a view to effecting any essential improvements required at any of these centres.</P>
      <P>Since I made that statement, I am glad to be able to report that, in fact, alternative premises have been acquired in Ardfinnan in the old school through the agreement of the manager.  These premises are, I am told, in good condition. The doctor is seemingly satisfied with them and they will be put into operation in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Kilsheelan, I understand this has been serviced by a doctor from Clonmel and that no complaint whatsoever has been made with regard to the services being provided by the doctor in question.  It seems from the map, and indeed from <Col N="2079" /> one's general knowledge of the area, that when choice of doctor is implemented, several doctors in Clonmel will be practising in that area and it would not be one that would require any special attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to Ballingarry, the House may be interested to know that only last week I was asking somebody who came to see me if he would be interested in going to Ballingarry to practise there.  My difficulty in regard to Ballingarry is simply this: as the House knows, the Local Appointments Commission is at present dealing with candidates in connection with a number of dispensary areas which were advertised in a confined competition among permanent DMOs and Ballingarry was one of those.  Until the situation is clarified in regard to Ballingarry, and that, of course will be only a matter of weeks, I cannot take any interim action.  This also applies to other areas, for instance, Nobber in County Meath which has been in the news.  I cannot take any effective action until I know the result of the examinations now being held by the Local Appointments Commission. The moment I do, I will proceed to take action, in consultation with the representatives of the medical profession because then the situation will have clarified itself.</P>
    <P>With regard to Kilpatrick, as the House, and Deputy Treacy in particular, know, a dispensary has been erected in this particular case.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned to hear what Deputy Treacy has to say about the privacy of people going to seek home assistance.  This is something which I was aware of for the first time only in the past few days because in my part of the country, it is not the practice of the home assistance officer to attend at dispensary premises such as this.  In fact in most cases, the home assistance officer calls on the applicant or the recipient in the case of re-investigation.  I am very concerned to hear that the use of these premises by home assistance officers in regard to these people is the cause of ill complaint.  I shall certainly take steps to remedy that situation, <Col N="2080" /> if necessary by asking the health authority to see to it that home assistance officers visit people in their homes and desist fror using these premises altogether.</P>
    <P>I want to make one specific repudiation, that is, that the situation here is entirely the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  This is not so and this applies to my predecessor as well as to me.  Indeed, the fact that Tipperary has a health authority and that the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; appears in it is in itself a repudiation of the allegation that the situation there is entirely and exclusively due to the direct action of the Minister for Health.  Indeed, the correspondence from the health authority made it clear that they themselves were not anxious to go ahead with any expenditure on these dispensaries and it is because of that fact that Deputy Treacy had to attempt to invoke the provisions of the City and County Managers Act, 1955.  If the health authority had taken a different attitude as they were entitled to do in pursuance of the terms of the 1966 circular, it would have obviated the Deputy taking the action he mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Hogan for the practical and sensible suggestions he has made and I would like to tell him that I am giving serious thought to any practical suggestion I can get and in particular to these, which in many ways summarise my own tentative thinking but again this is an area in which decisions can be made only when the result of the competition is announced in a few weeks' time.  We will then have a clear picture of the situation in regard to the posts advertised and the consequent effect the filling or non-filling of posts in that competition will have on the country as a whole.  I will give serious thought to the suggestions the Deputy has made and any other serious, well-meant suggestions that are made to me in an attempt to help me to discharge my responsibilities as Minister for Health, something that I intend to do despite the disruption of individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20th April, 1967.</P>
