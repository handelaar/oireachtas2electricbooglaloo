      <P>It appears as if a slight mistake has been made in item No. 3 because, as you are aware, the amendment to the motion proposed by the Taoiseach was moved by the Labour Party.  That is the one that is being discussed.  I discussed this matter with the Fine Gael Whip last night.  I could not at the time get the Government Whip but I spoke to his deputy.  I understood that arrangements were to be made to have the Labour Party speaker called before the Government speaker and the Fine Gael speaker would speak before him. I suppose the order has been put down this way because that is the way it is usually done and that is how it appears.  I suggest&mdash;if it can be done&mdash; the matter should be put in order now and that the Deputy to speak before the Deputy replying for the Government should be a person from the Party who proposed the amendment.</P>

      <P>The normal procedure is that the Leader of the Opposition, or somebody nominated by him, winds up the debate for the Opposition.  The usual practice in recent years is for a Member of the Fine Gael Party to wind up before the concluding speech on behalf of the Government.  If, however, the Leader of the Opposition wants to change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate last night, I was drawing attention to the fact that our application appeared to be linked entirely to that of the United Kingdom.  I was pointing out that the opposition to the entry of the United Kingdom was not entirely confined to General de Gaulle, that there was a long road to travel before the United Kingdom could come to transitional or full membership.  I was further pointing out that the reasons adduced by General de Gaulle were, first, the financial position of the United Kingdom and their position as the custodian and guardian of sterling and, secondly, that the French and some of the other members of EEC felt that the entry of the United Kingdom, possibly associated with the entry of Denmark and ourselves, would bring about severe disturbance within the EEC itself which recently faced so many trials and difficulties in coming to an agreement.</P>
      <P>Quite recently General de Gaulle made a speech in which he indicated that the policy which he would favour would be a transitional stage for the United Kingdom.  The reply came back from them that from their point of view, it was all or nothing.  For that reason, I believe the policy of the Government is entirely wrong.  I believe the application they are making on behalf of this country is not going to be accepted as a really forcible application unless it is entirely divorced from the application of any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> After the war, when Britain was very low economically and when she had, at the same time, the admiration of Europe and the free world, she had the opportunity of leading Europe. France was then in a very different position.  She had failed to live up to her reputation as a fighting nation.  Britain's opportunity to lead Europe was open to her and she did not do so.  The result was that the countries of Europe, waiting for a lead from Britain which was not forthcoming, united themselves into EEC.  Now, if anyone thinks it is just a question of knocking on the door and being admitted to this powerful economic and political body, he is making a great mistake.</P>
    <P>In 1966 we made the Free Trade Agreement with Britain.  It was forecast that as a result, our economic situation would improve and the Government based the be-all and end-all of their hopes on that Agreement.  It was stated that as well as being an economic agreement, it was also a political move in that it would create a better feeling between the two countries.  I do not think anybody in the House can now consider that there has been any improvement in the economic position of this country as a result of that Agreement. I think the Taoiseach highlighted that fact yesterday when he said that we are going through a period of economic stagnation.</P>
    <P>These were not precisely his words but what he said, in effect, was that if we do not get into the European Economic Community, we will face economic stagnation.  There is no need for him to tell that to an Irish Parliament. Everybody knows that we are facing economic stagnation, that we are facing what is perhaps the most disastrous situation since the Economic War.  Our livestock trade, on which fundamentally our economy depends, because it is on that we depend to get the money necessary to purchase the raw materials for our industry, is at a very low ebb.  Every Deputy knows that when there is decline in our agricultural economy, the economy on which our financial structure is based, we are in a very serious, dangerous and difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that <Col N="883" /> if we were to get into the EEC, we could estimate sales in the livestock markets for beef, and so on, amounting to a further £30 million a year.  He also stressed the fact that our dairy sales could be raised by £10 million a year. He went further and said that we were largely in a position to face the challenge we would have to meet from industry.  In fact, I think he made, in the long statement he read to us yesterday, an unchallengeable case for going right ahead and seeking entry to the Common Market.  But in a situation in which, leaving aside all the platitudes expressed at international conferences, particularly on the Continent of Europe, it seems self-evident that the United Kingdom application will be refused, where do we go?  Are we going to stagnate?  Are we to remain in the economic condition in which we are today?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment says that we should give longer consideration to the matter.  My view is that we have given consideration to it for far too long.  Since 1961, there has been no great advance in our economy.  It was then suggested that when we linked with Britain in a Free Trade Agreement our economy would mount and that prices for our livestock would increase.  Today we have the British Government challenging sales going into that country.  In fact, I can say openly here that as far as I can see, they are trying to break the Agreement already.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is quite satisfied with the recent speech by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Brown, when he addressed the WEU. What did he say, or what meaning can be taken out of what he said, except that Britain will try to get into the Common Market?  She has made an application to that effect for full membership: it is all or nothing for her.  And far from the close negotiations that have been going on&mdash;by whom I do not know&mdash;being operative, Britain will go in on her own.  If she gets in, there should be a transitional period of 12 months or more for this country, and Denmark and other allies <Col N="884" /> with which Britain has agreements already.</P>
    <P>Is it not time to remember that in negotiating on behalf of a country, one should do so in the direct interests of the country concerned?  That is what I accuse the Government of not doing. They have not directly negotiated for us.  They have negotiated as a bloc and have allowed the major part of the discussions to be carried out on their behalf by the British Government. It is true that the Taoiseach, as well as the Minister for Finance, who is the Minister who normally negotiates our foreign trade agreements, and the Minister for External Affairs are travelling around Europe, shall I say, in the wake of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown, perhaps with the slight variation that they do not follow the same order of capitals as the British.</P>
    <P>I ask the House whether we will be able to continue as we are at the present moment?  Will we be able to continue with our economy as at present?  Are we servicing our industries and will we be able to keep our farmers, the backbone of our country, from going into penury, on the agreements we have at present?  I thought that when the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement was made, it was made primarily for the purpose of protecting us when we acceded to GATT. I did not think that it was to be the be-all and end-all of our economic structure.</P>
    <P>The curious thing is the lack of thinking this Government have shown. A distinguished economist in an article on the history of our economic development said that things were very unusual in Ireland, that the Government got the civil servants to write a policy for them.  That, in effect, is the policy of this Government at the moment.  We have had the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion, both of which have been a total failure.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House&mdash;and I refer to this Party, as I confess I do not know what the Labour Party want in this European Economic Community debate&mdash;want an assurance <Col N="885" /> that we will not experience economic stagnation.  We want an assurance that a direct approach is being made so that our trade can be expanded.  It is quite obvious that even if we had made a direct attempt to get into the Common Market on our own, or to negotiate independently of other countries, there would be a considerable hiatus before our application was received.  But if we had negotiated at political level, as I stressed last night&mdash; and if you want to deal with Europe, you must do it at political level&mdash;by our then Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs, we would have been doing a far better service to the Irish economy than by carrying on the negotiations that have been going on with any other country in the meantime.</P>
    <P>We all agree that ultimately for the peace of the world, for, shall I say, the salvation of mankind, we must have a united Europe.  That seems to be one of the outstanding factors essential in the world today.  We owe a debt of gratitude to those who founded the European Economic Community as a basis for discussion on a future unified Europe.  It has always been stressed that the European Economic Community is an outward-looking organisation. Today, one of the major factors in the world is hunger.  That is the great danger that faces mankind today, and there is the risk of a much larger world population looking for food.  It is already threatening the world.  For that reason, unification of effort is desirable and necessary.  The areas producing the food are Europe and North America, and a unified effort in Europe is the only thing that can help to meet the conditions of world hunger which threaten us.</P>
    <P>I have listened to a lot of woolly talking, when I have been at international conferences, about producing agricultural goods, about more efficiency and about fewer people being employed.  When the call for food comes, as assuredly it will, if the food is not provided, there will be a world upheaval the like of which has never been seen before.  How can we meet <Col N="886" /> that situation if we have an unhealthy agricultural structure in Europe, if the primary food-producing countries are reduced to the stage at which they have reached rock bottom?  Therefore, the Government should take another look at the situation and when they go to negotiate, they should stop talking about the assumption that we shall go into Europe along with Britain.  My view, for what it is worth&mdash;and I do not hold it alone&mdash;is that Britain will not get in in the immediate future.  My view also is that we cannot sustain our present economy as it is without mass unemployment growing, mass emigration and general disruption of our economy with a lower standard of living for all concerned.</P>
    <P>We are a sovereign nation.  We struggled long enough to achieve that status and as such, we have the right and the duty to negotiate.  I ask those who represent us, those who are in power today, when they go to make their representations, when they go to discuss our application, not to do so as a stooge of any other government&mdash;to negotiate for the Irish nation.  This country is entering Europe on its own. There has been great talk about a situation developing in which Britain would impose tariffs on us.  I shall cover that point briefly.</P>
    <P>What we need is to export more finished beef, processed beef.  We cannot get that into the British market. We cannot get it into the European market at the moment because we are faced by tariffs and it is, therefore, not economic for us to do it.  But does anybody in his sane senses tell us that if we get into Europe and still have stores to export&mdash;I am not too keen on the export of stores because I think our economy would be better balanced if we dealt in finished products&mdash;Britain will put a tariff on them?  Why should Britain do that?  Why should they make a higher price for themselves to get our stores in and why should they put a tariff on produce they can get from Ireland and from no other country in the world?</P>
    <P>People may say that if we get into the EEC, our industrial goods will be tariffed on the British market.  The <Col N="887" /> British market for industrial goods consists of 58 million people and the market for industrial goods in Europe consists of 185 million people, with associates overseas running up to 250 million people.  If we have got to face a situation in which we must change our market, we must remember that.</P>
    <P>One thing Ireland suffers from, and has suffered from since the day we got our independence, is a shortage of capital.  If we have an avenue, an open entrance to the EEC, my guess is, and it is as good as that of anyone else, that we shall have heavy investment of capital in this country, the setting up of industries where we have sites available at one-tenth the price at which they are obtainable in continental Europe or Britain.  We shall have these industries set up with all the labour available and the export potential.  These industries can export directly into the largest market in the world.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government must do a little fresh thinking.  People have been saying this would mean disaster for the Irish economy.  What is the alternative?  It is 58,000 unemployed, emigration lifting its head again, and among the very people we need to retain, those leaving school today who constitute the future of the Irish race.  The Government should then go ahead, take their courage in their hands and negotiate well so that we may take our part in a Europe, to which traditionally, culturally, historically we belong, whether in association with the United Kingdom or not.  I have nothing but admiration for Britain as a nation.  When everything had gone in the war, they stood firm and fast.  I admire them as a nation but I realise&mdash;perhaps I have been taught it as a member of an Irish political family&mdash;that British parliamentarians negotiate for themselves alone.  The lesson here for Ireland is that Irish parliamentarians should do the same.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde is in a rather despondent mood this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> I do not agree with him that the prospect for negotiating entry to the Common Market is quite as dark as he makes it out to be.  After all, if the EEC are to keep alive and healthy and progressive, they have to live up to their charter, the Treaty, which established the Community.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, I think Deputy Esmonde is a little too gloomy about the prospects for the expansion of the EEC.  If the Community are to live up to their declarations in the Treaty of Rome, they must be determined &ldquo;to establish the foundations of an ever closer union among the European peoples&rdquo;.  They must also carry out their intention &ldquo;to confirm the solidarity which binds Europe and overseas countries, and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations&rdquo;.  Finally the Preamble to the Treaty states:</P>
      <P>Resolved to strengthen the safeguards of peace and liberty by establishing this combination of resources, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts.</P>
      <P>We notified the Community some years ago that we are prepared to join in their efforts and, although there have been no formal negotiations opened up on our application, we have been in very close contact with the representatives and statesmen of the Six.  That contact has been very close indeed for a small country off the coast of Europe. There have been several formal visits to Brussels to see the Directorate of the Community.  There have been dozens, if not hundreds, of ministerial visits and conversations between Irish Ministers and Ministers of the Six. Over the years I must have had at least between 100 and 200 conversations on our application with various Ministers of the six members of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all times they welcomed our <Col N="889" /> application.  They understood that it would be almost impossible for us economically to join the European Community unless our principal trading partner joined at the same time. We must realise this.  Deputy Esmonde sometimes in a fit of enthusiasm advocates that we should go and join if we were admitted by the Six, but if we were accepted, a barrier would be erected between ourselves and the country to which we sell threequarters of our exports.  That is not good business. It would be quite foolish on our part.  There have been quiet negotiations over the years and we feel that we have persuaded the Ministers of the Six that it would be good for Europe as well as for Ireland, if Britain and other extra countries joined, that Ireland should also be admitted.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Corish wanted the Government to stop railroading Ireland into the Community.  On the other hand, Deputy Cosgrave said that the only major objective in our foreign affairs was to ensure membership of the EEC.  We have not railroaded, nor have we attempted to railroad this Dáil or the people of Ireland into the Six.  There has been a terrific amount of discussion on this question.  Everyone knows that if we are to join the Six, we must surrender to the community as much sovereignty as any other member of the Six has already surrendered.</P>
    <P>It is foolish to suggest, as some members of the Labour Party allege from time to time, that we are surrendering all sovereignty when we join the Six.  We are not.  We do not propose to surrender all sovereignty, but we do propose to surrender as much sovereignty to the Community as other members surrender to it.  We cannot expect to get into the Community and be a less faithful or less loyal member than the Six who are already members. We do not ask to join on those terms.  We are prepared to do our duty as faithfully and well as any other member of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cosgrave that membership of the European Community is the only major objective in our foreign affairs.  It is one of our objectives and a very important one.  It <Col N="890" /> is important because we feel that by being accepted as a member of the European Community, this will contribute to the prosperity and happiness of the Irish people and, at the same time, we will contribute our small mite to the prosperity and happiness of the rest of the people of Europe.  It is, therefore, a major objective, and an objective of major importance but like other objectives of foreign policy, it must be related to the welfare of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Another very important objective from the point of view of foreign policy in this very dangerous world is to try to keep world peace.  Deputy Corish yesterday went on and on about NATO and whether or not we were going to join NATO.  We have never been asked to join NATO.  It has been said both publicly and privately by a number of members of the European Economic Community that the joining of NATO is not a <i>sine qua non</i> of our acceptance as a member of the Community.  I cannot understand why the Labour Party talk so much about NATO.  NATO is changing very rapidly.  The evolution goes on every day.  Our maximum contribution towards winning a world war would be, I think, of very little importance. The big powers can destroy themselves without our help, because that is what another war will mean.  One of the things we can do, however, is to try to win the peace and that should be our objective.</P>
    <P>Our objective in foreign affairs should be not alone membership of the EEC but also doing everything that a small country of our size can do, with its very limited resources, to help to keep world peace.  If a world war were to break out and we contributed in any way, either through neglect or through the implementation of a wrong policy, towards bringing it about, it would be very little consolation to the Irish people to know that we were either inside or outside the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Fine Gael members who say we have taken no active steps.  The terms of their motion read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;but in the light of the obligations <Col N="891" /> already imposed on our economy by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the possibility of EEC membership regrets the failure of the Government to take more realistic preparatory steps both at home and abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The policy of the Fianna Fáil Party since coming into office in 1932 has been the development of our economy to the point at which we can hold our own in the economic field and give our people a standard of living which compares favourably with that in other countries.  We have come a long way. Only 40 years ago we were depending for buying practically everything we ate and wore, except bacon and beef, on selling our agricultural produce. We even had to buy all our wheat.  We have developed now to the point at which we are not only providing a great many of our own requirements of industrial products and practically all our requirements from the land but we are no longer altogether dependent upon the sale of our agricultural produce for the purchase of other essentials. Even though 40 per cent of our foreign earnings come from the sale of our industrial goods, we are still too dependent on our agricultural exports and we have, therefore, to reduce that dependence.  Traditionally, we have become accustomed to selling our agricultural products, particularly our cattle, in the British market.  One of the advantages in joining the EEC will be the opening up of markets for our agricultural produce in countries other than Britain.  The amount we sell to the Six is a bagatelle compared with their total requirements.</P>
    <P>We hope, too, that if we get into the Common Market, we will find outlets for our industrial products.  But, even if we are never to get in, one of the heartening aspects of our application to join is the fact that it has encouraged the Government and industrialists generally to have a look at the operations of the industrial machine.  Improvements have been brought about with the help of Government grants and loans and technical assistance.  The result is that, if <Col N="892" /> we continue to improve industry and industrial processes, we will be in a much better position to face the rigours of competition in the Common Market.  Even if membership is delayed beyond 1970, we will continue to improve our industrial efficiency and our ability to sell our industrial products at the right price in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Esmonde that we face stagnation if we cannot get immediately into the Common Market.  If we are wise, instead of facing stagnation, we will take advantage of every month and every year between now and joining to fit ourselves the better to face the competition we will meet in both the industrial and agricultural fields when eventually we are accepted as members.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Labour Party's opinion may be of entering the Common Market, I hope they will join with the Government in trying to get industrialists and workers to improve the efficiency of our industrial machinery.  Whether we are in or out, we shall be in competition with other industrial countries.  If we are to sell our agricultural produce abroad we must be able to produce it at as good a price and as good a quality as it is on offer by other countries.  If we do not continue to export our industrial products, and increase the export of these products beyond the 40 per cent which we have reached, we shall become or tend to become as dependent upon the sale of agricultural produce as we were 30 or 40 years ago and that is a very bad dependence.  While we must do what we can to develop our agricultural efficiency so that we can produce the right products at the right price and at the right time of the year, we must remember that most of the products entering international marketing are industrial products.  If we are to make progress and develop the standard of life of our people we must organise ourselves to have factories efficiently run so as to give as good a livelihood to those working and controlling them as similar factories in other countries and so that their products <Col N="893" /> can be sold in competition with the products of other countries in the foreign market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening this discussion yesterday, the Taoiseach, in the very first statement, said the issue before the country at the present time is not whether we could join EEC but how best to prepare for membership. The issue then is how best to prepare for membership.  In the next few lines, he said: &ldquo;I am convinced that the Government, in deciding in 1961 to seek membership for Ireland, and the Dáil in supporting that decision, judged correctly.&rdquo;  It is evident from the first paragraph of the Taoiseach's statement that we applied for membership in 1961.  Six years afterwards, in 1967 in the first line of his statement to the House, we learn that the issue is how best to prepare for membership.  The obvious questions to ask, in reply, are: &ldquo;What has happened during the past six years, what preparations have been made in the past six years and are the preparations that have been made sufficient?&rdquo; We in the Labour Party put down this amendment asking for a deferment of our application until we get answers to vital questions which have been posed here.  We claim that the Government have had sufficient opportunity to answer these questions and to be in a position to bring before this House and before the Irish people answers to most, if not all, of the questions posed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discussion on EEC is nothing new here.  It has been drawn in and out of several debates and other matters since the Association was set up ten or eleven years ago and particularly since we got it into our minds, in 1961, to join.  As pointed out by the Taoiseach yesterday, our application was set out in 1961.  We were told then that whether or not Britain joined made no difference to us.  The former Taoiseach said we were prepared to &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;, that we were a sovereign State and would do our own business and were not dependent on Britain, on Britain's help or on Britain's advice in furthering our entry into what, from the discussion here yesterday and from the statements by the Leaders of Fianna <Col N="894" /> Fáil and Fine Gael, could only be described as Heaven upon earth.</P>
    <P>Once we get into the Common Market, it was implied in the wellprepared statement made by the Leader of the Government and by the Leader of Fine Gael yesterday, we shall benefit immensely.  All the benefits are to flow our way.  So far as could be ascertained, the disadvantages will be negligible. That is one of the reasons we in this Party set down this amendment.  We feel that the six years which have elapsed since our application for membership have, to a large extent, been wasted by the Government in so far as they have not the information to give this House and the Irish people in answer to many questions which have been posed by Members of this House time and again and posed by outside organisations just as well.</P>
    <P>One cannot help casting one's mind back to the debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement in this House in January, 1966.  That debate was then deemed to be one of the most important that had taken place within a number of years.  We had, at that time, too, carefully prepared statements by the Minister, statements that I am sure were prepared for him by the senior executives.  We were told that the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement would bring many benefits to the Irish people and that it was essential for Dáil Éireann to put their seal on the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Agriculture, in supporting the case for the sealing of that Agreement, said the main sector of our community which would benefit would be Agriculture.  He had no hesitation in giving a definite figure so far as the advantages to agriculture were concerned.  He stated that from 1st July, 1966, our cattle prices would benefit to the extent of £10 million from the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement. Every agriculturist in the country got it into his head that they, as a body, were about to benefit £10 million as a result of that Agreement and that their income would be raised by that amount.  That was the clear-cut statement of the Minister at that time.  That view was supported by the Fine Gael Party.  We, in the Labour Party, were <Col N="895" /> rather hesitant.  We were hopeful, as I expressed it here, that the statement was correct but we wanted more information.  We wanted to know, for instance, if, in the event of changes, if world prices were to fluctuate and if further eventualities were to occur, agriculture could benefit to the extent named by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our doubts were proven correct.  We have had a big decline in agricultural income, so much so that we have had a complete upheaval in the agricultural industry. We had farmers parading outside the gate of Leinster House.  We had them parading through the country, being put into Black Marias and removed to jail.  We had unrest and uneasiness among the farming community which were never experienced before, as a result of statements made here in support of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  It is my opinion that these statements, now proved to have been unwarranted, which were made by Government spokesmen were the root cause of the uneasiness and unrest which existed, and still exists, among our farming community</P>
    <P>Picture, Sir, one of the most hardworking sections of our people reading the Ministers' statements in the newspapers that their incomes were going to improve and an improvement was essential for many of them.  Picture them reading in the newspapers that as a result of the Government's activities and their bargaining power and as a result of negotiating this trade agreement we would have a market for 638,000 cattle and greater prices would increase their return by £10 million. Was that not what they read?  Was that not what they heard on radio and television?  What happened?  Instead of our agricultural industry benefiting to the extent of £10 million as a result of that agreement the opposite was the case and hence the uneasiness and unrest, the strikes, the marching up and down outside Leinster House and the jailing of farmers.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable then for the Labour Party to be watchful in so far as this debate is concerned, for them to ask reasonable questions and to <Col N="896" /> expect answers to them from the Taoiseach and from the responsible Ministers, and the Minister for External Affairs.  We have expressed doubts. The Government have had six years to give us the answers to our questions but six years after making our original application for EEC membership, we find the Taoiseach in his very first breath saying that it is not a question of whether we want to join but how best to prepare ourselves.  In this document of 44 pages, there is no clear indication of what the Government have done over the past six years to prepare us for entry into the Common Market.  We know that the Minister for External Affairs can have put very little effort into this work.  His work has mainly been confined to representing us in the United Nations in New York.  There is a consensus of opinion that, if we are to pursue our application for membership, the Minister's time would be better devoted to working in Brussels rather than in New York and that if the Minister had given as much time and attention to our application to the Six, than it appears he has done, as he gave to the United Nations, we should be able to get much more information than we have got from the Taoiseach's rather empty statement yesterday.</P>
    <P>If this question is as big as it is&mdash; and I agree it is very big&mdash;it amazes me that the man charged with dealing with External Affairs and with looking after our foreign trade should have played only a very small part in our negotiations during the past six years. With the exception of one or two visits to Strasbourg, I doubt if the Minister has been engaged at all on this work.  Indeed, such visits were made to the Council of Europe and despite his statement, I am sure he did not interest himself to any great extent&mdash;and we have good grounds for believing that&mdash;in our application for EEC membership.  I do not know whether the Minister agrees with our application or not, but if he does, it would have been much more in line than sending him for six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The statements made yesterday surprised me.  If the EEC were never there and we were not moving towards it, after all these years and despite the Tánaiste's statement, it appears we are becoming economically stagnant, our population is likely to decline, emigration likely to increase and our living standards likely to be greatly reduced.  That is not a very bright picture to paint after almost 50 years of Irish government.  In saying that, I am a confirmed believer in co-operation and in the work and objectives of the Common Market and of the Common Market countries.  I have had the privilege of being a member of the Council of Europe for a number of years.  I have learned there at first hand the many advantages that have accrued to member nations.  I think my colleagues in the Labour Party are also aware that, as far as the present Six are concerned, general advantages have accrued to their people.  They have improved their standard of living; they have almost wiped out unemployment and indeed it is putting it mildly to say they have done a good job of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very pleased that their position is thus&mdash;that countries which 25 years ago were fighting one another to the death are now joined economically, and one could almost say, politically, working for the common good of the people of all countries.  Everyone appreciates that Germany and France are now friends, working together in every field within this Community. Surely we are not too far away from Europe to say from this Dáil that that is what we like to see happening?  We like to see Germany and France working together for the future betterment <Col N="901" /> of their peoples.  It is a big change, and a pleasant change, from that which took place in 1939 when Germany and France, for the second time in this century, declared war on each other. We like to see this change in Western Europe.  We hope that as a result of this Community, as a result of the co-operation which now exists&mdash;co-operation which has been helped by the deliberations of the Council of Europe &mdash;that never again will it happen in our lifetime that countries in Western Europe, and in that I include Britain and Ireland, will have the necessity arise to declare war on one another.</P>

      <P>I believe it would be to Ireland's advantage to join this Community, but we have a number of doubts.  What we are asking in the Labour Party, and what I am personally asking here, is that we should not rush this through on the adjournment of the Dáil, but should during the next few months give Government Ministers, particularly the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, an opportunity of giving us more information as to what the advantages and the disadvantages of joining may be. Undoubtedly, side by side with the advantages, there are disadvantages.  If we allowed six years to pass with a great deal of inaction on our part as far as furthering our application was concerned&mdash;it is not so long since it was allowed to lie dormant completely and we lost faith in ever joining&mdash;I cannot see why we should, after renewing our application two months ago, try to rush this reactivation motion through the House, giving the Irish people through this Dáil as little information as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say at this stage that I am glad of the change of heart on the part of the Tánaiste and some other people in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am not a believer in hatred, in opening up old sores and trying to get our younger people to adopt a certain line of action as far as some countries are concerned. We know that that has happened here in relation to our nearest neighbour, Britain.  I never liked it.  We were told <Col N="902" /> at school to forgive those who trespassed against us.  But Fianna Fáil lived on that for a number of years. They cherished that idea.  They used it to try to hold power and to get votes from some gullible people.  I am glad to say they are changing now and that they believe in the statement: forgive those who trespass against you.</P>
    <P>It is about time we forgot what has happened in the past.  We hear too much about Oliver Cromwell and other people who were there hundreds of years ago.  It is about time we looked to the future.  I was pleased to hear the statement from the Tánaiste that we are now holding Britain's hand, that Britain is helping us along, that Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown, in moving through the different capitals, along with doing their own business, are doing Ireland's business as well. We asked Mr. Brown why this 12 months standstill period he mentioned in his statement some weeks ago.  That 12 months standstill period was put there to help poor, old Ireland.  &ldquo;If we get in, we will do nothing for 12 months in order to give our friend, Ireland, an opportunity of getting in.&rdquo; Is it not quite evident from that statement that we are entirely dependent on Britain, or almost entirely dependent on Britain, making our case?</P>
    <P>Possibly there is nothing very wrong with that because, I believe, Britain is better versed in diplomacy and in dealing with foreign affairs than we are and maybe we are making no mistake in that.  I am very pleased to see ourselves and our neighbour such good friends.  It is like two farmers living along a boreen who for years have been at loggerheads suddenly becoming friends. This new friendship is something like that and I am very glad and hope it will flourish and grow because I believe in neighbours being on friendly and cooperative terms and being helpful to one another.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear now that, despite Deputy Lemass's statement of some years ago, our application hinges on Britain and that if Britain were to be rejected, we would immediately withdraw. This question of going it alone <Col N="903" /> was used at the time for a bit of political bluff but there is no need to labour that now.  Let me say again that this change as between Britain and ourselves in the diplomatic world is welcome.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I have not a great deal of faith in our ambassadors abroad.  Our information is, of course, very limited.  We get a brief synopsis on the External Affairs Estimate in the House annually.  We get very little information.  I doubt if they are doing a good job.  This debate on the EEC brings that to my mind because the statistics for last year and for the previous years show an adverse balance in our trade with EEC countries.  If memory serves me correctly, last year we bought from EEC countries £56 million worth and sold them, goods to the value of £28 million, so our trading adverse balance was in the ratio of two to one.  It is bad business for a small country like ours to have such an adverse trade balance with the Common Market countries.</P>
    <P>It may be irrelevant to this debate or it may not, according to the Chair's opinion, to ask why such a position arose.  Why should a small country like Ireland, with relatively small trade in comparison with other countries, buy from the EEC annually £2 million worth of goods for every £1 million worth they buy from us?  That is a position which I mentioned here in some debate two years ago and expressed the hope that it would be rectified and suggested that our embassies should be in a position to rectify it but, judging from the latest statistics, that position still obtains.  Our trade with the eastern European countries with which we do business and with all foreign countries with the exception of Britain, shows an adverse balance.</P>
    <P>How is it that the people charged with the duty of selling our goods or our embassies abroad who are supposed to help in the sale of our products, cannot do better business with these countries?  What is wrong?  Is it that something is wrong with our <Col N="904" /> salesmen, if I may use that term, or is it that something is wrong with our products?  I doubt that the fault lies with our products.  This is a question that should be answered and it is a question that I shall be asking again, if I am spared, in the debate on the Estimate for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to say a further sentence or two on this point, seeing that our Tánaiste and Minister for External Affairs is present and, in view of the fact that he is so seldom with us, we must avail of the opportunity of his being here to bring to his mind matters that concern us in relation to foreign trade.  That is one matter that has concerned me and, I am sure, other Members of the House.  The Labour Party has always felt general concern about this question of our adverse trade balance with the EEC and other countries, apart from Britain.</P>
    <P>We have documents galore on the EEC and the advantages that will accrue to the agricultural community. I hope that, if we do succeed in having our application approved, what is set down in the documents will prove to be correct, namely, that so far as our two main agricultural products are concerned&mdash;cattle and milk&mdash;prices will be increased significantly and in an unlimited market. That is what has been set down for us. So far as other agricultural items are concerned&mdash;grain, sugar beet and horticultural products&mdash;I understand the position is not so bright.  We are told that our two main items, milk and cattle, will benefit immensely.  I think it is as a result of the benefit that is expected to be derived so far as cattle and milk are concerned that we are rushing into the EEC now because at present milk and cattle are a liability.  We have to subsidise milk extensively and we are unable to sell the cattle now at a reasonable price, and the price of cattle is so uncertain that the question has arisen as to whether or not farmers will get subsidies to hold on to their cattle until such time as prices may improve.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows&mdash;even our friends in the Press do not know&mdash;about this so-called <Col N="905" /> mysterious trip of the Minister for Agriculture to Europe and back again.  I do not think that mystery should surround a trip like that.  If the Minister had to go to Europe on the Irish people's business or about our agricultural policy in so far as it relates to our application to join the EEC, on his return he should tell the Dáil what his mission was.  Surely we have no secret organisations, no spies abroad to converse with whom we would send him abroad?  There is no excuse for that secrecy on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>There may be doubt about the alleged benefits for the agricultural community from membership of the EEC but side by side with the statement forecasting these benefits is the indication that they will be for a reduced agricultural population.  It is quite clear from the statements made that the agricultural population must decline.  We have also the statement from the EEC countries that they have no specific plan formulated so far as the small farmers are concerned.  We have a big problem here in trying to make our small farms economic.  It is difficult to do that.  How will membership of the EEC help us to do it? Small farms are such an important feature of our life that one would have thought that the Tánaiste would have told us something about agriculture and, in particular, about the small farmers in the context of membership of the EEC and what he or the Government had in mind to offer to the EEC with a view to solving the problem of small farmers.  There is nothing definite so far as small farmers are concerned. That is clearly set down.</P>
    <P>As one who is conversant with the agricultural community and who knows the problems of the small farmers and the low incomes they have, particularly at the present time, and the uncertainty of prices, I think that more attention should have been paid to this question by the Minister.  That is one thing I like about the Commission's regulations so far as farmers are concerned, that prices are guaranteed.  I appreciate the difficulty for us in guaranteeing prices for some commodities, <Col N="906" /> but guaranteed prices undoubtedly are a big advantage.  Therefore, I hope that in the event of our attaining membership, some policy will be formulated that will help our small and medium sized farmers.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, it appears from statements heard from all sides of the House that the disadvantages are likely to outweigh the advantages.  We must bear in mind here that we have many industries set up with State aid. The State acts as a fairy godmother towards them, keeping out competitors by tariffs and helping industries to with incentives such as grants, and so on.  We know that grants were given to people not because they had the business know-how, not because they were keen industrialists, not because they were a group whose merit warranted the payment of grants for further development, but because of their political affiliations.  We know that people with some money and a business, possibly who were not the best so far as management of that business was concerned, got money at a time when influence was the main factor in getting grants from the State. Everyone knows that.  Go down to the Library and read the list of firms who have got grants to date, even from An Foras Tionscal.  It can be seen from that booklet that firms have received payment of grants who should never have received them, and that our public funds have been wantonly spent on such firms who could not, in my opinion, if they were investigated properly qualify for payment of such grants.</P>
    <P>A number of our industries have been over-protected.  Competition was removed from them, and they have the market to themselves.  I appreciate it is difficult for such firms to compete within a free trade area.  If we never went into the Common Market that difficulty faces them from our association with Britain through the recent Trade Agreement.  Possibly it is a good thing to give some firms adaptation grants to try to build themselves up to meet competition, but, there again, reading the list of firms who have received adaptation grants, there is a <Col N="907" /> question mark as to whether some of those firms should have got payment of grants under that heading or not.</P>
    <P>There are a number of industries with which Deputies representing urban areas are more conversant than I am, but we know from our CIO reports that even our main industries are unlikely to survive within the Common Market.  The motor assembly industry is given as one; leather and shoes is another, and an industry that is important to rural Ireland, processed foods.  Whether or not the association of our Erin Foods Compay with the international firm will help them over that obstacle, we cannot say at present, but it is quite evident that industries in a number of centres will be hit.  It is also evident beyond doubt that some industries will have to close down and that redundancy will be rampant.</P>
    <P>At present there are big problems in relation to unemployment.  Very few of our industries are increasing their employment content.  Our State employing agencies or our State employing Departments such as Local Government, Lands and Finance are reducing their employment content. Forestry workers in the Department of Lands are being let go.  In the Department of Local Government local authority employment has been reduced, and a number of road workers have been told that their services are no longer required due to the reduced grants made available. Therefore, the uncertainty of employment for our workers is a very big question and one that must be taken into account in dealing with issues such as this.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will adjourn tonight until 18th October, but before it adjourns, while I am on this point, I want to say to the Minister for External Affairs and to the Government that some of our workers at present are faced with a situation that never before confronted them in the month of July. For instance, council employees are told that their services are no longer required in the third month of the <Col N="908" /> financial year.  That never happened before.  Forestry workers are told that their services are no longer required, and people who used to obtain employment through the Department of Finance and the Special Employment Schemes office are told that work no longer exists for them, due to the wiping out of some of the schemes, or due to the reduction in the funds available for other schemes.  I may be straying a little from the EEC debate, but this is quite relevant on the Adjournment Debate.  That is the position that obtains as far as our workers are concerned.  In relation to our rural population, there are water schemes which have been approved and which even down in my constituency, South-West Cork, where tenders were accepted, have had to be abandoned due to lack of public funds. As I mentioned before, our shopkeepers in the towns, particularly our small shopkeepers, are finding it difficult to make ends meet and grapple with the competition and the problems that confront them.  There are also the problems of the farming community to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>In regard to our admission to the EEC, it has been asserted here, and I hope correctly so, that it will be most likely to improve agricultural income. The position of the industrial side is uncertain.  We hope it is correct to suggest that the industries which have equipped themselves for this type of competition, with the aid of State grants, will prosper.  However, it is true beyond any doubt that a number of industries will go by the board.</P>
    <P>If we join the Common Market, surely we are not going to accept the advantages, enjoy their prosperity, and ignore them from the point of view of social adversity.  The military alliance which the Tánaiste mentioned a while ago in reference to Deputy Corish's remarks is completely out of place. What Deputy Corish wants to know is&mdash;I was sitting beside him and I think he was completely relevant&mdash; why our application is for full membership. That is the basis of our application but there is no talk of what is happening in the case of Greece or Turkey.  We want full association, <Col N="909" /> apparently, not association. Surely if we become a member of EEC and surrender our sovereignty&mdash;I agree we must do that and I assume we will surrender it in the same way as it has been surrendered by other member countries and as it will be surrendered by Britain if she joins&mdash; and if we were to have another war &mdash;that possibility was mentioned by the Tánaiste&mdash;we cannot desert them and take the line that we would share in their prosperity but in the case of adversity we would come back and stay here until everything was calm again and we could again enjoy the benefits that we are told we would get from membership.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident that as this association grows, and it has not come to the adult stage yet or even to its teens, it will be a matter of full co-operation economically and politically and surely we shall be obliged to stand side by side with our friends in the Six should war arise and that membership does mean the abandonment of the neutrality policy which we held during this century's world wars.  I think that must be the case.  We cannot say: &ldquo;If difficult times arise we shall desert.  We shall only join to share prosperity; we will not share adversity.&rdquo;  I mention this because the Irish people are entitled to know.  Generally, people have only a vague idea of what membership of the Common Market means. Some think it will give farmers increased prices and may help to give higher wages to industrial workers and that it involves no further commitments, not considering that if we join the cost of living may increase sharply and that we could be committed to action in the unfortunate event of another war and that we would have to share the difficulties as well as the advantages involved in membership.</P>
    <P>It is considerations such as these that led the Labour Party to put down this amendment.  We cannot see why a few months' delay should make any great difference.  We want more information. It is six years since the original application was made and we have got very little information.  Why rush now?  Is it because we want to keep up with <Col N="910" /> Britain?  I think it makes no difference if we allow Britain to go ahead particularly if, as we are told by the British representatives, that they are looking after our interests as well as ourselves.</P>
    <P>I cannot find a quotation to which I wanted to refer from the speech of Deputy Esmonde but he did express the view that the beliefs held by the two main Parties in the House&mdash;this is what his statement amounted to&mdash; about the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement were wrongly based and that the advantages that they thought would accrue from it did not arise.  I admire the Deputy for his outspokenness.  He is one of the Members I most admire. His knowledge of public affairs and particularly European affairs is second to none.  If a mistake was made so far as the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement was concerned are we to make another mistake in regard to the EEC?  Are the Government going to get away with a long statement which the Taoiseach read out for one-and-a-half hours and which could be usefully contained in a statement that could be read in 20 minutes?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are as mindful of the interests of the Irish people as any other Party.  Our main interests have been, are and will be the uplifting and advancement of all sections of our people and the uplifting and advancement of the whole nation.  We appreciate that this is a very important debate and we also appreciate that we must have some association with a community such as the EEC but we dislike the question being thrown at us here two days before the adjournment for the summer recess and without the information which we think is necessary.  The Taoiseach yesterday said they could not be expected to disclose generally the terms of entry. We appreciate that but there are other factors in regard to which more information could be made available.  In putting down this amendment, we are only seeking a deferment of this reactivation move by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is very peculiar that the Government should bring in this motion with the Adjournment Debate.  It is <Col N="911" /> one that is politically useful for the Government as an answer to questions that will be posed by our people who are so dissatisfied with present economic conditions.  It will be a useful answer to the farming community who are continuing their efforts to get some degree of justice.  It will also be an answer to workers during the holiday recess and for some time to come for the Government Party to say: &ldquo;Hold on.  We have reactivated our application to the EEC and we hope it will be approved, even though it is contended that we may have to wait for a few years or even much longer. When we get into the EEC, everything in the garden will be bright and rosy.&rdquo;  I believe that was one of the motives of the Taoiseach in introducing this motion.  He wants to sidetrack other issues and cloud them out of the picture.  He wants to take over the Press with our Common Market entry and what it will mean to Ireland and what the Government are doing for Ireland.  He wants to cloud the other side of the picture portrayed in the debate, the economic stagnation which surrounds us and is almost upon us.</P>
    <P>It could be implied from the Taoiseach's statement and from the statements of the Opposition that unemployment is exceptionally high, emigration is likely to increase, no improvement is likely in farming conditions and so far as work is concerned the outlook is anything but bright.  So far as rural schemes are concerned&mdash;housing, water and sewerage schemes&mdash;no public funds are available for them.  Money was never as scarce as it is at present.  The Taoiseach brought this motion in here with all the urgency that he could command in order to wipe off our national slate, if he could, the other issues which concern the people so closely at present.  What advantage will it be to the man who on last Friday or Saturday was told that there was no longer employment available for him to read our EEC discussion on today's paper?  This kind of discussion is not going to help the man who was told that money is not available for <Col N="912" /> the scheme he was looking forward to, whether it be a water and sewerage scheme or anything else, in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I say that our amendment is a fair and reasonable one.  The Labour Party are as mindful of the interests of our people as any other Party in this House, but we were forced to the conclusion that one of the main motives behind this rushing through of reactivation of our application is to wipe out other important issues that cannot be dealt with at the present time.  Indeed I do not see why the Government should have to reactivate our application at all.  It has been there since 1961.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that we gave this at our Party meeting a great deal of consideration.  We have as a Party put a great deal of work and effort into it.  We do not have the same advantages as the Government have of having innumerable advisers in setting out their policy statements and in making their case.  We know that advice got from such advisers in the past has been proved incorrect.  We have enough papers on closing gaps, economic expansion and so on, advice tendered by higher executives which in theory seems to be all right but which in practice was not workable.  As a Party we felt deeply obliged to consider every aspect of this application.  We have done that and we have come to the conclusion after a great deal of deliberation that our amendment is fair and reasonable and we are supporting it.  I am sure, in view of the statements made by the other Parties, that it is little use, at this stage of the debate, to ask them to reconsider the position and to allow our amendment to go through.  However, our amendment was put down after the greatest consideration and with the sole aim of keeping the interests of the Irish people uppermost and safeguarding their welfare. We feel that the House should approve of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a few comments on this very important matter.  It is something that has exercised the minds of all intelligent Irish people for the past few years but <Col N="913" /> we have found ourselves, for a variety of reasons, moving in a fog of half information and very little true enlightenment from the Government. When I say &ldquo;true enlightenment&rdquo;, I do not mean to say for a moment that in a matter like this the Government have been telling lies or untruths but they certainly have been indulging in what the lawyers call <i>suppressio veri.</i> There has been a great deal of hiding and suppressing of the truth from the ordinary people of the country.</P>
      <P>I dislike making purely political speeches and, in fact, I hardly ever make such a speech because I think that economic matters are in the end always more important than immediate political advantages.  However, sometimes, as has happened on many occasions in the history of this country and in the world in general with tragic results, political considerations have overridden economic and geographical facts.  That is what we are up against at the moment.  We are up against the political viewpoint&mdash;I use &ldquo;political&rdquo; in its very widest sense&mdash;of the Government which has prevented them from putting before the people of Ireland the economic facts in all their starkness and all the dangers which they carry for the whole of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is on the motion: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approves of the decision to reactivate Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community.&rdquo;  We in Fine Gael have said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  We have not said that we disapprove of that but we have said that in the light of the obligations already imposed on our economy by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the possibility of EEC membership, we regret &ldquo;the failure of the Government to take more realistic preparatory steps both at home and abroad.&rdquo;  That is what we are speaking on today.  We charge the Government with failure to give the people at home the true facts of the situation.  Personally I would leave to those abroad the onus of getting some of the true facts themselves but the Government have a very real duty to place the facts in front of the people.  They have been haunted by the ghosts of their <Col N="914" /> own past and that is the simple and naked truth of this situation because it is not a question of whether we go into the EEC or stay out of it.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Taoiseach yesterday &mdash;and indeed we knew it before&mdash;the position is that if Britain goes into the EEC, we, in no circumstances whatsoever, can afford to stay out of it.  That is the truth and that should be the fundamental thing.  This debate is not really about whether we should go into the EEC or not.  That is something that is as clear as crystal in front of us.  We must do it because we cannot afford to have the very big tariffs put up against us which automatically will have to be put up by Britain, who is our best customer.  It would mean that there would be very big tariffs against all our industrial products entering Northern Ireland and Britain, and also enormous tariffs against our industrial goods seeking to enter the European Community.  That in fact would not hinder us so much because the trade we do with those countries at the present moment, when those tariffs are there, is, unfortunately, rather slight.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when the Government opposite spoke about alternative markets and there were great searchings for these markets.  It was right that those searchings should be made for alternative markets.  In fact, tragically they did not just work out.  Personally, I would not have called them alternative markets: I would have called them additional markets.  I do not see why any markets should be alternative.  That is where politics impinged again on the economy. We now think of them as alternative markets and not additional markets.</P>
    <P>Now, we know that the amount of trade we do with the EEC, whilst it is very welcome, such as it is, in fact would not keep our industries going. That is a particular aspect of the industrial side of our exports.  What I am saying is solid fact.  It is not palatable to me.  I do not like that Ireland should be entirely dependent on trying to get markets which up to now have never existed in the EEC countries and also that we should be <Col N="915" /> entirely dependent for our industrial export trade on Great Britain.  It would be much better if we would regard Great Britain herself as trading with the rest of the world.  Maybe in time we might for certain items do that but it will not keep our people in gainful employment in the near future, without really thinking for a moment that in the far distant future we would be able to do that either. That is the position of entering EEC from the industrial point of view.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the agricultural point of view, we find that in regard to our livestock trade, overnight, if Britain goes into the EEC, it would mean, I am told, that there would be a figure of £27 per head against our cattle as well as against our cattle in all EEC countries.  I am not prepared to stand over that figure as being absolutely correct but certainly tariffs would be raised against our cattle of such a magnitude that it would be extremely unlikely that we could get them in or alternatively, would not be worth our farmers' while to produce them.  That is something we could not tolerate for one moment.  Our economy could not continue if we were in that position.</P>
    <P>That has not been clearly put in front of our people.  One of the reasons is, as I say, the ghosts of the past are haunting the Party opposite.  They should have put it clearly before the people.  I know it would be a blow because of the high tariff policy in the past.  In the 1930s, the industrial potential, the industrial arm, of this country was built up on a high tariff policy.  I think it worth while to recapitulate these facts.  They are historical facts.  They are not something invented by me.  They are on the records of this House and they are well known to anybody who takes the smallest amount of trouble to go into the facts of tariff history in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The original Cumann na nGaedheal Government, as it was, put on tariffs. Their policy was a policy of selective tariffs.  They took certain industries and protected them.  They believed that was in the best interests of the <Col N="916" /> national economy and that those industries were industries that could be carried out with materials which lay to our hands; in other words, materials which were a part of our agricultural life, or indeed of our industrial life and of our mineral products, such few as they are.  We know that up to now we have not been fortunate in discovering the mineral products on which the great industries of the big manufacturing countries are based.</P>
    <P>We had originally the selective tariff policy.  The present Government then came in and adopted this policy of high tariffs.  Behind that high tariff wall, our industries started.  I remember protective tariffs as high as 150 per cent.  Some of those industries prospered and some did not, even with the very high tariffs.  We as a Party always felt that there was a great danger inherent in the high tariff policy.  After the two wars, the 1914 and the 1939 wars, the European countries put their heads together and stopped putting up prohibitive tariffs against one another.  The volume of trade is so immense in those countries that they have enjoyed, for the past few years, a prosperity, both industrially and agriculturally, which they have never enjoyed before.</P>
    <P>It is not likely, at the same time, that the world will turn from a policy of tariffs to a policy of doing away with them generally.  That is what has happened in European countries who banded themselves together and said: &ldquo;We will sell to one another without putting up tariffs.&rdquo;  Great Britain is trying to get into that group.  We are trying to get in too, but our staying in or out depends mainly on Great Britain.  This does not mean that she has the veto but certainly if she goes in, in no circumstances could we afford to stay out.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine asked me a couple of months ago what I thought about the Common Market.  I said: &ldquo;Well, if by any chance we stay out of it, we will be ruined entirely.  If we go into it, our industries and our agriculture will go through an appallingly difficult time; our capital will go through a very <Col N="917" /> difficult time; and our trade will also go through a very difficult time.&rdquo;  I am connected with and have some knowledge of the building trade.  I know of certain industries that will not and could not survive a reduction of tariffs. I am not moving outside the trade which I know and there are some of those which may produce good products. It is not a question of that but the whole set-up of some of these means that they will find themselves in a very difficult position if we go into the Common Market, and even when the full effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement come to be felt, they will feel the draught very badly.  I am not going to name those industries which I think will not survive, and I hope I may be wrong in what I am saying, but I do not think I am.</P>
    <P>Where there is a high degree of research content in a business or industry, it will be increasingly difficult for our local industries to find the money for research scientists and research work on a large scale.  I can think of a whole range of research, such as medical research, which it would be extremely difficult for Irish firms to carry out.  There are many other industries which require a high degree of research and one of the reasons why that sort of thing would affect us greatly is that in modern times there are constantly changing recipes and formulae for various products.  Something new might be produced, and if we were not in touch with the original people who produced it, we would not be able to produce it.  In another instance, there may be a great variety of patterns and it would be difficult for our industries, working for a market of three million people, to produce that variety of patterns.  Then there is the old story of heavy industries based on mineral raw material.  We have not many of them but some of those we have would find it very difficult to carry on.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the whole set-up of some of our local industries. In some cases they are only subsidiaries of foreign firms and the question will be the extent to which the parent companies will take over when tariffs <Col N="918" /> are reduced.  Those are the questions which can only be answered by the people in the industries and they will be loath to say it in public.  I will not name any single one of these industries because other factors might come in and things sometimes do not turn out as black as they seem to be. However, this is something that should be discussed openly and frankly.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach touched on one particular matter in his speech yesterday but he could only touch on it.  We have followed here a policy, introduced by Fine Gael in inter-Party times, a policy of export encouragement. Whether they be by way of direct subsidy or by way of tax relief, those various forms of encouragement, and they can be quite considerable, might come in conflict with the policies of EEC.  Those are all things which are going to make the European Economic Community something the like of which this country has never seen before.  There will be tremendous changes of capital, tremendous movements of labour and goodness knows, we have had enough movements of labour in this country.  But we have come out of it all right.</P>
    <P>This is not like a football or a hurling match in which one can pull up one's socks and go into win.  This is going to mean a fundamental change in the lives of the Irish people and it is not going to be very pleasant.  I hope what we have been told will prove to be true, that we are going to emerge better and richer from it, but we have heard nothing from the Government to indicate how that will come about.  If we go into it, we will find it very difficult, and if we stay out of it, we will be ruined.  Of course, for a Government to put that bluntly to their people would probably mean that they would be hunted out of office in a few weeks, but this Government should have thought out some better way of telling our people the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>We are a very tiny country, gamely doing our best, and we now have to take the fearful step of trying to get into the EEC, but even in Great Britain, there are people who are afraid of the effects on British industry <Col N="919" /> and trade generally of membership of the Community.  As she is one of the greatest industrial countries in the world, she need not be unduly fearful, but we have not had long enough to develop our infant industries.  I heard one of the speakers on the Labour side of the House blaming the management of many of our native industries which he said started behind others.  Of course that is true in certain cases They started as a result of political influence rather than on a commercial basis, or on industrial skill.  I hope that since the early days of the commencement of many of these industries they have built up an industrial know-how and have been able to perfect their skills.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in facing facts.  How can a small country regrettably isolated from the rest of Europe, stand alone? If you look at the map, you will see that we are right out in the Atlantic. It certainly will take all our knowledge, all our skill and all our energy to develop and to keep an industrial arm, since we are close to one of the greatest industrial countries in the world and since we lie 300 to 400 miles from ports from which some of the biggest industrial countries can send goods cheaply by sea to our ports.</P>
    <P>These are the geographical and economic facts of the situation.  I do not think they should frighten us unduly, but certainly the situation is one of tremendous &mdash; I was almost about to say appalling &mdash; significance for us.  We are facing one of the greatest difficulties economically this country has ever faced because we are facing the fact that our infant industries&mdash;and they are infant in size and in age compared with many others&mdash; are now quite suddenly about to face the full blast of unrestricted competition from a group of countries, comprised of several hundred million people.</P>
    <P>That is what will happen, if and when we join the Common Market. That is what the Government should have been putting very clearly in front of our people.  They have not been <Col N="920" /> putting it to the extent they should have.  They have been afraid to tell the people the truth which I have tried to do here today.  I hope it has not been too harsh and I hope it will not frighten people.  I sincerely wish I could see it in a more optimistic light.</P>
    <P>I will close on this note.  Although these are the dangers inherent for our agriculture and our industry, still I believe that we will adapt ourselves. Man is infinitely adaptable and the Irish are as adaptable as any other race, if not more so.  We are facing a terrible situation and when I use the word &ldquo;terrible&rdquo;, I mean that I believe it to be a very difficult situation for our industries, that is, if and when we join the Common Market. It should be remembered that we are on the horns of the classical dilemma. If we stay out, the position will be worse.  This Party believe that in all the circumstances it is right that we should go into the European Economic Community, but we also believe that the Government should take much more active steps in relation to the truths of this inherently dangerous situation which very clearly confronts our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the question of Ireland's entry to the European Economic Community, we are discussing a momentous event in the history of this nation; but, so momentous is it that it appears to me some people have allowed their wills and their imaginations to become paralysed by the extent of the possible change involved and, having viewed the possibility of the loss and danger involved in it, put their heads in the sand and said: &ldquo;No; do not change; let us stay the way we are.&rdquo;  Even if we could do this, I think it would be a poor reflection on the people of this country were they to adopt such an attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, this course is not open to us.  It seems to me that in a debate such as this, we must first of all, be clear in our minds as to what is involved for us, what choice is open to us and where we stand in this <Col N="921" /> movement that is going on.  The principal objections that are being made to joining the European Economic Community could, I think, be largely put under three headings&mdash; economic, political and cultural.  I shall deal with the economic side last because I think it will take more time than the others.</P>
    <P>On the political level, I should like to ask those who are objecting on this ground or dragging their feet&mdash;and this might be a more accurate description of people in this House rather than outside it&mdash;do they believe that from this tremendous development taking place in Europe, one that has been sought for many a long year, through many a war and through many a famine, we should stand aside?  Are we or are we not a part of Europe?  Are our traditions, our beliefs, the things which we hold sacred, not a part of the European heritage and have we not contributed a great deal to that European heritage?  Is it not ours to a great extent in the sense that we have contributed to it?  Is it not ours to an even greater extent because of the fact that these are our traditions?  This is where we come from.  We are European and can we afford to stand aside while Europe is organising itself to ensure that the values, which are known as European values, the heritage which is certainly that of Europe&mdash;the belief in democracy, the belief in the right of the individual&mdash; these values which have come from Europe and have been developed in Europe, are preserved.  These values are in danger of being swamped in this world today and this is all the more reason, therefore, why Europe must organise itself and ensure the preservation of these values.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is part of the role of Ireland to stand aside in such an affair.  Ireland's role&mdash;if it can do so at all&mdash;is to get involved in this development, to contribute to it, and I think we have a lot to contribute to it.  We have demonstrated in the forum of the world&mdash;the United Nations&mdash;that what we have to contribute is greatly out of proportion to our relatively small size and influence otherwise.  We can contribute very much to the development <Col N="922" /> of Europe, to the political development of Europe, to ensuring that in so far as a European policy may emerge, it will be one based on the things which we hold dear. This is a matter of major importance for the future for our children and for their children.  It may not be of major importance this moment but we as a people are not living just for today and we have an obligation to contribute in so far as we can to that development, to the maintenance and, if possible, the expansion of the values of European culture in which we believe.</P>
    <P>On the political level, it has also been said that the objections which arise to the expansion of the Community are unreasonable.  Let me say that I would think, if anybody were to adopt the attitude that the Community should never be enlarged, this would not alone be unreasonable; it would be contrary to the Treaty of Rome and would spell the death knell of the effort to organise Europe.  But I do not think anybody has said that. Rather, I think what has been stressed is a fact which has not become sufficiently clear to most people in the English-speaking countries, that is, that what has been achieved in the European Economic Community to date has been achieved as a result of tremendous efforts, sacrifices, compromises and worked out with immense difficulty and tedium.  There is a very genuine fear that all these efforts, all those sacrifices and all that they augur for the future might be endangered if at this moment there were to be an enlargement of the Community.  I think this is a reasonable and a genuine fear but I also believe that the greater need of the Community and of Europe is that the Community should be expanded and, while there are risks inherent in that expansion, it is not by any means impossible to work out arrangements whereby the existing balance within the Community will not be upset.</P>
    <P>The advent of new members would, of course, mean changes in the voting structure in the various institutions in the Community but I do not think this presents any insuperable <Col N="923" /> problems.  In particular, I do not think it presents insuperable problems, having regard to the applicant countries.  It would, I think, upset the balance of the Community if at present only one large nation were to be admitted or only one small nation were to be admitted, but I think the present applicants, in themselves, constitute a bloc which can be integrated within the Community without upsetting the balance.  I also think that the Community institutions could be used by us to great effect to overcome a number of the difficulties which people here anticipated arising from our membership of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the objections of some people could be grouped under the heading of the cultural field.  I want to say I am convinced that the greatest shot in the arm which Irish culture and the Irish language could obtain would be our becoming a member of the European Economic Community.  There are far too many people in this country who&mdash;whether they know it or not&mdash;think that the world is bounded by Britain on one side and the United States on the other.  Most of our people, when they receive news from outside the country, receive it through this source and receive it in the English language. Naturally, news from this source in the English language takes a certain line. I do not say it is slanted but it is interested only in certain things, and interest in matters relating to continental Europe tends to be minimal, with the result that we are subjected all the time to a very powerful form of culture, against which our own culture, with all its vicissitudes, is struggling, and it is a real and difficult struggle.</P>
    <P>I believe that the more we become aware of the fact that there are other cultures besides the English-speaking cultures; and that they involve the great traditions of Europe, that freedom and democracy do not have to be spoken of in English to be real&mdash;the more we realise that there are other small countries in Europe with the same kind of values as we have, who do not speak English, who have their own cultures and who are cultivating <Col N="924" /> these, who are not asking that their language or their culture be abolished so that they can improve their trading position within Europe and the more our people get a view of reality in Europe&mdash;the better it will be for our culture and our language.  Of that I am quite certain and I think the fears expressed with regard to our culture and our language in Europe are completely misplaced.</P>
    <P>The main discussions in regard to our membership of the Community, of course, hinge on the economic front and, in this field, we find that many people seem to take the view that they can see only difficulties, no advantages, so they say: &ldquo;Let us not go in; we cannot take the chance; the damage will be too great.&rdquo;  I do not think this is true.  There are grave risks but this is what life is about.  Life is full of risks.  All of us run risks every day of our lives and the people who progress, the people who find life is worth living, the people who justify their creation on this earth, are the people who run these risks, who work constructively to improve the lot of themselves and of their fellowmen; and any attitude of hiding one's head in the sand is not only ignoble but highly ineffective.</P>
    <P>If we do not want to hide our heads in the sand, we must look at the situation as we see it, as it really is for us. What we see is that if Britain joins the Community and we do not, the common external tariff of the Common Market will be applied between Britain and ourselves against 70 per cent of our foreign trade, either immediately or gradually, probably gradually.  If we join the Common Market and Britain does not, the same situation will arise.  It is quite unrealistic to expect anything else, and if that situation arises, are we then better off than we are at present?</P>
    <P>Clearly this, if it were to happen, would be disastrous for this country and would be of serious economic import for Britain.  This kind of problem has arisen in fact in connection with the Austrian negotiations with the Community for a treaty of association. Incidentally, on the question of association, if one goes by the example of <Col N="925" /> the Austrian negotiations, it is not encouraging because they have been going on for years.  It seems clear that if and when those negotiations are completed, they will involve, to some extent at any rate, Austria withdrawing from EFTA or being involved in EEC tariffs against the EFTA group. If the EEC is enlarged, and being enlarged, a number of EFTA members go in, the position would be different for Austria.</P>
    <P>This is the reality as far as we are concerned economically.  As I say, we must never forget that statistic, whether we like it or not, that there is still 70 per cent of our foreign trade with Britain, including agriculture.  I might add that in the situation as envisaged about the common external tariff being raised between ourselves and Britain, if Britain went in and we did not, this would occur at a time when Britain would be reducing her duties against the EEC countries and therefore the position would be even worse</P>
    <P>We have in Europe today two trade blocs, EEC and EFTA, and they have achieved, or are about to achieve, complete free trade in industrial goods; and indeed within the EEC, they may even reach free trade in agricultural goods and they have gone a good distance along that road.  We are outside both blocs.  This is the background against which we must consider our situation and we cannot do one thing to change that situation that exists in Europe, even if we wanted to.  The position is that all the countries of Western Europe with which we do any significant trade will have or already have abolished tariffs against trade between them, in one group or the other, and we are outside both.</P>
    <P>These are the facts of life that we must face.  It is an economic environment that exists to which we must adjust ourselves.  We cannot isolate ourselves from this kind of development because to a greater extent than any other country in Europe, we live by external trade.  We are heading into free trade because this is the environment that exists, and in the interests of our economy, we have got to do it. <Col N="926" /> We know there may be painful adjustments involved in this, particularly in the short term, but they are not nearly as dangerous as the adjustments we would have to make if we were to sit aside while the world moves on, if we were to remain in the first half of the twentieth century while Europe moves into the second half.</P>
    <P>I suggest that anybody who objects to the course the Government are following in regard to application for membership of the Community must face these facts and must give us an alternative, if he does not agree with the course being followed.  It seems to me that the attitude of the Labour Party in this matter is to say the least ambiguous.  We do not know whether the Labour Party are in favour of our joining the EEC as full members or not.  I thought at one stage they were; now I am not so sure.  They have dragged their feet on this issue and there have been suggestions from them that rather than seek full membership, we should become associated with the Common Market.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear before that there is no such thing as associate membership of the Community.  A country can be associated with it. Association means that you conclude a trade agreement with the Common Market and nobody can say what that trade agreement would involve.  It would be the result of bargaining which would take place, with us in a very weak position as compared with the other party to the agreement.  Nobody could say what we would achieve in such an agreement, but assuming we got a reasonably satisfactory agreement, we would have no say thereafter in the changes that would take place within the Community, in the direction of the common agricultural policy or in any of the other aspects which the Community is developing.  It is a dynamic, developing community.  It is changing all the time and will continue to change for many years to come.</P>
    <P>If we had formal association with the Community, we would have no say in this: we would have to take what came.  I do not think that is a position <Col N="927" /> any of us would want to see ourselves in but those who oppose the course which the Government have adopted are obliged, if they want to be taken seriously, to demonstrate that it would be better for us to conclude a treaty of association or to have no association or membership.  It is not enough to point out the difficulties and to drag one's feet.  This matter is too serious for the future of this country, and it behoves us as politicians elected here to deal with matters such as this and to show clearly where we stand, to give a lead to our people, and if we honestly do not favour a particular course, to say so, and not to be trying to achieve a Tadhg-an-dá-thaobh situation where whatever happens, we can say we were right.  This matter is so serious that the Irish people are entitled to more than that from their elected representatives.</P>
    <P>It should be clear to us, even from a cursory examination of our economy, that if we are to have any hope of expanding our economy, of raising the standard of living of our people, of improving our social services, the only real way we can achieve this is by expanding our exports.  With a small home market which is, to a great extent, saturated by our own produce at the moment, the only real hope of expansion lies in expanding exports.  The evidence is there that we have the capacity for such expansion, both in agriculture and industry.  In money terms, the export of industrial goods rose from £33 million, approximately, in 1956 to £96 million in 1966.  Industrial exports as a percentage of total exports rose in the same period from 25.9 per cent to 40.7 per cent.  This is no mean achievement, but we can do better, we will have to do better than that.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the fact that too many people seem to have no faith in the ability of our industries to compete. I want to point out that that record alone is spectacular and shows what we are able to achieve. If anyone says to me: &ldquo;That is all right, but it was achieved in the British Market where we had a preference or, in recent times, <Col N="928" /> free entry&rdquo;, I want to point out to them that 40 per cent of our manufactured goods exports go to places other than Britain where they are competing in world markets without preference. That is something of which we should be conscious.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say that the situation is going to be easy, but it is no good for us to go into this situation of the Common Market and free trade without faith in our industrialists and exporters.  It is on them we depend largely.  If we are not only to survive&mdash; that is not good enough&mdash;but to improve our standard of living, we must depend on our industrialists, and particularly our exporters.  We want to help them in any way we can.  Let us not decry their efforts; let us not assume that they are not able to compete. They have demonstrated that they are able to compete, and compete successfully.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have at the moment, especially having regard to the vital necessity to export, is that too few of our firms are exporting.  Out of approximately 2,000 firms producing goods which could be sold on the export market only 750, roughly, are exporting.  This is a higher percentage than in many other countries, but it is not high enough for us.  We have to get these other 1,250 or 1,300 firms who are not exporting to export.  We are devoting particular attention to those firms to try to induce them to do so.</P>
    <P>The fact that we still have that relatively high number of firms which could export not exporting indicates the number of firms which have not been able to read the writing on the wall.  One would have thought it was clear enough by now.  Firms which are content to stay in the home market are going to have very difficult times in the years ahead because, in effect, there will be no home market in the sense that with free trade, goods from other countries will come in here and will be competing in this market with our manufacturers.  So, unless our manufacturers can get a foothold in the export market now, they will find it much more difficult to do so in the future.  They now have a few years in which to do it while there is still protection <Col N="929" /> for the home market base. Those who have gone into the export market, and those who will go into the export market within the next few years, are very likely not only to survive but to do very well.  If we go into the EEC, those who are not making a real effort will not do well, and may not survive.</P>
    <P>The Government have never pretended that joining the EEC will not create problems for Irish industry.  It will, and we know very well it will.  In fact, we have assessed, and are continuing to assess, the problems for Irish industry sector by sector, to isolate these problems in free trade conditions, with a view to assisting those sectors of industry as effectively as we can to overcome the difficulties which we see arising.  We know that some of our industries will gain, and gain substantially, by reason of the opening up of the huge continental markets without duties being placed against our goods, but we also know that some of our firms are going to be adversely affected.  By and large, as I have said, the ones which will be adversely affected are those which have not made any preparation and have not tried to get into exports.</P>
    <P>We must remember that we cannot have it both ways.  We cannot have free trade in certain sectors where it suits us, and not have it in other sectors where it does not.  Free trade means free trade all across the board. We hope that in joining the Community we will be able to arrange for the removal of protection on a gradual basis for a reasonable transitional period, but we should recall also that there is very likely to be a demand that if we want a transitional period, say, for industry, the same kind of transitional period will apply against our goods, industrial or agricultural, going into the Common Market.  Even assuming that we can achieve a reasonable transitional period, this should not give any false sense of security to industry.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of going into the Common Market will be to oblige us to bring our tariffs into line with the common external tariffs of the EEC. <Col N="930" /> This is likely to have two main effects on Irish industry.  Where we have duties at the moment against goods coming in, other than from Britain, they are, generally speaking, at a higher level than the common external tariffs of the EEC.  Where that obtains, we will have to reduce our tariffs against third countries down to the level of the common external tariff. Having regard to the fact that there has been a reduction in the common external tariff as a result of the Kennedy Round, we may take it that the duties we impose against third countries will be substantially reduced eventually.  This will make it easier for these third countries, that is, non-EEC countries, to sell in the Irish market but, in certain sectors in which this could cause undue difficulty, we may be able to avail of the provisions of the common commercial policy of the EEC to restrict imports from low cost and state trading countries.  The EEC are still working out this common commercial policy and the ultimate aim is that all the member States of the EEC will eventually have common arrangements covering all aspects of trade between them and the non-EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of reducing our tariffs against third countries is the fact that some of our basic raw materials, which at present come in free of Irish duty, would become liable to the common external tariffs of the EEC, but, where our manufacturers are buying these raw materials at present either from the EEC or from some of the applicant countries, there should not be any great difficulty because there will be no tariff applied, if they are in, or if the raw materials are coming from within the Common Market.  However, where an Irish manufacturer at the moment is getting his raw materials from a non-EEC source, and where they are subject to a common external tariff, he will have to pay that tariff on the raw materials coming in.</P>
    <P>I should, I think, point out that any disadvantages which may arise for a manufacturer in that situation should be offset by the fact that, when he <Col N="931" /> manufactures his goods, he then has a much larger market in which he can sell without any tariff against his goods.  At present there is a substantial tariff against the bulk of the market which would then be open to him.  Our competitors, including Britain, would of course be subject to the same limitations.</P>
    <P>Not enough stress has, I believe, been placed on the fact that the market available to us in the Common Market is a vast one, and an expanding one, and we can derive considerable benefits from this.  We have demonstrated by our performance in the past that in certain sectors we can compete against goods in any part of the world.  In competing in the European market, with protection against competition from outside the Common Market, we are likely to do extremely well.  There are some sectors of industry at the moment&mdash;for instance, the clothing industry&mdash;in which we do not do a great deal of business, though we do some, with Common Market countries.  We do not do a great deal because the extent of the tariff against our goods is such as to make it almost uneconomic in most cases; but, if that were removed, our manufacturers are quite capable&mdash;they would, of course, have to alter some of their stylings, and so on&mdash;of competing very successfully in that market.</P>
    <P>In connection with the garment industry I might mention that we can, by supplying a very small percentage of the market which would be available in an expanded Common Market, derive certain advantages.  This would be of enormous importance to us but would have no major effect within the Common Market.  We could do this because, with certain distinctive styles of garments, the small numbers relatively coming in from us spread around the whole Community would constitute exclusive items commanding good prices.  This is one aspect of the industry which might, I think, be borne in mind.  There are some advantages in not being too large and in not being tied to enormous production runs and having to dispose of that production at any price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> We have already entered on an era of free trade with Britain and this is proceeding in accordance with the Free Trade Area Agreement, so that protection for our manufacturers is going in any event.  In this light, the additional competition which our industries will have to face as a result of joining the EEC will, I think, be small compared with the export opportunities which will be opened up.  It is true that most of our industries are small by Common Market standards but they can, by co-operation and rationalisation, improve their position enormously. I am not now speaking theoretically. I am speaking about things that are taking place.</P>
    <P>There is in my Department a branch known as the Industrial Reorganisation Branch.  That Branch is concerned with meeting industry on the shop floor and in the boardroom and urging industrialists on to co-operative marketing, to rationalisation, to mergers.  They have been quite successful in many fields and some of our firms, small by European standards, have co-operated.  They have gone into export marketing on a co-operative basis.  They have been very successful and there is obviously plenty of room for expansion of this idea.  The fact that our industries are small need not necessarily be a great inhibiting factor in competing in Europe.  There are certain advantages and some of the disadvantages can be overcome by an intelligent approach to the whole problem.</P>
    <P>Irish enterprises which have gone into the export field have, in the main, shown a steady expansion and a steady growth.  I believe this will be the situation in future within the Common Market in the case of those firms which are getting into the export market now, should we go into the Common Market.  They will continue to grow and expand.  This has been the experience of the smaller countries of the Common Market.  Many of them had the greatest fears as to what would happen to their industries and they have found that many of their industries have expanded and continue to grow.  Some of them suffered but, taking it over all, the net position is a <Col N="933" /> considerable gain to each of the countries concerned.  If we approach our problems in the right way, I believe we will have exactly the same result.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the position in Europe is that we have these two trading blocs abolishing tariffs between them.  As a result of Britain being a member of one of them, the value of our preferences in the British market has been steadily eroded.  We must, therefore, base our policies on this reality about which we cannot do anything except what we do ourselves and how we approach it.  We cannot prevent these developments.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to use all legitimate means to help any industry to survive which is willing to help itself. They will do everything possible to cushion the impact on workers who may find themselves displaced as a result of reorganisation and adjustment which will be forced on Irish industry.  The House is aware that arrangements are being made to enable workers to be retrained and resettled, where necessary, and to provide a scheme of redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>A factor we should bear in mind in regard to employment, apart from the expansion of employment in the firms which will do well in the Common Market, is that it is reasonable to assume that the number of foreign firms setting up in Ireland will increase when we are within the Common Market.  One of our difficulties in attracting foreign enterprise to this country at the moment is that, from here, we do not have access to the large European market.  If they had such access, combined with the pool of high-grade and adaptable labour which we have in this country, there is no doubt that many of them would want to come here and will come here when we are within the Common Market.  This should certainly operate effectively to offset disadvantages from the point of view of employment in firms which are either closing down or having to readjust or rationalise and thereby let people off.</P>

      <P>We have an infra-structure in this country which is of much greater strength than might perhaps be warranted by the level of our industrial development.  That means that we have an infra-structure which can carry a much greater industrial development than we have at present.  This is a potent factor in attracting foreign industry.  I have no doubt that a large number of foreign industries will want to set up in this country if and when we are in the <Col N="935" /> Common Market, the major factor for them being access to markets.  The other factors needed by them we have here in abundance and better than anybody competing with us.  The only thing needed from that point of view is access to much wider markets.</P>
      <P>The question of adaptation to free trade has been mentioned in the debate.  I think Deputy Cosgrave was of the opinion that we are not doing enough and that we are doing it on an indiscriminate basis rather than on a selective basis.  Physical adaptation, that is, the modernisation of equipment, premises, and so on, is a basic requirement in connection with preparation for free trade&mdash;and it is only the first step.  It is clear, I think, in the circumstances of Irish industry, that that kind of adaptation can be achieved only with State grants.  The ultimate test of the effectiveness of this type of adaptation will be the actual performance of Irish industry in a free trade situation.</P>
      <P>It would be quite wrong, I think, to assume that there has been anything hit and miss about the system of adaptation grants.  An Foras Tionscal, in deciding on applications for these grants, has available to it all the information obtained by my Department regarding conditions in the industry, the market situation and whether or not there is excess capacity. It also employs its own technical experts.</P>
      <P>I want to stress that physical adaptation is only the basic requirement. I mention rationalisation, amalgamation and the other steps.  The principal ingredient of adaptation, in my opinion, is a frame of mind which is never satisfied with the efficiency at present attained and which is always trying to improve on that efficiency, a state of mind which is conscious that, in commerce, we cannot stand still and must always be going forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the efforts which have been made to encourage Irish industry to adaptation have been on the right lines and in many cases have been quite effective and have not been confined merely to physical adaptation, as I <Col N="936" /> mentioned earlier.  However, as the Taoiseach stated yesterday, he is not satisfied nor am I, with the rate of adaptation which has been achieved: it has been good but it is not good enough.  I have made a number of efforts to speed up this process.  I have also made arrangements to meet the chairmen of adaptation councils to review their work.  I have made arrangements to meet representatives of industry, sector by sector, at regular intervals in co-operation with the Federation of Irish Industries.  I have also requested, in this connection, regular meetings with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Due to the absence of certain officers, I have not got a final reply to this but I have no reason to believe that the fullest co-operation will not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>What we have to ensure, what we have to devise, is some method of getting the message through, not to the firms which are adapting themselves&mdash; they are always the better ones&mdash;but to the ones to which the message does not yet appear to have got through.  It is largely a question of communication and I have been endeavouring to solve this problem, but if any Deputy has suggestions as to how it might be better solved, I will be very pleased to hear them.</P>
    <P>There has also been talk about dumping and there has been a complaint that there has been a delay on the part of the Government in introducing anti-dumping legislation.  I want to make it clear that I and the Government regard the introduction of this anti-dumping legislation as a matter of urgency, and have said so publicly.  However, it is pretty well known by those most directly concerned that some of the delay involved in introducing the anti-dumping legislation was due to the fact that we were endeavouring to get the most effective anti-dumping legislation we could.  We could have introduced legislation earlier which would have been less effective.  We could also refer to the fact that when the legislation was drafted, after all the negotiations which were involved, both nationally and internationally, regulation <Col N="937" /> tions to which we have to conform internationally in the GATT were changed, with the result that the draft of the legislation had to be changed again.  Did the Deputy say something?</P>

      <P>As I say, we regard this question of anti-dumping legislation as a matter of importance and urgency but I should point out that under the tariffs and regulations which are in force at the moment, we have more control than we would have under anti-dumping legislation which conforms to international requirements. This is generally true and the urgency arises as our tariffs go down. This is when we need the anti-dumping legislation most.  At present in most fields the control we can exercise is more effective than it would be if we were relying solely on anti-dumping legislation, but as the House knows, the legislation has been introduced by way of Long and Short Titles and will, I hope, be passed in the coming session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the Government have not been sufficiently active in contacts with members of the Six.  It is easy, of course, to make this kind of allegation; it is not quite so easy to refute it.  However, I want to make it clear that the contacts which have been maintained with the Six, with the Commission, have been very effective and have kept us fully informed. We have, in fact, in the recent White Paper, made available to the House and the public generally the information available up to that time on the discussions and developments within the Community in various fields.  I also want to make it clear <Col N="938" /> that when I visited the Commission in February of this year, I discussed with them almost every possible area in which my Department might be concerned in the event of our entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I discussed with them the developments which had taken place within the Community, the projected developments and the chances of those developments taking place and when they were likely to take place I know that other Ministers have done likewise so that we are very well informed in relation to the situation obtaining. There are a number of things which I could say to the House about our position in regard to various items, the position that we should like to see, the position that we would be prepared to accept, and the position we would not accept at all, but it should be made clear to the House that, to say the least, it would be very foolish of me to talk in these terms.  The Labour Party's amendment is very naïve in this regard.</P>

We are telling them as much as we can but they do not want us to give away our negotiating position. If Deputy O'Leary thinks they do, he had better consult them again and he will find out.  I want to remind Deputy O'Leary, because he was not here when I said it before, that it is not good enough in this day and age, in this important matter for the Irish people, to come in and say: &ldquo;Well, we would like this or that&rdquo;.

      <P>I want the Deputy to tell the House how he expects our negotiators to negotiate when their whole brief has been laid before the public.  Does he think the Irish people are as naïve as all that?  They are not. The Irish people have shown time after time their faith in the Fianna Fáil Government and in its ability to look after their interests to the extent that this is possible.  No Government claims it can do everything infallibly, and we do not claim it.  But we do claim that, as far the interests of the Irish people are concerned, our record shows that we have always been devoted to the interests of the Irish people.  We have worked for those interests and we have made sacrifices for those interests.  We <Col N="940" /> believe we can stand on that record. We know that the Irish people again and again have demonstrated their faith in this Party and in its ability to look after the interests of the Irish people.  In this major, momentous issue of membership of the Common Market the Irish people will continue to repose their confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government, and no amount of sniping, whether naïve or pseudo-naïve, as I suspect it may be, is going to alter that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment we put down is, we think, representative of a responsible Opposition's viewpoint of the present Government's plans, and the account of them we have had, for entry into Europe.  We seek to get information under the headings we have requested of the effects of this move by the Government on our national sovereignty and on trade, employment, industry and agriculture.  From the very outset we have made it clear we do not ask the Government to declare the full extent of their hand in any detailed negotiations, but we ask for much the same rights as any other European country has asked of its Government&mdash;what are the areas of concern, the areas that would be particularly subject to sensitive negotiations in our application for membership.  This has been all the more marked in our case because the Irish economy is unique in comparison with that of any of the other ten who may eventually make up the membership of this Community.  It is unique in every respect, unique in its state of underdevelopment, unique in having one capital market, one labour market and in being a cultural slum of our neighbouring island, Great Britain. No other country involved in the present applications for entry to the EEC is in this unique position.  As a result of it, and as a result of our extreme dependence, which no other European country shares, on a neighbouring country, we have sought certain assurances from the Government that they are aware of this extraordinary weakness of the Irish economy in relation to the EEC negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> We have also sought this information because it has been a feature of the entire debate on entry into the EEC that very little has come out of it that would seek to go into the pros and cons of membership and what it would mean for us.  Admittedly, in most discussion under this heading the answer has been made that such discussion is of no avail.  Because the country is tied so closely with Britain, we do not have any choice and, therefore, to discuss the one or two alternatives is at this stage ridiculous and naïve, to put it in its proper terms.  This may very well be true.  It may be naïve to suggest at this stage that we should attempt even now to consider the alternatives and the balance of disadvantage in any of the courses that may lie open to us.  But it is the essence of brazenness for the head of this Government to taunt an Opposition in this country with the paucity of the alternatives and options left for this country when the Government have been in direct control of the destiny of 26 counties for the past 30 years.  Surely this must be a new low in responsible, so-called Irish government?</P>
    <P>Anyone looking seriously at the set-up in which this country is placed must realise it is a very difficult situation. As a member of this Party, I would be the last to hide the fact that our position is one in which we see that there are very few choices remaining in which it is not over-exaggerating the tragedy of our situation to say we are left very much with Hobson's choice. I do not deny that we cannot avoid having some kind of trading relationship with this Common Market, this marketing giant growing up on our doorstep.  This is all the more so if Britain, on whom we have for over 45 years of our so-called independence intensified our dependence, goes into the Common Market.  Because we are so tied hand and foot to Britain, we must have some relationship with the countries of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The whole debate should centre on what type of relationship that should be.  It is not right merely to dismiss all the possible nuances of that kind of relationship and only see this matter <Col N="942" /> in black and white terms, full membership or nothing.  Anybody looking at our situation honestly must realise that the decision we make in this matter is one that will colour the whole future of the development of whatever country may be left to us.  In recent years&mdash; also unique in Europe&mdash;we have had a catastrophic drain on our manpower from rural areas and from city areas. If in the future, as a result of any new economic relationship, this tendency is intensified, it means that this country, in terms of having even a little say in its own destiny, will have passed the point of no return and will have reached the stage of Monaco or some other place.</P>
    <P>If the whole ethos governing the Common Market set-up is planned competition, the drawing up of regulations for as much free competition as possible between equals in industry, one may wonder how this country of ours, where industry is so thinly spread, will fare.  We have been attempting to get as much control as possible into the hands of the Government, to plan economic development in parts of the country not so well developed.  We wonder if that kind of control we have sought to have over our economic destiny can continue in this new set-up. One must question the kind of future facing us in the Common Market in that particular area.</P>
    <P>We are justified as a Party before the Irish people in putting the question marks, in trying to spell out as far as we can some of the problems we see looming before us in this Common Market set-up, especially if, on the other side, the minimum information is given by the Government about what might be expected to happen to the Irish economy in free trade conditions. Instead we have been fed on a diet of our European connections, of our contributions to European history and culture and of the possibility of our further contributions.  As far as I am concerned, my enthusiasm for Europe begins and ends with the possibilities it has for this country of mine. As regards the future of Europe, I have no interest, if it means the extinction of this country as a nation or the passing of the point of no return.  I have no use for Europe in terms of <Col N="943" /> de Gaulle's idea of the Europe of the Fatherlands or the Hallsteinian idea of a federation of Europe, if this country goes down in the process.  I, unashamedly, admit myself to be a narrow nationalist in looking only to the future of this country.  The amendment in the name of this Party is put down on the basis of the future of the Irish people. This is all we are concerned with.  Let Government Ministers take part in European moonshine about the future of Europe.  It is the future of this country, inside or outside Europe, that I am interested in.</P>
    <P>So far, the Government have convinced me in no White Paper that they are in possession of the facts as to the possibilities of prosperity or otherwise that membership of Europe will mean.  The Taoiseach's speech was directed, as could only be understood in the circumstances, to the most part&mdash;and I suppose this is sufficient tribute and underlined the wisdom in putting down the amendbent&mdash;to the points we raised in our amendment.  This serves its function, that we have succeeded in getting the Head of Government to begin to attempt to formulate the Government's answers to some of the questions we have raised.  He has attempted, to the best of his ability, to examine what the Government's attitude is to some of the questions raised.</P>
    <P>We mentioned national sovereignty and the Taoiseach makes the comparison that we will lose no more national sovereignty than we would lose in participation in any international body.  This is palpably untrue and not in accordance with the facts. There can be no comparison between the kind of diminution of political sovereignty&mdash;the little we do enjoy&mdash; involved in the EEC set up and the diminution of political sovereignty that would occur in participation in the United Nations or the Council of Europe.  There is a difference between one and the other.  It is certainly laid down in the Rome Treaty that there would be severe limitations on the exercise of both political and social objectives employed by member Governments, by regulation or otherwise.  It <Col N="944" /> is quite clearly spelled out there that the Rome Treaty demands that there be certain supranational powers employed over and above those enjoyed by member Governments.  Therefore, there is no comparison between our previous experience of our participation in international bodies and what may eventuate by membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>We have mentioned trade and, again, this is clouded in very romantic language by certain supporters of our entry to the EEC and as far as we can see there has been very little dealing in the facts as to what we may expect in matters of trade in membership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, leading for this Party, has already referred to our fears in regard to employment.  Again, he threw down the figure to the Government, if you recall, from the Committee of Industrial Organisation, that if all adaptation measures were taken we could expect to see something like 12,000 redundant and, if none or not sufficient were taken, we could expect a figure of 45,000 redundant, in terms of freer trade.  Again, we ask for no secret from the Government, we do not ask them to give away part of their hidden hand in the negotiations but we do ask, at least, that they should be able to assure these unfortunate people who work in Irish industry that their future is secure to some extent in this free trade future. This information has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that Parties such as Labour should put out the objections as we see them, the other side of the picture, and the questions ordinary people are asking.  All the more important is that in view of the fact that this side of the case has not been put by any political Party in this House.  The Fine Gael addendum does not ask the questions we have sought to ask.  The Fine Gael addendum restricts itself merely to saying the Government have not done enough fast enough in terms of adaptation.  Yet, to read yesterday's press one would imagine that the real Opposition Party, putting the opposition point of view in this House, as we put it, has been the Fine Gael Party in their addendum. This is the politics of the present free <Col N="945" /> trade argument.  I have many good friends in Fine Gael and in Fianna Fáil but the politics of this situation show that on this question of freer trade there is one Party ranged on one side for entry, without worrying about its effects on this country, and that is those primarily in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and, on the other hand, Labour and the trade unions are the only element asking the awkward questions, who are not committed to any enthusiasm for any free trade that will do harm to this country eventually. Yet, in yesterday's press, the comments on our amendment are lumped as only trivial points of a small Party.</P>
    <P>Agreed that there has been a very well financed lobby in this country for the past five or six years who have pushed propaganda, day in, day out, on the mythical advantages of EEC membership for this country, who have poured money into lectures and seminars throughout the country calling for early entry into the Common Market and expecting extraordinary returns. Very many individual Deputies have fallen dupes for this propaganda without questioning what are the real worries and concerns of the Irish people and what are the real interests of the Irish people involved in such exercise.</P>
    <P>It is one of the tragedies and ironies of the situation that the Fianna Fáil Government, who originally set out to attempt to run some kind of independent Government, are today in the vanguard of handling up the very last piece of sovereignty we have.  In fact, one rather crude way of expressing the present pressure to enter the EEC is to describe it as the swan song of the 26 County experiment, the end of the road for the so-called Independence Movement that some of the veterans on the other side of the House led 45 or 46 years ago.  This being the case, we must be assured that the Government are conscious of the uneasiness in the weak sectors of our economy. The question must be asked whether Fianna Fáil have grown tired of the industrial worker and whether the parting of the wavs has not, in fact, at last caught up with them, whether the lack <Col N="946" /> of urgency in the adaptation of industry in the past few years shows the lack of serious intention on the Government's part to prepare our economy for the eventuality of free trade; whether in fact, the Government have not decided to jettison the industrial worker in terms of free trade, whether, in fact, in conformity with the political support coming to the Fianna Fáil Government in these days, they are now prepared to retreat to the rural corners for future support and to desert the industrial workers of the cities to their fate. This may be a loose reading of the situation but, undoubtedly, the kind of preparations taken in face of what may be in store in the Common Market suggest that they are no longer interested in the future of the industrial worker in this country.</P>
    <P>The Common Market and the countries involved in that experiment have never been at pains to disguise the fact that more is involved than merely an economic gathering of nations in Europe.  They have been at pains&mdash;and the Taoiseach has mentioned this in his opening speech referring to the Bonn Convention of 1961&mdash;to make it understood from the beginning that there were obligations other than economic involved in membership of the EEC.  There is no excuse for ignoring these political implications of entry into Europe, ignoring them in the Taoiseach's sense. They must be considered as part of entry into Europe.  Admittedly, there is the argument going on as to the kind of Europe that would emerge between the Gaullist idea of the Europe of the Fatherlands and the Hallsteinian idea of a looser federal arrangement but, no doubt, there are far reaching changes involved in entry which will mean overhaul of the ordinary ideas of the authority of this Parliament and of the Institutions in this country.</P>

      <P>Much has been done in recent years to make intending visitors to Ireland aware of the large number of monuments of historical and archaeological interest throughout the country, through publicity in publications such as the <i>Ireland Guide</i> and the <i>National Monuments Guide</i>.  Information of this nature is also publicised in each issue of Bord Fáilte's magazine <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> which has an estimated readership of over a quarter of a million and in other Bord Fáilte publications.  Posters have been distributed in recent years illustrating the Book of Kells, the Cross of Moone, the Rock of Cashel and Blarney Castle.  In addition, Bord Fáilte produced special leaflets in the past ten years featuring both archaeological monuments and places of religious interest.</P>
      <P>Visiting publicists, including journalists, radio, TV and film producers are also made aware of this material and as a result there has been a considerable amount of publicity abroad in major magazines and in films and TV programmes.</P>

      <P>The conduct of personnel negotiations with trade unions is, under sections 15 and 17 of the Turf Development Act, 1946, the statutory responsibility of Bord na Móna.  No ministerial instructions or policy directives as to the manner in which they should conduct personnel negotiations with trade unions have been issued to the Board.</P>
      <P>The Board has a long history of satisfactory relations with the trade unions and until this year there has never been an official strike in the Board.  The two official strikes which took place this year and the present manual workers' dispute have all been the subject of Labour Court hearings and subsequent recommendations in favour of the Board.</P>
      <P>The existing negotiating machinery of which Labour Court hearings and recommendations are an essential part has operated satisfactorily and I am unaware of any demand for an improvement in it.  If such a demand were to arise, the matter would be one for consideration by the Minister for Labour.  I should say in this regard that in a communication sent to all State companies for which I am responsible after the Minister for Labour was appointed, I asked for information on how far industrial relations, on the most modern basis, had been promoted.  This information was duly conveyed to the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his previous question on this subject on 14th June. As I indicated on that occasion, I am not aware that creameries have had any difficulty in disposing of surplus milk but I understand that a few creameries did experience difficulty in disposing of surplus skim during the period of peak milk deliveries this year.</P>
      <P>Discussions have taken place over the past few months between my Department, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, and representatives of co-operative societies and other interests regarding the establishment in the near future of additional plants for the manufacture of cheese and milk powder.</P>
      <P>These factories are, among other things, expected to make a major contribution towards problems of skim milk disposal over wide areas surrounding their location, but the creameries with which they are associated will naturally have first call on their services in this respect.  Those creameries which this year experienced some difficulty in disposing of surplus skim milk would, in my opinion, be well advised to adopt the solution which has proved successful elsewhere and, depending on their particular circumstances, either amalgamate with appropriate existing neighbouring groups that have access to diversification facilities or, where such facilities do not exist, co-operate with their neighbours in the erection of a suitable plant of their own.</P>

Is this not the time to take steps to ensure that there will be no recurrence of the situation which has arisen where it is a fact that hundreds of thousands of gallons of milk have had to be thrown down the drain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a shame for people to admit that they throw skim milk down the drain, because, apart from these facilities altogether, there was a time when skim milk was used for other purposes and it is surprising that it is no longer regarded as worth its place on the farm.  We do, by means of supports, which will probably run as high as £18 million this year, try to ensure that milk supplies will be taken up and that any surplus milk, that is, whole milk, does not become surplus to the point of throwing it away.  The extra skim milk which results from higher production of milk, which this year is running at 14 per cent above last year's level, together with the fact that higher prices are realised for skim milk, as high as 5d per gallon and perhaps <Col N="956" /> more in isolated cases, are factors which have caused more skim milk to be diverted by farmers from uses which were traditional in the past to this particular usage of having it manufactured. These factors are creating the difficulty and, as I have said, it is for the creameries themselves, with whom we have already had discussions and the IAOS who are very concerned about this matter, to initiate the steps that can be taken to provide additional facilities.  It is by getting together in groups of creameries that this can be done.  In many cases, it is only by getting together that it can be done, and unless it is done, there is not a great deal the Minister for Agriculture can do about it.  It is in their own interests that they should do it and those that have already done so know that not only is it in their interests but it is to their financial benefit as well.  Any help that can be given by the Government will be given.  As I said, we are supporting the milk industry probably to the tune of £18 million this year.</P>

      <P>The announcement of the farrowed sow scheme in May, 1966 and the increased pig housing grants in that year were designed to counteract the cyclical downturn in pig production which set in in early 1966. Minimum guaranteed prices for good quality pigs were increased by 6/- per cwt from 1st May, 1967.</P>

      <P>No; I have not information that could be useful to the House <Col N="958" /> at the moment.  As the Deputy is aware, a limited examination was first carried out.  Arising from information elicited by that limited examination, a more widespread examination was then undertaken.  I have not yet got to the point of having this study as a result of which I might be able to give information but I would hope to be at that stage in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Anent this question and the previous one regarding the user of skim milk, is the Minister aware that the increase in the price of barley by 15/- per ton in Monaghan and Cavan areas has operated very largely to negative the 6/- increase in the basic guaranteed price of pigs?  Will the Minister consider if anything can be done to reduce this increase back to the price which obtained previously if we are to get an increase in pig production in Monaghan and Cavan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument of the increase being partly or entirely absorbed by the increase in feed costs is merely taking the view that this is the only increase that has occurred. This is the increase in the guaranteed minimum price but the actual increase which has taken place in the price of pork is overall far in excess of that.  I may say that the highest price now or at any time here or in any part of Europe is being offered to pig producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that the increase of 15/- per ton in the price of barley and its <Col N="959" /> concomitant feedingstuffs has operated greatly to discourage farmers in Cavan and Monaghan from re-entering pig production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the guaranteed minimum price for Grade A special is 266/- the actual prices obtaining and being received, range between 275/-and 290/- in recent weeks.  This may or may not be an argument but it certainly does not get away from the fact that the 6/- increase is far from the amount the producers are receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that this arises from the obligation of the factories to support the Minister in his efforts to fulfil the quota laid down under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement and which has operated to exclude us altogether from the fresh pork market which was a valuable asset to pig production?  The present artifically high prices are operated because the factories are trying to keep up the quota for which the Minister asked them in order to participate in future quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument may be used in isolation, but the range of prices which goes down to Grade L, from 265/- to 285/-, is being paid in these recent weeks.  It does not support the argument that this is an effort on the part of the factories to fulfil their quota of Grade A special exports, because this is not for export.  While the guaranteed minimum price for this grade is 229/-, what they are paying is 265/- to 285/-.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will state, for the latest date for which figures are available and for the corresponding date in 1965, the average price paid for fat cattle (a) in Ireland and (b) in Britain; and if he will give the reasons (i) for the decline in cattle prices and (ii) for the increasing gap between British and Irish prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>During the week ended 15th July, 1967, the average prices for fat cattle of all kinds at Dublin Market, and the estimated market price in the UK for fat cattle within the standard required under the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme there, were 135s 9d and 134s 10d per cwt liveweight, respectively. The prices in the corresponding week of 1965 were 164s 9d and 184s 1d per cwt liveweight, respectively.</P>
      <P>A seasonal decline in market prices at this time of year is a normal feature of the cattle industry both here and in Britain.

Some 70 further applications were received: a few of these were subsequently withdrawn; in the majority, however, the lands offered were on investigation, found to be unsuitable for land settlement purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the scheme is entirely voluntary, there can be no question of compelling potential vendors to accept the Land Commission offer for their lands or to opt for a life annuity in lieu of all or part of the purchase price.  Once price <Col N="975" /> is agreed and a qualified applicant opts for participation in the scheme, however, the setting up of the appropriate life annuity and the necessary arrangements in relation to the other benefits attaching to the scheme can proceed quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point before Question Time that the Taoiseach's speech yesterday was almost like that of a captain of a football team leading his side, on a sunny day, on to the pitch for a Munster Final, in the placid manner he looks upon the possibility of EEC membership.  He spent quite an amount of time dealing with the changes necessary to bring in a decimal system but did not spend as much time dealing with the matters we mention in our amendment.  So far as that part of his speech in which he did concern himself with our amendment is concerned, we consider we have done a service to the country and the House in putting down the amendment and bringing the Taoiseach to the point where, as our Leader said yesterday, for the first time in six or seven years, we had a Taoiseach attempting to grapple with some of the questions raised by us, which are of great concern to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made the point that this is no normal European State we are talking about in regard to our application for EEC entry.  It is not to be considered normal in its employment figures or in the general management of the economy.  No other country involved in the applications before the Community suffers division of its national territory; no other country <Col N="988" /> can be described as having one labour market with its neighbouring country or one capital market, as we have with Great Britain.  One economist has gone so far as to say that a better description of this country would be that it is an economic region of the United Kingdom rather than an independent territory where economic decisions can be made.  The position of this country in regard to our entry into the EEC is far different from the position of any other European country.</P>
    <P>We have far greater problems than any other European country.  The relationship we must seek with Europe must be unique and different to the relationships which any other country can afford to have with that large trading <i>bloc</i>.  The position might have been different if the conditions we won half a century ago, under the Treaty, had been used to diversify foreign trade and to build up an independent territory.  If that had been done our position in regard to the EEC might have been far different from what it now has to be.  The opportunity, however, was not availed of and the interval of so-called political independence has been used to maximise our dependence on the British economy.</P>
    <P>Compare our position with that of some of the countries which wish to gain entry to the EEC.  Norway in the 1930s might have had a gross national product which was less but that cannot be said today.  They have their own language and they have built up good markets, both in the Scandinavian countries and Britain.  They have also built up a thriving fishing industry. Norway will consider putting the question of its entry into the EEC to a referendum of the Norwegian people before Parliament will commit the people to its entry.  That is very different from the kind of secrecy with which this Government seek to surround their own hand in, to use the Taoiseach's words, their delicate negotiations.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, there is a pretty sound economy and a highly developed cooperative system.  It is a by-word so far as its efficient agricultural industry is concerned and it also has a strong <Col N="989" /> industrial arm.  Although bound by land to Germany, nobody can say that Denmark does not have its own distinctive life and in every respect is an individual territory.  It has extensive markets with Britain and other European countries.  The Danish Government have made it pretty clear that they will wish to maintain their special links with other Scandinavian countries.  All these countries have made no secret of their special conditions and their attitude towards the EEC.  Only this country has no conditions.  The only thing we continue to refer to are the endeavours of our missionaries in Europe 1,500 years ago.  We have this kind of ridiculous posturing by the Government, as if it were any secret in the EEC countries that this was an underdeveloped economy, a ramshackle economy in every respect, in its social security and unable to fulfil any requirements of the modern State, but stating its willingness to undertake the implications of full membership.  The people of Europe, unlike the Irish people, will not be codded by such nonsense.</P>
    <P>Take the case of Sweden.  Their form of application for membership will not be known until this week.  They are worried about their traditional neutrality, unlike the Taoiseach who is not worried about our neutrality.  On the contrary, he has compared the obligations involved in this with our obligations to any international organisation. This is a palpable untruth, not in accordance with the facts.  Sweden might well be worried about her traditional neutrality, because adherence or non-adherence might well be the difference between continued survival in the future and nuclear annihilation. Sweden can at least have some options open to her, because she conforms to the standards one would expect in 1967.  Unemployment has been unknown there for a number of years. Probably the younger generation do not know what the word means.</P>
    <P>Here are some of the countries seeking membership.  Compare them with our own.  We have a population of 2.8 million.  We are divided in our national territory, which can be described, in the language of the economist, as part <Col N="990" /> of the United Kingdom.  The only thing we have got after 45 years is a distinctively coloured Tricolour, brought out once a year for national occasions and the psychological feeling we are a free people, but we cannot establish any other sign of being distinctive. Yet the Taoiseach and Ministers of his Government, having had control for nearly 30 years, taunt us by asking: &ldquo;Where are the alternatives?&rdquo; We say: &ldquo;What have you done with the mandate you have had for the past 30 years.  What is the result of your stewardship, now that this country has no option but to crawl on its belly into Europe?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, it is this.  I do not have the aid of any civil servants. We can only read the reports and see the situation of Irish industry and the wishes of those whom we represent in this House.  As far as we can see it, the only possible alternative before us is, first, an understanding of all the facts of membership and what it will mean.  Secondly, going to the Irish people with this picture and putting it before them.  From what I can see of this picture as it presents itself to my eyes&mdash;I can only judge from my reading of it and go as far as one individual Deputy can to make his anxiety felt in regard to this matter&mdash;entry into this European network does not automatically give us prosperity in any branch of industry.  The gains it gives in agriculture are gains not synonymous with a greater population on the land.  If the future of this country means greater prosperity for fewer and fewer people, that kind of country does not appeal to me, and does not appeal to the political movement to which I belong.  Whatever political advantages it may offer to other Parties, it is not the future of my Party or the socialist or trade union movement.  We do not share any benefits in that kind of future.</P>
    <P>We have done our best to see what the advantages are.  So far, I have not come across how we can pretend there are any economic advantages in full membership.  The Government and many speakers have laid their chief hopes on extraordinary industrial developments in this country, coming <Col N="991" /> from God-knows-where, from a foreign source.  It reminds me of the national struggle for 400 years waiting for help from abroad.  We wrote some very nice Gaelic poems about it.  But very little did come, and it came in bad weather. We are waiting for Godot, waiting for some international industrialists to come here.  We have been waiting long enough and they have not come.</P>
    <P>On this kind of faulty premise, the Government seek to present to the House, and ask for full backing for the flight into Europe.  It does not have the enthusiasm of the Labour Party, this flight into Europe, with the insufficient information given to us on the question.  The entire debate on this momentous question has been marked by the dishonest partisanship by those people committed to it from the very beginning, without worrying about the mass of the Irish people and what their fate might be on entry.  For over six or seven years in which this debate has been going on, waning or waxing according as the powers in Europe decided on admission or otherwise for Britain, we have had this kind of dishonest commitment to the European ideal, without questioning its implications for industry here.  This House has had very few opportunities of discussing the alternatives.  Indeed, some years ago during the last outbreak of European integration when we were supposed to be entering, the twist was given to the debate that those who were against going into Europe were somehow not quite right. Somehow their politics verged on the tulip colour of a pink variety.  This kind of dishonest approach was given in the matter.  We base our misgivings on the present course on the economic facts as we see them presented in Irish industry.  It is for the Government to persuade us we are wrong in these misgivings.  So far, they have not done so.</P>
    <P>The Press themselves, the Fourth Estate, are not free of guilt in this situation of leading to a frank, full discussion of the implications of entry. If you read today's papers&mdash;I have mentioned this already&mdash;you will see <Col N="992" /> that an addendum standing in the name of Fine Gael has been offered in the national press as being the alternative viewpoint expressed in this House.  I say the Press is infested with Fine Gael fellow-travellers, because the real opposition in this debate has been put forward by the Labour Party in this House.  Though we may have friends in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, let it be said that the real opposition to free trade in this country and its development in the future has been that of the Labour Party and the trade union movement.  Fine Gael produced an addendum which adds, in the usual Fine Gael Opposition style, that the Government have not done something quickly enough fast enough.  That is their kind of opposition.</P>
    <P>Let there be no mistake about it. When we go into the Division Lobbies, let us see who is voting for or against this and why we are doing it.  Let us see who in this debate brought out the relevant issues facing the Irish people in this most serious matter to face the Irish people.  Yet we have to face up to the taunts of the Minister for Industry and Commerce this afternoon, who says that this is a matter on which you have to be for or against, as if the question before us were a question of black and white.  We in the Labour Party have done this.  If over the past three weeks the business of this House has concentrated on the commas and t's of the Marts Bill, it reflects on every Deputy that we can afford only two days to an issue that commits every man, woman and child, to free trade in the future.  It is a poor comment on this House that we can spare only this time for this momentous debate and that only the 21 of my Party saw fit to bring out the relevant issues in an amendment to this motion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is quite confident, as are other members of his Party, that we can stand up to the full competition that membership of the Common Market will entail.  If one reads Government reports, such as that of the NIEC, one cannot see how this can be accomplished at all.  If you look at the NIEC Report on Full Employment, you will see the gigantic nature of the task before us to provide <Col N="993" /> full employment and you will ask yourself how does the Taoiseach think, if we enter the EEC by 1970, by 1975 we will be dealing with full competition from these other countries and by 1980 full employment will be attainable. With what diverse tongues does the official mind speak?  On one hand, we are told that by 1980 we will have full employment and, on the other, that by 1975 we will be meeting the full force of competition.  What are the full employment objectives set out in the NIEC Report on Full Employment? What are the targets to be achieved in either sector?  Over the 15 years from 1965 to 1980, in order to achieve full employment and a two per cent unemployment rate&mdash;what we might call structural unemployment&mdash; we would have to provide 236,000 new jobs&mdash; 168,000 new industrial jobs and 68,000 new jobs in service industries. That is to be achieved by 1980, dating from 1965.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the record of achievement over the past few years when we have not been in conditions of complete free trade with other countries, where we have not had to take on the full rigour of competition and where in the experience of people looking over the course of our economy, we have not been doing too badly relative to other periods in this part of our economy.  Between 1961&mdash;the time we first made application&mdash;and 1966 we provided 38,000 new jobs over a period when we were doing extremely well by all accounts.  That was one of our best periods.  We provided roughly about 5,000 new jobs a year in the non-agricultural sector.  But, if we examine these figures more closely, we see an alarming trend emerging.  Poor enough as the increase had been, there had been an increase.  We see that between 1964 and 1966, we provided only 9,000 new jobs.  We were slowing down in that period, providing 3,000 new jobs per year.  If we examine the figures more closely, we find that between 1965 and 1966, we provided 1,000 new jobs a year in the non-agricultural sector. Already you can see the rate of providing new jobs slowing down from 5,000 to 1,000.  How can one see that by taking on full competition on entry <Col N="994" /> into the EEC, by 1980, we would be near full employment if we follow the plans.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that we cannot possibly do better in conditions of completely free trade in the matter of the provision of new jobs than we have been doing in the past years in more fortunate circumstances.  If the Government have any secret weapon up their sleeves or would be soft-hearted enough to save us worry on our side, would they please indicate the areas that they think would provide new jobs and we will join them in the lobbies any night in voting with them for any political jaunt into Europe if they give us the so-called assurances for the future.</P>
    <P>Our problems are unique in Europe and demand unique solutions, not common or garden solutions of the type suggested by the Taoiseach yesterday. It is time the Taoiseach realised that he is not going on to a Munster Final. This is a far more serious situation and requires far different remedies than merely training 15 men and toning up their muscles for a couple of months before the so-called Final.  For the kind of planning he has for this country, the toning up would require far more drastic measures than this Government appear to dream would be necessary and far greater preparations than, in fact, have taken place.</P>
    <P>If our dependence on Britain is as severe as I have indicated, we are entitled to ask, and we might as well ask, whether, in fact, we would not have done better had the British Government been negotiating for us from the very beginning.  Some people may crudely say that our Taoiseach is merely following up the original initiative of Mr. Wilson in London.  But, if our suspicion is that our own Government are so unaware, so unworried, about the unique problems of the Irish situation, and have given this House so little information about the areas of their concern that they would be discussing with these countries, one may ask whether, in fact, it would have been better had we licensed the British Government from the beginning to negotiate on our behalf. Remember, the British Government in <Col N="995" /> their application have made known already publicly the areas of their concern.  They have mentioned their contribution to the Agricultural Fund. That is one of their concerns.  They have mentioned the role of sterling. Everyone knows that is one of their problems.  They have mentioned New Zealand butter and West Indian sugar.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Mr. Brown's speech only last week indicated that, despite the travail of bringing in an Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement two years ago last January, in fact, the British Government still go their own sweet way.  They still maintain that perhaps the Irish Republic would need a year outside in the cold before Britain, with the EEC members, would decide on what conditions we should enter.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach's assurance yesterday.  His excuse on this score was that Mr. Wilson had assured him recently that he would do anything that was possible.  Did anybody in his life ever hear anything more vague that &ldquo;anything that was possible&rdquo;? If one wanted to get a formula for doing damn all, that was the formula. I really felt that he capped his reputation for being a saintly, God-fearing man as Taoiseach when he brought forward that as the guarantee received from the British Prime Minister, that he would do anything that was possible.</P>
    <P>One might ask whether, in fact, we would not have been better off with some British Minister dealing with the entire question of our negotiations, some Minister who knew the facts of the Irish situation, rather than the gaggle of Ministers we have been sending from one European capital to another in the past few weeks.  It occurs to me that they are out to impress their own particular section of camp followers in their own Party as to the number of capitals they have been to in the past few months rather than as to the amount of negotiation put through.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, threw down this gauntlet today, practically seeing <Col N="996" /> treason in the idea that an Opposition Party could ask the questions we have asked, practically saying we were going to rock the boat, attempting to persuade us that the Chancelleries of Europe were looking for the misgivings of the Labour Party and presenting them to the Fianna Fáil Government as serious matters and harmful to our entry.  These questions that we have attempted to put to the Government are valid questions.  We have yet received no satisfactory answer to them.  The reason we have put these questions&mdash;they refer to valid cases&mdash; is our real concern with the problems behind them.  We are aware that there are not many options open to us, as I remarked at the very outset.  This Government have had stewardship of this country for practically 30 years and the Taoiseach taunts the Opposition Party by saying: &ldquo;Where are your alternatives?&rdquo;, after his Government and his Party have led us down the primrose path to complete dependence on the British economy over so many areas of their stewardship.</P>
    <P>There are very few alternatives and none of the alternatives provides a pleasant prospect. If our development demands as I think it does, more State planning in regard to the location of our industries and the management of our industries and their expansion, then this means we must seek some kind of economic treaty with the EEC countries that will allow us to survive. It is no more than a request for survival. If people say this Community is not interested in our survival, then I ask: What are our chances of entering into such a Community, if they are not interested in the survival of a tiny country that can do no one any harm?  If this is the character of the European Community, then again our fate is as final within as without. Our request is purely for survival. This is a small request to make of the largest marketing arrangement that has ever yet come into existence.  If these so-called democrats in Europe live up to the stirring ideals about which the Taoiseach has been telling us over the past two weeks, it is a request they should not refuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> I have mentioned this matter which the Taoiseach has ignored, the question of the loss of our national sovereignty, the little we have left, that permits us to hoist the Tricolour once or twice a year over the GPO.  How much of the little sovereignty we have are we to be left with?  The Leader of the Fine Gael Party, with commendable honesty, has told us already we must prepare further to tailor our international policies to the new straitened conditions of existence we may expect on entry into Europe.  He has told us in regard to the remarks of the Minister for External Affairs in the past few weeks on the small State of Israel, that the Minister should watch himself in future and be very careful about what he says about Israel.  Indeed in a television discussion some time ago, Deputy Cosgrave, again with commendable honesty, said in respect of the few occasions on which the Government have been independent abroad, they had better watch out in future and make sure that they consult the people who matter in Europe before they say anything on any international question.  This would indicate some of the sacrifices which we may or may not have to make in respect of national sovereignty.</P>
    <P>There are, however, more serious matters with which we shall have to deal.  The whole object of our planning will be for survival.  There will be the question of the location of industries and the granting of subsidies to industry. All the evidence available vindicates the stand of the Labour Party in this debate.  It is regrettable that that stand has not received greater support in the national press.  It is regrettable that they have followed the will-o-the-wisp addendum of the other Opposition Party, regarded in this House as being the main mouthpiece of Opposition in this House on the motion.  It is regrettable a situation has obtained where a monopoly has been enjoyed by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and that in pursuing this unnatural political life the Press cannot fulfil the chief obligation of the Fourth Estate to educate public opinion to the realities of life and tell the people who cannot look in on the affairs of this House what the real position is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke this afternoon about adaptation measures.  Like a lot of other Ministers in this debate, he has been preparing an ambitious alibi for future reckoning when we begin to look over the tally of this adventure into Europe.  We had the Minister for Labour last night, the Minister for External Affairs this morning, then after lunch today came the turn of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to say his little piece for the record. Like a good little boy, he talked about all the things his Department have done for industry over the past two years.  The Taoiseach yesterday again referred to the kind of preparations that had gone on and said: &ldquo;This is to our credit.  Here is what Fianna Fáil have done to prepare Irish industry for the possibilities of free trade.&rdquo;  The figure of £14 million was given yesterday by the Taoiseach as the amount of money spent on adaptation.  Unless my arithmetic is wrong, this means that, over the past few years, the Fianna Fáil Government, this so-called champion of the worker, have spent £70 per Irish worker to ensure that his job will survive. It shows the real area in which ones affiliations are to be seen.  It is interesting to note by comparison what it costs to create a new job.  Under the policies followed by the Government over the past few years, it has cost between £2,000 and £3,000 to bring new jobs into new industries.  Surely the preservation of jobs is as necessary as creating new jobs?</P>
    <P>The thought may occur to people, however, that the Government are preparing to pull back from the industrial worker, that the time has come for the parting of the ways, that the people who now control the party, the Taca people, have come to the conclusion that the honeymoon between the industrial worker and Fianna Fáil is over and that they should devote their attention to the agricultural part of the country.  Undoubtedly for some people in Irish agriculture, there will be prosperity in the Common Market.  It will also mean greater depopulation of rural Ireland.  There will be greater prosperity for fewer and fewer farmers, which will mean that the day of <Col N="999" /> the small farmer will come to an end. Are we to take it that the Government are no longer interested in this important section, that they are no longer interested in the maintaining of our population and its expansion?</P>
    <P>It may be that Fianna Fáil have decided that the time has come to pull back, and this may be the real background to their lack of activity on the industrial front, their lack of interest in properly adapting industry and their laziness in negotiating for real alternatives, their lack of interest in any options, which has led them to the unanimous commitment to full membership of EEC.  If the Taoiseach and members of the Government can give us so few facts on the kind of factors that will be influencing our negotiations, on the worries they experience and the kind of conditions for which they will be looking, these are valid enough conclusions.  It is not enough to scoff at those who are in the unhappy dilemma of attempting to pose the alternative, attempting to think of an alternative course open to us.  It is not enough to say: &ldquo;Where is your alternative?  This is a black and white case.  If you cannot give an alternative, sit down.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach was mentioned in our Leader's opening address. Some years ago the idea of association &mdash;I do not think the association idea has much to commend it&mdash;was definitely mentioned by the then Taoiseach without being scoffed at.  It is a pattern followed by other countries but association finally entails full membership and the argument has been made that you do not have the advantages of full membership but you have all the disadvantages of part membership.</P>
    <P>All Deputies must exercise themselves on this matter to the best of their ability.  They must see the problems in the country and consider what relationship would best serve our real interest because it would be foolish for any of us to lapse into a foolish sort of European enthusiasm without wondering where our own country would fit into the eventual jigsaw.  We must look over one of the features <Col N="1000" /> that prevents me describing this as an economy on an European scale, that is, the ramshackle state of our social security system.  One wonders at the brashness of the Government who would go to Europe and say that we are willing to take on the full commitments of members while knowing what a poorhouse system of social security we have.  They know it, and presumably so do those to whom they are talking, and one wonders again at the impudence of a Government who can go ahead on the basis of accepting full membership with only this kind of poor law system behind them.</P>
    <P>The kind of redundancy figures before us suggest that the manpower problem will be beyond the reach of anybody's imagination.  The problem of most European countries is manpower shortage.  In this country it is a manpower surplus.  Again, somebody has accurately said that probably our best exports in the long run to the new trading community may in fact be cattle, agricultural produce and our labour.  In the past, labour has been, I suppose, one of our most successful export lines mainly to Britain, also to the US and other countries.  It has been a never-ending export of ours, varying up and down, but always there and at a rather high figure.  This trend may be accentuated in the future.  That possibility is there.  The provisions made by the Department of Labour in the labour sphere again suggests that the Government are dragging their feet.  We still await a redundancy Bill. We had wordy battles on a Marts Bill but we still await the implementation in law of a redundancy measure and this at a time when our Ministers are going from capital to capital in Europe attempting to gain warmth and understanding of our position, while on the home front as regards preparing our work force and giving a safety margin or Plimsoll line to them below which they cannot fall, should they lose their jobs in future, nothing much has been done.  Again, one may question the sincerity of a Government and the people they represent and the things they do and intend to do in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The amount of adaptation that has gone on here is extremely small.  The grants have been mainly doled out to existing firms.  There has been little checking to know whether these firms are adapting themselves to the ferocious conditions facing them in the future.  There has been a constant idea that the only role of the State in industrialising the country is to be the eternal milch cow for private industry and that as long as that milch cow was available, Irish industrialists could take as much as they could possibly get. There was the idea that the State must be forever confined to this role. The State should enter into these industries that have not been expanding as they should, and this not for any doctrinaire consideration but for the welfare and safety of the people involved.  The alternative, if this is not done, is a slow rundown in future and a closing down of industry after industry.</P>
    <P>The Government have not adequately prepared the country for what may eventuate in free trade conditions.  They are a Government who cannot say their responsibility began last year or the year before.  They are a Government who once represented a movement that sought to bring this country up to independence status, a Government whose spokesmen see the history and the destiny of the country intimately intertwined with the Fianna Fáil Party. This Party have had 30 years to consider the country's position and all they can say after that period is: &ldquo;We have no alternative.  We have made such a bags of running this country that all we can do is crawl as fast as we can into the nearest large trading <i>bloc.&rdquo;</i></P>
    <P>We are in a different position from every other European country because these European countries, in coming to a decision about EEC, had alternatives and options.  They had sound economies, full employment, decent social security systems and national independence, and looking at their own countries, in their full sovereignty, and looking at EEC, they could come to a deliberate, mature decision.  Here we have a panic-stricken Government saying that we have no choice: &ldquo;Let <Col N="1002" /> us get in and let us get this unpleasant business over as rapidly as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had the Taoiseach saying the House was not entitled to ask the questions we put down in this amendment. I do not know if any effrontery on this scale has been known in any other European Parliament or if any other people would put up with decisionmaking by a Government, with such consequences for their future, on this basis with so little information at the disposal of this so-called national Parliament.</P>
    <P>I have said enough to indicate where our Party stand on this issue.  The Taoiseach suggested it would have our approval, provided certain information was available.  It would depend on the kind of information given us whether it would meet with our approval.  We intend as far as possible to interest the public in the issues raised by the accession of this country to EEC and as far as possible, to tease out the rather meagre possibilities open to us and explore as far as possible the idea of seeking&mdash;admittedly, a certain relationship with EEC is necessary&mdash;a trade relationship which would allow us to survive, and still be free to manage our economy.  That is our request, not a fantastic future but one that will allow the country to survive.  I am not one of those committed to this enthusiasm for Europe of the Fatherlands or anything else but I am committed to the idea of all European countries being able to live in peace with one another.  If EEC is this kind of institution, surely it will allow us to continue to survive here? Surely if it is committed to the idea of democracy, it will allow a small country to pursue its own course and take our products without discrimination, appreciating that our industries represent no threat to large-scale industries in Europe and that we wish to go our way and live as an independent nation?</P>
    <P>The suggestion is made that it would not accept such an avenue of escape for us and then I am suspicious, and doubly suspicious, of the European Economic Community.  Tonight we will be voting against the Government's decision to re-activate our application. So far, we have received no answer to <Col N="1003" /> our questions on this whole matter and we will invite other Opposition Deputies to put equally cogent questions as to the future of our country in European conditions.</P>
    <P>We would respectfully ask the Press to consider once more if it is their function to report Opposition versus Government, alternatives versus a certain series of actions, and we would suggest also, respectfully suggest, that they would look, not at numbers but at voices and at policies other than those suggested by mere numbers in this House.  We appreciate that we may not be in the majority in refusing to give unconditional acceptance to the Government's decision to re-activate our application for entry to the EEC, but anybody who looks at the facts honestly, who is conscious of the problems facing this country, could not accept the Government's decision and could not follow them into Europe on the information they have given us. Anybody who knows the facts could not be confident that this Government are really conversant with the problems facing the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied the Taoiseach's speech as closely as I could this morning and I have found it to be such a detailed statement that, if all the material which was sifted to provide it were brought in here, the Taoiseach would have needed several ushers to bring in the volumes of statistical material consulted.  All this material has been circulated to us over the past four or five years but when I sought in the Taoiseach's speech a new statement of what is going to be done to bring us into EEC, I sought in vain. I was reminded of a remark made at a meeting a good many years ago when someone described the chairman's speech at that meeting not as whiskey with a little water but as water with very little whiskey.  There was very little in the Taoiseach's statement except water.  There was little more in it than we know already. There was a statement of our position but there was no definite new strikeout, no definite mention of any new means by which the Irish people could <Col N="1004" /> help us to go into EEC with the least amount of dislocation and the greatest amount of opportunity.</P>
      <P>That is the challenge facing us.  I accept the Taoiseach's general statement that stagnation outside would be greater than the difficulties of membership. That goes without saying.  If we were to find ourselves alone and outside the European Community, the results would be much more difficult for us than any dislocation that would be brought about within the Community. That is a mere statement of fact. As an Opposition, it is not always our duty to oppose.  We do not oppose the Government's decision to re-activate our application for membership of EEC.  We accept it for the reason that there is no other avenue open to us but to explore the possibilities within the framework of our agreements with Britain and the framework of the Free Trade Agreement with that country.</P>
      <P>I also accept the Taoiseach's statement that he must be given the opportunity to negotiate without the whole of Europe having knowledge of his mind or the mind of his Government. When he has done that, it will be for the Irish people to decide at the next general election whether he and his Government have been good stewards or bad stewards.  It will be some time before the next general election and the decision on that matter will be made in fuller knowledge of the situation than we have at the moment.  It is naive to say to the Taoiseach that he should tell us everything now.  We have a volume of statistical material. That is all that has been given to us, but you cannot ask the Taoiseach completely to show his hand and tell us every delicate negotiation in which he may become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain points in the Taoiseach's speech with which I found myself in agreement, but there were others with which I do not agree.  I do not believe that opportunities for tillage farmers in the EEC are bad and I hope to deal with that later.  The Taoiseach spoke about the fact that we may lose some of our sovereignty, but when he talks about losing our sovereignty, he means that we may <Col N="1005" /> lose the right to make certain laws and the right to perpetuate laws which we have at the moment.  It is quite obvious to anyone who has studied the Rome Treaty that we will be allowed to provide funds for certain industries but that we will not be allowed to provide remission of income tax for exports.  This system of incentive was introduced by our Government in 1956 and it has been found to be very useful but such a system will not be allowed in EEC.</P>
    <P>When people talk about abandoning our sovereignty, they mean that we must face the fact that we will be subject to overriding regulations made in Brussels by a Council in which we will be a very minor force.  On certain matters we will have the right of veto but on certain other matters and in certain other bodies we will have no right of veto.  We will merely have the right to vote on the basis of our population and that will mean we will be a very minor body indeed.  This means that we are taking a very big plunge into a very deep pool and we have to face that in the realisation that with the volume of trade we have with Britain and with Europe, there is no other avenue open to us.  The discussion on this matter can only be on the basis of what is the best way to go about it.  This is what we should discuss, how best we can get in with the best results for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the matter of the restriction of the funds which we can provide in support of agriculture. He also mentioned a possible increase in the cost of living, but did not make any mention of increases in wages.  We have not been considering other matters that are quite true, that in Europe they have cheap vegetables, cheap wine, dearer housing and a much better climate over the greater part of it.  This means that if you take the consumer price index and the goods people consume, the cost of living in Europe might appear to be higher.  In Europe, the ordinary person enjoying his life goes home to his wife and drinks half a bottle of wine, has a good night's sleep and gets up in the morning to go to work.  That costs less than it would <Col N="1006" /> cost here.  Here a man does not go home and drink half a bottle of wine. He has a meal and perhaps he and his wife go out to a lounge, or to the pictures or somewhere else.  The whole pattern of life is different.</P>
    <P>This brings us to whether there is going to be a necessary rise in remuneration as a result of our accession to the EEC.  If that happens, everyone knows it will increase the cost of production. If that happens, can we compete? This is the situation which everyone must face.  When the Taoiseach talked about a three per cent increase in the cost of living, he did not talk about the inevitable consequence, an increase in the cost of production and in remuneration.</P>
    <P>You can never compare one country with another.  Account must be taken of the climate, the availability of goods, particularly food, and eating habits.  No consumer price index and no slide-rule can measure those things one against the other.  At the same time, we have to face the fact that accession to the EEC may mean an increase in costs here.  Perhaps we could not afford an increase in costs and we would be looking towards our export competitiveness for a decrease in costs.  That is something which we may have to face.</P>
    <P>As reported in today's <i>Irish Times,</i> the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to pretend that membership of the enlarged Community would not pose problems for Irish industry.  But our prospects for a progressive industrial economy providing a high level of employment depended on our having access to expanding export markets, and our objective could not be achieved in the contracting market which would be available to us if we were to remain in isolation.</P>
    <P>No one can contradict that statement. The Taoiseach went on:</P>
    <P>We are now entering an era in which the only assurance of survival for an industry will lie in its capacity to produce goods which will match those of its competitors in quality and price and to deliver them to the right place at the right time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> What have we been doing here?  This is my first criticism of the Government. So far, I have tried to open my mind completely and say what I believe: the problems facing us are there and no amount of talking can remove those problems from us or change their nature.</P>
    <P>What have we done?  I propose to deal immediately with our situation in relation to industry.  Every country in Europe has done its planning over the past ten or 15 years.  Every country in Europe&mdash;and I propose to deal with Northern Ireland later&mdash;in this respect has decided on the infra-structure within that country for the development of industry, has decided that where a port exists, where it is cheaper to provide services, and where there are people available.  That is the place to be developed.  We have not done that.  Our policy in relation to expanding industry has been to enter into the fray entirely and absolutely on a political basis.  Fianna Fáil Governments have looked for votes.  They have given extra grants in underdeveloped areas, anywhere in underdeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>I hold that it is a crying shame that the port town of Sligo has not been developed as an industrial centre.  For the first time, within the past six months, it has been decided that two places are to be developed: Galway and Waterford.  Those places have not as yet one factory running.  There is talk of one or two in Waterford being moved out of old premises and put into new ones.</P>
    <P>Instead of giving grants anywhere in the underdeveloped areas, we should have been developing places such as Sligo where there is a harbour and where we have the proper infra-structure, where we could easily provide labour from towns in Counties Leitrim and Sligo, but particularly Leitrim.  We should say: &ldquo;This place is going to be a development centre for industry.&rdquo; In their last period in office, Fianna Fail have been garnering votes.  What has happened?  In Carrick-on-Shannon, there are boys and girls walking the streets.  I know this place intimately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> I ran it for Fine Gael for two by-elections and we won the two.  There is one little factory there and one little housing estate.  We could take that estate and put it 40 times in Drogheda, and it would be lost in our housing estates.  That little factory makes plastic component parts and employs young boys and girls to the number of 30 or 40.  The town of Sligo has never been mentioned by the Government as a place for industrial growth.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House what Northern Ireland has done.  This is my criticism of the Government in relation to their move towards the EEC.  I want to quote from &ldquo;Northern Ireland Factory Specification&rdquo; issued by the Ministry of Commerce, 21 Linenhall Street, Belfast.  The heading is &ldquo;Low rent and a long lease&rdquo; and it states:</P>
    <P>The Government of Northern Ireland has a comprehensive factory building programme under which factories of standard type are built on carefully chosen sites with full services laid on and ample labour available.  Built in advance of immediate demand with ample provision made on all sites for expansion they are suitable for a wide range of manufacturing processes. This booklet describes a number of such factories, some of which are ready for occupation, and outlines their advantages for expanding industry.</P>
    <P>On page 3 there is a map of a place where they are going to have a new city.  The name of the place might not suit us, as it is Craigavon.  It will have all the infra-structure for industry, better railways, access to ports, and they will build houses and flats for the workers.  We are ten years behind and it is the fault of Fianna Fáil.  That is what is being done in Northern Ireland and it is being done, too, in Lancashire and other places in England where certain old established industries have gone down.</P>
    <P>We have provided a global 25 per cent for adaptation and in Northern Ireland, it goes up to 40 and 45 per cent.  We have not produced any plan for industrial growth in places where it is most needed.  We are ten years <Col N="1009" /> behind.  Now we have decided on our first two places but, with the exception of Galway, we have abandoned the west of Ireland with our policy of giving slightly higher grants for industry anywhere in underdeveloped areas &mdash;which is a daft policy.  The Government's policy has failed and failed abysmally.  In countries like Leitrim, Sligo and Mayo and other places, the Government are rapidly losing their support.  That is true and no one can refute it.  I want to quote now from a speech delivered by me at the Árd Fheis on 10th May last, on the Fine Gael position in relation to industry. I said:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael were not afraid to meet up to their responsibilities even if there might be localised unpopularity because of the selection of one place for industrial growth in preference to another and he wished to announce as Fine Gael policy on industry that when in power they would do as had been done with success in the North of Ireland, and other countries, namely, institute industrial growth centres where factory space would be available for renting at a subsidised level, so providing by instalment for the first-class industrialists that desired to come here the equivalent of an industrial grant. The system of industrial grants would still be continued but the provision of factory bays to which there could be added further suitable space at any time at subsidised rents, seems to the Fine Gael Party to be a sounder procedure and a more sure guarantee of the first-rate industrialist coming here than any other method.</P>
    <P>That was passed by the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party five months before May 10th.  It was announced. If we get power, we will, in preparation for the EEC, see to it that in the various places around the country in which there are good harbours and boys and girls coming forward for employment, places in which it is possible to visualise someone moving from Leitrim to Sligo instead of from Leitrim to Birmingham industries in these places, so far neglected by <Col N="1010" /> the Government, will be established, because this Government have been interested in nothing but the ballot boxes and have failed hopelessly in this so-called global system.</P>

      <P>That is planning: I could not agree with the Deputy more. That is what is not being done&mdash; planning.  Nobody on the Government side can produce for me completed buildings in Galway or in Waterford or a factory occupied in 1967 at a time when Northern Ireland is so far advanced, at a time when every country in Europe has done what should be done, following on the ruins of a war.  That is proper Government procedure.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal now with another failure of the Government which results in our knocking at the gate of the EEC quite unprepared.  I was going on television about six months ago with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I spent a few days looking up files in the Library and elsewhere on various matters.  I have no intention of giving a list of names because I have no intention of pulling down anything, even though the edifice is rotten at the foundation, but I say quite categorically that a minimum figure of £10 million has been wrongly invested by way of grants and loans in industry. In most cases Ministers were involved in these grants and loans.  I shall not go further than that, except to say that in certain instances, grants and loans of over £250,000 were given as a result of a Cabinet decision.  There was one instance, not so long ago, in which a Cabinet Minister was chairman of a public company and a Cabinet Minister at one and the same time.  At the moment that company has got £750,000 of Government money on a subscribed capital of £45,000.  I understand they are still losing money and they have accumulated losses of £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and the Deputy and the whole House know it as well <Col N="1011" /> as I do.  The misapplication of the capital reasonably available has left us in the position of knocking at the gates of the EEC improperly prepared. We could very well use that sum of £10 million to prepare us today for entry into EEC, but we have not got it to spend.  All planning is restricted because of the unavailability of capital. Fianna Fáil had both the opportunity and the time.  Capital was freely available. The only thing wrong was that they had not the men.</P>
      <P>Now I should like to refer to a volume entitled <i>European Communities laid by the Government</i> before each House of the Oireachtas, April, 1967, and to the position in relation to Ireland's exports and imports <i>vis-á-vis</i> the European Economic Community.  At page 299 I find that the value of Ireland's imports in 1965 were £56 million and in 1966 £50 million whereas I find, at page 300, that our exports to the EEC in 1965 were £28 million and in 1966 £26 million.  That was a period in which there was heavy criticism of the Government because they had not instituted reciprocal tariffs against the tariffs erected against commodities like Irish lamb entering France.  One of the reasons why there was a fall in imports in 1966 was, I think, because there were certain actions taken by certain Departments to see to it that we got a rather better deal.  At the same time, remembering the restrictions, this figure seems to me a pretty frightening one. We are taking twice as much from them as they are taking from us and when we enter, either by stages or immediately, but probably by stages, the floodgates will open and Irish industry will be quite unprepared.  The system adopted by Fianna Fáil over the past few years has been altogether wrong.  The global refusal of certain grants for adaptation in the case of certain industries was wrong.  If one refuses an adaptation grant to a laundry, for instance, one may find that a laundry with capital available in the European Economic Community will trot over here and wipe out the Irish laundry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether changes in <Col N="1012" /> the holding of capital by companies are something that would interest this House very much but it would be very wrong if there were a wholesale movement of proprietorship from Irish proprietors to European proprietors.  The global refusal of grants on the basis that certain industries could not compete for export is absolutely wrong. Nine months ago I raised with the Minister the global refusal of adaptation grants for bakeries.  The reason given for that refusal was that it was felt that in EEC conditions, bakeries would either not have to compete or would not be able to compete.  The suggestion of putting bakeries in a position to compete with bread coming across the Border was described by the Minister as a restrictive practice.  That is something I cannot understand.  If we have bakeries along the Border employing as many as 220 people, the refusal of an adaptation grant to safeguard them against being wiped out in EEC conditions seems to me a complete dereliction of an Irish industry.  It is like a lifeboat refusing to go out to effect a sea rescue.  In Northern Ireland, adaptation grants are given automatically if one buys a machine and sends in the paid receipt to the Ministry.  That is a much more intelligent approach.  That might take more taxation and it might mean having to increase the Capital Budget by some millions but it would at least be the proper approach to the problem. The Government have failed miserably to do anything about it.  Dropping the whole thing and letting everything go to the wall does not appear to me to be the correct approach.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with something the Taoiseach said about farm products.  Again, at page 301 of <i>European Communities,</i> we have an extremely interesting table which shows the self-sufficiency of the EEC from the point of view of farm products. They have sufficient wheat.  They have about threequarters of their requirements in fodder grain.  The price of their grain is much higher than ours. They are not self-sufficient in beef but they are in veal.  They prefer, of course, to eat veal.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach when he says there is no <Col N="1013" /> great opportunity for tillage farming. This 25 per cent of fodder grain, which is a market to the Irish farmer at a higher price than for his barley, would be of great value.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister's statement that our present wheat price is higher than the target price.  Allowing for the moisture lost when we dry the wheat, and so on, I felt, according to the last figure we looked at, we were around about the same price. There is nothing wrong with the price of wheat at present: the only thing is the weather.  When you get a rejection and when it falls to become fodder grain, the difference between the price of wheat for human consumption and fodder grain for animal consumption is so great that it tends to discourage growers.  If the price for fodder grain comes up, if 25 per cent more barley is needed for EEC at a higher price and if wheat went down a little in volume, then, when there was a rejection, the gap between the prices for wheat for human consumption and fodder grain for animal consumption would be less.  I think that, in such circumstances, there would be an excellent opportunity for tillage farming in EEC.</P>
    <P>When we talk about beef we have to talk about milk.  Milk and milk products, according to this volume, are slightly over-produced within the Common Market.  I hold that the great failure of the Government in agriculture has been their complete disregard for the conservation of the grass we produce by removing a large amount of the subsidy from the land project and devoting it to a subsidy on fertilisers. This increased our cattle-carrying capacity and the volume of grass produced.  There were, then, two things necessary.  Having extended the agricultural programme at both ends by the application of fertilisers and increasing the volume coming forward, we should conserve that grass and anything coming from it, but most important, produce it for sale at the right time of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and his predecessor in office have been talking here about everything under the sun during the past two years and have <Col N="1014" /> been wrangling inside and outside this House with people with whom they should have been lenient.  The one thing I have not heard them mention is self-feed silage units, conservation of grass, extension of lands for these highly important things that allow the grass grown in summer to be fed without hand labour in winter.  This was developed so that we could bring more of our cattle out in the spring, when the price is high, rather than in the autumn, when the price is low: it is low in the autumn because the grass is finished and there are too many cattle on the farms.</P>
    <P>I have heard of no campaign instituted either by committees of agriculture or farming organisations to see that this conservation of grass was done.  At the same time, we had the heifer scheme.  Three years before the Government produced that scheme, we on this side of the House proposed a different sort of scheme.  If they had followed our line&mdash;which would have been a political embarrassment&mdash;they would have got on all right.  Instead, they wanted a spectacular result, without providing for the animals God would give them in the due process of the mating of the heifers.  There resulted a catastrophic drop in cattle prices, with consequent losses to the farmers.  I do not want to prognosticate on the figures today.  If the figures are as we see them, then we are facing nothing else this year.</P>
    <P>Nobody has talked about the conservation of grass and the provision of tools to the farmer to enable him to finish his product when the prices are at their highest.  There are schemes, grants, loans.  It was the Minister's job to lead, not to walk behind the unfortunate farmer prodding him with a stick with a rusty nail in the end of it.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things we must watch when we get inside EEC is the trend of farm product prices. The whole system is one of target and intervention.  The target price is the price we hope they will get.  The intervention price is the result of the Community organisations intervening and paying a deficiency payment or a subsidy to the farmer to see that his price cannot go any lower than the intervention <Col N="1015" /> figure.  If milk products are over-produced in the Common Market and if Britain is energetically&mdash;as she is, according to Mr. Brown's speech&mdash; campaigning for some entry for New Zealand's products, it does not look as if there will be a great opportunity for a vast expansion in the production of milk and milk products but it does look as if there will be a good opportunity for the production of beef and veal but it has to be done in a way different from that in which it was done in the past few years.  All that has been produced is the expenditure of some millions and a cattle catastrophe. That is due to the arrant stupidity of those in charge of the Government Department.  That is a most important matter.</P>
    <P>I come now to labour, labour relations and the position in relation to the happiness and the future of the worker.  Mention has been made here in the past few weeks of the Redundancy Bill and its non-arrival in this Chamber, as well as to the insistence of the Government that other legislation be dealt with, irrespective of the wishes and view of Parliament.  That is a matter of small moment when we realise that months have passed and no Redundancy Bill was introduced and, when it was introduced, there was no energy used, no push used, to get it passed through here.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that the only way in which there can be industrial peace in this country and to prepare our workers as well as industrialists for the Common Market is by having a contract of service with our workers.  This had been produced by my Party before it happened in Aer Lingus, Guinness and I am proud to say in my own town with Messrs. W. and C. McDonnell who make excellent soap and margarine.  I refer to a contract of service.  An unfortunate man working maybe for 20 years knows he can get a week's notice and a week's pay in an envelope.  With a contract of service, there are certain requirements that shall be carried out.  He has certain rights.  There shall be a place where he can go and where his whole <Col N="1016" /> future can be discussed with management as an absolute necessity.  It is the policy of my Party that one of the requirements for the application of grants and incentives for industry is that there shall at least be an effort, if not a successful effort, to set up a contract of service with those employed within it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has been in his post for a year or so.  No results have become available to us and yet we have this obvious situation that when costs increase and people will want more wages, there will be this clash of interests.  All that can be quoted in this House are the three firms, Aer Lingus, Guinness and McDonnell's, the only three firms in which I have seen this happen, and yet this is a feature of employment in the Common Market, all over Europe and all over the world.  Still nothing happens in the Department of Labour and their Bills do not reach the House.  We are aware that certain members of the Cabinet are so pugnacious, stubborn and powerful, that they can force their legislation through to the detriment of their colleagues.  This is one reason why one might describe the Cabinet as a bad Cabinet.  I have found it hard over 13 years to say things about what happens in External Affairs because the Minister has been a colleague of mine in Louth for 13 years and has been elected for Louth almost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; since the institution of the State.  I agree, he never gave me any trouble.  However, there is this question of policy.  We have a Minister in the Cabinet at a time when external affairs is so important, of paramount importance as far as our entry into the Common Market is concerned, who spent 87 days in the United Nations, became involved in a ruckus between Red China and Tibet and now says that Israel should withdraw from whatever territory she got, forgetting that Israel applied for association with the EEC two and a half years ago and is at present <Col N="1017" /> negotiating her application.  Where does he think his friends are?  Britain has not said this.  America has not said this. Europe has not said this.  He said it. Was this a Cabinet decision or just Deputy Frank Aiken, Minister for External Affairs, deciding?  This is extremely relevant to the question of the Common Market.  I was in Brussels with Deputy Tully and Deputy Andrews&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more.  I do not know whether Deputy Andrews or Deputy Tully will agree with me when I say that our delegation was minute and our principal man was overworked.  He is a very able man.  The Minister has been in Brussels once in three years and that was by accident.  He was passing through and he was there for two hours.  What country in the world which was assessing its politicians and policies on the basis of performance and not on a &ldquo;Wrap the green flag around me&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where were you in 1916&rdquo; basis, would accept that kind of situation? The reason why votes are falling from Fianna Fáil like leaves in the autumn is because the people are now starting to vote on policies and politicians and on what they are doing.  I know that that unfortunate man was completely overworked&mdash;even his family were overworked&mdash;trying to keep our end up in the Common Market.  I knew this before I went and I verified it when I was there.  At the same time, his Minister sat for 87 days in the United Nations.  As I said, the question of our external affairs is of paramount importance, particularly in relation to our behaviour in Brussels.  I have prefaced my critical remarks by making it quite clear that I believe that the Government have no option but to proceed along their present lines.  However, I am arguing that they are not proceeding properly; their performance is wrong, not their direction. We are in the position that we have a Minister for External Affairs whose interest in Europe is nil and whose public statements caused havoc and <Col N="1018" /> trouble and interfered with our entry into the Common Market and the bargaining we shall all have to carry on.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Leary on one point, that there are bargains that must be made.  I substantiate what I am saying by reminding the House that France is in the Common Market but still has the right to trade free of duty with her past concessions, with places like Algeria and other places which composed the French Empire.  Western Germany can deal with Eastern Germany and it seems that there will be an exception made if Britain goes in in relation to New Zealand butter.  We will have to bargain and to fight hard to get bargains.  If I know continentals, they will spend hours and hours and even months doing it, but nevertheless we have to face up to it and bargain as hard as we can.</P>
      <P>As this is a short debate, I do not want to hold up the House.  I have devoted my remarks mainly to the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Labour, External Affairs and Agriculture, and I believe that the Government, in regard to all these Departments, in our movement towards the Common Market, have fallen down.  I have said that there is no avenue open to us except to move towards the Common Market along with Britain.  If our cattle trade under the Free Trade Agreement with Britain has been a failure, it has resulted from two things, the bad policy of the Government in creating cattle without proper plans for feeding them, without the conservation of grass, and on the other hand, the closing of the Common Market to cattle except under prohibitive tariffs.  These are the things which caused that, rather than any failure of the Free Trade Agreement. Be that as it may, the Ministers in charge of these Departments have failed, but let us hope that during the short term left to them before they move over here from there, they will improve.</P>

      <P>With the possible exception of the Labour Party, the House is agreed that we should seek membership of the EEC.  The main <Col N="1019" /> criticism from the Fine Gael Party is that we have not done our homework and that we cannot stay the course. Deputy O'Leary of the Labour Party has indicated his Party's downright opposition to immediate negotiations, rather as Michael Pat would say &ldquo;Show us the meat before you bring home the bacon.&rdquo;  That seems to be their form.  There are two aspects to this problem.  There is the economic aspect and the political aspect.  In regard to the political aspect, we find that England is still a powerful country, economically and politically, despite all its problems, whether in regard to currency or balance of payments problems or the possible dismantling of its agriculture, but George Brown in paragraph 4 in the speech he made at The Hague in July said:</P>
      <P>The European Communities are developing on an economic base. But we in Britain, no less than the present Members of the Communities, do not see the issues only in economic terms.  The balance of economic advantage for us is a fine one.  Some of the most decisive considerations for us have been political.</P>
      <P>They are still a powerful nation but yet they are prepared to throw themselves politically at Europe's feet.  This alliance with Europe should present no political problem as such.  Our relationship with Europe is a very long one.  I will not bore you with details of saints and scholars, but I cannot help bringing in one man.  Saint Columbanus, at any rate, was a very significant Northern Ireland saint.  He went to France early in the sixth or seventh century and found himself in fruitful discussion with a French bishop over the date of Easter.  There is a kind of echo about that today.  He did finally find his way.  He had to run from the wrath of kings but eventually found his way to Cologne, where he was given a civic welcome and he died of apoplexy some time afterwards. That was one of our first incursions into Europe.</P>

It looks as if we are going to engage with French people in a fruitful discussion of other things now.  We had the Normans coming here with the blessings of Pope Innocent.  I like to introduce these little bits of history for a change. My discussion is on the political aspect. We had a man called Duns Scotus. This was about the same time as the Pope sent the Normans to civilise us. He was educated at Oxford.  We had not Trinity or the Report on Higher Education at that time.  He went to Paris and took charge of all the schools of divinity.  He had a discussion on the Immaculate Conception. He established the doctrine by a cloud of arguments.  He challenged the doctrines of St. Thomas Aquinas.</P>

All spilled in Smerwick and Kinsale and O'Donnell in Valladolid and O'Neill in Rome finished their lives as princely suppliants.  And the Wild Geese and the smuggling in and out of the Kerry caves.  It is a very interesting historical fact that Wolfe Tone got his republicanism and we got Maynooth at about the same period.  It is something we might ponder on.  How we could hesitate to enter this unity I do not know.  One point was raised.  We hesitate to join because some say it will mean a derogation of our sovereignty.  I would like to elaborate on that a bit.  What is the EEC?  It is a customs union, with some institutional union, created with a view to shaping it into an economic unity with power still remaining in the hands of various countries but with the potential to form a political union.  That is the broad <Col N="1021" /> objective, but its creation will not be quick and easy.  It is a straight concept &mdash;the United States of Europe&mdash;but it still needs a political authority in addition to its economic authority.  We hope to be part eventually of that Europe.  We are moving into a world of giant powers, into an age of continentalism.  We are part of that continent.  Let us accept it.  As regards our sovereignty, are we to be a misty offshore island off the coast of Europe?  The last time we were an offshore island was when the commander of Caesar's legions stood on a hill in Wales having massacred the Druids.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that this concept of nationalism we have is a narrow one. I will quote two authorities for you now.  One of them is no less than the most Reverend Doctor Philbin in his essay <i>Patriotism</i>.  I will have George Brown for you later on.  Dr. Philbin says at page 12 of his booklet:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are guided by the concept of patriotism as designed to help and serve human beings we shall have the means of correcting the undue emphasis on nationalistic, political, and violent aspects of patriotism which an unbalanced presentation of history has brought us to regard as the sole manifestation of this virtue.  It is as if Governmental forms were everything for the community and public welfare could not be promoted independently of them. Patriotism, it should be clearly understood, is not identical with nationalism.  The latter is a narrower concept and much more ambiguous morally.  Philosophers of history have demonstrated that many of the evils of mankind are traceable to its excesses and some thinkers can foresee no real tranquillity or order in the world until it is superseded or subordinated to a higher allegiance. Some measure of restriction <Col N="1022" /> upon complete national autonomy seems indeed almost certain to come.  But there will always be room for patriotism, truly understood, no matter what the status of nations may be in new world orders.</P>

      <P>Politics may be, but not patriotism.  Paragraph 14 of George Brown's document says:</P>
      <P>Fears have been expressed that there would be some radical alterations in the nature of your Communities if we and other European countries were now to enter them. There will of course be changes.  But they will be changes of dimension-a larger Community, a more powerful and more influential Europe. None of us should have anything to fear here&mdash;for this whole concept of size is, as I have explained, the essential element of that unity we aspire to.  And above all that unity requires a common purpose and outlook, and a will to work together. We have already given assurances about this, and what I have to say today will confirm them.  The fundamentals of the communities will remain unaffected, for we shall be accepting precisely the same treaty aims and obligations in letter and spirit as yourselves.  We aim to create with you a unity, which will be all the greater because it will be built on the rich diversity of achievements and characteristics of European peoples who share a common purpose and a common resolve for peace.</P>

      <P>On the economic side, the Taoiseach covered the ground very fully in regard to agriculture.  I do not want to cover what other speakers have already dealt with.  The only concept I like is that of market price guarantees as against a subsidy. Deputy Donegan, the last speaker, was most enlightening on that point.  While he spoke about a surplus of things in the EEC, he left out that there is not a surplus of these things in England. It is England coming in that makes all the difference for us.  Deputy O'Leary said we were the only country following in somebody else's footsteps. Denmark are also doing so: she must get in.  If she does not, she is finished. Their market in Germany and their market in England could go.  So Denmark is in the very same position as we are and as regards sundered territory, Denmark has Schlesweig-Holstein which she lost.  She will be all one.  We will be all one.</P>
      <P>As regards the industrial side, I am not going to accept what Deputy Donegan has said, that nothing has been done.  Since 1961, the warning was clearly given by the then Taoiseach and several Ministers of what we had to prepare ourselves for by 1970. There is no doubt, the CIO report was very full and clear and laid down clear guide lines.  They spoke about the amalgamation of firms, rationalisation, common marketing, better use of our resources, the need for industries to adapt themselves to the new market. They gave all kinds of incentives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adaptation, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in a recent speech, is an attitude of mind <Col N="1024" /> as well as making the best use of resources and pruning what drags or is an obstacle in the way of efficient running. Since 1961, that has been driven into our people.  Progress has been made.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned that of 2,000 industries dealing with goods in partial exchange, 750 are now competing in the international market.  That is a substantial movement but we have until 1970, and I hope we may get several concessions when we do succeed in our negotiations to help us on to 1975, by which time these industries should be ready.  I know of several very fruitful amalgamations.  I know of one where had the firms not amalgamated, each of three separate factories engaged in the textile industry would have gone to the wall.  That is pretty common over Ireland and is happening every day.</P>
    <P>We were told we were completely dependent on trade with England.  For the 12 months ended March, 1967 our total export trade was £250 million.  It was £216 million for the year ended March, 1965.  I am quoting from Córas Tráchtála Export Information.  Of that £250 million, £167 million was to Britain and Northern Ireland, almost £3 million to EFTA countries; £26 million to the EEC, almost £22 million to North America and £32 million to other areas.  A very substantial additional market has been built up outside the British market.  So, contrary to the lonesome and doleful picture drawn by Deputy Donegan about nothing being done and about desuetude and squandermania, these are the facts as to what has happened in regard to exports.</P>
    <P>To quote the Minister for Industry and Commerce, adaptation is a frame of mind, a determination to prune all that is a drag and a burden on the development of business, to reorganise and regroup to meet the challenge free trade will bring.</P>
    <P>Our entry has been reinforced by the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement. That is one of the real benefits I see in that Agreement.  We had to dismantle tariffs in two stages by ten per cent. Our industries will have to be ready to face the full blast of free competition <Col N="1025" /> before 1970.  All that is a form of discipline and preparation for entry into Europe.  This is being done as well as we can.  We might be doing it faster, I confess, but it is being done as well as we could wish to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour last night, spelled out the possible implications as far as his Department is concerned, not, I must say, to a very attentive audience, but they are there on the record as far as migration of workers, equal pay, working conditions and many other facets of the problem are concerned.</P>
    <P>I realise that we are not an industrial giant, although our progress in development of secondary industries and in the export trade has been most impressive.  We will never have the technical know-how in electronics, and the computer, aircraft and nuclear technology that big giants have, but we do hope that if we do enter Europe and form part of this bigger Western European complex, at least we will have the benefits of the research into peaceful uses of these developments that the big giants have. There are only three giants in the world&mdash;Russia, America and possibly Western Europe, with the addition of England.  So we are in the same position as Denmark and many other smaller countries in this age of big giants.  We had better stay with the people we know and have the tradition of living with and whom we understand.  If we do not do it, I see no alternative except to wrap a cloak around us and stay in our own miasmal mist.</P>
    <P>One last argument in favour of entering EEC, the best argument, is, in the words of an English writer writing about England, that it would end the era in which entry into EEC was a substitute for serious thought and action as regards economy and world order.  For too long have we been codding ourselves.  This debate will decide and we will get on our way. As I have said, a good deal of serious thought has been given and a certain amount of action has been taken.  Now the die is cast.  We are going in and now we are down to business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been too impressed by Deputy Lenihan's point that Great Britain has shown through the speech of George Brown that she feels that it is a very good exercise for her to enter the EEC.  Great Britain has a galaxy of trained technicians. It is a powerful industrial group when one takes Scotland, Wales and England as a unit.  Great Britain has assets including atomic energy plants and advantages that this country cannot even dream of at the present moment. Even though at the beginning of his speech, Deputy Lenihan implied that he was speaking from the political side and I have referred to the economic side, it is true that on the political side, if Great Britain secures entry, she will have on the Council of Ministers at least four Ministers, in proportion to her importance, as against one that Ireland is likely to have if she secures entry.  It is not because it is a good thing for Britain that we in Ireland should decide that it is a good thing for Ireland.</P>
      <P>I can very well understand the reason for this motion.  It was necessary for the Taoiseach to table this motion so that the House could get an opportunity of discussing the question of whether or not we should reactivate our application.  It was also necessary for the Labour Party, because of their view, to put down the amendment we have tabled that this be deferred until further and more detailed information can be given because, to say the least of it, we have very grave doubts as to the effect entry to the EEC will have on the Irish people as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of the Government to decide whether or not to reactivate our application.  They have done this but our job here is to say how we feel about that reactivation of our application and the effect it is likely to have when we will be called upon to exercise our vote.  Unfortunately we will be called upon to exercise our vote as to whether we go in or not only when the thing is a <i>fait accompli,</i> when we have gone through all the motions and have been accepted.  It is only then that we have a right, if we so feel, to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thanks be to God, the Taoiseach <Col N="1027" /> has at last admitted, if the newspaper reports are correct, that if Britain does not go in, we are not going in.  Thanks be to God that, at last, that is a self-evident fact to the country and all the people know it.  Over all the years since the first idea of entry came into being, the question of whether England went in or not was the vital factor for us and it is time that that came out in the open and was admitted. Thanks be to God, the days are over of the former Taoiseach who spoke of going it alone and leaving our biggest market, Great Britain, aside and putting up tariff barriers against Great Britain and having her retaliate.  No matter what Deputy Lenihan may say about the work done in getting extra exports to America and to various other countries, the fact is that 75 per cent of our trade is with Great Britain, and if it was not there, we would be that much worse off and we would have very little, if any, prospect of recovering or increasing our exports to the countries he mentioned, not to talk about the market we have for our unemployed people who flee across to Great Britain when any slump occurs here.  There is a continuous stream of workers, boys and girls, probably the best workers in the country, going over there, at least 30,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Deputies base their conclusions on the information they have secured from committees of Congress, who have made a serious study of the effect of entry into the EEC on the employment content here. With Connolly, we say that the country without the people means nothing to us.  If the people of the country&mdash; and the people of the country are the workers&mdash;become unemployed, then no matter what benefits may come to a limited few, that is a situation we do not want to see arising.  We want to look very closely at all the assurances and examine all the problems very carefully before we give an unqualified assent to the reactivation of our application for entry into the EEC.  Goodness knows, things are bad enough, with 50,000 unemployed on a manipulated register, almost 10,000 more unemployed this year than this time <Col N="1028" /> 12 months.  Are we going to make things worse by this effort?  As far as I can use my own limited knowledge and from reading as much as I can, I cannot see much prospect of an improved employment content by entry into the EEC.  Whether or not we must go in because Great Britain goes in is a separate question.  I accept the fact, and always have accepted the fact, that if Great Britain does enter, then it is Hobson's choice for us: we must go in and make the best of it.  But that is the point, to make the best of it.</P>
    <P>What terms will we get?  I have yet to read of any terms that we have even been promised.  Do we know where we are going at all?  Certainly it is true there will be improved prices for certain agricultural commodities, for cattle, beef or dairy products.  But there are other commodities; certainly wheat will go.  There is a query about sugar beet, and that question is very difficult for me to assess.  I am not an expert on agriculture, and that is where the Government come in.  They can employ expert advice.  They can get it not only in this country but throughout Europe, throughout the very countries that are participating in these economic arrangements, and they can learn from the experience of these countries.  In regard to the problems about which we are worrying, these countries should be able to give us facts and figures and say: &ldquo;This is what will happen to the wheat business and the flour milling industry.  This is what will happen to sugar beet.  This is what will happen to foods such as those processed by Erin Foods and various other such firms.&rdquo;  There is a very big employment content in that. Will it be affected?  I cannot remember anyone telling us, even at a guess, what will happen, beyond saying we shall have better agricultural prices, that the price of cattle will be higher. However, if the price of meat is higher, it will be higher for the housewives of Ireland and the cost of living will rise. In Great Britain, I think it was estimated that the cost of living would go up by ten or 11 per cent.</P>

      <P>Fourteen?  Are we told anything like that here?  Will it go up that much here, or more or less?  Surely these are the things the Taoiseach or some of the Ministers should have been telling us instead of the bla-bla they went on with.  Let us all accept the fact that if Britain goes in we must go in, but there are things we want to know.  We want to know the conditions of entry.  Even if we are facing known facts, it would be a necessary exercise as a precaution to see if there was any further improvement that could be made.  We have not got expert opinion so far.  We got assurances last year from the Minister for Finance, the then Minister for Agriculture when we were facing free trade with Britain about the price of cattle, but did it turn out like that?  Then we were told something else happened.  Will something else happen about the assurances we are now getting about agricultural goods, about cattle prices and so on?</P>
      <P>Even assuming that things will improve for the farming community, is there not the factor of employment content in our farming industry?  It is estimated that a decrease of over 15 per cent will take place in employment content in a now already declining employment content for agricultural workers, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.  What are we going to do with all these farm labourers and farm workers?  Small farmers will probably be forced out of business.  What will happen when the wheat growing and the beet growing stop, and everyone turns to the rearing of cattle and exporting them either on the hoof or in cans, if there is some employment content in exporting cattle?  What will be the effect on the dead meat trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters on which we in the Labour Party would like to have information.  Even a reduction of 1,000 or 2,000 workers can have a very serious effect.  There is no hope of retraining them for something else, no hope of replacing them in some other industry because already we have 50,000 able-bodied men and women who cannot get employment at the moment.  What will be the effect of the EEC policy on agricultural employment? As I said earlier, and improvement <Col N="1030" /> for the limited few will not benefit the community.  The workers are the people.  They are the nation: they are the people who count, and the fact that a limited section will get improved conditions must not be the beginning and end of all things.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the industrial side. Without being in any way critical, I think anyone in his same senses looking at the set-up in the European Community will agree that the outlook for Ireland is gloomy, and even the Taoiseach has admitted that six of our major industries are likely to go.  A good many others are suspect, and the effect on them will only be known during the period of transition, a period of five years as was indicated by the Taoiseach, or even a period of ten years as the Labour Party are, and will be advocating if that point arises.  I do not believe that in five years we can manoeuvre ourselves into a position where we would be able to take even a small part of the trade and consequently the employment that may be available due to an expanded market and greater demand.</P>
    <P>For instance, in my own constituency of Waterford city and county, it is said by Irish Congress of Trade Unions experts who have examined the matter that the leather industry is likely to be seriously affected.  Should that industry of making boots and shoes and the raw materials for them be affected, we would have between 200 and 300 people losing their livelihood in my town of Dungarvan.  In Portlaw, we would have almost 400 people affected and in Carrick, on the border of the South Tipperary constituency, there would be another 300 or 400.  That is practically 1,000 men and women whose livelihood would be swept away by entering EEC. Where would they go?  What alternative employment could they get?  That is a problem which any Deputy alive to the needs of his constituency must examine and assurances would have to be given before he could feel justified in coming to a decision on an issue like this, on whether to give an unqualified consent to reactivating our application. <Col N="1031" /> There is a bright side to this, I admit.  I do not want to see the dark side only.  If we did go in with Britain, I would hope and assume that American firms seeking a toehold in the European market, would come to Ireland and establish units of their firms here.  There are three advantages for them in Ireland rather than in Britain or on the Continent itself. First, there is the advantage that land is cheap here compared with other countries.  Secondly, labour is plentiful and reasonably cheap.  It is certainly cheap compared with rates in America. Thirdly, there is the language problem. Americans speak approximately the same language and American foremen and supervisors, who usually have to travel with their firms when they go overseas, would find education available for their children either here or in Britain if they had to send their children there.  The normal life in Ireland or Britain would be close enough to that to which they were accustomed in America.  Food and other problems with which people have to contend if they go to a foreign country, and there is the difficulty of communication even for health reasons with doctors and so on, would not present any great trouble here.  I think American firms would find it easier, better and cheaper to establish their industries in Ireland rather than elsewhere if they decide to get into the European Community by setting up auxiliary establishments within the EEC zone of influence.</P>
    <P>Offsetting these advantages, if they come to Ireland, is the matter of transport charges compared with setting up on the Continent or in Britain.  Due to our insane policy of closing railway lines as quickly as possible, and often without concern for the interests of the people as a whole or industry, we now find ourselves, in the south at any rate, in the position where important industries will be completely detached from a railway link to a port and all the goods must be loaded on lorries, taken to the port and reloaded on boats for the Continent or elsewhere.  These added costs may offset the advantages <Col N="1032" /> to Americans when they are deciding whether to set up in Ireland or not. I hope they will decide on Ireland because this is of vital interest to us.</P>
    <P>This new industrial estate in Waterford city appears to be developing and may be of great help to the city and adjoining areas of County Waterford, South Kilkenny, and even portion of Wexford.  I should like to know from the Minister what is proposed under Article 92 of the Rome Treaty?  As I understand it, under that Article, the Government can secure from EEC the right to continue or even to initiate and sustain assistance to industry where it can be shown that certain industries have been so seriously affected by entry to EEC that there has been a considerable loss of employment in the area or region.  If, in County Waterford and the surrounding area in South Tipperary, the leather industry has to go to the wall, is there any possibility that the Government have sounded or will sound, before they decide on their action, what rights they have under Article 92?  If this has been done, what answers have they got? These are questions that could be asked.  The experts must foresee that the leather industry is in danger.  They must know its employment content and they should make inquiries as to how they will be able to retrain and resettle workers, say, in the industrial estate in Waterford and what money they can use to do so.</P>
    <P>EEC means free trade.  It means you cannot sustain or boost by the payment of money any industry.  It must be a question of the common good, not that of the nation or of individual areas but of the whole unit together.  As far as I know, only through Article 92 of the Treaty of Rome is permission given for any form of subsidy.</P>
    <P>Most Irishmen will want to stay at home or at worst, seek employment in Britain.  If we go into EEC, Britain will, of course, be open to us for employment but that is already the situation.  We already have free right to employment in Britain and free right to their health services.  We have agreements covering social services.  All these things are already there.  There is no advantage to us from transfer of <Col N="1033" /> labour.  It is not so in Italy where they are over-populated and where the popularity of a Government is revealed by the number of people emigrating. That is not the position here.  We are limited to employment here or in Great Britain, and even employment in America has now been limited to us by the new employment laws under which Irishmen are not finding the same favour as we hoped they would, notwithstanding our connection with that country through the fact that the son of an Irish emigrant became President there.</P>
    <P>With regard to adaptation of industry, a good many people in Fianna Fail believe that adaptation is a question of improving industry by buying in more machinery and doing as much work with one machine as was done by 30 men before.  All the mentality tends to the limitation of the employment content in industry but that is no great help from the point of view of the Labour movement.  We do not believe that machinery is necessary to disemploy men.  We believe it should be used to make a better product, to make labour easier, and that it should be an aid to employment rather than a substitute for human beings.  Human beings are the nation and nobody wants to adapt themselves out of a living altogether.  That would make this country a great place for the favoured few and we would then have the picture of Oliver Goldsmith's deserted village repeated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a figure of £63 million spent on adaptation and he said that £14 million of that was given by the Government to 800 firms.  If we take all the firms in Ireland, big, little and small, I would suggest that the figure of £63 million would amount to only about £100 per firm for adaptation and at the present time you could not adapt a henhouse on £100.  Such a limited figure gives us no prospect of promoting industry or increasing employment content and it is because we see things like that we are dubious about the whole matter and are asking that the decision to reactivate our application should be deferred at the moment. <Col N="1034" /> If we do seek entry, it is on the basis that we will be permitted to use limited tariffs and limited industrial incentives for five years. We would suggest that that period should be extended to at least ten years from the date of entry, which would bring us up to 1980 at least before we would feel the full economic blizzard of living with the competition of such highly industrialised countries as the Six are at the moment and when they will be added to by Britain, Norway and Denmark.</P>
    <P>I do not know about the political implications of the Treaty of Rome.  I thought Deputy Lenihan was going to give us some indication about that but he went on to speak of the economic effects and of where St. Columba lived and where he died.  He is said to have died of apoplexy but I hope that our entry into EEC will not mean apoplexy of the whole Irish nation.  I admit that Ireland cannot remain neutral in any world struggle.  We will have to be on one side or the other.  There has been talk of America leading an Atlantic community if the European Community fails and, if we join that community, we would then be under American influence.  I accept that we cannot stand aside but I would like to know more about it.  I would like to know whether, if we join EEC, we will have to join NATO as well, although de Gaulle has almost put an end to that.</P>
    <P>There are other dangers.  Where would we be if this grouping of the EEC should decide to have a go at Russia or to break all links with the United States?  Would we be committed to these things?  We must know the answer to this question before we commit the country.  It might be a good thing to fight Russia or to break all links with the United States but I would like to know why we should do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given us any wonderful information.  There are already 17 Ministers in the Council and if Britain goes in, they are likely to get four; Norway will get two, Denmark two and Ireland one.  That would be other countries with 25 Ministers and Ireland with one. <Col N="1035" /> Various matters would come up.  If it were agriculture, our Minister for Agriculture should be there and if it were Industry and Commerce, our Minister for that Department should be there.  In that Council Britain would have four key Ministers and we would have to be dependent on the decision of a group like that.</P>
    <P>There are some very drastic provisions in the Treaty of Rome.  That Council can override the national good of any particular nation in favour of the general good of the community and they can bring any nation to the court of justice if it fails to carry out the decisions of that Council.  Are we going to give up our rights to independent action by joining this Community? Are we going to give up our rights without knowing what we are to get in exchange?  Are we going to be paid back sufficient to compensate us for what we are giving up?  These are the questions we must examine before we are asked to decide whether Ireland should reactivate her application to join EEC.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by quoting the late Deputy Norton when he spoke on this matter when it first arose.  &ldquo;No matter what happens, no matter what fails, my opinion is that entering Europe will be an excruciating exercise.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters for discussion before the House in this debate.  The first is the motion in the Taoiseach's name that Dáil Éireann approves the decision to reactivate Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community, and the second is the general debate on the Adjournment.  I want first to say something about the motion with regard to the EEC, and then to say something with regard to the general political and economic situation of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First with regard to the motion, we are asked to approve of the decision taken by the Government to reactivate&mdash;I object to that word but it is there&mdash;Ireland's application for membership of the EEC.  I do not find it easy to follow the attitude adopted by the Labour Party in regard to this <Col N="1036" /> matter because, were the amendment standing in the name of Deputy Corish carried by this House, we would be in a situation in which Dáil Éireann would defer a decision on Ireland's application to join the EEC until such time as the conditions of entry were known and clear.  That would mean the rather extraordinary situation of Britain proceeding on a crusade into Europe and this country by a decision of this Parliament deciding to have nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>One's imagination boggles at the implications of that in so far as the welfare and living standards of Irish people, and in particular, Irish workers, are concerned.  Deputy Kyne has said he has always accepted that if Britain goes into Europe, we must do so also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In saying that, Deputy Kyne, speaking as a Labour Party Deputy, has correctly described what must be the attitude of any sensible person regarding this issue. Therefore, if at the same time he suggests that we should decide here not to do anything about Europe at a time when Britain is seeking to get in, it appears to me that is an illogical stand.</P>
      <P>I want to say in regard to this question of a European union that the whole idea of concerting together all the European States into what eventually will be a federation has arisen&mdash; and probably the idea and the sentiment and feeling were accelerated by the holocaust of the last war&mdash;because in the past two decades in particular, those in charge of the Governments of the different countries have come more and more to realise their responsibility to the ordinary people in the lands they govern, to raise their living standards, and to find for them outside the confines of their national territory a way of life and an opportunity to look forward to higher things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That concept of European union was expressed powerfully by M. Schumann and Signor de Gasperi and others who were opposed to the jingoism of the last century, and to the extreme nationalism that had frustrated the <Col N="1037" /> hopes and ambitions of ordinary people.  I would have thought that kind of sentiment would have had the support and backing of anyone who regarded himself as a true socialist. It is right to say that the socialist movement in Europe today is solidly behind the movement towards union in Europe.  It is solidly behind it because those who believe in socialism and hold hard to its tenets recognise no national limits.  The idea of a socialist being at the same time an exponent of extreme nationalism is mutually contradictory. I think that on reflection many people will recognise that the liberal movement in Europe looks forward to European union as something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In fact, those who continue to prevent the movement towards European union are those of the extreme right who want to preserve a way of living which has blighted the hopes of many generations over the years gone by, a way of living where man's ambitions and ideals were never considered, but the ambitions and ends and aims&mdash; often very selfish&mdash;of those who were concerned purely with national interests always prevailed.  It was because of that strong dominant point of view in Europe over the years that Europe became the cockpit and battlefield in so many cases.  Today, it is the last remaining knight, the last lingering troubadour, the last representative of that era and age which has gone.  The idea is, apparently, to prevent European peoples coming together, but I believe that union will take place.  We should look forward to it cheerfully. We should look forward to it in a spirit of optimism, not wearing blinkers and not failing to realise the difficulties involved if we do not act properly and in time, not confusing ourselves by drifting into a complacent attitude about it.</P>
    <P>It is right for Deputies like Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Kyne to point to what is involved but the fact that problems exist should not mean that we will show the white flag or turn our backs on our brothers and sisters in other countries who have achieved so much.  If we decided at any time to withdraw from the main stream of <Col N="1038" /> European thought, if we decided to stand aside, we would be deliberately sentencing our people to accepting a standard of living which is lower and will continue to be consistently lower than that enjoyed elsewhere. We would be sentencing our people to become wandering manual serfs, seeking where they can get in to hold down menial employment.  We would be doing a very grave and serious disservice to the legitimate aims and aspirations of our people. For far too long they have been kept in the background and out of developments elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I say that because I believe it.  I believe our accession into Europe, while it may create problems and difficulties for us, will give us also an opportunity to build, if we have the requisite enthusiasm and intelligence and self-reliance, something worthwhile for our people.  We may not get in. We cannot control the course of events. We may not get in the decade in which we are now living, but I believe that, sooner or later, we will get in and I, for one, look forward to it.</P>
    <P>Are we to consider what will happen if we do not get in?  That would be an exercise in pessimism.  It is worth stating, I think, that in this part of Ireland down the years, and not merely since this part of Ireland evolved, our chief difficulty was the fact that we were not able to control our own destiny.  We were in juxtaposition to Britain, with her vibrant, powerful economy, an economy which sucked our workers out of this country and prevented our country developing on the lines on which it should have developed because it was more convenient from the point of view of British needs that we should remain Britain's back garden.  It should be remembered, and this is something which has led to confused thinking on this present issue, that prior to the Treaty we existed in a free trade area.  There was absolute freedom of trade and complete liquidity of money and labour and our people never had, and could never have, the vista of a developing prosperous future ahead of them in that particular situation.  It was to deal with that situation that the late Arthur <Col N="1039" /> Griffith, one of the greatest men this country has thrown up, conceived the idea of Sinn Féin, with the Irish people somehow some day being able to control their own destiny and develop their own economy.</P>
    <P>I mention that because over the past 18 months we have been once more in a position of free trade with Britain.  Many of us expressed doubts about that Trade Agreement but we were prepared to accept it as a necessary preparation by us and by Britain for joint accession to the EEC.  It was in that set of circumstances that the Agreement was negotiated.  That Free Trade Agreement, interpreted in association with our entry into Europe by 1970, clearly shows that we were not recreating the situation which was ended in 1922.  In that debate I indicated that, if we and the British failed to get into Europe, the whole situation in relation to the Free Trade Agreement would require urgent re-assessment. I trust that will not arise, but I want to make it clear that, while we believe and hope we will find ourselves part of Europe, if that does not happen and if we find ourselves cut off from Europe, with the gates locked against us and married to Britain by a Free Trade Agreement, then, so far as this Party are concerned, the whole situation will have to be re-assessed and that free trade arrangement will have to come to an end because we could not afford to continue it in such circumstances.  Were we to do so our national sovereignty would be meaningless since economic circumstances would make it impossible for us to exercise it.</P>
    <P>It is because of the Free Trade Agreement and the atmosphere in which it was negotiated that certainly I and many of my colleagues read with dismay the remarks made by the British Foreign Secretary when he addressed the European countries some ten days or a fortnight ago.  I cannot say that that dismay has been allayed in any way by the Taoiseach's conveyance to us of what the British Prime Minister said to him recently. It seems to me that, in this, as in <Col N="1040" /> many other things, we must always be on our guard in relation to the British. They have negotiated a Free Trade Area Agreement with us, with a sense of honour, as men of principle, on an understanding, that, together, we were going into Europe.  If the British Foreign Secretary's words mean what they appear to mean, when the first difficulty arose in their path into Europe, they were prepared to shed us and to let us wait out in the cold. I hope the protest the Taoiseach made on our behalf was couched in strong and significant terms.  I trust he made it quite clear to the British Prime Minister and to the British Government that the words used by the British Foreign Secretary were in direct contradiction of a solemn international agreement made between these two countries and I hope we shall hear no more of it.</P>
    <P>In what I have said up to this, I have been referring to the first part of this debate which relates to our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> Europe.  I should now like to say something about our present political and economic situation, with particular reference to the economic course upon which this country is now travelling&mdash;whether by direction or by drift I do not know. Deputies will recollect that, in the summer of 1963, the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was ushered in with a flourish of trumpets by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and the Fianna Fáil Ministers, a Programme which was to be seven years in duration, which was based on the belief that we should be in Europe by 1970, which, we were told, was conditioned to prepare us, over that seven-year period, for our eventual adherence to the Treaty of Rome. This Programme was talked of so much at that time that people began to think that, once you issued a blueprint and called in the press and made sufficient noise and publicity about one's plans, the promises were thereby being accomplished.</P>

      <P>People began to feel that fresh jobs, new sources of <Col N="1041" /> employment, would become available, that there would be an increase in production and a rise in living standards.

      <P>At the same time, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, made it clear that this new plan, this great new concept of his and his Government, was an exercise in what he called economic programming. He said that, in that regard and in that respect, it was something different from economic planning for which he did not entertain any good word.  At the time of the introduction of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, with the flourish of trumpets which I mentioned, I remember seeing that Deputy Lemass, in a press interview, said they were going steadily ahead to achieve the Programme targets step by step, week by week, year by year, and so on.  Then one of the interviewing press people asked him how frequently he thought a review of progress would be necessary.  Deputy Lemass, the then Taoiseach, said he rejected the idea of a review because he regarded it as dangerous.  He went on to say that if reviews took place and if, by accident, a particular target was not being achieved, then people would only get depressed and the Programme would be retarded.  At that time, we in the Fine Gael Party and in particular, the then Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon, made it clear that we regarded this Second Programme as a very dangerous effort at misleading the people of our country.</P>

      <P>I think it is fair to say that it was not very long after the start of this Programme in 1964 that things started to go badly and very badly indeed.  They went badly in 1964, in 1965 and in 1966. We are now at a stage where we are half way through the Programme.  On this occasion of the adjournment of the Dáil, we should look at where our country now stands in relation to providing a better way of life for our people.</P>
      <P>Under the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, it was laid down as one of the targets to be achieved each year that our economic growth and our resources, our wealth, would increase at the rate of 4.6 per cent.  That was the target and, upon that target, on the basis that it would be achieved, a new ray of hope was given to those concerned about employment for themselves and their children that new jobs would consistently be provided each year so that, over the Programme period of seven years, some 88,000 new jobs would be provided for the people of this country.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  In 1965, the 4.6 per cent target was not achieved. The growth rate was 2.4 per cent.  In 1966 it was 1.1 per cent.  So far as the present year is concerned, we do not know what the eventual result will be but the best that is looked for is some thing around three per cent.  Over three years, assuming that this year is in accordance with estimate, a total accumulated growth of 6.7 per cent will have been achieved and that is 6.5 per cent behind the Programme target over those three years, of 13.8 per cent.  These are percentages and they do not mean anything to people but they do indicate that in the past three years, we were not going ahead in the way our people were promised, that our economy was not expanding at the rate people were told would be achieved, and that in fact over that period we are now 1 ½ years behind the Programme target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the result?  Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Kyne have correctly and properly said that we should never forget that the country consists of the people in it people who work the land, <Col N="1043" /> people who seek employment or are employed and are working.  What is the result for the people of this sluggish drifting over the past three years in circumstances of what I believe to have been ministerial incompetence? What has been the result in relation to people at work?  By this year, according to the Second Programme there should be in employment 1,090,000. Today on the figures, and they fluctuate, the actual number at work is 1,040,000.  That has meant that in these three years we are already off target by 50,000 in relation to jobs for our people.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is more serious than that.  These are just 50,000 broken promises; these are just 50,000 young people who have left school and who thought they would get a job under Deputy Lemass's Programme and Fianna Fáil's promises and who found they could not get them.  They are just people.  Their hopes have been blighted and the promises made have been broken.  We have gone over the top in reverse and in these three years not alone have we not achieved the promised 50,000 jobs but close on 15,000 people have lost their jobs. There are 15,000 fewer people at work now than there were when the Programme started three years ago.</P>
    <P>It is this problem of a lack of economic growth, of a failure to provide employment, of a slip back in employment, of fewer jobs being available, of continued emigration, of a fall in production, particularly in agriculture, all these things associated with the Second Programme, which have lead increasingly to demands on the Government over the past three years to re-appraise the situation and to let the people know what the true story is.  The demands have been made consistently for a review of progress under the Programme, to revise the targets and to set up some policy whereby a discipline can be brought into our economic effort.  These demands which have been made increasingly in the past 12 or 18 months have coincided with an extraordinary universal ministerial silence on the Second Programme.  After the first <Col N="1044" /> fine, careless rapture when it was introduced and after all the talk by Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach and by other members of the Government, in the years that followed, they kept away from it.  They never mentioned it; it became something awkward, something embarrassing, something that no Minister wished to mention.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at ministerial Estimates in the past three years. Instead of a Minister for Agriculture, or a Minister for Industry and Commerce coming in to discuss his Estimate and telling the Dáil: &ldquo;Under the Second Programme this is what should have been achieved this year but in fact this is the position we have achieved,&rdquo; there was never a reference to Programme targets.  They have never been mentioned by any Minister since the Programme targets.  They have never been mentioned by any Minister since the Programme started.  Pressure for a review has been there and eventually last year the then Taoiseach assured the House that there would be a re-appraisal of the Second Programme in the light of what had happened and that the new targets would be announced in the autumn of 1966. People looked forward to seeing what the new targets would be, but in fact last autumn Deputy Lemass left and the new Taoiseach said that they would make the review coincide with the annual review by the Department of Finance in the spring of this year, so that in the spring we would see the details of what was planned with regard to the remaining years of the Programme.</P>
    <P>In April of this year, when the Department of Finance Economic Review came out, there was no reference to the Second Programme in the sense I have mentioned.  There was no re-appraisal of targets or review of progress and in the Budget debate, the Taoiseach announced that they had decided to announce the details of the review in July.  We are now in July and we have the Taoiseach's statement yesterday referring to this matter.  He said that while a certain amount of work had gone on in regard to re-examining, and reassessing the Programme, he was not going to say anything about it and that the details would now be <Col N="1045" /> announced next year in the annual review in the spring.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Does it not seem to indicate that somebody is endeavouring to cod somebody else.  It seems to indicate that the Government themselves are so embarrassed at the breakdown of their programme that they fear the public criticism a re-assessment of it would involve.  So last year people who inquired were fobbed off to the autumn, to the spring of this year, to the middle of the year and now it is to be next year.  More serious than that, according to the Taoiseach yesterday, is that the Programme is now to have superimposed on it the Third Programme which is going to start some time this side of 1970, so that there will not be any objective analysis of our economic progress under the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we do not accept this repeated postponement of the necessary adjustment of the Second Programme.  We do not accept that it is in the interests of the country. We feel it is wrong and very inimical to the interests of ordinary people.  We are not prepared to wait until next April to measure the performance under Fianna Fáil of a Fianna Fáil programme.  I want to make it clear that as soon as the Dáil resumes in October, we shall seek by question and answer precise figures for each and every economic indicator with a view to seeing just how far this country has fallen behind the targets.  If this information is refused on any grounds, Fine Gael will produce their own mid-term review of the Programme and we will challenge the Government to accept the figures thereby disclosed and publish their own.</P>
    <P>The time has come to end the kind of make-believe that has so long misled and confused our people.  We just cannot accept any longer that everything is going to be all right on the night.  Things are too serious.  It is a truism to say we are living in a challenging world.  We are.  We are a very small people.  We are finding it hard to maintain our country as a viable unit and we simply cannot afford to have a Government in office <Col N="1046" /> who appear to be falling down on the job, appear to be drifting along, using gimmick after gimmick, but without any concerted definite policy.  One would have thought that the Second Programme represented a Government policy, if not a national policy.  One would have thought that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party could say: &ldquo;At least we have some reason in politics.&rdquo;  The fact is they were not prepared to accept the discipline involved in making that Programme succeed.  The fact is that they do not believe in economic planning.  We do. As far as we are concerned, as long as we are in Opposition, we will continue to point out the grave difficulties caused to our country once a planned route or roads is turned aside.  We will continue to do that because we regard this matter, as I believe most people do, of providing for the future of our people as of urgent importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary talked about the position of people on the land seeking employment in the years that lie ahead.  He pointed to the drift from the land.  That is there.  It is here in Ireland.  It is in every country in Western Europe.  It is one of the dismal facts of life.  For us, it is made more acute and more difficult by the fact that we have to face the cheap food policy operated in England, but it is there.  That problem of how to provide decent employment at home for those who are no longer working or willing to work on the land must be one of the aims of Government.  It cannot be accepted&mdash;and we do not accept it&mdash; that anyone is entitled to say: &ldquo;We can do nothing about it.&rdquo;  It is the responsibility of a Government to devise a programme to deal with that problem.  That was what we were told the Second Programme meant to ordinary people.  We were told it would mean that, while there would be disemployment on the land, there would be increasing employment elsewhere and the slack would be taken up.  That is just not happening.</P>
    <P>Now, with the Programme abandoned, we are told by the Taoiseach that between this Programme and the Third Programme, whenever it comes along, there will be interim planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> What does the Taoiseach mean by that?  Interim planning without targets? Nobody will know where we are going or what we are seeking to do.  Interim planning, he says.  But there will be no announcement of targets.  Apparently that merely means that, after all the fuss about the Second Programme, we are going back inevitably to the old situation that caused so much economic stagnation in this country, the situation in which you drift along hoping that things will get better, hoping that trade returns will be bright next month, if not next year. But nobody is trying to plan how we, as a small country, can contrive to use our resources to provide an extra job for another Irish boy or girl.</P>
    <P>We are to have interim planning. One of the most regrettable aspects of the present situation was the announcement by the Taoiseach yesterday of the apparent decision to abandon the Second Programme and put nothing in its place.  I believe it will serve the country badly, particularly in the context of the Europe, particularly in view of what we have to face.  I can only hope that there will be a change of attitude by the Government.  The Government will continue to be responsible to this Dáil for decisions, actions and administration until the next general election. We can only criticise&mdash;I hope, constructively. We can only point out what we feel should be done.  We cannot do it; we have not the power to do it.  But I urge on the Government the necessity now for announcing a complete re-appraisal of whatever economic plan or programme we are purporting to be working on.  At least give the people some indication that there is a national aim ahead, and a means of achieving it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that re-activation of our application for membership of the European Economic Community and the uncertainty as to its outcome have particular implications for economic planning.  He goes on to say that they arise midway through the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and coincide with the conduct of a review of that programme.  He goes <Col N="1048" /> on to indicate&mdash;I will not read it all&mdash; that because of these considerations, because of the re-activation of our application for membership of the Community and because that arises midway through the programme and is coincidental with the review, he thinks it would be unwise to do anything about the review and that it would also be unwise to announce new targets or new aims because they might not be achieved.</P>
    <P>Remember, that statement is made by the Leader of a political Party who announced the Second Programme in 1963 which was based on the fact that we would be in Europe by 1970.  That was the fundamental premises upon which the Second Programme was announced, that here we were with all our hopes and everything we planned for based on the fact that we would be in Europe by 1970.  Now we have the Taoiseach, three years later, saying that because we are now negotiating or likely to negotiate for membership of Europe and because of the implications of Europe, we now must abandon in effect our economic planning and had better not announce anything to take its place for fear we might be wrong.  Does that not indicate a paucity of thinking on the part of Fianna Fáil Ministers?  Does it not indicate that this whole thing up to this has been a complete hoax?</P>

      <P>I assert that those who have carried on in this way drifting along from crisis to crisis, and difficulty to difficulty, have not been serving the interests of this country. We have lost three valuable years now, years in which much necessary work should have been done not only to prepare us for Europe but also to prepare a future for our people.  All that, apparently, is gone now and here we are waiting, waiting, waiting, hoping that things will be all right but afraid to do anything else except indulge in interim planning, the Taoiseach says, and contriving to carry on until such time as we know what our fate will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people that does not seek to control its own destiny is a people that will not survive and there is a need <Col N="1049" /> in this country now&mdash;I believe the need was always there&mdash;for someone, some Party, some Government, to grasp the nettle, the economic dangers that may be there, firmly and to plan with vigour for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My main reason for intervening in the debate is to support the Government and, indeed, those Deputies who have spoken for Ireland's entry into the Common Market.  My only criticism of the debate is the time available to backbench Deputies to give their opinions on Ireland's possible entry into the Common Market. I do not think that two days is sufficient time to debate a subject of this nature and this magnitude.  I do not think two days give backbench Deputies of all Parties an opportunity to express their opinions on a subject of this magnitude.</P>
      <P>I have been sitting in here most of the day listening to Deputies speaking against membership of the Common Market and to Deputies suggesting that we should have an association with the Common Market and to Deputies of the Government Party and, indeed, of the Fine Gael Party, suggesting, and rightly so, that we should seek full membership of the Common Market.</P>
      <P>I believe that those people, inside and outside the House, who say we should not enter into the Common Market have a duty to produce an alternative to our entry into the Common Market.  This is one of the main functions of a debate.  If one person says &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; he has to show why he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and if another person says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; he has to give his reasons for saying &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that there is not sufficient information available on the Common Market.  This is a fallacy. There is a plethora of literature emanating from the Council of Europe, from the Community itself and any Deputy can be put on the mailing list of any of the committees that produce booklets, pamphlets and all sorts of literature appertaining to the various institutions and regulation-making committees of the Community.  There <Col N="1050" /> is plenty of information available.  I should like at this stage to pay a special tribute to Mr. Denis Corboy who is in charge of the Council of Europe office at 27 Merrion Row, Dublin.  I place this address on the record of the House as being a place where Deputies may call and get any information they require in relation to Community institutions.  The Department of External Affairs comes in forcriticism from time to time but Government Departments are available to Deputies.  Government Departments do not come to Deputies.  It is the duty of Deputies to go to Government Departments.  Some three months ago I went to Belfast and called to the Department of External Affairs seeking certain information in relation to Northern Ireland.  I was treated with great courtesy and received all the assistance and information that I required.  I would suggest to Deputies who say that there is not sufficient information available that there is possibly too much information available and that it is confusing to some by reason of there being so much.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the conditions on which we enter into the Common Market.  The Treaty of Rome sets out clearly in a general way the type of conditions to which we must adjust ourselves.  That is the answer to that question.  The conditions are stated there clearly.</P>
    <P>Again, it has been stated that we do not know what the consequences for this country will be of our entry into the Common Market.  I wonder did the Six when they were signing the Treaty in 1958 know what the consequences would be nine years later, in 1967?  I doubt it, but, on reflection and looking back to 1958, I am pretty sure that they were glad they did sign the Treaty.  The figures are there to show what has happened since the Six signed the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the Community is one of the fastest growing economic areas in the world, between 1958 and 1966 its gross product increased in volume by 45 per cent compared with 37 for the United States of America and 29 for the United Kingdom.  Between 1958 and <Col N="1051" /> 1966, the combined industrial output of the Six rose by 64 per cent against 74 per cent in the United States of America and 32 per cent in the United Kingdom.  Add to this the fact that the Community is the largest trader in the world.  When we are talking about the consequences of Ireland's entry into the Common Market, we should relate ourselves to the experiences of the signatories of the Treaty of Rome in July, 1958.</P>
    <P>There is a market there of 184 million people making up the six countries. Then there is the question of the extent of the Common Market, the number of people contained in this area of the European Community. Add to this the fact that EFTA countries may become full members.  Consider also that Greece and Turkey, with populations of 13,500,000 and 33,500,000 respectively, have some from of association with the European Community.  Add to this the Yaoundé Convention countries, 18 African countries, including Madagasgar, with a total population of about 60,00,000. Add to this the population of Nigeria, 55,00,000.</P>
    <P>Ask yourselves then: Will Ireland be left out of a market of this size? As Deputy Lenihan asks: Will we be left as an offshore island in Europe? What is the alternative outside a market of that magnitude?  Also we can envisage in time that the Eastern <i>bloc</i> and the Western <i>bloc</i> countries must from some sort of economic trading association.  At the moment there is a working committee liaisoning between the Comicon countries and the Six. Again we must ask ourselves is Ireland to be left out in the economic wilderness and every other type of wilderness, cultural, and so on.  My answer to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and I believe the answer of any right-thinking Deputy must be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, then produce an alternative.  Where will we continue our trade if we do not go into Europe?</P>
    <P>Another problem involved is the education of public opinion.  I do not think our people are fully aware of the structure of the European Community. <Col N="1052" /> the Yaoundé Convention means or entails.  These are matters which must be put across to them because in the final analysis they are the people who will be affected, and I believe they will be affected to the good.  On the question of communication, public opinion can be educated through the newspapers, through radio and television and through the schools.  The newspapers are doing a good service in this respect. I might mention, in passing, the articles by Mr. Séamus Brady of the <i>Irish Press</i>.  He did a tour of the Community countries, and clearly indicated how the economy of the various countries had been affected by the Common Market.  Equally, there was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> giving facts about the Common Market.  This is the type of information which I believe will educate public opinion.  The history books in the schools will have to be revised and brought up to date, and possibly when that is being done, it might be mentioned, by the way, that Ireland is anxious to become a member of a greater economic community. I have said before that government by secret is anathema and is entirely contrary to the national interest.  The people are entitled to know and must be told what the European Community is all about.</P>
    <P>I happened to be in the city on Saturday night outside the GPO listening to the Anti-Common Market League letting off about our sovereignty.  I consider myself to be of the Republican tradition and I would certainly say, in fairness to these people, I had a lot of sympathy with what they said.  But again it was all couched in the same terms: The speech of the great &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  All negatives; no alternative was given.  It is important that we should discuss our sovereignty and how it would be affected.</P>
    <P>Some of our people do not seem to recognise that at this time we are European as well as being Irish men and Irish women.  Our entry into European will possibly have an emotional impact, as indeed the emotionally-charged atmosphere in O'Connell Street on Saturday night indicated. Again I ask: Do we cease being Irish <Col N="1053" /> men and Irish women, do we submerge our national identity and become citizens of Europe?  The answer is that we do become citizens of Europe as we became participants in the United Nations without loss of national identity.</P>
    <P>If we do become full members, then we take our places on the Commission with a representation equal to our commitments.  There will be no loss of sovereignty here.  Equally it is envisaged that the members of the European Parliament will be elected by universal suffrage.  At the moment the European Parliament, as it is constituted, is made up of 142 members selected from and sent to the European Parliament from disparate European Parliaments.  Again it is envisaged in an increased European Parliament that the people will elect whom they wish to send to the European Parliament.  This again raises the issue of the Constitution.  I am sure those on the Constitution Committee will take note of this fact. It is a period of great change and one which will require great changes.</P>
    <P>On the question of political alignment as it exists at present, there are four political parties making up the European Parliament of 142 Members. The four political groups are the Christian Democrats, the Socialists, the Liberals and the Democratic Union of Gaullists.  I wonder what banner Deputy Corish will go under.  Will it be under a socialist banner, the same as Fianna Fáil.  However I would think we would from a separate group called the Social Democrats.</P>

      <P>He has caused a lot of heart-searching amongst those who do not share his political views or his idea of the destiny of Europe and those who possibly do not agree with his attitude to NATO or other things. Frankly, I suggest that Ireland should stay outside this alliance as I believe it will preserve our neutrality and, most important, preserve our independence of attitude on world affairs generally.  I believe this will be the making of this country, the continuation of this concept of independence of attitude.  Apart from the fact that NATO is now almost defunct, there are deeper issues involved and I should not like this country to align itself with the foreign policy of any country or that we should lose our independence of mind or attitude in the international forum.  If we adopt this policy of independence we will gain the respect of the European countries with which I am sure in time we shall become partners in the greater European Market.</P>
      <P>General de Gaulle has not endeared himself to certain people but we must recognise that he has achieved a great deal for France.  He has instilled a new confidence in the French people, given them a sense of destiny which they probably did not have since the time of Napoleon.  He has given them political stability.  These are good things. He has an independence of mind and attitude which I admire.  Ireland's destiny lies in Europe and I believe it lies nowhere else in the world.</P>
      <P>We might ask ourselves what has Ireland to offer Europe.  We have a strong democratic base to add to the European institutions and I also believe we could give the Six the opportunity of proving to the world that they are Europeans and it will give the world an opportunity of seeing that Europeanism does not mean exclusivity to the Six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding, there are one or two points I should like to mention. One of them is taken from &ldquo;The Common Market and Common Law&rdquo;, a book by John Temple-Lang which <Col N="1055" /> came out in 1967.  He makes the point that the approach of the EEC Commission to cartels is similar to that of the Fair Trade Commission, even though its terms of reference are limited to matters affecting trade between member States.  Were we to join the Common Market the Fair Trade Commission would retain the right to prohibit abuses which it considered against the public interest regardless of the EEC Commission's verdict on such practices.  This is a very important point in relation to suggestions that have been made in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Equally, I want to point out that in regard to small businesses there are specific safeguards in the Treaty of Rome and in the regulations under it to ensure that while small businesses will manufacture separately they may market <i>en bloc</i>.  So, the scares being put about by certain persons or politicians, are to that extent, without foundation.  We should tell small industries or businesses that this is the situation and that if they pull up their socks and work harder, they will survive within the greater European market.  This is the type of thing we should tell the people.  There is no discrimination in the Common Market on the basis of nationality.</P>
    <P>There is the question of language. I wonder how many Deputies know French.  I have a smattering of it and I am not proud of my lack of knowledge of it.  Possibly we should come together in an all-Party Committee and set up a French class here.  Some might consider that a facetious remark but all Deputies represent the people who, I assume, will be going into the greater European Market and I expect French will be the <i>lingua franca</i> of that market.  I hope it will be; it is a beautiful language.  Its literature is well known.  It is important that we should consider this type of situation. How many of us know the French language?  I know Deputy Dillon has a smattering of it and other Deputies and Senators know French.  These are matters to which we should give some thought.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> I should like to stress this question of communication on matters relating to the Common Market.  I should like to see articles in the papers on education in relation to the Common Market, on how income tax will be affected, on the social services, on social security generally and on the regional policy.  People speak of Ireland having underdeveloped areas but if you relate our underdeveloped areas to Southern Italy in the context of the Common Market at present you find that we are considerably ahead of Southern Italy.  This would come under the regional policy and I am sure we will be helped under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to congratulate the Minister for External Affairs on his initiative in setting up the separate mission to the Common Market.  It was something that was needed and I am confident it will fill that need. Equally, it has been said that we have not been taking sufficient interest in the Common Market.  One can only gauge our interest or lack of it by the comings and goings of the Taoiseach and his Ministers who have been commuting between Europe and Ireland. The Taoiseach has been touring European capitals and is to be congratulated on this, as also is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey. They have been drumming up support for Ireland's eventual entry into Europe and they are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies of all Parties, in the interests of the nation, not to be gloomy about the Community.  Let us give the people confidence.  Let us tell them the rights and the wrongs. Let us help them.  The expression of gloomy forebodings can do nothing but undermine national confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Andrews on his speech, although I do not agree with all of it.  For me, the point of high drama was when I saw him smile three times for the first time since he became a member of Dáil Éireann as far as I am aware.  It does no harm to be cheerful in public life. It is not necessary to look sad in order to be serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear to Dáil Éireann that the affirmative vote which <Col N="1057" /> I shall give this evening is to the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the decision to re-activate Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community but in the light of the obligations already imposed on our economy by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the possibility of EEC membership regrets the failure of the Government to take more realistic preparatory steps both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>It is five years, Sir, since I first introduced a debate in this House on 13th December, 1962 on Ireland's entry into the European Common Market.  It is reported in the Debates of this House in columns 1329 to 1356 of that date and I ask the House to note that I desire to reiterate, five years later, every word I then uttered. I believe that the words I then said are as relevant to the situation now as they were when I first uttered them here.</P>
    <P>Let us get to the root of this matter, Sir.  If Britain joins the Common Market, 80 per cent of our foreign trade will cross the Common Market tariffs existing against us but if Ireland does not accompany Britain into the market and if such a position should arise that 80 per cent of our external market was cut off, it would be a ludicrous understatement to describe as an ordeal the situation through which our people would have to pass.  In fact, instead of exporting goods, we would export our people and there would be nothing left at home but the old and the children, with nobody left to earn the means to pay them the social security benefits, without which their standard of living would decline to the level of destitution.</P>
    <P>To anyone who says that if Britain and Northern Ireland joined the Common Market, Ireland should not, it is fair to ask the question: what do you propose to do with the 80 per cent of foreign trade that we have at present with a foreign market which includes Britain and Northern Ireland?  I have heard nobody answer that question.  I have heard some of the more euphoric <Col N="1058" /> members of Fianna Fáil say at Strasbourg that we were going to enter the Common Market, whether Britain entered it or not, but I also know that when they came back to Dáil Éireann, they denied emphatically that they had ever said that.  It is just as daft to say that we would go in whether Britain or Northern Ireland did or not as to say that we should not go in if Britain and Northern Ireland do go in.</P>
    <P>If we stayed out and they went in, we would be economically ruined.  If we went in while Britain and Northern Ireland remained out, approximately 70 per cent of our trade would be put in great peril.  We might replace it with alternative trade in continental Europe to the extent of about 20 per cent but we would still be left in the state of economic crippledom if we allowed the common tariff of the EEC to rise between us and Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I remember saying the first time I ever spoke in Strasbourg that if the only purpose they had in forming the EEC was to grow fat and sleek and rich, then it would be better not to put their hands to the task at all.  I said that the only justification for the creation of a united Europe was the preservation of peace in freedom.  We can have peace very easily on the terms of those who would make us serfs but peace in freedom needs the eternal vigilance of those who would prefer to be dead without it.  I want to recall to this House that the creation of a united Europe is not an end in itself. It is a step on the road to a far greater concept which was first enunciated by the late President Kennedy on a significant occasion and at a significant place.</P>
    <P>With the inspiration that characterised that young statesman, he chose to go to the steps of Constitution Hall in Philadelphia on 4th July, 1962, Independence Day, and to say on that day, so sacred to the people of the United States of America, from that platform so solemn in their history, what no President of the United States had ever dared to say before, something that did not evoke one single dissenting voice from the whole 50 states of the Union.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> With the passing of the ancient empires, today less than two per cent of the world's population live in territories not officially termed independent.  As this effort for independence, inspired by the American Declaration of Independence, now approaches a successful close, a great new effort for inter-dependence is transforming the world about us. And the spirit of that new effort is the same spirit which gave birth to the American Constitution.</P>
    <P>That spirit is today most clearly seen across the Atlantic Ocean.  The nations of Western Europe, long divided by feuds far more bitter than any which existed among the 13 Colonies, are today joining together, seeking, as our forefathers sought, to find freedom in diversity and unity from strength.</P>
    <P>The United States looks on this vast new enterprise with hope and admiration.  We do not regard a strong and United Europe as a rival, but a partner.  To aid its progress has been the basic object of our foreign policy for 17 years.</P>
    <P>We believe that a united Europe will be capable of playing a greater role in the common defence, of responding more generously to the needs of poorer nations, of joining with the United States and others in lowering trade barriers, resolving problems of commerce and commodities and currency, and developing co-ordinate policies in all economic political and diplomatic areas.  We see in such a Europe a partner with whom we can deal on a basis of full equality in all the great and burdensome tasks of building and defending a community of free nations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has taken the advice he gave to Deputy Andrews to talk about serious things with a smile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and this is truly serious.  The President continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be premature at this time to do more than indicate the high <Col N="1060" /> regard with which we view the formation of this partnership.  The first order of business is for our European friends to go forward in forming the more perfect union which will some day make this partnership possible.</P>
    <P>A great new edifice is not built overnight.  It was 11 years from the Declaration of Independence to the writing of the Constitution.  The construction of workable Federal institutions required still another generation.</P>
    <P>The greatest works of our nation's founders lay not in documents and in declarations, but in creative, determined action.  The building of the new house of Europe has followed the same practical and purposeful course.  Building the Atlantic partnership will not be easily or cheaply finished.</P>
    <P>I want to ask Deputies to note this peroration by the late President Kennedy:</P>
    <P>But I will say here and now, on this Day of Independence, that the United States will be ready for a declaration of inter-dependence; that we will be prepared to discuss with a united Europe the ways and means of forming a concrete Atlantic partnership, a mutually beneficent partnership between the new union now emerging in Europe and the old American union founded here 175 years ago.  All this will not be completed in a year, but let the world know it is our goal.</P>
    <P>I believe that some day history will have to recall that that speech marked a milestone in human history.  I remember as a young man in America, where I lived and worked 40 years ago, had any President of the United States dared to make a speech of that character on that day, at that sacred spot, he would have evoked an uproar of reprobation from a vast body of American opinion.  Five years ago, before his premature death, President Kennedy was able to say that, and make that commitment on behalf of the United States of America, without a single dissentient voice being raised.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Dáil Éireann something <Col N="1061" /> which I think badly needs to be said.  There are very few people here or elsewhere who realise that at this moment we are in the middle of the third world war.  We have become so accustomed through our history books and through our personal experience to a picture of wars involving the deployment of great armies, the marching and counter marching of men, the flutter of flags, the thunder of artillery, the filling of the skies with planes from one side or the other, that in the absence of all that drama, we find it hard to conceive of the existence of war.</P>
    <P>The truth is that with the emergence of atomic power and atomic weapons, war as we knew it can never assume world-wide proportions again, but there is a new kind of war.  It is part of the unremitting and declared intention of communistic dialectic materialism, under the leadership of Moscow, to assail and overthrow the citadel of individual liberty.  I think Moscow is right if Moscow wishes to retain the system of slavery for which it stands in the world.  It knows that there can be no permanent co-existence with freedom and the principles of freedom in which we believe.  On the day that the atomic bomb, and more especially the hydrogen bomb, became the common property of Moscow and Washington, Moscow abandoned hope of overthrowing freedom, as the Chinese still hope to do, <i>vi et armis,</i> by force and conquest by arms, but they have not relaxed in their resolve to destroy the citadel of freedom, if not by direct assault upon the citadel, then by consistent undermining of its ramparts not only territorial but intellectual.</P>
    <P>There is proceeding in the world at this moment an unrelenting war on freedom.  At this moment in history, the torch of freedom and the leadership of the forces of the world concerned with freedom are borne by the United States of America.  I chose the word &ldquo;borne&rdquo; deliberately, for it is a fearful burden.  It is a fearful burden for a free people within whose own domain the right of dissent is sacrosanct, and they are bearing it with endurance and immense sacrifice, and in the presence of every form of passionate dissent from one extremity of <Col N="1062" /> inspired treason to the other extremity of idealistic humanist materialism run mad.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there are people who feel that American resistance to the assault upon freedom by the forces of serfdom and slavery should be reprehended. We hear people talking of the awful horrors of Vietnam.  We hear people talking of the cruel slaughter that takes place in that afflicted country.  We hear few who speak of the fact that tomorrow morning Ho Chi Minh could end the conflict simply by saying: &ldquo;We want to go home&rdquo;. Nothing is more certain than that the masses of the American people want no permanent residence in Vietnam. Nothing is more certain than that, from General Westmorland down to the humblest soldier in the field, there is one common longing in the hearts of every citizen of the United States of America, not to speak of Australia and every other country involved in that deplorable conflict, and that is their longing to go home.  What keeps them?  The determination of the United States of America to declare there is somewhere a Rubicon at which individual liberty must make a stand.</P>
    <P>We witnessed recently an acute crisis, the repercussions of which we felt ourselves, in the Middle East.  I pass no judgment on the merits of that conflict, but the whole purpose of the civilised world, when that battle was embarked upon, was to induce both parties to end the fight, to sit down and find a peaceful solution of the situation that had created the conflict.  Who is now pouring arms into that dangerous quarter of the world?  Who is replacing every aeroplane, every rocket-launcher, every tank, every instrument of crisis to which you can put your name?  It has almost become indecent to advert to the fact that it all comes from Moscow or from Czechoslovakia.  I can almost hear the enthusiasts down in O'Connell Street winding up the machine to shout: &ldquo;Fascist beast: Fascist beast: Fascist beast&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anyone who dares to state in public facts universally known to those who have any understanding or knowledge of foreign affairs must expose himself <Col N="1063" /> at once to the vicious assault, not only on his good faith but upon his character and, indeed, even his background. I say to them: &ldquo;Be damned to you&rdquo;.  Some of them are dupes; some of them are frauds; some of them are hirelings who work for pay, whose reprobation I welcome.  It is amazing that we have not got one of them hanging around here prepared to burst forthwith into the strains of &ldquo;The Red Flag.&rdquo;  It is, of course, out of fashion now to say: &ldquo;Long live Jo Stalin&rdquo;, but I remember&mdash;it is not so long ago &mdash;when, if anyone had ventured to say in this House that Josef Stalin was a bloody murderer&mdash;he perpetrated horrors on his own people equal to, or worse than, the worst the Nazis did to Jew and Christian alike under the Nazi tyranny in Germany&mdash;one would have been declared anathema, a Fascist beast, until Khruschev joined the chorus, and then it became the very quintessence of international patriotism to join in howling for the removal of the remains of this vicious savage from the Lenin Tomb in Red Square. Then Khruschev tried to send his rockets to Cuba, to show presumably, his passion for peace.  They failed to find their way in, but he was thrown out on his ear.  Whoever presides ultimately in the citadel of tyranny, be it Stalin, or Khruschev, or Breznev, or whoever speaks for the Cominform&mdash; remember, I do not say who speaks for the Russian people, but who speaks for the Cominform which controls the Russian people&mdash;presides to destroy freedom.</P>
    <P>Mark you, it is a chastening thought that some of those most eloquent are prone to forget that, if the citadel of freedom of which the late President Kennedy dreamed, a United Europe and a United States of America combined, should be undermined, have its walls breached, or its precincts taken by the forces of the Cominform, I would not be allowed to say the things I am saying here and no other Deputy, man or woman, would dare to make a speech in Dáil Éireann that had not first been vetted by Deputy Jack Lynch and Deputy <Col N="1064" /> Frank Aiken.  God knows, I have not much use for Deputy Jack Lynch as Taoiseach or Deputy Frank Aiken as Tánaiste, but at least they share with me and the other Deputies one common ideal, an ideal for which we believe we would be prepared to shed our blood, and that is that, no matter how much they differ from us, they would die in defence of our right to say it, save only, perhaps, our old colleague, Deputy Blaney, who, under provocation, will invoke the closure. But, even at that, in this liberal dispensation, we are at least entitled to vote on that motion without sanctions being invoked against us.</P>
    <P>That is the struggle that is proceeding in the world, and I want to relate that struggle very directly to the whole concept of a United Europe working as an equal partner with the United States of America in an Atlantic partnership, such as that envisaged by the late President John F. Kennedy on the steps of Constitution Hall on 4th July, 1962.</P>
    <P>I was listening in this debate to Deputy Andrews.  He was anxious to emphasise that he was one of the young ones who was going into the Common Market.  I am bound to go on record as saying that it is a dangerous thing to make prophecies and yet I suppose it is our duty to foresee the future, if we claim the title of statesmen and not to be afraid to do so, if we have elected to enter public life.  I do not believe this country or Great Britain has as much chance as a snowball in hell of getting into the European Economic Community so long as General de Gaulle remains President of France.  I share a great deal of Deputy Andrews' admiration for the President of the French Republic and I would be profoundly reluctant to mention his name, in view of his exalted office, in our Parliament, but for the fact that his actions react on us; because of that, he may with propriety be referred to in this, our national Parliament, with appropriate respect.</P>
    <P>I do not believe General de Gaulle has the slightest intention of admitting Great Britain, or Ireland, or Norway <Col N="1065" />&mdash;whatever he may do about Denmark &mdash;into the European Economic Community because he believes&mdash;and I think, rightly believes&mdash;that the Community, as at present constituted, is substantially controlled by France. I think it is substantially controlled by France partly as a result of the inflexible will of President de Gaulle and partly because of the consummate skill of its Civil Service.  I believe that the final stone upon the edifice of President de Gaulle's resolution to exclude Great Britain was laid upon the structure when the civil servants of France found themselves confronted at Brussels, during Mr. Heath's negotiations there, with the best of the Civil Service of Great Britain.  I mean no disrespect to the distinguished public servants of the other five participating nations but there are degrees of expertise and skill which are supremely manifest in the public service of France, in the public service of Great Britain and, I am proud and happy to think, in the public service of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment pretend that the French Republic quails at the prospect of our impact, either bureaucratically or otherwise, upon the structure of EEC but I firmly believe that the bureaucracy of France warned their President: &ldquo;If we find ourselves confronted by our five partners, sustained by the bureaucracy of a new seventh partner, Great Britain, then the dominant preponderance of France in this Community is over.&rdquo;  I believe the position today is that General de Gaulle has notified Monsieur Pompidou and Monsieur Couve de Murville that he is aware of the passing of time and that, in the ordinary course of nature, he cannot expect to be President of France forever but, so long as he is President of France, Great Britain will not enter Europe.  Thereafter, it will be for the generations that succeed him to determine what the ultimate position may be.</P>
    <P>Now, let us stop and think for a moment.  Deputy Andrews, young and full of enthusiasm, seeing visions as he should see them, dreaming dreams as he should dream them, throws up his hands in despair at that situation and says: &ldquo;This means catastrophe for <Col N="1066" /> Ireland.&rdquo;  There, he showed inexperience and jejeuneness.  This country survived Oliver Cromwell; this country survived Queen Elizabeth; and this country survived James I.  It can survive General de Gaulle.  It was not a very pleasant encounter but we got through, you know.  We are here still. King James I is long buried in his mausoleum.  The Queen, the glorious virgin, whose title still evokes ribald laughter in posterity, Oliver Cromwell, who, I think, was dug up and cremated and his ashes scattered on the waters of the Thames, all had a go at us and we are still here, independent, sovereign and on our way to national unity in God's good time.  We shall survive General de Gaulle even though, for the moment, he does not love us excessively.  But there is no use, if you are dealing with a firm resolute person like the President of France, in opening your negotiations by saying: &ldquo;My Lord and Master, if you do not condescend, we have nowhere else to go.&rdquo;  That kind of thing only feeds fuel to the flame of an egocentric man.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to pause.  Does exclusion of Great Britain and Ireland from the European Economic Community mean isolation and decline?  I do not think it need mean that.  If the European Economic Community should say: &ldquo;No, we will not receive you,&rdquo; I do not think we should therefore cry &ldquo;havoc&rdquo; and collapse.  We should cast about to find an alternative &mdash;and there is an alternative.  There is an alternative which I believe would give some of the subservient nations of the French Republic reason to pause.</P>
    <P>Seas, wide seas, are no longer insurmountable obstacles.  If we look east and are rebuffed, though the sun rises in the east, it traverses the heavens to set in no lesser glory in the west. Deputy Andrews talks with admiration and amazement of the multitudes who occupy the market of the Six today and of the infinite potential for expanding trade that it provides.  I suggest he might go and make some inquiries in the Ruhr.  He might inquire from some of the steel masters of Western Germany as to how they are getting on.  He might pursue his inquiries amongst the Belgian coalminers <Col N="1067" /> as to the benefits they have enjoyed. It is not all sunshine.  There is some shadow on the continent of Europe. The future on the continent of Europe is not plain sailing.  There will be ups and downs there just as there are in any other free society.</P>
    <P>But, in the West&mdash;think of it for a moment.  If there were an alternative Common Market consisting of the United States of America, of Canada, of Great Britain and of Ireland, with a standing invitation to any other free democracy who wanted to join to come in and share that far more dynamic market disposing of an infinitely greater range of natural resources than continental Europe could ever have, I wonder, after a decade, who would be knocking on whose door.  I wonder, if Monsieur Pompidou and Monsieur Couve de Murville were told by their master, as is the convention in the incomparable Civil Service to describe their political guides, that they must stand fast to the exclusion of Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Denmark, that they could solve the problems he proposed to leave behind, may they not be behoven to say: &ldquo;Mr. President, if these are the problems you propose to leave behind, what are these people going to say to us if circumstances require us to come knocking on their door?  They would say, &ldquo;Gentlemen, remember twice in one generation Great Britain and the USA came sword in hand to knock upon your door while your enemies beset you and but for the fact that these nations knocked on your door with an unanswerable challenge you would have the crooked cross of Nazism flying over the Elysee instead of the triple Cross of Lorraine.  In 1973 we may find in a decade that they have evolved something without our help which had become indispensable to our economic future to acquire.  What will they answer when we come knocking on their door with the clamorous cry to give France, glorious France, a share of the new Common Market of the West?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House must not interpret Deputy Andrews' silence to my rhetorical <Col N="1068" /> question as consternation: it is merely an indication that he has gone away to his tea.  What does Deputy Andrews say to that?  Would he agree with me that if you go bargaining, it is better to go bargaining from a position of strength than to go bargaining on your knees?  I believe with the late President Kennedy that the right solution is a united Europe as an equal partner with the United States of America in an Atlantic partnership to share the burdens of the world.  Let there be no ambiguity about that.  I am prepared to commend that to our people and I believe President Kennedy's vision is the right one but if that is to be perennially denied for the glory of France, then we have to look elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have a primary duty to the Irish people and there I differ from Deputy Andrews and here I am a little towards the General.  I do not accept that our primary duty as representatives of the people is to Europe.  I say our primary duty is to our own and I claim authority from Saint Paul for that proposition.  I do not deny that our ultimate obligation is to all mankind but our primary duty is to our own people, north and south of the Border, the people who inhabit the 32 Counties.  We must love those north of the Border with a charity that will forgive their anger at the bread we bring them and invite them to share in any fortuitous benefit we may bring them.  I want to see Ireland in a united Europe but if I cannot get it, I want to see Ireland with economic opportunities opening before it designed to secure for our people the security, the standard of living and the dignity for which I pleaded when speaking before this House on this very topic five years ago, on 13th December, 1962.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to tell Dáil Éireann that while the prophet spoke of young men seeing visions, he spoke of old men dreaming dreams and perhaps the finger might be pointed at me with a legitimate criticism, projected against me that I have reached a time of life when I mistake dreams for visions, but I am not alone. This House ought to know that the <Col N="1069" /> concept I envisage has its friends on the other side of the Atlantic, both in the Democratic Party and in the Republican Party.  I could give distinguished names from both sides of the aisles of Congress who would willingly sponsor this concept, but I deliberately choose one from the ranks of those whom one would expect to be least sympathetic to it, the Republican Senator from the State of New York, Senator Javits.  He believes in an Atlantic union such as I envisaged and he did not come down in yesterday's shower, and it is not a popular thing in Republican circles in America to see visions of wider economic couplings such as I have described.</P>
    <P>Therefore I will say to the Government I deplore, in the light of the obligations placed upon our economy, in the light of the Free Trade Agreement and the possibility of European Economic Community membership, the failure to make more realistic preparatory steps at home and abroad. I would say to the Government: &ldquo;Get out and make way for better men.&rdquo; However, I would also say to the Government that the devil is entitled to his due and &ldquo;in so far as you have reactivated Ireland's application for membership of the EEC, I think you have done the right thing.&rdquo;  We will support any measures taken to carry Ireland into a united Europe but I am speaking in the same role as that for which Deputy Andrews cast himself, a back bencher, and I would say: &ldquo;When you conduct this negotiation, do not do it on your knees; do not do it to an <i>obligato</i> of protestation that unless you are received, you are a beggar at their gates, a Lazarus licking your sores.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us go courageously and honourably and tell the nations of the EEC that we want to share the burden and the benefits of an enlarged Community, bearing in mind the higher purposes envisaged by the President of the United States in his speech on 4th July.  But if we are to be denied that opportunity, we regret it not only for ourselves but for Europe.  We turn elsewhere in defence of a fundamental interest of our own people.  We believe, not without some foundation, that we <Col N="1070" /> have friends widely scattered throughout the world who understand the language we speak, whether we choose to speak our own or our adopted language, and who will not be ashamed to join us and for us to join them in the structure of a growing citadel for freedom to which some day France may come knocking as a beggar to our door.  Should that day dawn, we shall not forget Admiral Hoche, as the present generation of Frenchmen seem to have forgotten Eisenhower and Montgomery and the others without whose help France would be France no more.  I hope that, if the event I now envisage should ever transpire in the lifetime of the Minister for Finance and my younger colleagues, there will be the same unanimity in this House to bid our old friend, France, a hearty welcome and so heap coals of fire on the head and hand that had no welcome for us, when we sought it at their door.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all in this House will agree it would have been better if this debate had been held on the original date suggested by the Taoiseach and accepted by this Party, 27th June.  It would have been much better to have had the debate before the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance went on their various tours. It would have avoided the situation which apparently has arisen today that the Taoiseach has gone yesterday while the Minister for Finance is still here, although he is supposed to be joining the Taoiseach in these discussions.  Of course, we know why that date was changed.  On the occasion on which the date was first arranged, it was made quite clear that it was the week of the local elections.  But it was agreed it was better in the national interest &mdash;difficult though it might be for political Parties&mdash;that it would be held on that week rather than interspersed between the various visits which had been taking place.  But as they have so often done in recent times, and indeed down over the years, Fianna Fáil, when faced with a decision, decided to throw aside the national interest and opt for their own <Col N="1071" /> narrow Party interest, because they considered it would be against their Party interest to have the Dáil sitting while local elections were being held.</P>
      <P>However, the debate is here now notwithstanding that breach of their word, and we must consider it from two angles.  We must consider it from the angle of what is ahead and how we have made preparations here for that future.  The Treaty of Rome was signed on 25th March, 1957.  It visualised then that the trade barriers between the member countries would be gone completely by 1st January, 1970&mdash;a period of 12 years.  In fact, as we all now know, the negotiations internally have been such that they are now going to go on 1st July, 1968.  Instead of the 12 years originally visualised, this final change within the Community will take place in 10½ years and by the 1st July next year, there will be an end to internal tariffs.  More than that, by that date The Six will be adopting a common tariff against all who are not in the Community.</P>
      <P>We must consider this&mdash;as has been said before in this House and elsewhere and must be said again and again&mdash;not with the possibility of the world standing still, not with the possibility that we alone would be enabled to change the face of what is going to happen in Europe, but with the certain knowledge that some things are going to happen whether we like them or not, that there is throughout the world and has been over the past years a tendency to combine, a tendency shown, on the one hand, in the European Economic Community and, on the other, in the European Free Trade Association, a tendency to combine which might well have the effect of leaving us as a small island dot on the edge of the Atlantic, out of everything, condemned to a shrinking standard of living and a declining population, unless we grasp the nettle firmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem, this decision, this alternative&mdash;I can understand some people having some doubts and difficulties about the future&mdash;is whether one is going to become part of a very great Community or stand completely <Col N="1072" /> outside without any chance at all.  We are a country with a population of just under 3,000,000, compared with the 184,000,000 in the Community as it is at present, the 62,000,000 that will be added if Britain, Denmark and Norway accede, and the 39 million associated with it in Greece and Turkey&mdash;three million out of a total of 288 million people.  Indeed, one could look at it in another way, from the point of view of size.  There are something about&mdash;as well as I remember&mdash;27,000 square miles in Ireland compared with the size of the present Community&mdash;about 500,000 square miles.</P>
    <P>It is useless and futile for us to imagine in that comparison that we are going to be able, solely and alone, to paddle our own canoe.  We must recognise and realise that the decision that has to be made is not a decision in which there are two positive alternatives for us but a decision in which there is one positive alternative only and one negative one.</P>
    <P>Even if the European Free Trade Association were to remain, the fact that it did not include agriculture meant that it was not of much use to us.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was accepted by us in Fine Gael as being the basis of a step towards the European Economic Community and if in its growing pains, it has not done everything that was announced by the Government at that time, part of the blame for that failure must lie, not on the Trade Agreement itself, but on the administration of the Irish Government which failed to take advantage and to see that advantage was taken of the opportunities provided.</P>
    <P>It is suggested by some people that we have a choice in this decision, that it is open to us to consider and to determine whether we are going to join the Community if Britain does not or whether we are not going to join the Community if Britain does join.  We in Fine Gael have always made it clear that we believe in a policy of trading with our neighbours, that we did not believe, and do not believe, in the policy of building up an island wall, whether the ships are sunk or whether they are not, that the policy <Col N="1073" /> of trading with one's neighbours and increasing exports is the only policy that is going to achieve for our people a rising standard of living for a growing population.  We accepted that when, in 1956, we turned back from the inward-looking protective policies of Fianna Fáil and, for the first time in our history, provided real worthwhile incentives for exports, incentives which were decried by the members of Fianna Fáil at that time, but which, I am glad to say and I can say it, were improved by them subsequently.  But that turning towards exports that there was in that year, towards making our people growingly aware that there was no future for Ireland unless we could increase our exports and thereby increase our standard of living, is a decision that was inherent, as I say, in the policy of improving our trade relations with our neighbours.</P>
    <P>Where are we faced in that respect in this decision?  In 1966, our visible trade consisted of £373 million of imports and £235 million of exports, and if we take the new and enlarged Community which it is hoped there will be, on the basis of those trading figures for that year, £189 million of our exports would go to the present Six, Britain, Denmark and Norway&mdash;80 per cent of our exports.  To suggest for a second that it would be possible for us even to continue at our present standard of living, much less increase it, for a period even of a single year while we waited with the common tariff wall against all those 80 per cent of our exports is something that, frankly, we could not possibly contemplate. It would mean hardship for our farmers up and down the country and unemployment in industry.  The town of Newbridge in my constituency, for example, where a forward-looking industry has built up a substantial export trade and has been an example to many industrialists in Ireland, would find, as other industries in the same way would find, their exports cut, tariffed into a community of the Six plus Britain with us, sitting, perhaps almost sulking, as an island dot.  Quite apart from the loss that there would be for our cattle &mdash;and God knows, through the incompetence of the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1074" /> we have seen how the cut in exports of cattle into the Community from Britain this year has hit our cattle trade&mdash;it would be a tiny fraction in comparison with the difficulties with which we would be faced if we were to stay outside the Community while Britain had joined the Community and our market for everything was within that enlarged Nine. The unemployment would be something which it would be frightening to contemplate.  It is only because these things are not realised that we get people suggesting and wondering whether we can afford to go it alone. It is a fact of life which we have to accept, whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>The speech made on behalf of Fianna Fáil by the Leader of the then delegation at Strasbourg, Senator Eoin Ryan, in which he said whether Britain went in or not, we were going in, was just another example of the muddled thinking and lack of leadership by Fianna Fáil that has got the country as it is at present, unprepared in thought and in certain ways for the problem that is ahead.</P>
    <P>Some people may suggest that we would have a bargaining power in the amount we buy from other countries. Of course, there is in certain respects a limited bargaining power in that but it is a very limited one, because we buy from other countries because what they have to sell suits us, because we can get from those countries the goods we want at prices which are comparable and which suit our pocket, and we would be to some extent cutting off our nose to spite our face if as a matter of policy, we were going to pay more for our imports if they came from a particular quarter unless we were certain that in getting these imports we were at the same time enlarging substantially our exports.</P>
    <P>In this open economy which we have, we are more liable to fluctuations in relation to foreign trade, more dependent on foreign trade than many other countries are and for that reason it would be flying straight in the face of facts, no matter how we may dislike admitting it, to contemplate seriously going into the Common Market if 70 per cent of our trade remains <Col N="1075" /> outside it, and with our obligations in respect of the common tariff wall.  The facts, as I say, are that in 1966 £164 million of our exports of £235 million, or 70 per cent, went to Britain; £189 million went to what would be the enlarged Community; and of the present Community, £4 million went to Belgium, £7 million to France, £9 million to Germany, £1 million to Italy, virtually nothing to Luxembourg, and £5 million to the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that there are not in these basic statistics lessons which we should read and which we should understand.  It is, perhaps, one of the greatest tragedies of the 'sixties that since the Community became a reality for Ireland in 1961, proper preparation has not been made by the Fianna Fáil Governments who have been in office since that time.  We have had a continuation of contradictory speeches and lack of leadership to such a degree that the people cannot be blamed if they are occasionally bemused as to what is the real object of this Government, and I use the phrase &ldquo;this Government&rdquo; to mean the continuation of the Governments who have been there&mdash;the same wine in old bottles&mdash;since 1961, when it became a real live issue, to date.</P>
    <P>One of the things that was to be done in relation to our preparation for that was that we were to have programmes for economic expansion, that we were to see in relation to those programmes how we were measuring up to the targets we had laid out and how we could improve on our performance.  Some people thought that that form of comparison of target with performance was a dangerous operation, but when the Second Programme was being launched by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, on 26th July, 1963, he made it clear that he rejected that annual reviews were dangerous and that, on the contrary, they were of use in seeing where one could travel.</P>
    <P>Now we learn from this Government that they have run away from these reviews.  I understand the Minister for Finance is winding up on behalf of <Col N="1076" /> the Government tonight.  I want to challenge him in relation to the field of current Government public revenue and public expenditure to point to any time since 1963 when a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance ever took the targets in the Second Programme and compared performance with promise. As far as I can find, it never happened. Perhaps in one way it is not surprising it never happened, because the only single item where the target laid down in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was exceeded was in the amount of taxation that was going to be levied on the people.</P>
    <P>Now, apparently, the Second Programme is to be thrown overboard.  It has been a failure already anyway, but at least to see where it had fallen down would assist us in our projections for the future.  However, for the purpose of saving their own face the Government will not even do that, and apparently we shall have a new programme before 1970, a new paper plan. I remember all the various paper plans produced by Fianna Fáil, including one to provide 100,000 new jobs but which omitted the caption that the new jobs were to be in Birmingham, Coventry, London, Liverpool and elsewhere in Britain.  Anyway, we are to have another paper plan, but no attempt is made to undertake the discipline that is inevitable in a proper plan.  If anybody takes the trouble to read back during and since the assessments of the inflation of 1965, it is clear all the way along from every writer, from every body, that that inflation occurred for one reason and one reason alone, that the Government were not prepared to accept the discipline of a proper plan, and instead proceeded to throw aside such parts of the Second Programme as did not suit them politically.  They broke that discipline and with that break brought for all of us all the difficulties of that inflation.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the targets we are supposed to reach in agriculture.  Only one target has been reached, that is, the target in relation to cattle, and that has arisen with disastrous consequences for our farmers, because the scheme to increase cattle numbers was brought in <Col N="1077" /> without any proper thought or provision by the Government to ensure their disposal.  The improvement in cattle numbers has brought more difficulties because of the lack of planning by the Government, but if it has, it is a target towards which some distance has been travelled.  In respect of the other targets, we have failed.  Now we are to have no discussion, and apparently no examination to see where those failures arose.</P>
    <P>The policy in relation to industry has met the same unfortunate fate.  As Deputy Cosgrave said yesterday, patching here and there will not provide the improvements and the increases urgently needed.  Here we are today on the last day of the session, and we find for the first time on the Order Paper an anti-dumping Bill that should have been not merely considered here earlier this session but should have been ready if we had a Government alive to their responsibilities at the time that the Free Trade Agreement itself was brought in.  It should not have been necessary to wait until now.  It is brought in now on the eve of the recess solely, I believe, as a sop to opinion.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have seen striking improvements in management and in techniques by comparatively few firms but we have seen no real effort by the Government to extend that development through the general range of industry, no real effort by the Government to provide a proper manpower policy.  They have made no effort to deal properly with the problem of redundancy which would help more than anything else to do away with restrictive practices which we must change if we are to be able to compete in this modern world.  All these things wherein we should compare performances with targets are now to be nicely brushed under the mat under a new paper plan.</P>
    <P>A frank acknowledgment, for example, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;instead of hedging every time the matter is raised&mdash;that it is profits, when invested and reinvested, that produce economic development and growth, as is properly <Col N="1078" /> set out in a booklet circulated to us this morning on behalf of the Federation of Irish Industries, would be of great assistance.  Paying lip service to the idea at some times, the Government at other times have been making it clear that they are not prepared to have the efficient and vastly larger development that there must be if we are to ensure that we shall be able to complete adequately in the modern world.  In saying that, I want to make clear that we take the view strongly that our entry into the Community is something which will help to co-ordinate and integrate Europe as a whole, that it is not in the interests of the Community to have a sick man among its members and that if we are accepted as such, they will ensure that, bungling Government or no bungling Government, in the shortest possible time, so long as we get some assistance in the early years, we shall be able to play a full part and pull our full weight.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Corish suggests that the Government should not negotiate terms of entering but should first deal with those terms in this House.  I am glad that at last the Government have come to realise that would be the wrong way to deal with the matter.  I think the Labour Party are wrong in that, just as I think Collins and Griffith were right in 1921 to negotiate a Treaty and bring it back here for approval, and just as I think Mr. de Valera was wrong when he opposed that method and tried another method.  I rejoice that at last Fianna Fáil have, by this action, acknowledged that Griffith and Collins were right and that they were wrong in that method.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the only alternative open to us but that does not mean that we should not examine, and should not have examined, its implications far more fully.  We should have <Col N="1079" /> examined, for example, the implications in relation to the cost of living and in respect of social welfare benefits. I thought we should have heard something from the Minister for Social Welfare if he was really interested in the picture in relation to benefits in the Community and the target at which, as members of the Community, we should be aiming: the target in Belgium, for example, where there is a full pension of 60 per cent of the gross weekly earnings during the insured period, or in West Germany where there is an average old age pension of £260 per year.</P>
      <P>These are some of the things I thought we would have heard.  There is also the question of family allowances and there are family allowances in each of the six countries in the Community. On the other side of the penny &mdash;it is desirable that we see both sides &mdash;we should consider the amount by which our cost of living would be increased, the cost of living which might help towards a reduction of taxation to improve social welfare benefits in that the pound of butter in the Community costs approximately 7/- compared with 4/7 here.  The price of meat might be up and so might the price of eggs.  These are the things that a Government giving a real lead to the people might have answered and might have been expected to answer.</P>
      <P>We might have expected some examination of, dissertation on and explanation of EEC prospects which are set out in the market outlook for Irish beef and cattle published by the Agricultural Institute in which they base the excess of 100,000 cattle which they estimate we are going to have on the fact that the Common Market was only going to increase by one per cent in this year.  It would seem, unfortunately, that the members of the Government have not been interested in making these assessments known to the people in such a manner as to enable the people to know exactly what was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for External Affairs is here as I would rather say this to his face than say it elsewhere.  It has been a crying shame <Col N="1080" /> and a disgrace that the Minister has taken no interest whatever in European Affairs over the past five years.  He has not been in Europe enough to take that interest and apparently he has been engaged only in currying favour with Afro-Asians at the expense of the people who have been and would be the whole-hearted friends of Ireland at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>I think it a dreadful thing that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has rejoiced in getting for himself the reputation with European businessmen all over Europe that we have in Ireland the worst telephone service in Europe.  I was told recently by a businessman in London whom I was trying to interest in this country that he might think of coming here when we had a telephone service on which he could rely.  He said that he had been over here and that he had heard his business associates talk of the difficulties of the telephone service and said that he could not run a business until there was a more efficient telephone service in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I told him that I would make sure that we would order equipment in advance and that we would do things that Fianna Fáil have failed to do for ten years and that, apparently, they are quite happy about.  Anything I did is on the record and, unlike the Tánaiste, I will not run away from it, like denying that he ever said that all the ships should be sunk and that we should build an iron wall around the country. Thank God, all the ships were not sunk as the Tánaiste would have liked, or else we would be in a very much worse position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had the Minister for Local Government intervening the other day to pretend that the amount of the commitments of the Road Funds was causing the change in the grants this years and implying that we had more commitments to honour in 1957 than we have today, suggesting that there were more commitments to be <Col N="1081" /> honoured by the then Minister for Local Government.  I took the trouble to look up the records and the amounts on 31st March, 1957, totalled £2,800,000, while the requirements the other day amounted to £6,500,000.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister for Lands, who has been, when he was able to spare the time from attending at his office at Castlebar on Saturdays, engaged in creating holdings that are far too small to be capable of providing an adequate living.  We have Deputy Lenihan who, as Minister for Justice, should have seen that there was an immediate examination of the implications of the Treaty of Rome and whose committee has not yet reported and has not done the work that should have been done years ago.</P>
    <P>We also have Deputy Blaney as Minister for Agriculture who is interested only in personal and political control and has done more than any other man in the past 100 years to create chaos in the agricultural community in the past six months, who has set one farmer against another and who has set town against country.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, who was given away completely by the Taoiseach yesterday. We have been looking at the Common Market since 1958 and yet yesterday the Taoiseach said that in preparation for entry to that Community, we are currently examining the changes that will have to be made in our tax system to bring it in line with the Community's arrangement.  For five years we have had the prospect of the Common Market before us and yet we are only currently examining the changes that may have to be made. It is five years, although in the White Paper tabled by the Government of which the Minister is a member, it was stated that in April, 1965, the Commission submitted a draft directive on the form and procedure for the application that would be necessary.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance gave no indication that he was in any way moving towards arriving at conclusions leading to harmony with the taxation policy of the <Col N="1082" /> European Community.  Since then he has referred to it in one speech but it was obvious that that was done in order to cover up his lack of progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the reference to it here and it is not very complimentary to the Minister himself.  These are the reasons why we felt it necessary, in the common interest, to put down the amendment moved by Deputy Cosgrave yesterday, in order to show that it is the bungling and inefficiency of the Government that have resulted in the people being confused and not knowing exactly where they were.  We believe in trading with our neighbours and because of that belief we are going to vote for this motion. I believe that if we are to have a rising standard of living for a growing population we must enter the Common Market simultaneously with Britain. To stand aside and refuse to do so because of the bungling of Fianna Fáil would be to condemn our people to greater hardship, to condemn them to worse unemployment and to deprive them of the opportunity that is their right.</P>
      <P>We shall also vote for the amendment to have it on the records of the Dáil for future generations that we hold the Government responsible for any lack of preparation there may be, for their failure as a Government to make those preparations, for their failure as a Government in all directions, a failure which was condemned by the people on 28th June and will be condemned again by the people whenever they get a chance in a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying for the Labour Party on the amendment moved by Deputy Corish yesterday, I should, first of all, like to put some facts straight.  The Labour Party submitted an amendment and will vote against the motion.  Fine Gael submitted an addendum and will, I presume, vote for the motion.  Having said that, I should like to point out that for the second time within a period of <Col N="1083" /> about 18 months, when a serious position has arisen, and a very serious matter is being discussed by Dáil Éireann, we find Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil of one mind on that matter.  The only opposition to it is coming from the Labour Party.  Possibly it is a sign of things to come.  We may find that the union of hearts which was talked about here today may be a lot nearer in this House than many people realise.</P>
      <P>In concluding, Deputy Sweetman had harsh things to say about individual members of the Government. We have harsh things to say about Government action and inaction because in this case we feel that the Government have been incompetent. They could not have been more incompetent. In fact, as Deputy Coughlan said in an intervention while Deputy Sweetman was speaking, at attempt is being made to sell the country, not the Labour Party, not this House, but the whole country, a pig in a poke, and we know the type of pigs there are in the country at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say also that this evening Deputy T.F. O'Higgins lectured the Labour Party on socialism.  Perhaps Deputy O'Higgins is an expert on socialism because in his address to the House, he did what most Fianna Fáil people did.  He directed his attack on the Labour Party.  Apparently Deputy O'Higgins and others think that if you are a socialist, you have to be a certain type of socialist, that you must be akin to some continental socialist parties or you are not a socialist at all.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party claim and have proved that we are socialists, but we are socialists who put the interests of Ireland first, not international interests or anything else, but the interests of this country.  We have no apology to offer to Deputy O'Higgins, Fine Gael or anyone else for adopting that line.  It is awfully easy to get around a problem by directing the attack away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> I cannot see what Fine Gael hope to achieve by putting down this addendum because, in fact, they are saying to Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;We know you have made an awful muddle of things.  We know you are desperately incompetent. We know you are not handling the situation right, but go ahead, you have our blessing.  We will back you to the hilt.  All right, muddle into the Common Market, if you can.  Make as many mistakes as you can.  It is all right.  Fine Gael are behind you because you think as we do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we in the Labour Party have the interests of the ordinary people of this country at heart.  We claim to represent a broad cross-section of the people and we do not think we will get any thanks from them or anyone else for walking with our hands up into the rich man's club of Europe and saying: &ldquo;We want to get in; it must be nice in there,&rdquo; knowing, at the same time, that if we go in, the very people we represent are the people who will take all the kicks. Those who have a lot of this world's goods will make sure to protect their friends.  Those who have power and authority will, as they always do, protect those they represent and see that the harsh realities of this excruciating exercise, as the late Deputy Norton described it, will not affect them as much as it will affect those who have barely enough to live on, those living from day to day because of inadequate wages and because of bad management not only by this Government but by previous Governments.  There are people in this country who are living from hand to mouth literally.  If there is more unemployment and a higher cost of living and things go from bad to worse, who is going to suffer? Those people are, as they always do.</P>
    <P>We have a new suggestion here. There was a decision which was practically unanimous and which was backed by the people, that we were a neutral nation and intended to remain neutral.  That is no longer so.  The Taoiseach said we must accept political commitments.  The leader of Fine Gael said that of course we must forget, that it was for the last war that we were neutral, that that does not <Col N="1085" /> apply now, that we are free to make up our minds.  Perhaps the suggestion is that we should tell these people that we are prepared to supply the manpower and the cannon fodder until a war starts and then say we are neutral again.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter, and a matter which must be decided, not by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, but by the people.  If we are changing from our policy of neutrality, it is the people who must decide.  Have no doubt about that.  Of course, again, the wonderful idea has been put forward that we must play our part.  It is a long time since a famous Irish patriot said that when battles had to be fought in this country, they were fought by the great and respected body of men of no property.  If a third world war is started, I can see Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael saying: &ldquo;We will play our part. You fellows with no property go out to the front lines, to the trenches.  We have no time.  We must look after our own business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The suggestion made here by both sides of the House on the question of neutrality cannot be allowed to go any further.  They have got to get it into their heads that if the decision on neutrality is to be changed, it is the people who must change it.  It should be made an issue at a general election instead of being settled behind closed doors.  We are not going to accept that, not because we are cowards but because when any battles were fought, it was the people who traditionally supported the Labour Party since its foundation who fought them and who were involved.  While from time to time there were people who came from other ranks, the great majority of those involved in the fight for Irish freedom were these people to whom I have been referring.  In every war that has ever taken place since history came to be written there were Irishmen fighting.</P>
    <P>Added to that, we have now, of course, the suggestion that patriotism is a dirty word.  We should forget our patriotism, and go into Europe.  &ldquo;We are no longer Irishmen; we are Europeans.  Go into Europe, and forget all the rest of it.&rdquo;  That may be <Col N="1086" /> all right for people like the Germans and the French, ravaged by two wars in the past 50 years.  It may be all right for them if they want to avoid that sort of catastrophe again.  But this country fought for its freedom over 700 years.  It has now got partial freedom.  Are we to go marching into the Common Market under the Union Jack while the six north-eastern counties are still tied up with Britain?  Are we to say: &ldquo;It is all right now, boys. We will forget the fact that you are by force holding portion of our territory. We are going into the Common Market and everything will be forgotten?&rdquo; The Irish people will not accept that.  They have demonstrated over the years that they are both a patriotic and courageous nation, and if anybody thinks Ireland's right to demand freedom for the six north-eastern counties has been abandoned, they have another think coming to them.</P>
    <P>We know quite well here are people&mdash;I am surprised at some of them&mdash;who try to give the impression that everything will be all right so far as the Border is concerned: &ldquo;Go into the Common Market and the Border will disappear and, if the Border disappears, we have nothing to worry about.&rdquo;  Does anybody think it is because some people, taking goods across the Border, have to pay a little in customs duty, that is the only thing about which we complain?  If we go into the Common Market, will the army of occupation in the North disappear? Will the people who represent an alien Government there disappear?  Let us get some sense into all this.  This is Ireland and the people who are holding the North today are not Irish.</P>
    <P>Over the past few days we have been listening to quite a number of people speaking here.  Some of them appear to be well briefed in putting their Party's point of view.  Some of them seemed to know very little about the subject matter under discussion and just came in for the purpose of keeping the House going.  It is deplorable that more responsible speakers from the two big Parties, particularly from Fianna Fáil, were not in this House explaining their point of view in relation to this important matter.  I believe the Minister for <Col N="1087" /> Agriculture, who spent a great deal of time here last week, was in the Seanad today and possibly that excuses his absence, but either he, or somebody for him, should have been explaining in detail the way in which Irish agriculture is likely to be affected by the entry of this country into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>This business of saying to the farmers, as has been said, that all they have to do is to go in&mdash;they do not even have to say their prayers any more; they will be in Heaven straight away, once they go into the Common Market and everything will be grand&mdash; is a lot of bunk and nobody knows that better than the Minister for Finance.  Of all the members of the Government, I give him credit for knowing at least what is going on, and that is more than I can say for some of his colleagues.  I am quite sure that quite a number of the Fianna Fáil Party, including Ministers, are not aware of the full facts and do not realise what entry into the Common Market would really mean for this country.</P>
    <P>I referred to the previous occasion here on which the two Parties came together and I listened yesterday and today to the speeches of some of the Fine Gael Deputies here, speeches in which they roundly condemned the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain. They were, of course, right to condemn it.  The only trouble is they did not condemn it at the right time, because, when it was going through this House and when the vote was taken on 6th January, 1966, the Labour Party were the only people to point out what would happen.  And they did not have to have Deputy MacEntee's crystal ball to know what would happen. They knew because it was quite plain, as it must have been plain to the Government and to the members of it who went to Britain to negotiate.  For what?  They got a very bad bargain indeed.  We voted against that Free Trade Area Agreement.  Now everybody says it was a bad bargain; now everybody admits a mistake was made. I do not think anybody can deny that <Col N="1088" /> the increase of almost 10,000 in registered unemployed this year as compared with last year must be due almost entirely to the fact that industrial goods are now coming into this country from Britain, goods which were formerly manufactured here.</P>
    <P>As far as agriculture is concerned, I blame, first of all, the present occupant of the Government Front Bench. I have discussed this with him both in the House and outside it on numerous occasions.  He may possibly argue that he was not as responsible as other people, but he was the person who made the first mistake with the farmers and, following on that initial mistake, one mistake after the other was made by himself, by the previous Taoiseach, by the present Taoiseach and by the present Minister for Agriculture. We now have the spectacle of the present occupant of the office of Minister for Agriculture flying to Brussels, for no apparent reason except that he knew the NFA representatives had been there a few days ago and, in case they said something which he would not get a quick opportunity of trying to deny, he flies to Brussels practically on their heels.  If that is the co-operation we are going to get in Irish agriculture outside the Common Market, it is a sad lookout for agriculture and for the country.  We have something between 100,000 and 150,000 head of cattle which cannot be sold this fall and nobody can say whether they should be held or whether they should be sold now.  If that is the only way in which the Minister for Agriculture can help the farmers, then God help the farmers.</P>
    <P>We have heard rumours that the subsidy being given at present to the meat factories may possibly be switched directly to the farmers.  We have heard rumours that there may be a possibility of introducing some type of subsidy which will induce the farmers to hold on to their cattle and not put them on the market in order to ensure a price for those which have to be sold.  But there is nothing definite about it and, if there is one thing Irish farmers hate, it is delay.  If the Government made up their mind and said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that would be understood. <Col N="1089" /> What is not understood is this pretence that there is something round the corner, something that never turns up.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister for Finance that the situation is even more serious than the Government seem to appreciate and, unless they are prepared to get down to it and talk in plain language, instead of the veiled threats so patent over the past few months, to the elected representatives of Irish agriculture, this country will fare badly, Common Market or no Common Market.  The suggestion has been made, if we enter the Common Market, the price for cattle in particular will go sky high.  If it were as simple as that, many of us who live in rural Ireland might be inclined to say that there is something in it, but anybody who knows anything about the situation must know that, first of all, the type of cattle we rear and the type of beef we produce is not, in the main, the type used in Common Market countries.  Secondly, on the question as to whether or not Common Market countries are self-sufficient or nearly self-sufficient in agriculture, there is grave doubt in relation to beef in particular.  The Minister said there was a market for cattle.  Someone else said there might to be a market.  I say it is very doubtful.  It is very doubtful if the kind of cattle we have could be sold at the moment if we had free entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I have criticised Fine Gael.  A number of them made very excellent speeches.  I would refer in particular to Deputy Dillon because, while I do not go the whole way with what he said. I think he at least had the courage of his convictions and said what he thought was an alternative.  The Taoiseach yesterday challenged Deputy Corish and said we should be prepared to put up an alternative.  With his army of civil servants&mdash;very excellent gentlemen and ladies they are and, I am sure, doing an excellent job&mdash;with their assistance, surely he should be able to know all the facets of this problem?  Surely he should not ask another political Party who have not those facilities to dig out the facts for him and to put them before him?</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is negotiating, as <Col N="1090" /> he claims he is, with the leaders of the Common Market countries, surely he should know what he is negotiating for?  Surely he should know what he should ask for and what he should get?  As Deputy Corish so rightly pointed out, the other countries have laid down their terms and stated the terms on which they would enter. Apparently, we have not done that, either because we are too damned lazy to go to the trouble of doing it or because we are unable to draw up a set of facts to put before the countries concerned.  If the Minister says he has got those terms and is doing that, then why can he not do what the other countries have done?  Why can the national Parliament not be told?  I do not agree with Deputy Sweetman, even if it did prove a point for him, that the right thing to do is to make a bargain and to come to the Dáil and to say: &ldquo;Take it or leave it: you can do nothing about it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made by a number of Deputies on both sides of the House of the necessity, the urgency and the responsibility on this country to join a united Europe.  What are they talking about?  Does anybody suggest that EEC represents a united Europe?  Does anybody suggest that even Germany, which is not itself united but is split in two, represents a united Europe? Does anybody suggest that, with all the countries outside the Common Market, it is any crime that Ireland, an island off the mainland of Europe, should wait to see what the best bargain is before we rush in?  Apparently the Government seem to think that it is the right thing to do, that it is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;, that it is a united Europe in their book and therefore they must join it.</P>
    <P>As far as the whole economic situation is concerned, I wonder if the Minister for Finance would be prepared to give us a short comment on what is happening at present to the economic position of Western Germany? Would he be prepared to say whether they are making so much of their position in the Common Market? Would he be prepared to say what <Col N="1091" /> the situation is with regard to France? Take General de Gaulle who, apparently, has not got the same ideas about political union and defence as some of his colleagues in the Common Market countries or the Government of this country.  Would the Minister for Finance be prepared to say what the ultimate position there would be or are we likely to find that we have a Common Market with the person who at present considers himself its leader, General de Gaulle, angling about for support from Red China to Russia, and back?  Is he to be the fellow who will lead the new united Europe?  Are we to have Red China as an ally? Is General de Gaulle, mainly because of his intense hatred of some of the British statesmen and some American statesmen, to ask some of his newfound friends to back him in his fight for control over Europe?  These are all matters which the Government must take into consideration before asking our people to back them in their attempt to become members of the so-called united Europe.</P>
    <P>We have a reference here to social welfare benefits.  Deputy Sweetman was quite correct.  He posed the question about the various benefits paid in the countries of Europe and asked if we would try to regularise ours.  I know we do not have to do so.  I know the situation is different from what some people seem to think it is.  I know that the EEC do not claim to have a uniform benefit in the Community: I know they can zone the benefits.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter I got from our Department of Social Welfare.  It is in reference to an unfortunate man who is on the dole and who has six children to support.  He received £4 4s 6d per week but 8/- per week was deducted because one of the Department's inspectors saw a heifer in the man's garden and said he had property which would bring in an income of about 8/-per week.  I wrote to the Minister and asked him if it was proposed that this man should cut slices off the heifer while she was still alive and feed them to his family because it was the only way in which it could become an <Col N="1092" /> income.  The reply I have received was that a decision had been taken and an appeal will be considered.  In the meantime, the man does not get his 8/- per week.  We are the people who are talking about the Common Market.  We are the people who are talking about going in and doing what is being done in Europe, while even the poorest of our poor have a few shillings deducted from them.</P>
    <P>In our amendment, we have asked that the whole proposal be deferred. We have asked to defer the decision on the re-activation of our application until such time as the full implications of what we are letting ourselves in for are known.  I do not think there is anything wrong with that.  Those who imagine that Britain is on the verge of being admitted as a member of the Common Market just do not know what is going on.  It is quite obvious to anybody who is watching what is happening that, if Britain does get in, it will be quite a long time before that can happen.  I quite agree with the Taoiseach when he said that if Britain goes in and if Ireland attempts to stay out, the position will be very serious. I go further and say that, since Britain is taking approximately 75 per cent of our produce and is, in fact, taking between 20,000 and 30,000 of our people every year to work there, we have got to be very careful about our action, and if Britain goes in, then the pressure on this country to go in will be very much more serious.  However, I do not think we should panic now as we seem to be panicking and, because Britain has asked to be admitted and has not even got a polite answer from General de Gaulle, rush along and say we are going in.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach has not done what his predecessor did.  Senator Eoin Ryan&mdash;it was referred to here tonight &mdash;has suggested that we would &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;.  Those days are gone.  I know that both Deputy Lemass and Senator Eoin Ryan would be very anxious to forget that those foolish words were uttered.  We cannot &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo;. However, there is no reason whatever why we should attempt to go into Europe and join the Common Market without any terms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> Deputy Corish asked if the question whether or not we would get associate membership was considered, and if the question was considered whether or not Ireland could hold to whatever trade agreement she had with Britain and make a trade agreement with Europe while her membership was being considered. Has that been gone into? Apparently it has not.  Apparently all the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have so far done has been to visit some of their friends in Europe, to receive a very good reception from them, to succeed in getting a fair amount of television publicity, to which they were entitled, and to come back here without one extra word of information, except that the Taoiseach is alleged to have stated that we are prepared to accept the political responsibilities of Common Market membership. If the Minister for Finance has any answers to these questions, and particularly to the ones posed by Deputy Corish when opening this debate, perhaps he would let us have them.  It appears to us here that very little thought seems to have been given to these matters.  I will go so far as to say that it looks to us very much as if this is another gimmick produced by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I heard somebody accuse the present Government a couple of years ago of government by gimmick.  I thought it a very apt description because gimmick after gimmick has been produced, and this appears to be another one.  I shall tell the House why I consider this to be a gimmick.  I have heard unlettered members of Fianna Fáil cumainn down the country attempt to explain to their fellows the wonderful things that will happen to them if we become members of the Common Market.  The bush telegraph apparently has been operating and they are spreading the word.  It is the old story that if you have not got bread for them, give them circuses, the circus in this case being the Common Market.  What will be the next one? The whole question of the Common Market and what it means to this country has been considered by our Party in great detail.  As I said earlier, the people who will be mainly affected if things go wrong are the people <Col N="1094" /> represented by the Deputies on those benches.  The ordinary people seem to be getting the rough end of the stick when anything like this happens.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the adaptation grants, and said that a lot of money had been promised and a considerable amount had been spent and the Government were doing everything possible to try to prepare us for Common Market conditions.  Deputy Kyne put his finger on it when he said that as far as we can see, the only effort being made by the industrialists is to find out if they can produce the same amount of goods with a smaller labour force, and whether or not the process costs more money because they have to introduce very expensive machinery does not seem to matter. The adaptation grants which have been paid out by the Government in many cases seem to have passed into the hands of those people who are experimenting with the expensive machinery which will have just that result.  Possibly that is what the Government meant.  Possibly that was their idea when they introduced these grants, that we should attempt to reduce the labour force.</P>
    <P>Of course, one of the Government speakers offered the usual solution which is offered by any pro-Common Market person, that there is no unemployment in the Common Market, that we should have no objections, that after all they are only workers. Maybe there will be jobs for them in Berlin, Brussels or Paris, or somewhere in the rural districts of those countries.  They are only workers and they can move off.  At present they are moving to Britain, so they can move elsewhere.  That seems to be the general idea and it has been proved by the fact that the Redundancy Bill, which we were promised and which had reached a certain stage, was shelved. It was shelved because the number of people who would be entitled now to payment under that Bill is so big that the Government are getting scared. That appears to be the only reason for the Government putting it to one side. If there were any hope of finding employment, <Col N="1095" /> or retraining people for other employment as a result of adaptation grants being spent, then perhaps there might be a little hope, but there does not appear to be any. I do not think the Government are worried very much as long as it does not cost them money, or perhaps it is because money is very scarce with them at present.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, as we always have had, the question of the small industrialist, the small shopkeeper and the small farmer.  I said something in this House before and a contradiction appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> from an official of the Common Market.  Since he was not telling the truth, I want to repeat it now.  The statement he made to me in Brussels was that in the Common Market there was no place for the small man, no place for the small industrialists, or the small farmer, and that such people would have to be replaced by the very big manufacturer or the very big farmer, because, he said, they are the only people who can work economically.  When I asked him what would happen all the people who would lose their employment, all the people in this country, for instance, who were traditionally employed in a small way, his reply was that they might get jobs in factories.  I pointed out that the prospect of getting jobs in factories in this country did not seem to be very bright and he came back with the reply, which was used by one Minister, that there was no unemployment in the Common Market. We are going to have people being asked to accept jobs, not alone completely out of their own neighbourhood but out of their own country, simply because it suits the people who run the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I described the Common Market as a rich man's club, and that is what it is.  I do not care whether the social Parties in Europe find at suits them to support the Common Market idea; I am talking about what will affect the people of this country and we in the Labour Party are convinced, from the scant information the Government have made available, there is no future for this country at present in Common <Col N="1096" /> Market conditions.  If the Government can come into this House and tell us something which will completely contradict what I have said, which will show that that is not so and will show that we must stand to gain in the Common Market, then we are prepared to change our minds, but as of now we can see no future in it. Whether or not we would be able to exist if the Common Market does not allow Britain in, and we have to continue to depend on our exports to Britain, is a matter which the people can decide fairly easily.</P>
    <P>I am quite sincere when I say that if the Government attempt to improve conditions, as they should have, if they had not got in their minds the notion that the only important thing at present is to beat down the farmers, if they could get that out of their minds and realise that there are far more important things to be done, they could substantially improve the standard of living of the ordinary people.  We must remember, too&mdash;and this is the whole crux of the matter&mdash;that for a Fianna Fáil Government to come in here and promise, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, to have the debate at the end of June, and then, having deferred it until now, to have the Taoiseach speaking for an hour and a half and saying nothing new, and then think that the House should accept without question what is happening, is too much to expect of anyone.</P>
    <P>We are mainly interested in what is going to happen to the workers in Common Market conditions.  The CIO, in its final report, as Deputy Corish pointed out, is quite definite when it says that a number of industries have no possibility of survival, adaptation or not, if we enter the Common Market, and as many more are likely to lose considerably in Common Market conditions.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, according to this report the number of people who are likely to lose their jobs if we enter the Common Market, if the industries in which they are engaged did adapt to Common Market conditions, is 12,000 and the number likely to lose their jobs if adaptation is not carried out is 40,000.  That is something which should <Col N="1097" /> worry the Government but apparently it does not.  Apparently the Government are prepared to sit back and to use this gimmick, the Common Market, as the solution for all ills and expect us on this side of the House to say: &ldquo;All right, if that is the way you want it, we are prepared to accept it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that we do not think that is good enough.  We do not think the Government have given any explanation in regard to what they hope to get.  As far as industry is concerned, we require more explanation than we have been given. We feel that industry is going to suffer badly if we enter the Common Market at present.  We feel the promises given in regard to agriculture are entirely untrue.  No matter what the Government say, they have given no definite proof that they can succeed in getting the terms which apparently they consider they will get.  We know that early last year the Minister for Finance&mdash;I am sure he remembers this&mdash;came here and, with the former Taoiseach, guaranteed that there would be an increase of £7 per head for cattle.  We know that, not alone did that not come about, but there was a reduction of almost £20 per head. Knowing that, to expect we will now accept that there will be a substantial increase in prices in Common Market conditions is just too much.</P>
    <P>We know that our workers are at present very badly paid and that industry finds it hard to compete.  But, if we succeed in getting a decent rate of wages for our workers, as we must, and if the cost of living increases, in Common Market conditions, we would then not be in a competitive position. Taking everything into account, we have to face the fact that the Common Market, on the information we have at present, is not for us.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which seems to have been overlooked&mdash;I referred to it earlier&mdash;this question of political union.  If anybody has any doubt about what is meant by political union, I can only quote from the July-August edition of <i>European Community,</i> where Dr. Walter Hallstein, retiring President of the former EEC Commission, suggested the need for <Col N="1098" /> political union.  On page 3, he is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>Our aim, the full political union of Europe, has not lost any of its topicality.  The weakening of NATO makes joint defence efforts imperative. Only through political unity will Europe be listened to and respected throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that the EEC consider that they should be able to build up a power <i>bloc</i> in a position to challenge the might of America, Russia or any other combination of countries? Is that what we want in this country? Do we want to be associated with somebody who will be expecting us, not to send troops for peacekeeping purposes as we have been for some time past, but to take part in any war which may take place?  Is that what we are being asked to do?  Are we being asked to give the Government a blank cheque?  Are we being asked &mdash;Deputy Coughlan's reference to a pig in a poke&mdash;to tell the Government: &ldquo;It is all right; you do what you think is right and we will follow you.&rdquo; Apparently, Fine Gael are prepared to do that.  We are not.  Let me say, in conclusion, that it appears we are back to the old Bible story.  Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.  We are afraid the Government are selling ours for less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The burden of the complaint made by the Labour Party during the debate seems to me to be that we have not given them sufficient information and we have not clearly enough outlined the problems, difficulties and implications of membership.  I thought the Taoiseach in his opening statement effectively disposed of the main purpose of the Labour amendment.  He has pointed out clearly that the procedure inherent in that amendment is quite impractical and could not be followed.  I grant Fine Gael that they see this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any validity in the case which the Labour Party have put forward that we have left a lot of questions unanswered.  I shall try to deal with as many of them as I can <Col N="1099" /> in the space of these few remarks.  I want to point to what is I think a serious illogicality in the position of the Labour Party.  Deputy Tully has indicated that, in his view, if Britain goes into the EEC, there is no future for us outside it.  If that is so and if there is&mdash;as there obviously is&mdash;a possibility of Britain going in, surely Deputy Tully and the Labour Party must in every way they can support our efforts to get in?  I suggest that the best possible support they could give us whatever about their amendment, is by voting for the substantive motion and strengthening the Government's hand in our negotiations.</P>
    <P>I want to say there is no lack of information about EEC and what membership means.  The Treaty of Rome is there for everyone to read.  It sets out clearly the basis of the Community, which is a customs union, supplemented by common policies for agriculture, transport and for commercial relations with third countries. It aims at the harmonisation and co-ordination of policies in other sectors, common rules of competition and free movement of enterprises, workers and capital.  By these various measures, economic union is to be achieved over a period of years.  This economic union, of course, will constitute the foundation for eventual political union.  The from of that political union&mdash;and this is important&mdash;will in due course be settled by the member states.</P>
    <P>The progress which has been made by the Community over the past nine years in implementing the Treaty of Rome has been spelled out in the White Paper we published as recently as last April, and which lists every important decision, directive and regulation adopted by the Community.  The Government have gone further and put copies of the relevant Community documents at the disposal of all Deputies. I think we can fairly claim that there is not a single aspect of the Community on which information has not been made fully available.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the disability under which the Opposition labour is <Col N="1100" /> not lack of information, but failure to use the information which we have put at their disposal.  If they had not so failed, I do not think we would have the nonsensical situation of Deputies on the opposite Benches urging the Government to insist on access to the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and the European Investment Bank or complaining that our wholesale and turnover taxes are contrary to the fiscal arrangements of the Community. Membership of the Community guarantees us access to the Common Agricultural Fund and the Investment Bank.  As for our wholesale and turnover taxes, it is clearly published in the White Paper that these are in no way in contradiction to the harmonised policies of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party professed to see in the Government's campaign to prepare the economy for membership of the EEC nothing but &ldquo;a succession of platitudes&rdquo;, as he put it, and claimed that we had failed to give any positive lead to the country. Is it Deputy Cosgrave's view that there is no point in the Government's unremitting efforts to ensure that everyone concerned in agriculture and industry is made aware of the conditions in which the economy will operate in the EEC and that all possible steps necessary to prepare for these conditions are taken in time?  If we had not resorted to these exhortations, I am sure Deputy Cosgrave would have criticised us for not doing so.  On the one hand, he berated the Government for not preparing the economy and manufacturing industry for entry.  At the same time, he berated us for what he called &ldquo;lavish expenditure&rdquo; on adaptation measures.  I submit that Deputy Cosgrave cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He also maintained a rather curious position about the adaptation measures and said that we should be more selective in the assistance we give.  That assumes that at this stage there are some objective tests which we could apply to ascertain <Col N="1101" /> whether industries could be viable in European Community conditions or not.  He should realise that the future of any particular firm or industry will depend on the energy and enterprise shown by management and labour in preparing themselves for Common Market conditions.  Individual concerns themselves are the best judges of their future prospects and the encouraging response to the incentives, to the extent of £14 million in grants and £63 million in total expenditure, which industry has received is clear evidence that industry itself is far more optimistic about our prospects in the EEC than are the Deputies opposite.</P>
      <P>Concern was also expressed by Deputies about the provision that could be made for sensitive industries and about the possibility of continuing our general scheme of industrial grants for the development of industry.  This very problem was envisaged by those who framed the Treaty of Rome and Article 226 provides that if, during the transitional period, difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in one section of the economy, or difficulties which would result in a serious disruption of the economy in a particular region, a member State can be authorised specifically to take protective measures including these which involve derogations from the rules of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made it clear in his opening remarks that the system of aids that we have for industrial development would not be significantly affected.  I feel that I cannot pass without comment what I can only characterise as the cheap jibe of Deputy Cosgrave yesterday here in regard to the Taoiseach's visits to European capitals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The citizen,&rdquo; said Deputy Cosgrave, &ldquo;might be excused for having the impression that not much more was involved than the Taoiseach tripping around the capitals of Europe shaking hands and <Col N="1102" /> assuring RTE reporters that he was very happy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think every responsible citizen knows, in fact, I submit, Deputy Cosgrave knows too but is not, apparently, big enough to appreciate or publicly recognise, that the Taoiseach has been doing, and continues to do, a truly remarkable job of work in presenting Ireland's case for EEC membership; and I want to put on record my view&mdash;and I have seen him at close range and I think it is fairly widely accepted inside and outside the House&mdash;that the remarkable success which has been achieved to date in these rounds of talks and the magnificent reception we received in every capital we have been in is due to the personality of the Taoiseach, in the first place, to his leadership, to the skill which he has brought to bear on his difficult task and to his obvious sincerity and his dedication to this cause of European unity.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody.  Several Deputies raised the question of the diminution of our sovereignty in the context of the Community, first, as it is, an economic unit and, secondly, as it is going to become, a political unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> The first issue which arises has regard to our constitutional position. The Taoiseach mentioned this matter has been under examination by a committee under the chairmanship of the Attorney-General.  That committee has now reached the conclusion that while membership of the EEC would not entail any fundamental change in our Constitution, a comparatively narrow specific amendment in regard to Article 29 would probably have to be made to meet requirements.</P>
    <P>The second issue relates to participation in the political union itself and this has prompted many Deputies to ask whether joining NATO would be a condition of our entry into the EEC. The answer to that question is quite simple and straightforward, that neither individually nor collectively have the Governments of the member countries of the Community at any time suggested that we would have to join NATO if we were to become a member of the Community.  Our nonmembership of that organisation in no way disqualifies us from membership of the EEC.  The attitude which we have adopted in the past towards military alliances of one sort or another is not the same sort of neutrality as is followed by countries like Sweden and Switzerland.  We have no doubts or hesitations in relation to the political implications of membership of the Community.  Deputy Tully may ask me what do I mean by the political aims of the Community to which we are ready to subscribe.</P>

      <P>We mean that we are fully aware that the Community as defined in the Treaty of Rome is intended to serve as a foundation for political unity and that we support this objective and are anxious to play our part in making it a reality.  Political union in Europe is something that has to be constructed by the peoples and governments of Europe and&mdash;this point I want to emphasise very strongly&mdash;there is as yet no political union and any union that is to be created will be the creation of the peoples and governments that are members of the Community and the precise from it will take has yet to emerge.  But, there is one aspect about which we have no doubt: political union without the capacity and the means to defend that union would be utterly meaningless in the world in which we live today.  The achievement of political unions, to my mind, necessarily implies the formulation of a common defence policy and the working out of common defence arrangements. That is clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only 45 minutes.  I did not interrupt one Deputy. I should like to deal briefly with the implications of membership for us in the field of economic planning and policy because there has been a great deal of talk about that.  As the Taoiseach explained in his opening remarks, the aim of the Rome Treaty in the field of economic policy is to facilitate the achievement of the various objectives which the Community has set itself and which are designed to lead in time to the creation of an economic union.  I want to make this important point, that they Treaty does not envisage a common unified economic policy for all sectors. It does envisage a common agricultural policy and a common transport policy. But, in all the rest of the economy what it aims at is the co-ordination and collaboration of the individual economic policies of the member States.</P>
      <P>Article 6 of the Treaty requires that the member States, in collaboration with the Community's institutions, should co-ordinate their respective economic policies to the extent necessary to achieve the Treaty's objectives.  The broad objectives of our policy in the economic field correspond with the EEC aims, and membership in our case is not expected to give rise to difficulties in this sphere; in fact we would stand to gain in so far as Community policies succeed in achieving greater stability and promoting balanced growth.  The review and consultation procedures should also be helpful to us in dealing with economic trends and planning ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject completely the suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave that the Government's change of their plans about the character of the mid-term review of the Second Programme is in some sense an attempt to conceal the facts of the situation.  This Government have never suppressed facts about the economic situation.  There has been <Col N="1106" /> a greater publication of economic statistics by this Government and of analytical and critical comment on developments in the past few years than in the entire history of the State. In fact, Deputies, including Deputy Dillon, have complained from time to time that we have too many economic publications, not only those which are issued officially but those of the NIEC and the Central Bank, as well as OECD and other international agencies. It is the intention of the Government to keep the House as fully informed as possible of developments on the economic scene.</P>
    <P>We have decided that as far as the review of progress, that is, the factual survey of the course of economic development in the first three years of the Second Programme, is concerned, this could most usefully be done in conjunction with the re-assessment of industrial and agricultural preparedness for free trade now in hands and linked up with the general annual review of both industrial and economic conditions which would in any event take place at the end of this year.  The results will, of course, be published. I do not accept that the delay thus imposed on reviewing progress under the Second Programme is in any way a deprivation: all the relevant statistics, in so far as firm figures are available, have already been published and commented on in Government publications, NIEC reports and elsewhere. Indeed, from the point of view of having definite information on progress in the Programme's first half, the postponement will improve both the coverage and reliability of the figures.</P>
    <P>The next, and most important, step is, clearly, to prepare a revised and definite programme of policy and action related to the external trading conditions we will face in the years ahead.  Nobody can say for certain just now what these conditions will be. Everything depends on whether the re-activation of our EEC application will succeed and when, and on what conditions, we will become a member. It would make no sense to lay detailed plans for economic and social developments without being reasonably <Col N="1107" /> sure at least that EEC membership&mdash; and not a position of isolation or of prospective alignment with some other grouping&mdash;is the external framework for our programme of policy and action.  We should have this reasonable certainty of our future external environment within the coming year and meanwhile we can use our resources most effectively in trying to ensure the best outcome of our EEC application and in preparing the general groundwork for a Third Programme.</P>
    <P>This general approach has been discussed with the NIEC who have agreed generally with it.  This in no way involves an abandonment or a hiatus in planning; it is, indeed, the only logical course that planning can take, given both the external uncertainities and the limited resources available, in Government Departments, in industry and in the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The general lines of future economic action in at least some areas, however, remain clear.  The necessity remains of increasing competitiveness in all sectors, of improving the efficiency of production, raising the standards of management and the level of workers' skills, of deepening and diversifying the industrial base.  These are essential to fit the economy into the new environment taking shape around us and to ensure its future viability.  This means they must continue to guide our interim planning.</P>
    <P>The necessary preparatory work for a Third Programme is, as I have indicated, being got under way so that it can be linked with the studies that are now going on in relation to our application, and so that it can take account of further developments as they arise. This programme will also build on the experience of the First and Second Programmes and will take account of the recommendations in the Report on Full Employment issued earlier this year by the National Industrial Economic Council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked me if the estimate I gave recently of our likely contribution to EEC of £3½ million was correct, and I want to say very briefly that it is.  Our obligations in this regard <Col N="1108" /> will be to contribute to Community budgets and funds generally.  The most important of those is the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  The next is the European Social Fund, and then the General Budget.  We shall also have obligations to contribute to two other budgets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be the contribution if there were, say, ten members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the contributions are made as to about 80 per cent by Germany, Italy and France, the balance by Holland and Belgium, and a small contribution from Luxembourg.  The best estimate we can make is that our contribution would be&mdash;this must be hedged around with many qualifications&mdash; somewhere in the region of £3 million to £3½ million, with a once-and-for-all contribution of less than £1 million to the Investment Book.  Of course, in return for that, we would expect to have access to the Agricultural Fund, the Social Fund, the European Investment Bank, on the same terms as the other members.  For example, in the case of the Social Fund to which Deputy Tully referred, that is used to assist schemes for retraining and resettlement of workers operated in the member States, and we would expect that appropriate retraining and resettlement schemes operated by us would qualify for assistance from the Fund.</P>

      <P>These are the various funds operated by the EEC.  It is clear that the appropriate schemes for the structural improvement of agriculture can qualify for assistance from the Agricultural Fund as would exports to non-member countries of agricultural product below those obtainable within the Community area.  There would also be substantial relief for the Exchequer arising from the termination of agricultural subsidies now payable which would no longer be necessary under the common agricultural policy. To my mind, one of the most attractive of all the many aspects of our entry into EEC is the comparative budgetary freedom that the relieving of the Exchequer of the burden of supporting the export of agricultural surpluses will confer upon us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A further point I want to make on the monetary side is that we shall have various fiscal obligations to undertake in connection with EEC.  As I have already said, the details of the harmonisation of fiscal policies have not yet been settled.  One important directive has been given, that is, in regard to the introduction of added-value tax on the French system throughout the Community.  There is nothing in our tax structure as it stands at present which will cause us any difficulty in that regard.  In the interim period, it will be quite open to us to continue our wholesale tax or our turnover tax if we wish to do so in the context of an added-value tax. No doubt when we come to deal with these matters, we shall have to consider all that the harmonisation of the tax structure means to us from the point of view of protecting our revenue and also pursuing our economic development, but in spite of what Deputy Tully says, again we have been giving most careful study to all these matters and all these aspects and we are quite confident that we can cope with them when they arise.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Corish who pointed out that the British Foreign Secretary had made a statement to the Western European Union outlining the issues involved in Britain's application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> He seemed to suggest that we were blameworthy because we had not done the same thing.  The first thing I want to say is that there is no comparison between the two applications principally because the problems involved in the British application are nothing like, in number or magnitude or complexity, those which arise in our case. We have no Commonwealth or sterling problems.  In fact, we are a creditor nation.  The entire structure of our agricultural arrangements will not have to be overhauled.  Our admission as a member will not give rise to any fundamental change in the character of the Community and our accession will not involve any significant changes in the form of the arrangements as they stand at present.  We have no international ties or commitments except the obligation to work for peace, an objective which we regard as fully consonant with playing a fully active and constructive part in the EEC.</P>
    <P>There are many other matter for close and detailed study and examination and negotiation but we have no problems of the scope and substance that they need to be outlined now in the way in which they were outlined by the British Foreign Secretary to WEU in Brussels.  We shall continue, of course, to put all aspects of our case before all relevant bodies and institutions, the member Governments, the Commission and institutions in Brussels.  When the appropriate time arrives, we shall submit all the documentation necessary and Deputy Corish need not have any worry about that. Even in Britain's case, I want to point out that with all the complexity and magnitude of her problems, she has made it quite clear that she is quite prepared to sign the Treaty of Rome as it stands and leave all these matters to be negotiated afterwards.</P>
    <P>There might have been some room in the early fifties for doubt about our ability to face the challenge of membership of EEC.  We had not then any experience in overall economic planning or the achievement of high rates of economic growth.  We had no experience of free trade conditions and the problems such conditions were <Col N="1112" /> likely to bring to an industry long accustomed to protection.  There is no reason for such doubts today.  In the interim, we have had the experience of successfully developing growth rates of three per cent and four per cent over long periods.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out, we have seen our industry continuously expand its potential, month by month and year by year, in the most keenly competitive markets.  We have seen manufacturing industry stand up already successfully to three successive cuts in tariff barriers.  There has been a marked improvement in the marketing arrangements for the more important of our agricultural products. These and many other developments, to my mind, clearly demonstrate our capacity to meet the challenges that Europe will bring, if we have the national will and desire to do so.  We did encounter difficulties last year but then so did practically every OECD country.  That is not what is significant: every country, even the most powerful and wealthy economies, encounter difficulties at some stage.  What is important is that we have demonstrated our ability and capacity to overcome difficulties, to correct adverse trends and in due course to get the economy moving forward again.</P>
    <P>All the economic indicators point to a substantial recovery in economic activity in the first half of 1967.  Exports have been particularly buoyant; production is well up on last year's levels in manufacturing industries, mining and building and construction. In the period, January to May, 1966, our exports were 20 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Turnover tax receipts, which are a very good guide to the general level of economic activity, were 14 per cent higher in the first five months of 1967 as compared with the corresponding period in 1966. The volume of production in manufacturing industries in the first quarter was 7.9 per cent above the index for the first quarter of 1966. Mining, quarrying and turf production were up 35 per cent in the first quarter. Transportable goods, industries as a whole increased by 9 per cent. There was a sharp recovery in building <Col N="1113" /> and construction.  Productivity&mdash; and this is particularly important&mdash;the output per person engaged, rose by about seven per cent in the first quarter of this year.  In the absence &mdash;and we hope there will be an absence&mdash;of any further international complications during the year it is quite certain that we shall reach a growth rate of between three and three and a half per cent as against one per cent last year.</P>
    <P>However, despite these favourable trends and the soundness of the economy, many people in trade and commerce still appear to be reluctant to step up the pace of their investment. I believe that one reason for that is the uncertainty surrounding our application for membership of EEC and about the timing and conditions of entry.  We shall have to wait some time yet before these doubts can be resolved, perhaps 12 months, but this must not be allowed to stand in the way of progress in the interim.  The greater the level of our enterprise investment, the more efficient will be our methods of production and the better equipped we shall be to cope with possible difficulties as well as to derive full benefit from our membership.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious that there should be present in everybody's mind the clearest possible picture of exactly what Europe involves in all its aspects.  If Deputy Tully is still not satisfied, we can come back and discuss this again after the recess.  I believe that so far as anxieties exist at the moment they are largely inspired by a fear of the unknown.  If there is full understanding of the situation by all and a calm appreciation of the implications, favourable and unfavourable, I think that a great deal of the anxiety which at present exists will disappear and will be replaced by positive enthusiasm to meet the challenge and avail of the opportunities that membership will offer.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to point out the lessons from all these developments. We are a far stronger, more diverse and better planned economy than we were 20 or even ten years ago.  We <Col N="1114" /> have learned how to plan and control our affairs within the limits of our resources and how to overcome difficulties, either temporary or of a more fundamental nature, if they arise.  We have had the experience of negotiating the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and experience of the negotiations for the GATT.  And here I want to point out to Deputy Tully that Irish industry under the Free Trade Agreement has done better than British industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that is that emigration is done.  I also want to say that the job of concentrating our energies in this direction is not made any easier by the statements of some Deputies who seem to take a masochistic pleasure in maintaining that our application is dependent on that of Britain, that our economy is subservient to that of Britain, that our freedom of action is limited and so on and so on.  I have always regarded this as an unrewarding attitude.  It is the béal bocht transferred to a new dimension and is just as meaningless in that context.</P>
      <P>Why should we feel ashamed that a combination of geographical and historical forces has resulted in our being a small economy placed beside a large and powerful one?  We might as well bemoan the fact that we are surrounded by water.  There are many other nations placed in the same position and they do not take a malicious delight in pointing out the fact.  They just accept it as one of the facts of life and go on in the circumstances in which they find themselves, and the sooner we learn to do that the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention this because it is important in connection with our application.  The circumstances of our external trade make it difficult for us to become a member of the EEC without Britain.  I would be glad if Deputies will note that I say &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; because I do not say it would be impossible.  It would be possible in <Col N="1115" /> theory at least to devise arrangements which would enable us to become a full member of the Community and at the same time, retain our position in the British market.</P>
      <P>This would involve the establishment of a customs union relationship with the Community with a special derogation permitting us to retain our Free Trade Area relationship with Britain, if both sides decided to give us this necessary consideration.  I accept that it it is most unlikely that either in London or Brussels they would be enthusiastic to devise the arrangements which would be necessary but it would be quite feasible if they were prepared to make the necessary concessions.</P>
      <P>While economic reasons make it difficult, if not impossible, we have no political objections to going into EEC without Britain.  Our application is a separate and independent application. Our membership of the Community will be separate and independent and our actions as a member will be determined entirely by what we consider to be in the best interests of the Community and by our own needs.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there are two ways of looking at this great national question.  There are those who take the view that if Britain becomes a member, we have no option but to do so.  While that is basically true, I think that psychologically it is the wrong approach.  Our attitude is a positive one.  We believe that possibility of membership of the Community offers us an opportunity unparalleled in our history.  It offers us an opportunity to take part in the building of a new Europe.  Inside that new Europe I think we could feel a great deal more secure in this troubled world because this new united Europe would be a <Col N="1116" /> potent influence in world affairs in the promotion of international peace in our time.</P>
      <P>Membership of the Community provides us with the possibility of building a social structure with a level of standards never before available.  It offers us the opportunity of achieving a level of economic expansion never before achieved.  I sincerely believe that all these are possible and it is from that conviction that my total dedication to Europe springs.</P>
