    <Title>Supplementary Estimate, 1966-67.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil, according to order, went into Committee on Finance to consider a Supplementary Estimate for the year ending 31st March, 1967.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Blaney) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Blaney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,167,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and Sundry Grants-in-Aid. </P>
      <P>The net amount of this Supplementary Estimate, added to the original Estimate for 1966-67, brings the total net expenditure from the Vote for Agriculture to £38,476,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main items in the present Estimate are Subhead K.12 &mdash; Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, Subhead K.21 &mdash; Beef, Mutton and Lamb Export Guarantee Schemes, Subhead K.22 &mdash; Temporary Scheme of Headage Payments on Fat Cattle exported for <Col N="609" /> immediate slaughter, Subhead K.23&mdash; Scheme of Grants for Farrowed Sows and Subhead N. &mdash; Marketing of Dairy Produce.  The gross total of the additional sums required under the various subheads amounts to over £5½ million but against this it is now estimated that Appropriations-in-Aid will be over £½ million greater than the original provision and also that there will be savings on other subheads of the Vote amounting to over £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £2,399,000 is needed to meet the cost of the support given to cattle and sheep prices.  This is made up of £1,739,000 to meet the extra cost of the support payments on carcase beef, mutton and lamb exported to Britain and £660,000 to meet expenditure under the Temporary Fat Cattle Headage Payments Scheme of last autumn.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement provides for extension of the UK fatstock guarantees to 25,000 tons of Irish carcase beef and 5,500 tons of Irish carcase mutton and lamb exported annually to Britain.  For exports in excess of those quantities the Irish Government are providing a similar level of support.</P>
    <P>Exports of carcase beef, mutton and lamb to Britain since 1st July, 1966, when the Free Trade Area Agreement came into operation, have been running at a high level and it is estimated that for the nine months ending 31st March, 1967, support payments will have been made on a total of 38,500 tons of beef and 8,350 tons of mutton and lamb, at a total cost of about £1,758,000.  For the first three months of the financial year, that is, the quarter ended 30th June, 1966, £56,000 was expended on support payments on carcase beef exports to Britain under the temporary scheme introduced by the Irish Government in February, 1965. The total support payments on carcase beef, mutton and lamb exports for the year 1966-67, as a whole, will, therefore, amount to about £1,814,000.</P>
    <P>As against that amount, the payments which we will receive from the British Government on our exports of <Col N="610" /> beef, mutton and lamb under the Free Trade Area Agreement for the nine months from 1st July last to 31st March, 1967, will amount to about £1 million.  These payments will be made on 18,750 tons of beef and 4,125 tons of lamb, that is, three-quarters of the amounts provided for a full year in the Agreement.  The precise amount to be secured from the British Government cannot be calculated until after the end of the British fatstock year on 26th March and none of the money will be received before the end of the present financial year.  It is expected, however, that we will receive most of it during April.</P>
    <P>The fat cattle headage payments scheme was, of course, introduced as a special emergency measure at the end of August to strengthen market conditions for cattle producers here at a time when prices weakened.  This weakening of prices has been brought about by a number of factors outside our control, the principal ones being the sluggish demand from Britain for our stores and the virtual closing of the EEC markets to imports of cattle and beef as a result of the imposition of very high levies.  I think there can be little doubt but that the fat cattle headage payments scheme kept trade moving during a very difficult period and prevented what could have been a more serious situation in the market. Other countries such as Britain herself and Denmark were, of course, equally affected by the difficult cattle and beef market situation last autumn.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,240,000 is required under Subhead N &mdash; Marketing of Dairy Produce.  Deliveries of milk to creameries set a new record in 1966, the total quantity used for manufacturing purposes being 406 million gallons, which was 14 million gallons, or 3.6 per cent above the 1965 level. The late spring seriously retarded milk production during the early part of last year, and if weather conditions had been more favourable, deliveries to creameries during the year would certainly have been appreciably higher.</P>
    <P>The general creamery milk price allowance paid by the Exchequer was <Col N="611" /> increased from 4d. to 6d. per gallon as from 27th May, 1966, and the extra sum required to meet this is £2,305,000.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the special extra allowance for quality milk which was introduced in May, 1965, is proving successful.  In framing this year's Estimates it had been assumed that some 40 per cent of the milk delivered to creameries would receive the quality allowance.  In fact, almost 49 per cent of the milk qualified in 1966, and because of this an extra £102,000 is now required to meet the cost of this quality allowance.  As Deputies are aware, the special quality allowance will be increased from 1d. to 2d. per gallon on 1st April next.  This increased allowance represents a very significant bonus on the basic price of milk and makes it well worthwhile for producers to take all possible steps to ensure that their milk qualifies for the extra allowance each month.</P>
    <P>A grant of up to £18,000 was sanctioned in 1965-66 for a milk collection pilot scheme operated by the Waterford Co-operative Society and £10,000 was paid to the society in that year. Only a token provision was made in this year's Estimate as it was not certain when the balance of the grant would be required.  An additional £7,000 was in fact sought during the year, and that sum is now included in this Supplementary Estimate.  The pilot scheme is designed to test the operation of bulk milk collection under Irish conditions and the final results are not yet available.</P>
    <P>The gross total of the extra amounts now being sought for the creamery milk price allowance, the quality milk allowance and the milk collection pilot scheme comes to £2,414,000 but, as there is a saving of £1,174,000 in the amount provided by way of grant to An Bord Bainne, the net increase required under the Subhead is £1,240,000. The sum provided for An Bord Bainne in this year's Estimate was £4,750,000 but it now appears that, due to such factors as the effects of the late spring on total milk production and the better prices prevailing on exports markets, the actual loss will be about £3,576,000. <Col N="612" /> The improved export returns arose particularly in the case of cheese, the improvement in that case being due primarily to the grading scheme introduced by my Department during the year.  This grading scheme has resulted in considerable trade interest in Irish cheese in Britain and it is expected that it will help to achieve a further reduction in export losses in the future.</P>
    <P>The total sum being provided by the Exchequer for milk support including the grant to An Bord Bainne, is £13,880,000 or about 8d. per gallon of milk delivered to creameries.  The comparable total for 1965-66 was £10,704,000.  These large sums are convincing evidence of the Government's willingness to assist the dairying industry within the limits of available resources.</P>
    <P>In regard to Subhead K.12, the expenditure on the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme for the year is now estimated at £2,882,000, which represents an increase of £1,000,000 over the sum already provided.  As an offset to this, the receipts in respect of the salvage of reactors are also estimated to show an increase of £552,000 on the original estimate of £400,000. The main reason for the excess expenditure is that in the six counties of the South, which were attested in October, 1965, the percentage of reactors to the tuberculin test was higher than expected. This increase in the incidence of the disease, while disappointing, is not of great significance, and there is every hope that the 1967 round of testing will show a considerable improvement.</P>
    <P>During the past year there has been a decline in pig output in most pigproducing countries in Western Europe. Despite price support measures in many countries the traditional pig cycle has not been eliminated.  This country has not been immune from the general cyclical decline and total deliveries to bacon factories during the year 1966 were 1.65 million pigs approximately, as compared with the record total of nearly 1.8 million pigs in 1965.  The 1966 figure, was, however, substantially higher than in the years prior to 1965.  With a view to countering at an early stage the downward <Col N="613" /> trend in pig production my predecessor announced in May, 1966, a scheme of grants for farrowed sows. Under this scheme a grant of £5 is paid for each farrowed sow up to a maximum of five in each herd.  In this Supplementary Estimate I am providing in Subhead K. 23 a sum of £275,000 to cover the cost of the farrowed sow scheme up to 31st March. It is too early yet to indicate the effects of the scheme which is to continue up to September next.  The records of sow services, however, suggest that the downward trend in production has been halted.</P>
    <P>Last year two schemes were introduced with a view to helping mountain sheep farmers.  These schemes were based on recommendations made to my predecessor by an expert group which he set up to examine the problem. One scheme provided for the payment of a subsidy of 10/- each on Blackface Mountain and Cheviot wether lambs sold off the hills in the period from 1st August to 15th October and which were considered by the Department's inspectors to be suitable for finishing on the lowlands.  Under the second scheme a subsidy of £1 each was paid on Greyface and Halfbred hogget ewes presented for inspection at approved centres in the period 1st August to 30th September.</P>
    <P>The immediate purpose of the schemes was to improve the quality and productivity of mountain flocks by encouraging the removal of the two most unproductive types of sheep off the mountains.  In addition, the lamb subsidy was intended to provide lowland farmers with an improved supply of wethers suitable for fattening while the hogget ewe subsidy was intended to encourage flock owners in the foothills to buy Blackface Mountain and Cheviot ewes from mountain flocks for mating with Border Leicester rams to produce the Greyface and Halfbred ewes on which the subsidy was payable at the hogget stage.  Under these schemes subsidy was paid on approximately 67,000 wether lambs and 11,500 hogget ewes, the total expenditure being £47,000 including incidental expenses of approximately £2,000. <Col N="614" /> I am having the schemes reviewed in the light of suggestions made from various sources and of the experience gained last year.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £30,500 is required under Subhead K.10 for the Warble Fly Eradication Scheme.  This scheme which has been in operation on a countrywide basis for the past three years has been an outstanding success. In 1964 over two million cattle were dressed, in 1965 4½ million approximately and in 1966 about five million. The level of infestation with warbles, which a few years ago was as high as 60 per cent to 70 per cent dropped to 3 per cent after the 1965 campaign. Information recently received from Britain indicates that, of Irish cattle arriving there in 1966, only 0.8 per cent showed warble infestation.  A decision on the future of the eradication campaign cannot be taken until we have completed a survey of the incidence of warbles in cattle in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the staffs of my Department's district offices are engaged on a spring campaign aimed at dressing for warbles cattle which were not treated in the autumn.  I am anxious to give all owners of such cattle a further opportunity of having them dressed and I would appeal to them to get in touch with their district veterinary offices with a view to arranging treatment.  I am afraid there will be no option but to take action against cattle owners who do not avail themselves of this final opportunity to dress their cattle.  There is also the possibility that, since the dressings used are not 100 per cent effective in every case, some cattle which were dressed and duly certified in the autumn may show some slight evidence of infestation during the next few months which is the season when warbles normally appear on the animals' backs.  Any such certified cattle will be re-dressed free of charge.</P>
    <P>The standard charge of 3/- per animal will be made for dressing uncertified cattle and on this basis it is anticipated that the spring dressing campaign will be self-supporting. Accordingly the sum of £8,500 shown in the Estimate under Subhead K.10 (3) is offset by a corresponding Appropriation <Col N="615" /> in Aid in Subhead P. (31).</P>
    <P>Subhead K.10 also contains a provision of £22,000 for compensation to herdowners for losses attributable to the dressings used under the Scheme. It will be noted from Subhead P. (32) that this expenditure will be offset by receipts from the proceeds of a charge of one penny per dressing certificate issued for cattle treated in the 1966 dressing campaign.</P>
    <P>A sum of £15,000 is required under Subhead L.1., of which £13,500 is for compensation for fowl destroyed as a result of fowl pest outbreaks during 1966.  With regard to the fowl pest situation, I should like to emphasise again that, although the condition has been labelled fowl pest, the only relation to that disease is in the positive reaction to a blood test.  In no case were there clinical signs of the disease.  Neither was there any spread of the condition nor any drop in production from birds showing positive reactions and in no case was the virus isolated.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of animal disease, I would refer to the ever-present danger of the introduction of foot and mouth disease into this country.  Holland is at present badly affected, and since the beginning of the year fresh outbreaks have occurred in Italy, West Germany and, nearer home, in Britain. My Department has intensified the precautionary measures which are continuously in operation against the introduction of the disease, but the effectiveness of these measures depends on the full co-operation of all concerned. I would appeal especially to persons in the livestock trade travelling abroad, and to Irish people working abroad on the land or in meat processing plants, etc., to be particularly cautious when abroad and to report for disinfection to my Department's staff at ports and airports immediately on landing in this country.</P>
    <P>A sum of £196,000 is required under Subhead K.8 of which £188,000 is to meet excess expenditure on the Land Project Lime and Fertiliser Credit Scheme.  The original estimate was <Col N="616" /> £185,000.  The generous credit terms provided under this scheme are attracting an increasing number of applications and present indications are that this increased interest will continue.</P>
    <P>The original provision made under Subhead F for grants to county committees of agriculture is now estimated to be insufficient to the extent of £55,000.</P>
    <P>A further £29,000 is also required under Subhead K.16 in respect of grants for forage harvesting equipment. I am glad to say that this scheme is proving very popular and applications for grants have been increasing each year since its introduction.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that, under Subhead D.10, I am seeking £2,000 for the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme.  This arises from the fact that this year we propose, for the first time, to pay the Farm Apprenticeship Board a grant towards their administrative expenses. This is made up of a basic grant of £1,200 plus a supplementary grant of £1 for every £1 which the Board raises from non-State sources up to a maximum of £800.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead D.4 and D.5, I am seeking £46,000 for the Veterinary Medicine faculty of University College, Dublin and the school of Veterinary Medicine of Trinity College.  This is due partly to the transfer of some staff from the payroll of the Veterinary College to that of the Universities and partly to increases in pay granted by the Universities to their teaching staffs last year.  So far as the staff transferred is concerned there is, of course, a resultant saving in the provision for the Veterinary College itself &mdash; Subhead D.3 &mdash; which has been taken into account in the total savings shown in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of university education, I would like to take the opportunity of informing the House that I have told the authorities of University College, Cork, that they may go ahead with arrangements for the extension of their Dairy Science Faculty.  I regard this project, which will ultimately involve State outlay of over half a million pounds, as highly <Col N="617" /> important for the future of the country's dairy industry.  All going well, it is hoped to commence building work around next September.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead C.C.3 an additional sum of £150,000 is required for the purpose of increasing the amount of this country's pledge to the World Food Programme in the current three-year period, 1966 to 1968.  As the House knows the Programme is a joint UN/FAO project which aims at the utilisation of surplus food donated by member countries of these organisations in implementing social and economic development programmes in the developing countries of the world. The target set for the Programme in the current period was 275 million dollars but the total amount pledged by all countries to date is of the order of 155 million dollars.  The United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organisation have recently appealed to member states to increase their pledges to enable the goal of 275 million dollars to be reached.</P>
    <P>A sum of £450,000 was pledged on behalf of Ireland in January, 1966, and the additional amount now being sought will increase our pledge to £600,000.  Ireland's pledge to the Programme in its initial three-year period from 1963 to 1965, when the target set was 100 million dollars, was £300,000.  This country's pledges to the Programme are fulfilled on the basis of approximately one-third of the pledge being provided in cash and the balance in Irish foodstuffs, usually milk-powder and canned meat.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £60,000 required under Subhead A is to meet the cost of tenth round pay increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so in order to widen the scope of the discussion and not because we object in any way to the amounts being sought apart from minor exceptions. This Estimate is in respect of a period during which there has been a very serious crisis in the agricultural industry.  It is in respect of a period in which the farmers of this country, fighting against extraordinary odds, <Col N="618" /> have been able to increase output by about two per cent while, at the same time, they have had to suffer a loss in income of between £3 million and £4 million.  The gap between urban and rural incomes has now widened a further £50 per annum.  This everwidening gap has now reached £5. Some time ago in reply to a Parliamentary Question, it was said that the gap was £2 1s.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to put on record that the comparison being made was an unfair one.  It was a comparison between people engaged in industry where there were 26 per cent of female workers.  It has been shown beyond doubt on the basis of comparison between male industrial workers that there is a gap of £5.  At the same time as the farmers had to suffer a loss of income while increasing output, the industrial sector which remained almost stagnant got, I think, increased earnings of approximately six per cent.  Is it any wonder that we have had such very serious unrest in the farming industry?  It is only fair to say that the farmers have been badly let down.  They have been misled, deceived and rejected by Ministers who should have been safeguarding their interests and doing everything possible to advance their welfare.</P>
    <P>The root cause of all this trouble is that the Government have no longterm policy for agriculture and they fail to see that no policy can hope to succeed unless it has the full co-operation, confidence and support of the farming community.  I believe they fail also to see that it is important to set up effective machinery for consultation and discussion of farm policy and problems.  The time is now opportune and I say to the Minister that if he does not set up a worthwhile national agricultural council with an independent secretariat and statistical and other specialist advice&mdash; not the type of council he proposes which is one that will be suspect from the beginning &mdash; there is little hope for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything in this debate that would make it more <Col N="619" /> difficult to arrive at a sane and satisfactory settlement of the present difficulties and I hope that the settlement when it does come, as inevitably it must, will have built-in safeguards to ensure that we shall have peace and progress and prosperity in agriculture for many years ahead.  There is an enormous job to be done.  I hope that both the Minister and the farmers will now get down to finding solutions to the many problems that confront the country and particularly the farming community.</P>
    <P>Coming to the various items in this Estimate, I see that £2,305,000 is required to meet increases of 2d per gallon in milk prices.  There is no reason why this should not have been included in the Budget last year.  As we know, it was only secured after the Dáil had been picketed for a considerable time and after many farmers had been fined and threatened with jail sentences.  Obviously, the Minister at the time and the Government failed to see the necessity for these increases before we had all this unnecessary and undesirable agitation by the farmers. I trust we shall not have a repetition of this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Similarly the £102,000 for the quality milk payment is something that should have been anticipated if we were not policy-making from day to day in agriculture.  It should have been seen that this was a desirable course and we should not have it coming as a result of most undesirable agitation by those in the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the £275,000 grant for farrowed sows.  This is also a desirable grant but again there is no reason why it should not have been included in the Budget.  The signs were there for anybody to see that the pig industry was on the decline but no serious move was made to overcome the difficulties of that industry.  If we are to have any worthwhile success in preventing the enormous decline in pig numbers that we had in 1956&mdash; the June census showed, I think, a drop of 250,000 pigs &mdash; we must get back to the position in which we can supply pigs and carry on the <Col N="620" /> pig industry at the level at which it should be carried on.  We shall have to think about something more effective than a £5 per sow farrowing scheme.</P>
    <P>The £1,739,000 for the beef, mutton and lamb guarantee scheme, I gather from what the Minister has said, is expected to be offset to the extent of approximately £1 million from the British Government.  I know this is based on an average over a period and that the exact amount is not known in advance but is it possible &mdash; this is quite a considerable sum when one remembers that it is £1 million in nine months &mdash; to have an arrangement whereby we would get an interim payment on the amount due?  It occurs to me that it is a great pity that some of this money could not be channelled into better marketing and into reducing the cost of production.  It is obvious that there was chaos in meat marketing last year and that nothing was done, and nothing has since been done to come to grips with that problem, one which is most likely to confront us again in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In times of scarcity, anybody can sell but in times of growing quantities and over-supply, there is urgent need for a well-established, well-informed and vigorous agency.  From the little information at my disposal, I believe there is urgent need for the setting up of a meat marketing board.  I had hoped that on this Supplementary Estimate the Minister would give us some idea of how he is thinking in relation to such a board.  We had a situation last year when it was obvious that our own exporters were competing against themselves in the same market while there were other areas of the British market which our supplies did not reach at all.  As long as we have no centralised marketing organisation, we are bound to have this type of disorderly marketing and have slump conditions and slump prices as a result.</P>
    <P>There is no greater deterrent to farmers striving to get full production from their holdings than this business of the price slumping every time they increase numbers or quantities in any particular sector, and no guarantee of an economic market for their output. <Col N="621" /> We all know that cattle have been artificially induced and it is a tragedy that while that was done, not one extra penny was put into the marketing of the produce.  We have seen in the case of the Milk Marketing Board that by vigorous, well-informed selling, they have been able to reduce subsidies needed on certain milk products quite considerably, and they have also been able to find new markets for everincreasing quantities of milk products. This should be an example of what can be done if we tackle the question of meat prices and meat selling seriously.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to put up an unreasonable argument and I want to quote from the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of Saturday, 18th February, 1967, which says:</P>
    <P>In the second half of 1966 average prices of Irish fat stock were considerably below the levels in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.</P>

    </table>
    <P>The UK prices are based on the official average market prices collected for the purposes of the beef price guarantee scheme; the average weekly subsidy payment is added to this to obtain the farmers' return per cwt.</P>
    <P>The Irish prices are the average monthly figures for two- to threeyear-old fat cattle collected at fairs and marts by the Central Statistics <Col N="625" /> Office.  These correspond very closely with the average prices advertised by meat factories.</P>
    <P>The figures I am quoting are the figures published by the Central Statistics Office and there cannot, therefore, be much wrong with them.  This table shows that farmers' receipts for fat cattle in the second half of 1966 were 68/6 per cwt. below the Scottish returns, 39/- below the English and 16/- below Northern Ireland.  Were it not for the fact that these figures were collected by official sources, their accuracy might have been questioned. The table gives figures for the various months.  In the month of July, England, 188¾; Scotland, 207½; Northern Ireland, 166 and the Republic, 158¾.  In the month of August, England 179¾; Scotland, 192¼; Northern Ireland, 154¾ and the Republic 142.  In the month of September, England 173½; Scotland, 184; Northern Ireland, 146 and the Republic, 131½.  In the month of October, England, 167; Scotland, 180; Northern Ireland, 143 and the Republic, 127.  In the month of November, England, 166; Scotland, 183; Northern Ireland, 139 and 120¼ for the Republic.  In the month of December, England, 163; Scotland, 189; Northern Ireland, 148 and 123¼ for the Republic.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to explain these differences in prices and I should like to hear the Minister explain them because we have on several occasions at Question Time tried to find the justification for these differences.  I do not believe they can be justified, short of bad marketing. We have a very efficient meat processing industry.  I have no doubt those in charge do their job well.  I have no doubt that we have first-class quality cattle.  The Scottish cattle which have on every occasion got a premium price are, in the main, store cattle exported and fed for three months in Scotland. There is no reason to believe that the cattle we export are not at least as good in quality as these Scottish cattle. The reason must be that they are being dumped and not marketed as they should be.</P>
    <P>Headage grants have been referred to.  These were, of course, a rescue <Col N="626" /> operation at a time when the bottom had fallen out of cattle prices.  They at least prevented complete disaster in the livestock industry and, from that point of view, this was a worthwhile operation.  It is too bad this sort of thing cannot be anticipated and I cannot understand the misleading prospects that were put before our farmers in the early part of last year, in January and again in May, in relation to future prices, etc.  An increase of £10 million was forecast in farmers' incomes.  In actual fact, farmers' incomes suffered a loss of £3 million to £4 million.</P>
    <P>At Question Time, we have raised on occasion the desirability of making some effort to get subsidies back to the farmer.  In England they are paid directly to the farmer.  I see no reason why that should not be done here. I cannot say how much of these subsidies and support payments finds its way back to the farmer but nothing will convince the farmer, if it is paid to the meat factory, that he is in fact getting it.  If it is the intention to go on inducing the farmers to remain in cattle production, we will have to let them see clearly that they are getting fair play and that everything possible is being done to assist them.  I know the Minister has expressed the view that he would like to find a way of dealing with this situation and if he is really serious in this, I do not believe it should prove impossible.</P>
    <P>With regard to warble fly eradication, I believe we are providing money for something which is actually costing the State nothing.  I do not know whether or not that statement is correct but the appropriations-in-aid equal what is spent.  This is a worthwhile scheme.  It has been very efficiently carried out and results reflect great credit on all concerned.  If it is carried out as effectively for the next year or so, there will be no need for any further expenditure under this head. The end result will be an increase in the value of hides and the prevention of loss in liveweight gains.</P>
    <P>In relation to the beef quota, on which we get support payments from the British Government, the quota seems to me to have been very in-in <Col N="627" /> adequate.  We were told in the discussion on the Free Trade Area Agreement by the Minister for Agriculture at the time that he had got practically everything he had looked for.  Obviously he did not look for nearly enough in relation to the beef quota.  I have mentioned this before. I mentioned it on television when the present Minister was there and he quoted a ridiculously low figure for exports of meat in the previous year. I knew it was a ridiculous figure at the time but I was not in a position to quote the correct figure.  The Minister's figure was deplorably wrong and he was deplorably misinformed.  I hope he has since had time to realise that.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see this extra expenditure on the Land Project.  It is obvious the main expenditure has been on lime and fertilisers.  That is, in fact, section B of the Land Project, working as it should work, exclusive of drainage. This is a long-term way of getting land fertilised.  It should be encouraged because there has been a very sharp drop in fertiliser usage during the past year.  That is serious and anything that helps to correct it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is an item of £30,000 for the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in University College and an item of £16,000 for the Trinity College School of Veterinary Medicine.  The only comment I should like to make here is that the sooner these two amalgamate the better it will be for all concerned.  In State subsidy alone it is now costing approximately £15,000 per graduate in Trinity College.  Surely that is a ridiculous situation, all the more ridiculous when we remember that Trinity College never wanted a Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.  It arose out of the previous Fianna Fáil Taoiseach looking into his heart and deciding this would be a good thing for Trinity.  Something should now be done to rectify the situation and I hope something will be done before we are very much older. This is a ridiculous waste of money. It is an expenditure that cannot be justified on any rational grounds.</P>
    <P>There is a sum here for the mountain sheep subsidy scheme of £47,000.  This is a scheme with which there has been <Col N="628" /> an enormous amount of dissatisfaction. I have heard it discussed at length at various farmers' meetings, county committees of agriculture and the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture and being severely criticised.  I was glad therefore to hear the Minister say that in the light of experience of the operation of the scheme, he is having another look at it and also in the light of the advice he has got from various sources about it.  It is a good scheme as far as it goes but it obviously needs improvement and the sooner it is gone into the better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The trouble about all these moneys which we are providing today is that they have already been spent and they add nothing to the income of the farmers.  I wish they did but they do not.  This is money they have already been receiving and we are just making provision for it.  It is deplorable, at a time when the Minister is coming in here to look for extra money, that at the same time he should be squandering &mdash; and I call it nothing but squandering &mdash; the taxpayers' money on full page advertisements in the Sunday newspapers for no other purpose than to drive a bigger wedge between the urban and rural population.  In my view, this is disgraceful Fianna Fáil propaganda for which the taxpayers are paying, and it has been put in the newspapers under the guise of educating the people in regard to the aids being provided for agriculture.  That advertisement cost more than £1,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to say how glad we all are that some grain of sense seems to be coming into the dispute between the NFA and the Government.  We hope that the discussions will take place soon and that once and for all the problem which has racked this country for the past five or six months will be settled.  When the NIEC was being formed, we on the Labour benches protested that agriculture should be represented on it, but the then Taoiseach said that he felt they should have a separate body of their own.  We considered that in view of the fact that over 70 per cent of our exports came from agriculture, it was only logical that they should be included on that body, particularly as it was supposed to be a national industrial economic council.  We could not understand how you could plan for the country without including the major industry on that body.  However, the decision was taken to leave them out, and now apparently it has been decided to set up a separate council for them.</P>
      <P>May I add my voice to the voices of those who have already spoken about this matter and say that this is a far bigger problem than is realised and one which if it is properly handled, could result in peace for a very long time between the agricultural community and the Government, no matter what that Government may be.  There should be a new look at the whole set-up of the council.  The Minister will make his own decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  That is one of the things which the Minister has always done since I came into the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has dealt at length with the amount of money required to finance the exports of beef last year. I should like to point out that unfortunately at the time the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain was being discussed here, the Fine Gael Party did not see certain aspects which they now can see.  If they had, perhaps the vote would have been different on that famous night of 6th January, 1966.  I am glad to see that they have now come around to our point of view.  When the Minister said that (a) there would be an increase in the first year, from July to 31st March, of £10 million in the income of the farmers, (b) that cattle prices would go up from £5 to £7 a head and (c) that he had got all he asked for from the British Government, then on those three points the Minister could not have been much further wrong.  However, we have reached the stage where we have to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears rather odd that while the British are paying a certain amount of subsidy in order to keep up the supply the Irish taxpayer has to pay a greater amount in subsidy than the British are paying; otherwise the floor would fall from under the cattle and carcase beef price completely.  The Minister must be aware that his predecessor &mdash; not his immediate predecessor but the Minister before him &mdash; was the author of most of the troubles of the cattle industry in the past year.  The calved heifer subsidy is at the root of all this trouble.  The <Col N="632" /> country is swarming with cattle and the Minister must be aware of this.  You could not possibly get top price for most of these cattle because they are very poor class cattle.  We cannot blame the Minister for taking this decision on the calved heifer subsidy, but the decision was taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>I would not like to go to Wexford.  I saw a lot of queer things down there.  The calved heifer subsidy upset the balance completely and people who were greedy rushed in. The Minister was very definite a few weeks ago about the horrible crime it was to use scrub bulls to increase the herds.  The use of scrub bulls reduced the standard of our cattle and absolutely no attempt was made by the Department to ensure that these low class animals would not be produced. In fact, they have been produced and they are there for everyone to see, and will be there, in my opinion, for many years.  As a matter of fact, a farmer who was very proud of his cattle herd told me recently that he considers that the work of 30 years of the Department of Agriculture was ruined in the course of about 12 months.  I am inclined to agree with him.</P>

      <P>The whole question of agriculture is one which must be dealt with seriously by the Government. We have here a factual statement from the Minister.  He gives us the facts as he sees them now, but some of these facts were obvious to most interested people before the last Budget was framed.  For some reason which we can all recognise, sums of money which could and should have been included. in last year's Budget were not included. I would be interested to know what happened with regard to one sum of money which was included, and what is likely to happen now.  To the surprise of most of us, a sum of money amounting to around £2½ million was provided for the calved heifer subsidy in the Budget of the current year. Everyone who knew the situation appreciated that that sum would not be taken up, that only a fraction of it would be taken up.  I have a question down to the Minister which will give us that information.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us how much of this sum has been taken up, and in what way it is proposed to distribute the amount remaining.  That is a fair question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The export of butter and the necessary supports from the export of butter are mentioned in the Minister's statement. We have very successful exports of milk products other than butter. Why is it that we do not seem to try to establish more of that type of industry?  Why is it that although we can sell without subsidy quite a number of these products &mdash; cheese, milk powders and so on &mdash; we seem to be so chary about giving any assistance to industrialists who are attempting to set up this type of industry?  Last year a group of dairy farmers came <Col N="634" /> together and attempted to set up a milk processing factory for the purpose of producing milk powder.  A deputation was received by the Government. There were discussions on a number of occasions but over the years during which discussions took place very little encouragement was given.  There was no money available and eventually the scheme was set on one side, and I doubt if it will ever see the light of day again.  It is rather a pity that this type of thing should happen, because I think it is the only answer to the problem of increasing milk products.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a statement by a gentleman who felt he would be able to extend the supply or the sale of butter because of a contact he had in a place called Kuwait.  He was very excited about this.  He thought he would be doing a great job if he could get substantial sales of butter to Kuwait.  So far as I know the subsidy for the sale of butter in Kuwait is 3/8 in the pound.  This did not seem to strike the gentleman who was carrying out these negotiations unofficially. The Department did not know about it, and I am sure they were prepared to shoot him as soon as they found out about it.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to have been realised that there is a bigger market for our agricultural exports in Britain. There are portions of Britain which have never been touched in this regard.  There are numerous places in Britain where no effort has been made to sell Irish produce, good, bad or indifferent.  We seem anxious to find markets in East Germany, in West Germany, in Italy, and such places, but we do not seem to be anxious to try to find markets in places much nearer home.  I wonder why the Department do not try to find the markets on their very doorstep.  This is another example of what is happening in the tourist industry where we seem to be looking all over the world for tourists but we will not go into the villages and towns in Britain where tourists can be picked up.  We will not go into the villages and towns in Britain where we could <Col N="635" /> export agricultural produce.  This is a matter which should get much more attention from the Minister and from his Department.</P>
    <P>There was a brief reference to the Land Project and to the extra subsidy on lime.  While this is a very good idea, it is something which requires a lot of tightening up, because we have some people engaged in that business who apparently have decided that the old system under which certain people are supposed to become very rich in a hurry should be carried on.  Yesterday I saw a docket.  Someone was supplied with six tons of stone and signed for six tons of lime.  Someone else got 2½ tons of lime and he signed for six on one docket and 2½ on another.  That sort of nonsense should not be allowed.  The Minister's inspectors should ensure that that type of practice is stopped.  It is simply robbing the Exchequer and robbing the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>If someone wants to do land drainage, I understand that the period between making the application and having the inspection carried out&mdash; not until he is paid &mdash; is 12 months. Deciding to drain his land, he goes to the local office and signs all the necessary forms.  He sits back and 12 months later an inspector comes out to inspect the land to decide whether or not he will get a grant.  It would not have been any harm at all if there had been some money included in this Supplementary Estimate for the provision of extra inspectors so that this work could be done, as it was intended to be done, as soon as application is made.  One man I spoke to informed me he was prepared to do the work and, even if he had to wait over a period, he had no objection; but he started to do the work and when the inspector arrived, he told him: &ldquo;We will not pay you anything for it&rdquo;. Therefore, the poor man was left in the position that he had to tell all his neighbours: &ldquo;For God's sake, if you are doing any land drainage work, do not touch it until the inspector comes along, even if it is in 12 months or 18 months time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan, who unfortunately is not with us, had a very <Col N="636" /> interesting comment to make about the closing of the bacon factory in his area.  It has been alleged in this House that the only reason the shortage of pigs in the Republic has not become obvious very much earlier is the wholesale smuggling of pigs across the Border.  The Minister knows I live fairly close to the Border&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I go over and back fairly often.  It is an extraordinary thing that again and again, not small lorries with two or three pigs, but lorry loads of pigs have been seized.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And it does not seem to have come to the notice of the Department of Agriculture.  There is another racket quite openly talked about and the Department of Agriculture do not appear to know anything about it, that is, the driving of herds of up to 200 pigs from the North in here.  This is alleged; I believe there is an awful lot of truth in it, and the reason it has been ignored is that the Department must know that because of the shortage of pigs here, this would have blown up much earlier, but they were leaving the position to rectify itself.  The sow subsidy now will help but, unfortunately, it does not seem to have been publicised as widely as it might be. I am hoping, for everybody's sake, it will be a success.  It is too bad that we find factories closing down completely because they cannot get the pigs they require.</P>
      <P>There is something else I should like to mention in passing.  I do not know what way bacon is being sold in Britain; I do not know how Irish bacon is being marketed.  I will say this, that if the standard of the bacon being sold in Britain is not much higher than the standard of so-called grade A bacon being sold in this country, it is no wonder we are not getting a grip on the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody said recently that when all the pigs go into the factory, no matter what their grade, they all come out grade A.  It does appear to be true because I have not seen anything anywhere except bacon which is graded as top-class, for which one is charged top price, and it is darned poor stuff.  It does not compare at all with the type of bacon which could be bought here a couple of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at the beginning I would not hold up the proceedings because none of us wants to be here all night but, while we agree the money the Minister is seeking is necessary, we believe that the attitude of the Department towards the agricultural industry must be changed.  We believe that unless that change is made, and made quickly, we will have more trouble on our hands than this House will be able to deal with.</P>
      <P>I started by saying how glad I was an effort is being made to try to patch up the differences between the farmers and the Government.  I hope it will be successful, but I shall conclude by saying, as Deputy Clinton said earlier, the creamery milk suppliers' dispute last year proved that you will gain nothing by trying to put people in gaol, put a whole community in goal because they were looking for what they considered to be a fair price for their produce.  I would appeal to the Government to show some good sense and realise that without the agricultural community, this country cannot survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start where Deputy James Tully left off, that is to say, I hope the negotiations between the NFA and the Minister will prove very successful.  Of course, what all the Opposition speakers say is that this is between the farmers and the Minister, but at the moment this is between the NFA and the Minister, because there are other farming organisations with different views.  I have always been in favour of one organisation <Col N="638" /> for the farmers in general.  The Minister has moved that a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,167,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1967.  This, of course, brings the total net expenditure from the Vote for Agriculture to £38,476,000, which is a good sign in itself that the Government have the interests of the agricultural community at heart and are anxious to see to their needs, regardless of what people may say from time to time.</P>
      <P>I listened for some time to Opposition speakers discussing the calved heifer scheme and the money provided for subsidisation of milk, <i>et cetera.</i> The calved heifer scheme was started to increase our cow numbers and it has succeeded in doing so, to a large degree. With the extra butter allocation we got in the past few days, the figure is now 28,000 tons, but we would not be able to fulfil that obligation if we had not got the extra cows to produce the milk. There is more room for improvement and we can expect to have a lot more milk within the next few years because, as we all know, the bovine tuberculosis scheme greatly upset the building up of milk herds.  Somebody said to me recently: &ldquo;You have many cows alive now just because they passed the test.&rdquo; Now that the bovine tuberculosis scheme has gone through, the culling of herds will start once again and we can confidently hope that the average milk yield per cow will go up henceforward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also in the Minister's speech that it is assumed that some 40 per cent of the milk delivered to creameries will receive the quality bonus, that extra money is to be available for it, and that the special quality bonus will be increased from 1d to 2d per gallon as from 1st April next.  That extra 1d is very welcome because there were many people who really did not gain much by being paid a 1d per gallon.  The small farmer would not gain much.  He would have to waste a lot of good water and it might not be too convenient for him. If the price goes up another penny, it will be worthwhile. On that matter, I suggest that the Minister should make <Col N="639" /> special recommendations to the ACC or some other body to organise a system of grants to provide the type of coolers these people need.  It would result in the production of high quality milk and it is no good talking about anything else.</P>
    <P>The debate touched on the subject of pig rearing and about the factories closing, about smuggling and other matters.  This is a repetition of the old cycle again where you have X pigs one year and then they go up in numbers until a peak is reached every four years.  Last year fewer pigs were killed in the factories than in the previous year.  The Minister brought in the sow scheme and I am reliably informed by many farmers that it is serving a good purpose.</P>
    <P>On this question of the factories closing, I am inclined to wonder what happens when there are too many pigs. I do not think there is much mercy for the farmers who will not get a good trade when there are too many pigs.  Until we have some sort of centralised buying system one way or another we shall not get very far.  A new factor has entered the pig business &mdash; the matter of feeding.  You have the traditional man who goes out and buys his pigmeal and you have the man who uses a lot of whey.  The man who feeds whey has a great advantage over the man who goes out to buy his pigmeal. It takes 5 lbs. to 6 lbs of balanced pigmeal per pig per day and that costs a lot of money, whereas the man with the whey can feed three or four gallons a day and at most he has to pay a farthing a gallon to have it delivered.  He is saving roughly 3 lbs of pigmeal per day and that has been worked out, in the feed of a pig for ten weeks, at roughly £3 for fattening a pig.  In the creamery areas especially, which are more advanced in this matter, the man feeding the whey has a big advantage.  There is no doubt that the pig trade is booming at the moment.  A man can get anything in the region of £40 for the sow in young. The trade is safe enough for this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked to provide <Col N="640" /> some help for the mountain sheep farmers.  They are men who have a hard way of life, a very limited way depending an awful lot on their sheep. The Government, in the past year, brought in a scheme whereby 10/- per head was paid on Blackface Mountain and Cheviot wether lambs.  There are suggestions that the scheme did not work so well in its first year and I was glad to hear that the Minister is having the scheme reviewed in the light of suggestions gained from various sources among the sheep farmers.  I am glad to see that the Minister has been in contact with many sheep organisations throughout the country, many of whom have put their views to him.  The main crib is that last year too many of those lambs were put on the market at the one time and that little was gained out of the 10/- per head because of a flush of these lambs at the one period. However, the Minister is to review it. It is hard to build up a perfect scheme but it is well for us to realise that the hill farmer has a very hard way of life and that there is a danger the young generation may not stay in the hills where life is hard and arduous.</P>
    <P>Statistics on the warble fly eradication scheme show that the level of infestation, which had ranged from 60 per cent to 70 per cent, dropped to 3 per cent after the 1965 campaign and Irish cattle arriving in England in 1956 showed only 8 per cent warble infestation.  Among the cattle trade it has been found that the treatment is not 100 per cent effective.  However, the Minister has stated that any farmer in whose case the treatment is not 100 per cent effective can have his cattle treated and a certificate given free of charge.  This is something the general public are not well aware of and I ask the Minister to publicise this more widely, especially in marts where it is quite easy to post advertisements on mart walls where every farmer will easily see them.  Then there will not be any excuse for not having animals treated effectively against warble fly infestation.  I have no pity for a person who tries to dodge this scheme.  Though there might be 99 persons out of 100 who avail of the scheme effectively, <Col N="641" /> one person might be too smart and dodge the scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the spread of foot and mouth disease.  This is something the Department must always keep a keen eye on and take strict measures, where necessary.  We realise at least that Ireland is known abroad as a disease free country.  That counts for a lot when we are in the export business.  I do not intend to delay the House for very long but I must say I was amused by Deputy Clinton.  He said that our meat processing plants were efficient and that we have good quality cattle.  I am glad to see that we have converted the Deputy from his view that the calved heifer subsidy scheme resulted in inferior cattle.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate could really be regarded as a mopping-up operation to cover the failure of the Department, the Minister for Agriculture and his advisers to see into the future with regard to agricultural policy.  There are three main portions in this Estimate. There is £1 million for the eradication of bovine TB.  There is also the beef, mutton and lamb export guarantee subsidy, which is a sizeable sum. Before I go on to deal with that, there is one portion of this Supplementary Estimate on which I would like clarification. I do not see anything in the Minister's opening speech about it. There is a temporary scheme of payments on fat cattle exported for immediate slaughter of £660,000.  Am I to take it that we are paying people to export fat cattle rather than kill them and process them in this country?  I cannot take any other interpretation from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that it is a sort of moonlight madness that we should pay people to export cattle rather than process them here.  When the Trade Agreement was made between the present Government, or rather the previous <Col N="643" /> Government headed by Deputy Lemass &mdash; actually it is the same Government under different colours &mdash; and the British Labour Government, they did not look for a big enough quota for the export of processed meat and they are now in the position of trying to level that off by encouraging people to fatten cattle rather than export them as stores.  Then, again, if you look into the Estimate, you find that there is £1 million for the eradication of bovine TB.  This still means that we are spending very big sums of money to get rid of bovine TB here on the understanding &mdash; this was the original understanding on the adoption of this scheme &mdash; that we could export live cattle to Britain and increase our store market.  I personally do not agree with that.</P>
    <P>Many people here are of the opinion that success in agriculture depends on the export of store cattle and that the more store cattle we export the better it is for the farming community as a whole.  That may well be from the point of view of a short term policy. Against that they are excluded from exporting as much store cattle as they would wish because of the Trade Agreement we made with the British Government.  Under this Agreement, the British Government were to take 628,000 stores within the first 12 months of that Agreement.</P>
    <P>That agreement started on 1st July, 1966, and the first year would end at the end of June, 1967.  I have some very illuminating figures here.  Those figures were derived as the result of a question at Westminster.  I have a question down this afternoon in which the Irish Government will have an opportunity of confirming that their figures are the same as the British Government's figures and that a love affair is still going on between the Government here and the British Labour Government.  The figures I have are certainly very illuminating in regard to the store trade.  This was supposed to expand and increase.  According to the former Minister for Agriculture there was supposed to be a sizeable increase per head in relation to the store cattle we exported to the <Col N="644" /> United Kingdom.  The figure I have from July, 1966, to December, 1966, which is the first six operative months of this agreement, in which the British were to take 628,000 store cattle from us, is 179,700 cattle.  So much for the Agreement.  Does that not prove the fact that we made the mistake of relying almost <i>in toto</i> on the British to take all our store cattle from us? That is one of the reasons we find ourselves in such difficulties today with regard to sales, prices and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputies may come in here and say that is all right and that it will be better for the future.  The figures I have given do not point to that.  I will go back now to another six months.  The figures show that from January, 1966, to June, 1966, the six months prior to the operation of the Trade Agreement the export of store cattle then was 216,157.  I invite the Minister to deduct the figures and he will find that there is a great difference.  If we look at the six months before that we find that the figure was 199,480.  Therefore, 12 months ago we were exporting 20,000 more store cattle than we are exporting today.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that there are difficulties in agriculture today?  Is it any wonder that the farmers are picketing when you have that state of affairs? They were promised the sun, moon and stars in this Agreement.  As far as I can see the whole thing is a complete fiasco.  Now let us look at the prices. The average price per cwt. was 67.7/during the six months in which this Agreement is operative.  During the six months prior to it, the price was 68.3/- so there is a difference in the price of cattle since the treaty became operative.  During the six months prior to this, the price was 73/-.  Therefore, one must come to the inescapable conclusion that in respect of one of the things this Agreement was expected to do, that is, to give a guaranteed price and a market for our cattle, it has fallen down.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the British are taking fewer cattle than they were taking before. Perhaps the Minister will explain this to us.  He certainly has not explained it in his opening speech.  He said that <Col N="645" /> one of the difficulties farmers had to contend with was that they could not export their cattle into the European Economic Community on account of the high tariffs there.  That is understandable.</P>
    <P>I should like to go further into this Agreement.  As I said at the beginning, this Supplementary Estimate is a mopping-up arrangement for the failure of that Agreement and nothing else.  The Agreement has failed and that is the reason we have all this trouble with regard to agriculture in Ireland today. It is better for the Government to accept that and say it.  If they did that, they might regain the confidence of the people.  They are not doing anything about giving the farmers the decent standard of living to which they are entitled.  Under this Trade Agreement, we were supposed to export 25,000 tons of carcase beef in 12 months. Some of the Deputies opposite criticised the Minister because of that.  This shows further mismanagement on the part of this Government and this Supplementary Estimate is just a mopping-up operation.  During the six months in which the Trade Agreement has been operative, we exported to the United Kingdom 25,320 tons of carcase beef. In other words, we exported our full quota in that period.  What are we to do for the remaining six months of the year?  Does this mean that the export of stores is falling for one reason or another?  It may have something to do with whether the British are trading elsewhere.  We do not know what it is. It is a matter for the Minister to deal with.  What are we to do for the remaining six months of this year?</P>
    <P>We are subsidising the export of fat cattle for immediate slaughter to the tune of £660,000 because we cannot get processed beef into the British market.  This shows a total failure on the part of the Government and it also shows total mismanagement with regard to the export of livestock to Britain.  We are spending £1 million on the eradication of bovine TB.  We are going to have our cattle TB free.  The British have repeatedly said: &ldquo;If you eradicate bovine TB it is absolutely assured that the price will go up and <Col N="646" /> that you will have an unlimited export of cattle.&rdquo;  They are the figures.  The fact remains they are not taking the cattle.  The only thing I can see is that this is a stopgap operation to enable us in some way to bolster up the farmers to carry on by subsidisation. In other words, we are subsidising exports to the British market, a market which was supposed to give us all the benefits in return for which we gave them benefits and they were to give us a full opening, an unlimited opening, for agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The answer is the Supplementary Estimate today.  The situation has been totally misjudged.  Here is a new Minister for Agriculture coming in who has certainly had a very stormy period in the short time he has been in office.  I do not think he can be exonerated from blame for what happened.  However, one is always glad to see the sweet light of reason and it looks as if there is a possibility of better relations now.  However, the Minister should bear those facts in mind.</P>
    <P>I do not see how we can go on without every Minister for Agriculture coming in here looking for larger and larger subsidies to bolster up a market which is virtually of no value to anybody. It is a known fact that the British in the past two, three or four years have been buying cattle from us, killing and processing them, and getting all the benefit from it.  Further than that, they do not even keep them but export them elsewhere to rectify their own balance of payments.  I propose to the House that the policy of this Government is to export raw materials.  This is proven by those figures.  Provided the love affair is still continuing between the Government and the British Government, I presume the figures I get this afternoon will be the same as the ones I got from Westminster. It has been proved from that that our policy is wrong.  We have been concentrating on offering to the British and allowing them to buy from us everything they want at their own time and at their own price.  That is not economic for us.  Further than that, the very thing the Government hoped to gain &mdash; I did not believe in it &mdash; a large <Col N="647" /> increase in the export of stores, has proved to be a total and utter failure. I am perfectly justified in describing this Supplementary Estimate as a mopping-up operation to clean up the mess that has been created in the agricultural field.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely fundamental that we should have a sound agriculture.  With regard to the Minister's statement that we are almost debarred by the levies from exporting to the EEC, it must be borne in mind that the levy at the moment fixed on the frontier of the EEC is as high as it will ever be and is unlikely to remain at that level.  It was fixed for the specific purpose that when they went to negotiate on the World Trade Agreement under the Kennedy Round there was to be a cut of 50 per cent in the tariffs.  That is a general principle of the Kennedy Round.  It is quite obvious from the EEC point of view that if they go in with a 40 per cent tariff this year, it will be cut to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>For that reason I say to the Minister that he should not sit on the fence as he is doing now.  He should not rely on the British market but should look for markets elsewhere.  He will not then have to come to the House looking for these enormous Supplementary Estimates to bolster up the agricultural economy which is fundamentally unsound and perhaps more unsound today than it has been for a great many years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the Land Project.  The more generous the contribution given to the Land Project and the more rapid the development and acceptance of schemes, the more beneficial it will be to the country as a whole.  It is money spent on subsidisation but it is for the purpose of increasing production.  I do not think the grants today for land projects are realistic.  There is very little increase over and above the grants of some years ago.  The Minister must accept the fact that charges have gone up enormously. The land reclamation people are very often not anxious to go on with jobs because they do not find them economic.  They have to pay a higher <Col N="648" /> rate of wages, the cost of machinery is very much greater and the charge on the farmer himself is considerable.  He has every kind of overhead cost as well. I feel that in this Supplementary Estimate the Government are not giving enough to the person who has to be responsible ultimately for seeing the job is properly done, over and above what he got a few years ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to the World Food Aid Programme, I am very glad the Irish Government have seen fit to increase our contribution.  We are estimated to be one of the best fed nations in the world.  The reason for that is probably that we are an agricultural country and not able to sell our products on the markets with which we have agreements and for that reason we feed ourselves better than anybody else.  The House should know that today there is almost a calamitous food situation in the world.  There are many millions of people in many parts of the world who are literally dying of starvation.</P>

After criticising the Government considerably, you will be happy, Sir, that I am giving them a little meed of praise at the end.  I say they are doing the right thing in doing that.  I go further and say they could have been more generous.  It is no satisfaction to me, to any Deputy or to any Irish citizen to know that there are people all over the world dying of starvation. Although we are not a wealthy nation, we have played our part in the international arena.  We are making this contribution and, having criticised the Government strongly on their agricultural policy, or rather, their total lack of agricultural policy and total lack of judgment of the future of the situation.  I congratulate them on doing something to alleviate world hunger and starvation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to speak on a <Col N="649" /> few points of the Minister's Supplementary Estimate but first of all, I should like to refer to my colleague, Deputy Esmonde.  He says he is a widely travelled Deputy and advises the Government to look for markets for our cattle outside the British market.  I have listened to the Fine Gael shadow Minister for Agriculture, a speaker from the Labour benches and then my colleague, Deputy Esmonde, and I have not heard one constructive suggestion as to where the Government should go to look for an export market for our cattle.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that one of our main problems with regard to the export of cattle last year was the high protective tariffs within the EEC countries and this affected not alone our exports but the export of fat cattle from England also.  The two figures total some 400,000 head of cattle.  This was the main factor in the drop in cattle prices last year and the drop in the number being exported. Where the Government are to try to get an export market outside that, I do not know.  I was hoping to hear from Deputy Esmonde where we should go but he did not make any suggestion. Perhaps at a later date he will enlighten us.</P>

      <P>I should have liked to have heard remarks to this effect from Deputy Esmonde but I heard none.</P>
      <P>There are one or two comments I should like to make in connection with cattle prices.  We have had Opposition speakers for some considerable time talking about the drop in cattle prices.  One would think that calves at £20 a head&mdash;and Deputy L'Estrange will not disagree with me &mdash;were completely uneconomic and that you could not buy them at £20 and make any profit.</P>

      <P>There has been a lot of discussion here about a meat marketing board.  I would feel&mdash;and this is a personal opinion&mdash;that possibly a meat marketing board would be more desirable for promoting sales.  That is all I can say on that because I will probably be ruled out of order if I elaborate on it.</P>
      <P>There are one or two items in the Minister's Estimate in connection with the £5 paid for each farrowed sow up to a maximum of five in each herd.  I would love to know the approximate cost per sow to administer this scheme.  I have knowledge of meetings in my own county with a senior official of the Department of Agriculture who came down to determine whether a sow with one bonham should get a grant or not.  This is a shocking state of affairs.  It happened that the man stayed overnight and I am sure that it cost £10-£15 to determine whether a sow with one bonham should get a grant of £5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the sheep subsidy scheme, I have had personal experience of that.  I feel that 10/- for Blackface wether lambs is very desirable.  It helps in many ways in getting the wether lambs off the mountains.  I have strong feelings in regard to the Cheviot ewe scheme.  I was speaking to mountain farmers last year and very few of them got this £1. It was the lowland men who got the £1 subsidy in connection with the Cheviot ewe scheme.  The mountain farmers got none of it.  It was promoted for them and these farmers feel they could not possibly keep this type of sheep.  I have experience in Wicklow of the Cheviot type of sheep.  It is felt there that no type will thrive on the mountains except the Cheviot ewe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have a look at this and try to make alternative arrangements.  It would be <Col N="651" /> most desirable to bring in the Cheviot ewe breed.  It would be very desirable to get the £1 and have the most unproductive type of sheep removed off the land in this way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the warble fly scheme, I am glad to hear what the Minister says.  In my county there are a number of cases of men who did not carry out the warble fly scheme.  They are now in a position to have their cattle treated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Land Project, when I listen to Opposition speakers it makes my blood boil.  They were the instigators of Section B.  They were responsible for the present Government having to do away with it.  There is a case in my own county of a very prominent Fine Gael man&mdash; I shall not mention any name&mdash;getting £480 per acre for removing rock.  He got £28,000 on a Land Project scheme which is a great scandal in my county. Then, they come in here and talk about having Section B of the scheme re-introduced.  Were it not for some of their own colleagues making a fortune out of it, possibly this would not have taken place.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other things I should like to mention in connection with this scheme.  The amount of land the Department's inspectors have mapped out and the amount drained is considerable.  I also feel the Department should not pay the full grant in one go.  They should pay it over a five year period because in many cases where Land Project work is carried on, if the land is not maintained afterwards, it reverts to its former state, if not to a worse state.  A certain amount of the grant should be kept over for a few years to make sure that drains are kept open because I saw lands becoming worse after the drainage scheme than they were before.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in his negotiations with the NFA and I hope NFA members will be nominated to sit on the Agricultural Council. Then, we may get agriculture off to where it should be.  This Party have always stood behind the small farmer <Col N="652" /> and we are going to stay there and we will support the small farmer as we always have.  I wish the Minister every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I am very glad to see the difficulty between the Government and the farmers about to be settled.  I am sure that every Deputy independently feels the very same.  We all realise the truth of an old Irish proverb which says: &ldquo;I never knew a good man to be reformed by a spell of imprisonment; it makes a good man bad and a bad man worse.&rdquo;  It is a pity the Government, and particularly the Minister for Justice, did not realise that before putting these unfortunate farmers into gaol.  When one looks and examines figures of the income of the Irish farmer over the past two years, one certainly is inclined to agree that he has a grievance.  Agricultural output over the past year has increased by two per cent and the income has reduced by £3 million to £4 million. Now, that is not a great achievement for the farmers themselves.  Their conscience must annoy them to think that they are increasing their output by two per cent and that their income is reduced by £3 million to £4 million. Far be it from me to drive a wedge between the urban dweller and the agricultural community but when we look at the position of the urban dweller over the past 12 months, we find that his income has increased by six per cent while his output has remained static.</P>
      <P>It may be all right to talk about the National Agricultural Council but we must realise, and the farmers have displayed, that, over the past few years, there is reason for a certain amount of uneasiness there.  Only 12 months ago, we had the NFA withholding rates.  Some time last year, we had the ICMSA picketing outside Leinster House.  Again, over the past few months, we had the NFA looking for an increase in their income.  I do not think this Government can close their eyes to that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that this whole uneasiness has crept in since the 1966 Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain. <Col N="653" /> If we examine the figures paid for our cattle on the Irish market, mark you, it is justified.  From July, 1965, to December, 1965, the average price per head of cattle exported to Britain was £73&mdash;that was six months prior to the Trade Agreement.  From January, 1966, to June, 1966, the average price per head of cattle exported to Britain &mdash;in the first six months of the Trade Agreement&mdash;was £68.3.  From July, 1966, to December, 1966, the average price per head of cattle exported to Britain was £67.3&mdash;that was for the second six months of the Trade Agreement. One can feel quite satisfied that the farming community have a genuine grievance.</P>
    <P>The strange thing about headage that was paid on the price of cattle when the bottom completely fell out of the cattle market is that in fairs and marts such as those at Elphin and Roscommon town the average farmer did not get the advantage of the headage.  From the day the headage was paid until the day it ended, the price of cattle in these marts or fairs increased.  I do not know if it was the middleman or the exporter or who it was who got the headage but certainly it did not go directly into the pocket of the farmer.</P>
    <P>We can say the same about the mountain sheep headage which was paid last year for the first time.  As a matter of fact, sheep were about 10/to 15/- per head cheaper last year than in the previous year, despite the fact that 10/- headage was being paid.  On that note, I am glad to know that the Minister is having another look at this mountain sheep scheme because, again, there seems to be a certain grievance with the sheep producers in these areas about it and I hope that the scheme, when it is operated next year, will have some changes to the advantage of the farmer.</P>
    <P>It is all right for us to say that reference has been made to the heifer scheme but everybody in this House and every farmer in the country knows that there was an over-production of cattle brought about by the heifer scheme and that there was no market in which to sell them when they were produced.  That was the tremendous <Col N="654" /> harm that was done to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference to the warble fly scheme.  I see a figure of £30,500 in the Supplementary Estimate in that respect.  If my information is correct, and I think it is reasonably correct, the societies operating this scheme are making sufficient profit to pay for it the whole way through.  Not alone are they making sufficient profit to pay for it but they are also making sufficient profit to give a substantial reduction to the farmer on the 3/- per head he is paying.  I have figures of the profit one society has made for the current year and, mark you, if you heard that profit, you would be rather surprised to see a figure of £30,500 in the Supplementary Estimate for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I agree with a number of previous speakers who have said that we feel that Land Project grants should be increased and increased substantially. Even over the past few months, without talking about the last year, the price of field drainage pipes has increased substantially; the farmer's wage bill has increased; machinery costs have increased because whether it be hired or owned, the cost of running it has substantially increased and the price of artificial manures has increased.  All of these increases clearly indicate that the Minister will have to make up his mind to give an increased grant under the Land Project.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House as I understand that we shall adjourn this evening for the Easter Recess.  I wish the Minister the best of success in his appointment as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say that we on these Labour Benches, as a Party, are very pleased to know that relations between the Minister, the Department and the farming organisations have improved in recent times.  We hope this improvement will continue and that an early solution will be found to the many problems outstanding at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether included in <Col N="655" /> this Supplementary Estimate is a figure covering the cost of the announcement by the Department in recent newspaper issues which, to my mind, was something unique as it is seldom or never that the Department expend money on such elaborate advertisement.  The Minister may say that, in view of the peculiar position that obtained over the past months, such advertisements were essential.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell in detail on all the Minister has claimed for himself and his predecessors in office and all that the Department have done and are doing for agriculture.  The main fact emerges at the present time that agriculturists are up in arms.  They are very much dissatisfied with their share of the national kitty and they have demonstrated in no uncertain manner their dissatisfaction.  As I mentioned at the outset, I am glad that some ground has been found at last for negotiations. However, that does not take from us here in this House our responsibility to address ourselves to the question generally and particularly to the items mentioned in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has not held that portfolio for very long.  I should like to add my voice to the closing sentiments expressed by Deputy Reynolds by wishing the Minister a successful term of office and expressing the hope that he will be responsible for bringing about friendly relations with the farming organisations in general, and friendly relations with individual farmers by making available to them the additional helps that to him and, in particular, to this House, seem justified.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to cover ground which has been adequately covered in many forms in recent times. The main claim of the farming community, and particularly of the small and medium size farmers, is that the Department must have a closer look at its expenditure&mdash;that is my strong personal view&mdash;and endeavour to channel more of this public money into the pockets of the people who deserve <Col N="656" /> it mostly, namely the hardworking small and medium size farmers.  While the larger farmers have suffered a setback in their incomes within the past two years, I am assuming that in view of the extent of their holdings and of their incomes, even though depressed, they will be able to withstand the depression that arose in agriculture within the past few years.</P>
    <P>We blame the Department of Agriculture for a good deal of this depression. First of all, on the main Estimate here, we blamed, I think rightly, the Minister's predecessor for creating a very false impression in the debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  I had occasion to comment adversely on the Minister's lack of judgement and lack of foresight in the many statements he made as to the benefits that would accrue to the farming communiy from that pact.  We in the Labour Party voted against the pact for reasons which we stated in detail.  We were not satisfied then, and unfortunately we were proved to be correct, with the statements made by the Minister as to the advantages that the farming community would get from that Agreement.  We got statements without any supporting evidence. It is difficult to blame people who took as being quite definite the assertion that farmers would benefit in the year commencing 1st July, 1966, to the extent of £10 million, which has now proved to be completely without foundation.  Instead of the farmers benefiting by £10 million, the net results are likely to be that in the year commencing 1st July, 1966, the agricultural income will be depressed by a figure approximating to half of that amount, £5 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies must bear in mind the reasons why there has been strong agitation in recent months.  The most important section of our people, the agricultural community, found that the big carrot which was dangled before them in the early weeks of 1966 had no substance.  They were told that they were in for a good time, that there would be a big increase in their income.  They found that this was without foundation and that, instead, <Col N="657" /> a depression set in.  That must be considered against the background of what was happening so far as other sections were concerned.  Large sections of our people got benefits which, it has now been proved, the country could not afford to pay, under the heading of status increases.  I condemned these increases, not that I would not like to see every man getting the highest possible remuneration for his work, but because I thought it was not fitting to give big bonuses to people who were reasonably remunerated which, according to one of the Minister's statements, cost £10 million a year.  I opposed the increases because I felt that our tax revenue, our economy, our people could not afford such increases.  As a member of the Labour Party whose first and main object is to ensure that everybody is reasonably and adequately remunerated for his work, I maintained and I still maintain and I suggested to the Taoiseach in his capacity as Minister for Finance, that these people having got the 12 per cent increase which was paid to other sections, should rest for the time being until we had a further look at what would happen and then, if the economy were able to bear further increases, they should be considered subsequently.</P>
    <P>In my view, the man who has to go out in the field, take off his coat and work in wind and weather, who produces our crops, feeds our cattle, produces our pigs, is contributing as much to the national effort and to the economy and to our wellbeing as are people more favourably placed by virtue of certain talents or possessions which they may have.</P>
    <P>You will agree, Sir, that in the kind of climate prevailing, it was no wonder that we had these marches from various parts of Ireland and the unrest which, fortunately, we all hope is over and done with.  I say that as one who believes that to a big extent, apart from any illegal acts, the agitation was completely justified by the circumstances in which our farming community had to live.</P>
    <P>I charge the Government with lack of foresight.  It is the Government's job, aided by the technical advice <Col N="658" /> available to them and by the advice of their chief executive officers, to be able to anticipate future events, at least to some limited degree.  In the pronouncements made early last year, the Government did not take into account that markets may change, that there may be major fluctuations in prices, particularly in export markets for farm produce and that if fluctuations were to take place the assurances which they gave might not be honoured. There was no mention of that possibility. Even in May, some five months later, and even when the Agreement came into operation in July, the Government were not in a position to anticipate the decline that took place and consequently did not make any preparation to offset it or to relieve the burden that would fall on the farming community as a result of the depression.</P>
    <P>I claim that a Government lacking in judgment, that make wild, extravagant statements and that are unable to anticipate what may happen within a few months are incapable of governing the country.  I am not indicting the present Minister too strongly as he has not been long in this office but I do say that the former Minister for Agriculture lacked judgment and lacked any essence of tact in dealing with the farming community.  If he had been a little more diplomatic and had met the farmers in Dublin last July or August, at the time of the first march on this city, a good deal of the unpleasantness which subsequently arose could have been avoided.  Ministers represent the people just as much as Deputies do and it is part of our job to meet representatives of the people and organisations of people who have grievances, whether these grievances are justifiable or not, and discuss them with them.  The Minister for Agriculture failed to do that and, as a result, we have had this unpleasant chapter in our history over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>I was one of the first to suggest to this House, and the suggestion has now been taken up by organisations representative of farmers, that milk subsidies should be channelled in such a way as to help the small producer as <Col N="659" /> far as possible.  I hope that when the Minister is preparing the main Estimate later on, he will be prepared to give a higher rate of subsidy to the man producing 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 gallons than to the large-scale producer. The subsidy should be on a sliding scale rather than on a flat rate.</P>
    <P>In the greater part of this country, dairying is the main means of livelihood of the farmers.  The smaller farmers have poorer quality land; they have to buy fertilisers and put a lot of work into their land to get any reasonable return, and they are entitled to an extra subvention over and above those farmers who have a large acreage and land of higher productive capacity. The latter are not as much entitled to State subvention for the purpose of subsidising the dairying industry as are the smaller farmers.  That fact has never been taken into account by the Department.</P>
    <P>We cannot have an overall agricultural policy to be applied wholesale to this country.  We must have some variation and I am glad to see from recent statements that notice is now being taken of that fact.  There has been a change and we are now more inclined to look on agriculture on a regional rather than on a countrywide basis.  Some of the Minister's predecessors rejected that idea but I claim, in support of my idea, that even though our country is relatively small in size, there is a big variation in agriculture. What applies to western counties does not apply in the central counties and in the counties with better land.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take steps to ensure that this subvention for milk, which he boasted about so much on Sunday last in his expensive advertisements in the newspapers, will be applied on a graded scale in future.  From 1st November until 1st April every year, the small farmers have little or no income from their milk.  The supply is generally so small that it would not buy much more than the butter they consume.  It is a well-known fact that many farmers never see a creamery cheque.  Instead of having a credit balance, the opposite is the case.  They are always in the red in the books of <Col N="660" /> the creameries and the creameries are to be congratulated on the credit they allow to their suppliers.  I have mentioned this matter again and again. I mention it now and I am glad it is something which is likely to be accepted generally.  I hope the Minister will also accept it.</P>
    <P>The second most important sideline of the small and medium farmer is the pig industry.  It is unfortunate that at present the number of pigs is declining. That should not be the case: it should be the opposite.  I have heard statements by Ministers, officials and by heads of some big co-operative farming organisations that the best way to ensure a sufficiency of pigs is to promote large pigbreeding stations of 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 pigs.  I do not think these pig stations would help the economy of the pig industry.</P>
    <P>What we should do is enable the individual farmer to increase his stock so that if pigs become a profitable proposition, he can increase his profits proportionately.  I would prefer to see a farmer who is now rearing seven, eight or nine pigs increase his stock to 20 pigs and I would prefer to see a farmer with one, two or three sows increase that number to four, five or six rather than have these big sow stations.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly on this question of pig production and I come from a constituency with the greatest record of pig production in the country.  In West Cork we have been agitating over the years that by right and justice we are entitled to have our bacon processed in our own confines.  We cannot see why the 11 per cent of the total output which is produced in our area should not be processed at home, why it should be taken to central curing stations set up by Government grant.  I do not know whether or not they are members of the organisation Deputy Cluskey was telling us about the other day.  I was rather frightened, when I was down in the Library some few weeks ago examining the records of these grants, to find the amounts some existing bacon factories were getting towards the development and general improvement of their factories.  That may be right from the Minister's point of view; but, from our point of view, <Col N="661" /> if that money is available for the development of bacon factories, the place to develop them is where the pig is produced.</P>
    <P>Examine the position as it obtains in West Cork at present.  The man buying the feeding stuffs for the pig must subsidise the farmers in other parts of the country who grow the barley.  He is not entitled to buy maize, except that I think if you had a good &ldquo;pull&rdquo; you could get a private licence.  That may not be correct, but I have heard it alleged.  Even last week I had some representations on the matter.  The Minister must find an outlet for the barley grown in this country.  To find that outlet barley must be sold to the pig producers.  As we do not grow a big acreage of barley in West Cork or Kerry, we have to buy it at the prices laid down by the millers.  We must buy it whether we like it or not, whether we think it is the best type of feed for pigs, in order to get it off the hands of the growers and to give them what is deemed to be an economic price.</P>
    <P>I am very conversant with pig production and with the marketing and sale of pigs.  The pig produced in Skibbereen, Schull and Castletownbere must be taken 50, 60 or 100 miles to the factories in Cork.  You must make sure to arrive there by 12 o'clock because, if the pigs are not within the factory confines by that hour, they are not killed on that particular day and you are told they are staying over until the next day.  Examine the position, then.  The pigs have to be transported a long distance and, if they do not arrive by 12 o'clock, it is likely, and often happens, that they are left over until the following day for slaughter, with a consequent reduction in weight and a probable reduction in grading.</P>
    <P>That is the basis of our claim to a pig processing station in West Cork. We had deputations here to the Minister for Agriculture on this question. When the former Minister, the present Minister for Finance, was seeking support in West Cork and was speaking on the Sunday before the last election, he implied, possibly subtly, that a factory would be given to West Cork if Fianna Fáil were returned. Hence, we have this agitation to try <Col N="662" /> to get this factory, to try to get the Minister to honour his assurance.  It is all very well for the Department to say that, if one thousand producers form a cooperative, they will get a licence.  People do not establish factories in this country at present without a State subvention.  We are making such subventions available to many people, both native and foreign.  We have made them available to a number of people, native and foreign, who have made very little use of them. Some of these subventions, sizeable sums of money, have, so to speak, gone down the drain.  I am not one to plead here for a State subvention without feeling there is justification for it.</P>
    <P>We all know that the personnel of some of the boards charged with doling out this money should be changed, having regard to the many blunders they have made in handing out hard-got taxpayers' money to ventures which have proved unsuccessful and which were not firmly grounded even in the initial stages. I am not going to name such ventures.  If I were asked by the Government to do so, I would be prepared to give a reasonable few and to give the Minister some additional information in support of this charge, which I do not make under the privilege attached to this House.</P>
    <P>Our main problem in regard to this bacon industry is this.  We cannot blame the IDA and Foras Tionscal in this instance.  They are not going to make grants available for this industry, unless they get a recommendation to do so from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is he who is mainly the deciding factor in this agitation of ours.  It is deemed to be an agricultural matter rather than a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce. I am pleading with the Minister to give this his blessing and to make a recommendation to the boards which make these grants available.  I can assure him he will be taking a step which will meet with the approval not only of the people of the constituency of South-West Cork but of all fairminded people irrespective of where they reside.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by various <Col N="663" /> interests to avail of the first opportunity of raising this matter relevantly in the House.  I am doing so now and bringing home to the Minister the views of the people I represent.  I have never set myself up as a prophet but I have not the slightest doubt that, if we get this factory in West Cork, inside 18 months the pig population there is likely to double.  In addition, without going into any matters appertaining to particular factories, I can say we have people in the bacon industry who are interested. If they got what was reasonable and just under our subvention scheme for factories, they would come down to us and erect the factory.</P>
    <P>Brucellosis is another item I should like to touch on.  I know this was tackled to a reasonable extent by the former Minister.  It is a very big problem. In his opening statement on the Diseases of Animals Bill, he stated that animal diseases cost this country the sizeable sum of £25 million.  Fortunately, we have almost got rid of TB, undoubtedly at a big cost, and the second disease to be got rid of is brucellosis.  What I want to bring home to the Minister is that a number of farmers, whose herds have been stricken with this disease, have suffered grave financial loss.  I know a limited number in my own constituency.  I know one man who had 14 of his 21 cows aborting last year and despite the best veterinary advice, the same is likely to happen, I understand, with the replacements he subsequently bought.</P>
    <P>We all know of the danger of selling cattle affected by disease at public fairs and marts and it is quite reasonable to suspect that some farmers not so civic-minded have brought such animals to fairs and marts and sold them, with the possibility of spreading the disease to other cattle.  When we find people whose herds are suffering from such an outbreak going to the local veterinary surgeon and trying as far as they possibly can, regardless of cost to themselves to ensure that their herd will not be responsible for spreading the disease, we should treat them a little more generously than we have been doing up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> I know it is difficult to devise schemes to meet such situations but I should like, at least in the case of serious outbreaks, where it is likely that all the stock must be disposed of and the farm left over for a period of one, two or three years until the disease is eliminated, some compensation to be given even if only in the form of some grants with interest-free loans so that the farmer could replace the stock and begin again.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this question of compensation for brucellosis, taking into account particularly farmers who are co-operating in the schemes promoted by the Department for the eradication of diseases.  I do not suggest that any leniency should be shown to those who do not co-operate and who may be unmindful of what may happen to their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Another question that has engaged our attention in counties Cork and Kerry for some years past is the problem of sheep scab.  Our information is that if a co-operative effort were made, scab could be eliminated within two years.  If that is so, it is unfortunate that, despite the amount of money expended on technical advice veterinary inspection, sheep dipping inspectors and so on, we still have sheep scab.  It is particularly unfortunate, in the case of farmers who rely for a large part of their income on sheep, that many are able to get away without dipping&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what I am doing now.  I can only reiterate that the past year has been a bad one for the farming community and this Supplementary Estimate will not relieve the situation very much.  It covers only odds and ends in the different subheads and will make no real contribution to the improvement of agriculture. I ask the Minister, when formulating his policy and presenting his main Estimate in the near future, to take more cognisance of the plight of the farmers than has been taken by his Government in past years and have an agricultural policy drawn up by the Department of co-operating with the committees of agriculture and the farming interests which will prove fair and equitable to all farmers, small, medium and large.  If he does that, he will have my blessing and that of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As the previous speaker says, the year was a bad one and a sad one for Irish farmers and agriculture generally.  Irish agriculture at present, and not for the first time under Fianna Fáil Government, is definitely in the doldrums and the farmers who are our principal producers are at present cast in the role of hewers of wood and drawers of <Col N="666" /> water.  Highly respectable and responsible men do not join together and adopt attitudes which result in their going to jail unless driven to it by desperate needs.</P>
      <P>Anybody interested in the economy and in agriculture is glad to see&mdash;at least we hope&mdash;that sanity has at last prevailed and that the Minister is about to do what we claim he should have done six or eight months ago, that is, to sit down at the conference table and discuss their problems with the NFA, an organisation which represents, I should say, 70 or 80 per cent of Irish farmers.  It is in the interests of the nation that the discussion should be fruitful.  I hope it will.  We have always favoured co-operation and consultation and I am glad the Minister has now agreed to it.</P>
      <P>The situation was very badly handled.  It should never have been allowed to escalate.  Now that the Minister has agreed to meet the farmers, I hope he does not adopt the strategy of Lord Melbourne: &ldquo;to ponder, cause, prepare, postpone and end by leaving things alone; in fact, to earn the peoples' pay by doing nothing every day&rdquo;.  That is how Fianna Fáil have treated the NFA up to now.  We hope there will be a change for the better in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's duty to govern, to control the economy and balance one factor with another and see that all sections get a fair deal. They have definitely failed in this respect to do their duty.  The more we look at the sad history of the past few months since this dispute began, the more we realise the Government's responsibility for the chaos that exists in the agricultural industry.  The dictatorial attitude of some of the brassnecks in the Fianna Fáil Government and their determination not to meet the NFA but to crush them has led to the crisis which now exists and which, as I said earlier, I hope is now on the way to final solution.  But the NFA will want to be very careful because they are dealing with wily politicians. However, the Taoiseach asked them a few days ago to stop to think.  They <Col N="667" /> have done that now and I hope that when this conference takes place and the Minister meets them there will be fruitful results.  Recent events have shown the disastrous situation which has followed from the Government's refusal to accept representations which were made by the farmers a long time ago in regard to a meat marketing board.  I am not going to discuss that now but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a collapse in livestock prices over the years.  There is reference to it in the Minister's speech and to the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain. We remember when that Agreement was introduced in this House all the different promises that were made by Fianna Fáil.  We were told that the price of cattle would increase immediately by £5 to £7, that the farmers' income would increase by £10 million.  From the facts available to us at present, we know that was completely wrong.  The farmers were misled then.  There has been a collapse in the livestock industry over the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy realises he is speaking to the general Estimate, not to the item here on the Order Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in the Minister's statement, for example, <Col N="668" /> there are sums in relation to the beef, mutton and lamb export guarantee schemes.  When the Free Trade Area Agreement was introduced, we were told that prices would increase under these schemes.  The Minister also mentioned today the subsidy for sheep and lambs.  Despite that subsidy, sheep and lambs were sold at our markets from 15/- to 20/- less than they were last year, so that in that regard this scheme has not been very successful.</P>
      <P>The Minister says here today:</P>
      <P>The fat cattle headage payments scheme was, of course, introduced as a special emergency measure at the end of August to strengthen market conditions for cattle producers here at a time when prices weakened.</P>
      <P>When he said that &mdash; I do not want to quarrel with you, Sir &mdash; we are entitled to say that our marketing system is antediluvian and if we had a better marketing system in the past, as people advocated a few years ago, this crisis would not have arisen and there would be no need for voting this extra money here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>This weakening of prices has been brought about by a number of factors outside our control...</P>
      <P>Some of them have been brought about by factors outside Government control, but many of them have been within the Government's control.  If there had been a proper agricultural policy down the years and if there was more co-operation by the Government with farmers' organisations and farmers' representatives, we might have a much better agricultural policy.  We are quite entitled to argue that had we had that, we would not have had this disastrous collapse in prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...the principal ones being the sluggish demand from Britain for <Col N="669" /> our stores and the virtual closing of the EEC markets to imports of cattle and beef as a result of the imposition of very high levies.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor came into this House last May and told us about this wonderful Agreement and about the wonderful improvement we were to have in prices.  Surely if the Minister and his advisers were doing their work properly abroad, the Minister would have had this information available at that time?  In 1965, we exported 160,000 head of cattle to the EEC countries.  That market is closed since last April.  What we are concerned about is that despite the fact that it was closed since 1st April, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Haughey, misled this House by telling us that after 1st July the farmers would get £5 to £7 extra for their cattle.  The farmers, being an important section of the community, should be taken into the confidence of the Government, should be told the truth, and the whole truth.  They should not have been misled as they were at that time.</P>
    <P>In the month of October, the then Minister told farmers to hold on to their cattle.  What has happened to the farmers who held on to their cattle?  We know that they lost heavily on them by taking the Minister's advice.  This all comes back again to the one thing, that if there were consultation and co-operation, much more could be done for Irish agriculture than is being done at present.</P>
    <P>Deputies today have dealt with the decline of pig output in most pigproducing countries in Western Europe.  I raised this question in the House last year, and I pointed out to the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, that there was a danger of a collapse in the pig trade. He told me from those benches over there that I was talking through my hat, that I knew nothing about it.  I wonder now who was talking through his hat.  We know that the pig industry is in trouble.  As Deputy M. P. Murphy said, the small farmers who took an interest in pig production in the past are going out of it, due to the price of feeding stuffs, due to their <Col N="670" /> overhead expenses increasing and also due to the fact that there has been very little increase in the prices they have been receiving for their production. The time has come for the Minister to do a little more for these people than he has been doing.</P>
    <P>There is an additional amount of £30,500 under Subhead K.10 for the Warble Fly Eradication Scheme.  This scheme has been in operation for the past three years, and full credit should be given to the people who started it. Remember, this was not a Government-sponsored scheme.  Indeed, the Department of Agriculture is very lackadaisical in many ways and very much behind the time in advocating schemes for the benefit of Irish agriculture. It was the NFA and the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association who came together and launched this scheme.  They did it voluntarily.  It is proved a huge success and, for that, we are all very grateful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to the Land Project, for which more money is being voted.  He said that Section B had to be stopped because a prominent Fine Gael man in his county got £28,000 under the scheme.  He added that, were it not for some of the Government's colleagues at that time making a fortune out of the scheme, the scheme would still be in operation.  The Minister knows quite well that work under Section B of the Land Project was done by the Department of Agriculture and the money was not paid to the farmer. The sort of woolly thinking of which Deputy Allen has been guilty is most unfair and unjust and no Deputy should get up here and make a statement such as that made today by Deputy Allen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the fall in farmers' incomes and their income <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rest of the community. The Minister gives certain figures here. When giving figures, the Minister should compare like with like.  At the moment there is a difference of four or five per cent.  Last year farmers increased production by two per cent. They were promised, of course, increased remuneration to the tune of £10 or £15 million.  In actual fact, they increased production by two per cent and their income was reduced.  It is still falling.  The farmers represent 35 <Col N="671" /> per cent of our community.  The Taoiseach gave us figures recently to show that that 35 per cent is getting roughly only 18 per cent of the national income, roughly half of what they are entitled to.  Deputy M.P. Murphy reminded us that the farmers are the primary producers in the country.  For them there is no 40-hour week and no five-day week.  The majority of them work seven days a week and ten to 12 hours per day.  They are entitled to a fair return for their labour, but they are not getting that fair return.</P>
    <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement, about which we heard so much, has done nothing for these unfortunate people.  Only a week ago the Taoiseach gave us a figure of 270,000 people who have left the land since 1931.  Since 1956, 91,000 have left the land.  Tillage is down by 674,000 acres in the past ten years.  Looking at the particulars given here, we see under (a) that the grant-in-aid will be paid into the World Food Programme account from which contributions will be made to and foodstuffs purchased on behalf of the Programme. Is it not ridiculous to see that coming from an agricultural country? Surely, if we had a proper farming programme, instead of providing money to purchase food elsewhere, we would be producing that food ourselves? If the tillage farmer got justice, if he had got fair prices over the past ten or 12 years, this ridiculous position would not arise.</P>
    <P>The price of barley was fixed by Deputy Dillon almost 20 years ago at 48/- a barrel.  Today the price is 45/-, despite the fact that production costs have increased.  This year the price for malting barley is £3 2s 6d; last year it was £3 17s 6d.  If the Minister were doing his job properly and the farmers were getting the encouragement they should, instead of our providing money to purchase foodstuffs elsewhere, our farmers would be producing these foodstuffs and we would be supplying them to people in other less fortunate countries.</P>
    <P>Last year we spent £24 million on imports which could have been grown here.  Unless there is a change, there does not seem to be much future for <Col N="672" /> Irish agriculture.  I am glad that sanity has prevailed at last and I hope that when the Minister meets the NFA, he will not try to fool them as they were fooled in the past.  The farmers marched from Cork and they spent 20 days out in Merrion Street sitting in the gutter.  The Minister and the Taoiseach met them.  Then the Minister went down to Kerry and spent three weeks in Kerry; he thought it more important to win a by-election for Fianna Fáil than to solve the problems of the farmers.  That led to the impasse which has existed until quite recently.  I trust that something useful will emerge for Irish agriculture from the discussions proposed now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and the Minister on having the good sense to bring about negotiations in connection with the dispute between the farmers and the Government.</P>
      <P>We are constantly receiving complaints about the hold-up in grants due to farmers whose cattle have been rejected.  After a long delay, these people get in touch with a county councillor, a TD, or someone else, to find out if there is any possibility of getting payment.  When everything is in order, these people should be paid their accounts punctually.  They have to buy more cattle, sometimes at an enhanced price.</P>
      <P>There is an increase of £29,000 towards the purchase of machinery for forage harvesting.  Spread over the 26 counties, that is a very small sum indeed.  Our young boys and girls are going away and the only hope the farmer has from the point of view of help is the purchase of equipment. Weather conditions in the West are very uncertain and any harvesting spell there is usually of short duration. If equipment is limited, only a few get the benefit and the others lose.  That aspect should be examined more carefully; £29,000 of an increase will not buy very much machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers were very disappointed because the subsidy paid on cattle exported was paid to the exporter, the big man, during recent months and meant practically nothing to the man <Col N="673" /> who went out to the local fair to sell his cattle.  The subsidy went into the pocket of the exporter and stayed there.  I hope that will not happen again because this is the taxpayer's money and it is to the taxpayer it should go.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that in the Sligo-Leitrim area the subsidy on mountain sheep nearly created civil strife at fairs in that constituency. Inspectors came to the fair in the morning and began to sort out the animals, and some of the farmers selling that stock knew much more about the stock than the inspectors.  I happened to be at one or two of those fairs and I could envisage a very ugly situation arising between farmers and inspectors, with inspectors telling a man who had perhaps spent three days getting his stock to the market, what quality his sheep were and that sort of thing.  I would appeal to the Minister to bring in a scheme before the next season which will include all lambs for this subsidy.  In that part of the country, the difference is practically nothing and only the odd man might be lucky enough to get firstclass quality of field sheep.  If the subsidy were given to all lambs in that area, it would save trouble and the extra cost would not be very great.</P>
    <P>When the heifer scheme was introduced, I said to the Minister for Agriculture that if the subsidy had been given on calves instead of on heifers, it would have been of greater benefit to small farmers.  I still hold that this would be the case.  The result has been that on many small farms today, there are cattle of inferior quality.  This was not always the case but in general, any heifer capable of carrying a calf became one of those which qualified for the £15 grant.  If it had been the other way around, everybody could have been given four grants for four calves. Whether he was a big farmer or a small farmer, he could have qualified for four grants and no more, and that would have meant that everybody would have benefited from the scheme. I would appeal to the Minister to reexamine that proposal.</P>

      <P>The first point I want to make is that this is a Supplementary <Col N="674" /> Estimate of correction, a correction of Estimates now that they know, or almost know, the out-turn of the financial year.  No item in this Estimate constitutes a price increase to farmers and the figures produced still stand, while the farmers' income has decreased by two per cent and output has increased by the same percentage. There is an aspect of the preparation of Estimates for the Department of Agriculture to which I and other Deputies have referred many times, and which has developed in the Tables we get prior to the Budget, that is, the practice of adding up the amount expected to be spent on agriculture by the State.  We did not have to wait this year for this until Budget time because we were provided with it as a cost of £1,032 on last Sunday in an advertisement in the <i>Sunday Press</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> I do not want to go through it in detail because I understand Deputy Clinton has done so but I wish to make one point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the <i>Sunday Press</i> charges less than the <i>Sunday Independent;</i> perhaps it does. The point I want to make about this highly expensive advertisement, which, by the way, was issued on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, is that point No. 1 states:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Reservation of Home Market for Irish Farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very few agricultural products that are not in surplus supply and available cheaply on world markets.  The Government prohibits <Col N="675" /> the importation of most important agricultural commodities which can be produced at home and reserve the Irish consumer market for the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>It proceeds to other items, points Nos. 2, 3 and so forth, giving the list of agricultural headings on which the Government have to intervene to produce a price.  I want to suggest that the persons who planned this advertisement laid a very dud egg because if they indicate in point No. 1 that there is hardly any agricultural product that is not in surplus supply and available cheaply on the world markets, then of course they are intimating to us that agricultural products could be dumped at a price far below the cost of production on our home market.  Then they suggest that they are spending £55.39 millions on agriculture and that this is extra income for the farmer.  The real truth is that the great bulk of this money does not reach the farmer at all; what does reach the farmer is the amount of money necessary to bring the price of his product as it leaves his farm, from the dumped world price he would get on the export market, or on the home market if the Government produced their threat, as they do in point No. 1, and left the market open to the world, and the price at which the Government hope the farmer will continue to produce.  It is the difference between the dumped world price, which is far below the cost of production, and the figure at which the Government hope the farmers will continue to produce.  The position is that the dumped price would be one at which agricultural production would cease and the money paid by the Government is merely to bring the dumped world price up to the price they hope the farmer will accept and at which he will continue to produce. That is the kernel of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted from the <i>Sunday Press</i> of March 12th, 1967, <Col N="676" /> page 15.  That is the kernel of the situation.  One must realise, when one approaches a Supplementary Estimate of this nature, that a very great amount of the moneys therein are for this purpose but do not represent any profit or extra profit for the farmers. A great volume of the money included never reaches the farmer at all but goes to very praiseworthy things such as universities and such like.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with the question of milk.  We have here a good situation now inasmuch as Bord Bainne got a better price abroad, and did not require as much money as was estimated.  There is also the fact that they sold better.  Our Kerrygold image which should have been produced many years ago, has improved the price we can command.  I read in the Press yesterday that our butter quota to Britain has been increased.  That is good, because GATT set out to stop dumping on the British market.  In our agreement with Britain, the Government produced a system of quotas which meant that butter should not be dumped, at least to the extent it was, on the British market.  This has brought about a good effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that we will provide improvements out of that money because of the diversification that has taken place in many co-operative creameries.  Even with extra subventions, our price for milk is still extremely low by continental and English standards.  I read in an English farmers' journal last week, while sitting in a waiting room, that the English farmer was entirely dissatisfied with his price for milk, which is approximately 1/3 better than ours, and that he was going out of milk.  The only method by which he has succeeded in making a profit was by giving a very big bonus to individual herdsmen.  That indicates to me that there is a necessity for an increase in the price of milk in the next Budget.  As we are now aware, there will be a large revenue surplus and it would seem as if this is the proper time to suggest to the Minister that part of Government will enjoy this year should this large revenue surplus which the <Col N="677" /> be devoted towards, if not a spectacular increase, certainly to a considerable increase in the price of creamery milk and milk for liquid consumption.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the position in relation to pigs.  I think I am in order.  The price quoted for pigs in bacon factories is the highest price ever quoted; yet the price received by the farmers for pigs is probably the lowest in eight years.  There are two possible explanations of this.  One is that the farmers all suddenly started to produce far less grade A pigs; the other is that there was some change in the marketing of bacon and pork or some change in the pattern of trading generally.  I asked the Minister a question a fortnight ago and I got the information that the through-put of the bacon factories is about 2½ million pigs a year, and that the number of pigs entering there stands at 1½ million.  It appears as if the fact that lower grade pigs were directed towards pork exports, to allow a proper price for pigs which could not quite be graded as grade A special or grade A, had something to do with this.  We are aware that the export of pork was discontinued so that we could keep up the volume of our bacon exports.  I asked the Minister did he think we could do it and produce a volume of grade A bacon on the British market which would mean that we would retain the business we had got by hard trading since we first produced properly-graded bacon, and in his opinion and the opinion of the Department such was the case.  Pigs that could be exported for pork, pigs that could not quite be graded as grade A, cannot now be so exported.</P>
    <P>This means that the pig producer is now carrying the cross for the country. He is taking a reduced price for his pigs on average so that we will have the volume of grade A bacon that will supply the market we have achieved. In the long run, this is good for him too, but in the short run, it means that he is going out of pigs.  The scheme of grants for farrowed sows at Subhead K. 23 is something that we must welcome for that reason.  The pig cycle, <Col N="678" /> as we all know, seems to run to thre years.  This temporary scheme is, in my opinion, a good thing to introduce.</P>
    <P>In relation to cattle, I asked a series of questions a few weeks ago which gave me the figures &mdash; I do not want to quote them now; they are on the record for anyone that wants to read them &mdash; of the export of cattle and beet to Britain, and the export of cattle and beef to the Common Market.  The third vital statistic in this series of figures was the amount of cattle exported from Britain to the Common Market.  If we send their requirements to Britain and then send a further 200,000 cattle in the form of beef or cattle, and they are then moved on to the Common Market, that is an added number of cattle which we as a nation cannot export except to markets other than Britain and the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Our trade with America &mdash; and a very good trade it has been &mdash; has been largely box beef which is cow beef.  It is used there for what the Yanks like, namely, hamburgers, on which I wish them the best of luck.  We are faced with the situation that if on 1st April the Common Market authorities do not change their present policy, there could be a glut of cattle at what we farmers refer to as the back end of the year, September, October, November and part of December in some years, which could result in lowered prices again.  Giving advice is not much use to anyone, I suppose, as conflicting advice seems to abound at the moment</P>
    <P>As a farmer, my policy at present, whether I am right or wrong, is to sell anything I have that is fit to sell between now and 31st May, and to go out with whatever funds are available in October and buy in again.  That may be a pesssimistic view, but the question entirely revolves around whether or not the Common Market authorities are going to change their mind.  I understand that the relevant date is 1st April.  The extraordinary thing that happened, in which the Common Market people found themselves close to being self-sufficient in beef plus certain imports, was something that we did not foresee.  I am not one of those who shout and blame the Department of Agriculture and <Col N="679" /> Fisheries on this particular item or who blame any Minister for it, but it is quite sure that it occurred.  If there is no change or if the change is not substantial, then we must add the number of live cattle and the cattle in the shape of beef that we send to Britain and then take the number of cattle in the shape of beef or live cattle which they export to the Common Market and add that to the number we export to the Common Market and that is the number that cannot be exported if there is no change.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take too pessimistic a view because I hope the Common Market authorities will take some steps on 1st April.  If we address ourselves to things they have done and things they are doing we find, for instance, that they accept that if they were to exclude New Zealand butter from the Common Market they would ruin the economy of New Zealand and, therefore, they make certain exceptions in that regard.  Because of the link between East Germany and West Germany, they allow East Germany to export to the Common Market: this also is an exception.  If it could be brought home to them that the ruination of the cattle trade here for even a period of months was, in our particular economic situation, probably as serious as it would be to exclude New Zealand butter from the Common Market, then I think that perhaps there might be some hope of an exception.  But if one studies the figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why we should beg from them.  Our imports from the Common Market would be twice our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest we were going to beg.  My suggestion was that unless there was a change in the present policy there would be a serious situation here in the back end.  I impress on the new Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, who, up to recently, was busily engaged in another Ministry &mdash; as I am sure the officers of his Department have been impressing upon him &mdash; the necessity for every action he can take, of whatever nature, to ensure that we get <Col N="680" /> access to the Common Market for our cattle.</P>
      <P>Anyone who wishes to study the figures may do so but, on a Supplementary Estimate like this, I do not want to go into a ream of statistics.  I shall leave that to the Minister for Transport and Power, if he comes in.  It is quite clear that it is a serious situation. It approximates in beef equivalent of cattle to about 400,000 cattle that we could not send during this calendar year if there is not some change in Common Market policy on 1st April, that is, if 1st April is the date on which they will make their decision for the months to come.  When they made the previous decision they made it until 1st April and there was very little softening by them afterwards. There were 2,000 head of cattle which never went in this year and then became elderly bulls.  Whether or not these elderly bulls ever went, I do not know: of course, 2,000 cattle is merely a pin-prick.</P>
      <P>The beef subsidy scheme is working well.  There is this objection to or criticism of it which is rampant in agricultural circles at the present moment.  If one examines the price paid in recent times for beef in Britain by beef factories or slaughterers and the price paid on the same date here, it will be seen that there is a wide discrepancy. When we take from that discrepancy the cost of transport and various costs that arise because we are across the sea we shall still find that there is a discrepancy.  This has been explained by the fact that different types of beef have been killed at certain times by the different nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scotch beef has always got a premium in Smithfield.  I know exporters who sent vast numbers of cattle over the years to places such as Aberdeen which were slaughtered and hung up in Smithfield as Scotch beef. They answer to the description of Scotch beef which merely means that it is a beast of a certain size and quality.  However, there is a remedy for all this.  The remedy that has been suggested by one farmers' organisation is a producer-controlled marketing board for meat.  There is another remedy because the first thing is that <Col N="681" /> justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done if people are to be encouraged to proceed.</P>
    <P>The remedy I would see as the first remedy the Minister could apply would be to pay the beef subsidy directly to the farmers.  It has been suggested that this is impracticable.  If it is not impracticable to have every beast in the country with an ear-tag and a number on it and to tabulate them for the purposes of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme and for the purposes of the eradication of the warble fly and, shortly, for the eradication of brucellosis, surely it is not impossible to have, in this city or preferably somewhere else, an office from which beef subsidy could be paid directly to farmers?  There is a precedent for this. I could quote two precedents but one is indirectly related to Government activity.</P>
    <P>When there was a back payment to be made on wheat, the offices of Bord Gráin made that back payment in a period of six weeks and employed no extra staff to do it, and they did it very well.  In this instance, they were unused to this practice, unused to this particular occupation.  They had to go into extreme detail in regard to the names of all the buyers, and so on, and to verify with the flour mills, and so on, but the job was done and done well. This would be a continuing process without the great rush period when back payments had to be met on the whole intake of wheat in one harvest. This deficiency payment could easily be done by a relatively small office here, say 20 people.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the proper step by the Minister would be to see that deficiency payments were paid direct.  This would mean that the price of beef would be less.  The farmer could sell his beast as a store beast before it reached the beef stage or he could wait until it reached the stage when it could profitably be kept for the couple of months in Britain and then draw the subsidy as a store.  He had the choice of taking a lesser price for beef in the knowledge that, in his waistcoat pocket, was a small yellow notebook which told him the exact amount <Col N="682" /> of subsidy he would receive from, in the case of the British farmer the Queen, or, in our case, the Republic of Ireland.  This would be the first step to get people to realise that there can be fair play.</P>
    <P>I myself would wish to examine the suggestion of a producer-controlled meat marketing board in very great detail before I could come down on one side or the other.  I could not say I am competent to express a view here and now because it is a most detailed situation. In our present position of agricultural turmoil it would appear to me that the proper procedure would be to see to it that the beef subsidies are paid direct to the farmer.  At that stage, it would be a simple sum in arithmetic for any farmer to see what he is getting for his beast and at what price the beast is available to the slaughterers.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the heifer grants.  I was critical of the heifer scheme here.  I clearly told the Minister's predecessor and the House that there were people who were hopping on the bandwagon, drawing the heifer grants and hopping out and that this should be corrected.  I was the object almost of derision from the other side of the House.  Statistics were produced to show that the average payment was for three to five cattle and that in fact there was no such thing as a racket, and all that sort of thing.  I am now able to say here that, notwithstanding all the derision that was piled on me when I said this, the Minister has changed the heifer grant scheme &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;surreptitiously&rdquo; but I will use the word &ldquo;silently&rdquo;&mdash; and that a provision of the heifer scheme at this moment is that the numbers are preserved in the breeding herd and that this is being strictly enforced, and properly so.  The Parliamentary Secretary looks at me in a grim and serious manner.  I would much prefer him when he smiles.  I am telling him that this is absolutely true and that I know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will delay payment but the point is that you cannot do what you did, which was to go in, calve out your heifers, get your heifers' ears punched, draw your subsidy and as a free man, complete and absolute, go out, sell your heifers and buy bullocks.  I want to suggest to you, as I suggested before, that if the Minister knows anything about mathematics, he will know that there is no such thing as an average of averages and that when he quotes across the House to me, as he did previously here, that the average payments were from three to five heifers, I say that if you take one man with 1,000 heifers and throw in ten men with five heifers and divide by 11, you now get a figure that indicates that the average number of heifers in each scheme was around about one-seventh or one-eighth the largest one, but the largest one was a scandal and you have had to change it, and I want to claim <Col N="684" /> credit for the fact that I was the one who criticised it here.  I want to inform you that you have changed your scheme, that I know when you changed it, and that you changed it because you found out that we were right and you were wrong, and the position is that it is not possible at present for the <i>entrepreneurs</i> and adventurers to hop back on the wagon and draw £5,000 or £6,000 and hop out.  You have changed your scheme.</P>
      <P>I quote from page 22 of the Capital Budget, 1967:</P>
      <P>The provision of £1.55 million for 1967-68 for calved heifer grants as compared with an expected out-turn of £2 million in 1966-67 reflects the continuing downward trend in the demand for the scheme, which reached its peak in the first year of operation.</P>

    <P>Let us recall that the Minister's predecessor two moves back &mdash; and it takes a man of the moment to keep up with the moves &mdash; produced in his Estimate for Agriculture that year a figure of £350,000 for the heifer scheme and it cost £1,100,000 in the same year. What he had hoped for was the balanced improvements in the average numbers of breeding animals in a herd that would have been brought about if you had followed the good scheme that we had.  That would have brought about an improvement that would have been genuine and permanent. Instead, you went into this other scheme which had this spectacular result, which cost a vast sum of capital money but did not improve our situation inasmuch as it threw on the market over the past 24 months, at the wrong time, a large number of cattle for which &mdash; and I do not blame the Department or the Minister for this &mdash; there turned out to be no good market at a good price.  Now you have had to cut down your scheme; you have had to rearrange your scheme and you have decided that if a man draws £150 for increasing his herd number by an injection of heifers which he mates and which bear calves, he will be expected for a considerable period, at least 12 months, to preserve his herd numbers and, if he does not, he will not be <Col N="685" /> paid.  You have changed your scheme, if not surreptitiously, silently.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I want to express the general hope, as I expressed it on the price of milk, that in the coming Budget there will be for the farmers real increases in the price of their products and, as I indicated when I started and used the nefarious advertisement which cost £2,064 in the papers last Sunday as a headline and example in the matter, the moneys that directly reach the farmer, which are very little in relation to the total sum claimed by the Government, are in fact, payments to bring the price of the farmer's produce from the dumped world price at which it has to be sold abroad to a price at which the Government hope that the farmer will continue to produce, the purpose of his production being to pay for the raw material that must be imported so that we can on our industrial front employ the people who are inevitably leaving the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>An important factor regarding the Supplementary Estimate is that it makes provision for money that has been spent or will be spent before the end of this month and consequently will not mean any increase for the farming community at this stage.  It is recognised that the farming community at the present time need assistance and that agriculture has been in the doldrums for the past year or so, that there was an upset in the dairying industry last year and that recently there have been further upsets.</P>
      <P>There is one matter the Government and the Department of Agriculture in particular should keep in mind, that is, that in their anxiety to help the farming community, they should pay more attention to grassland in connection with both milk production and livestock production.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the purchase of the 2,000 Irish cattle in question or their equivalent in beef, were made with the appropriate German authorities on 8th October, 1966.  The Commission of the EEC was not involved in the arrangements as the cattle or beef were not destined for the West German market.  The availability of purchasing facilities for the cattle or beef was announced in the official German gazette of 12th November, 1966.</P>
      <P>The cattle or beef have not been exported since then as the trade interests concerned on both sides have not reached agreement on the commercial terms.</P>

      <P>The average range of liveweight prices for good quality fat bullocks at Dublin Market was 128/to 135/- per cwt. on 30th November, <Col N="705" /> 1966 and 124/- to 130/- per cwt. on 7th December, 1966.</P>
      <P>During these two weeks, support payments equivalent to the rates of fat cattle guarantee payments arising in Britain were made to Irish meat factories on their exports to Britain of carcase beef up to the standard eligible for such payments; and during the two weeks ended 3rd December, 1966, a headage payment of £7 per animal was made to cattle exporters on fat bullocks of an equivalent standard exported to Britain.  The benefit of these payments on carcase beef and live cattle exports to Britain would have been reflected in the prices received by farmers for such animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Faulkner) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current season's land settlement programme, which has been gathering momentum in recent months, is now at its peak.  This means that the position regarding lands taken over by the Land Commission for division throughout the country generally is rapidly changing from day to day.  For that reason statistics on the lines requested, if compiled as of now, would be very quickly out of date.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, perhaps the Deputy would repeat the question in about a month's time, when a more realistic assessment of the position should be feasible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that that is a lot of cod.  He could easily have given the position as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does not accept that it is all cod.  In fact, it is well known that at this particular period of the year there <Col N="722" /> is very heavy allotment and even if the Deputy got the information today, it could be changed when reports come up from the inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Land Commission decide to allot farms today and that they are allotted tomorrow?  Is it not the position that the decisions are made months beforehand and could the Parliamentary Secretary not have given the information as it was asked for?  That would have covered the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>55.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state in respect of the past five years the number and location of all farms allotted in County Meath of over £40 poor law valuation, giving the poor law valuation of each of such farms separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The official records are not compiled in a manner which includes the rateable valuation of lands allotted by the Land Commission. The position in this regard is that when an estate is divided by the Land Commission, details of the various allotments are furnished to the Valuation Office and the apportionment of the total estate valuation is then carried out by that Office.  Particulars of the area and location of all new holdings allotted by the Land Commission in County Meath during the past five complete financial years are contained in a tabular statement which I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>County Meath.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>The Parliamen- tary Secretary may not be aware that these workers get some Church holidays  and they do not get their full entitlement of 14 days.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any change in recent years with regard to the provision of medical treatment for the families of serving NCOs and men.  My Department does not accept liability for the cost of domiciliary treatment, except at Fort Dunree and in the Curragh Training Camp area where such treatment is provided by Army medical officers.</P>
      <P>As regards hospital treatment the position is that prior to the coming into operation of the Health Act, 1953, dependants were afforded hospital treatment in public wards in approved voluntary and local authority hospitals at the expense of the Vote for Defence. In the Curragh Training Camp area, as a special case, the treatment was provided in the Families Section of the General Military Hospital there.</P>
      <P>With the coming into operation of the Health Act, 1953, local health authorities became liable for the provision of medical, institutional, and specialist services for soldiers' dependants to the same extent as they are liable for the provision of such services for other members of the community in the corresponding categories as to social insurance and income.  In that connection I should mention that NCOs and Men are insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, as amended. Where the dependent receives the treatment in a public ward of a local authority hospital, or in a public ward of a hospital approved by the local health authority for the treatment of their patients, my Department defrays the charges made by the health authority. My Department also defrays the charges for specialist services provided by a health authority under Section 15 (4) of the Health Act, as amended.</P>

If, however, the Deputy has in mind an extension of the services by bringing in additional classes or improving benefit rates, he can rest assured that the existing policy of expansion and improvement in those directions will be maintained.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Question, the position is that people in receipt of the maximum non-contributory old age, blind or widows' and orphans' pension have no means assessed against them.  Amending legislation would be necessary to enable maximum pension to be paid to any other class or to alter the Schedule in which the items which constitute means are specified.  The various Acts which control these pensions are kept under review and amendments which appear desirable are made from time to time according as money becomes available for the purpose.</P>

I have one case where a man posted a certificate on 20th February, 1967 and should receive payment on 24th or 25th February but did not receive it until 29th February.  He posted a certificate again on 6th March and has not received payment so far.  He wrote to the Department again on 10th March but so far has not received payment.

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the report of the Flour and Bread Prices Advisory Body was published on 10th March, 1967 and that I announced simultaneously that I had accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the report; these were:</P>
      <P>(a)  that millers' prices for flour and wheatenmeal should be increased by 11s 3d per sack of 280 lbs in the case of bakers' flour, 8s 8d per sack of 280 lbs in the case of shop flour, 9s 10d per sack of 280 lbs in the case of bakers' wheatenmeal, and 7s 8d per sack of 280 lbs in the case of shop wheatenmeal,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us why there was a delay and why this question was not dealt with last August or September when they made the application?  Further, is the Minister aware that the millers' representative has said that bread prices will be increased by the next harvest after the crop of Irish wheat is taken into the mills?  Instead of there being a reduction, as you anticipate, there will be a further increase next autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>For an increase. They informed the Department last July or August.  But the Government did not make it public that this demand for an increase was in until the day the votes were being counted in the Waterford and Kerry by-elections. They kept it quiet until that day and then the announcement appeared that the millers had in their application since July or August.  That was pure coincidence, my eye.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware. I do not accept that.  The question of an increase in the price of bread is a serious matter and one that has to be looked into very carefully.  The mere fact that the millers look for an increase does not mean that the Government should automatically publicise that fact.  It is up to the Government to ensure that there is some basis for the application before the application is publicised.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the hospital in question applied 12 months ago to my Department for permission to employ additional staff &mdash; presumably nursing staff &mdash; to operate a 96-hour fortnight.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have in mind a proposal made last November to increase the complement of student nurses so as to make it possible to reduce the student nurses' working fortnight from 96 hours to 90 hours including lectures, as recommended by my Department in April, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's recommendation referred to had stressed the importance of maintaining high standards of nursing care of patients, and to that end had drawn attention to the need to maintain a reasonable ratio of trained to partially trained nurses.  In this particular <Col N="762" /> instance, the proposal would involve a practically doubling of the complement of student nurses with the addition of only one extra staff nurse.

      <P>The latest financial year for which the information sought by the Deputy is available is 1965-66.</P>
      <P>Up to 31st March, 1966, expenditure from public moneys on airports construction and on share capital in the Air Companies subscribed by the Minister for Finance amounted to £25.46 million.  Receipts of a capital nature were negligible.  The expenditure on airport construction amounted to £11.79 million.  The following is a summary of the financial outcome of the operation of the Airports and Air Navigation Services up to 31st March, 1966:</P>
      <P>Receipts, £15.8 million.  Expenditure (air navigation services and airport management), £16.8 million.  Operating deficit, £1 million.  Interest and depreciation, £10.5 million.  Gross deficit, £11.5 million.</P>
      <P>The total amount subscribed by the Minister for Finance by way of share capital in the Air Companies as at 31st March, 1966, was £13.66 million. Under the Air Companies Act, 1966, this shareholding is held direct by the Minister for Finance as to £6.4 million in Aer Lingus, £7.21 million in Aerlínte and £0.05 million in Aer Rianta. Aerlínte in turn invested £0.28 million in Irish and Intercontinental Hotels Limited.  No capital was invested in any other company in respect of air navigation and transport.  No dividends on capital investment in the air companies have been paid.  If a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent had been paid from the time that the capital was provided, receipts by the Minister for Finance would have amounted to £4.2 million.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 168, 169, 170 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>As explained in my reply to the corresponding questions tabled by the Deputy on 8th March, 1966, figures are not available for 1963-64 or subsequent years, of the net produce of tax under each Schedule.  However, for reasons also explained in that reply, it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt of Schedule E tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of income tax collected under Schedule E in 1965-66 was £26.9 million approximately of which £21.5 million was referable to Pay As You Earn.  The amount of Schedule E tax <Col N="802" /> to be collected in 1966-67 will not be known until some time after the 31st March, 1967.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy puts down a further Question after the Easter recess, I shall be glad to give him particulars of the actual out-turn of the Schedule E collection for 1966-67.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was commending to the Minister's attention that one of the best ways of assisting the farming community was in regard to the management of grassland.  The production of good grass would be of assistance both to the dairying industry and the livestock industry.  Two things are necessary in this respect.  One is the provision of cheap fertilisers and the other&mdash;a question associated with education to some extent&mdash;soil analysis.  Listening to the answers at Question Time today, we heard the amount invested by way of capital sum and the amount made available to manufacturers of fertilisers by way of grant by Foras Tionscal. Something that does not appear to be appreciated is that if the drive for the use of more fertilisers is to be as effective as it should be, the soil analysis service should be used to a greater extent. Anybody wishing to fertilise land should know exactly what is deficient in the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is the provision of <Col N="806" /> cheap fertiliser.  We know the Department make a subsidy available but these subsidies are paid to the manufacturers of fertilisers at the end of the trading year when they produce their figures to the Department of Industry and Commerce which determines the appropriate amount of subsidy to be paid.  If farmers could get cheaper fertilisers, this would eliminate the need for some other supports that we must have otherwise because if there was a more forward and more sustained crop of grass, it would enable even small holders to increase production considerably and would add to their incomes. This is something well worth considering.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by Deputy Murphy some time ago, the people are not convinced that the benefit of subsidy is brought to the level of the farming community.  I am open to conviction on whether or not it is administratively too difficult to provide a direct subsidy.  If the Minister can sustain the case that administratively he has to control the subsidy through manufacturers of fertilisers, that is one thing, but I think there is a lot to be said for direct payment of the subsidy to the farmer against the weight of fertiliser purchased.</P>
    <P>We have a sum made available for the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme. Since it is a small sum, we may take it that the scheme has not really got going.  When the Minister's main Estimate comes along, perhaps he will be able to give us a better account of how this scheme is going.  The question of farm apprenticeship is wider than just the mere provision of money in the Estimates and I think the Minister should seriously consider extending this scheme to its finality.  It is quite some time ago since a former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, mentioned an apprenticeship scheme whereby young farmers who had served their apprenticeship to farming would find themselves entitled to priority of consideration for some of the land which falls to be divided by the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>There is little sense in talking of a farm apprenticeship scheme if the <Col N="807" /> Minister cannot convince his colleague in the Department of Lands that he should relax the regulations under which young men are prevented from obtaining a holding after completing an apprenticeship scheme.  I ask the Minister to consider this seriously and see if he can produce a worthwhile proposal to carry to finality the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme. Assistance is being given also through the committees of agriculture.  This is a very useful form of assistance as it it brought down to local level and applied to local conditions.  That is an admirable system.</P>
    <P>There is some provision in the subheads for the Land Project.  In 196566 the amount spent on this project was less than the sum provided.  I am glad that in this case the Minister had to bring in a Supplementary Estimate because of increased spending on the Land Project.  In this connection there is need to review the regulations. Schemes of work are being held up in cases where a number of people are occupied in something that will be advantageous to a number of them and one of them opts out.  I know the difficulties involved here.  There may be legal matters to settle but I suggest that if there are any new ways in which the Department can use its endeavours to ensure that the Land Project is made to work in such circumstances, they are well worth trying.</P>
    <P>More money is sought for the bovine TB scheme to which the Minister referred.  It is of some significance, especially for one from the southern area, when the Minister mentions that the percentage of reactors was higher than expected and said that while the increased incidence of the disease was disappointing it was not of great significance.  On the whole I agree but it is certainly of significance so far as the individuals affected are concerned.  We sometimes have unreasonableness regarding people affected.  It is understandable to a degree in the case of a person who has been co-operating with the scheme from the beginning and now finds himself at the stage where his <Col N="808" /> cattle again become reactors.  Certainly, there is grave disappointment and serious loss.  I suggest &mdash; I do not know how this thing can be operated &mdash; that where farms become locked up, as quite a number of them are in the south, some assistance should be given. I do not know how the Minister and his Department can get over this problem. It is a big one especially for people trying to rear families if the outlet from their land is blocked and if they cannot sell their cattle.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the help that competition is in the sale of cattle and the person who can drive his cattle to the fair or mart and show them there has an advantage.  If he must rely on somebody coming to his farm to buy the cattle, he is in an unenviable position and he is forced to seek a buyer in a very restricted area. I know these cattle are bought but very often there is dissatisfaction with the price offered and the farmers concerned feel they are not getting what they should get as the market price if they were able to move these cattle to an area of competition.  That is the kernel of the situation.  This breeds distrust of the scheme and a certain amount of distrust of the officials who have the unenviable task of trying to cope with the situation.  I do not think a large amount of money would be involved in giving the market price of these beasts, according to weight, but it would do much to create confidence in the scheme among the farming community.</P>
    <P>The questions of the increase in livestock and the heifer scheme have already been mentioned here.  The fact has also been stated that we have had quite a number of poor cattle as a result, particularly where there is only a small amount of land.  If one takes the constituency of Limerick as a whole, where there are over 22,000 holdings and 17,000 of which are under 30 acres, the Minister will realise there is need for people to take land if they can find it.  What happens to some people is that, when they take this land, they are then credited with a number of cattle, mythical or hypothetical, whatever way you like to take it, as being attached to this land.  This <Col N="809" /> increases for them the amount of their basic herd and very often deprives them of the grant to which they are entitled by increasing the number of heifers they are carrying.</P>
    <P>I know the Department must have some system so as to prevent fictitious claims, but the Minister has reliable figures at his disposal, certainly since the beginning of testing, and that is quite a long time ago.  He also has the returns of the creamery, if necessary, which would indicate the number of cattle on a farm at any given time. Between them, these statistics should enable the Department to pinpoint the basic herd of any person in an area. Certainly the person who increases his herd and who, in order to do that, has taken extra land on short-term letting should qualify for a grant.  A number of cases have been brought to my notice and I brought them to the attention of the Department.  I have got the stock answer that they have investigated the matter, but that this hard and fast rule which has been laid down must be observed.</P>
    <P>This has created great hardship for quite a number of people, particularly those who kept cattle over last year, because they were told, when cattle prices were bad, to hold on.  A good many people, <i>bona fide,</i> held on to those cattle and then found themselves in difficulty in regard to feed for them. To enable them to hold on to the cattle for some time, they took land on short letting.  In these circumstances it is unfair that they should be penalised.</P>
    <P>An increased sum had to be made available for the marketing of dairy produce and that was to be expected with the increasing number of cattle in the country.  With the increase in the number of heifers first time calving we were bound to have an increase in the number of milch cows, resulting in an increase in the amount of milk which would become available.  From this it would follow that no matter how milk could be diversified after that, whether as butter, cheese, chocolate crumb or milk powder, subsidies would be required.  Probably the lowest of these at the present time is in relation to the marketing of butter.  Under <Col N="810" /> the brand of Kerrygold butter has been marketed successfully.  This butter marketing board has succeeded in placing butter in its proper category on the British market and has continued to find a satisfactory price.</P>
    <P>When the Minister mentions an increased price for milk, particularly quality milk, one of the things that is absolutely necessary &mdash; and perhaps this is not fully understood &mdash; is an adequate supply of water.  This, of course, involves a good deal of capital expenditure in regard to the installation of a proper water supply on any farm. The Minister, having left the Department of Local Government and moved to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will remember that the grants for water were taken away from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and centralised in the Department of Local Government.  I suggested at the time I did not think that was a wise thing; I still do not think it was a wise thing to take this responsibility away from Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should have control over the provision of grants for water schemes for the farming community.</P>
    <P>I have seen costings for water schemes.  Some of these can be very expensive.  There are very few which could be termed moderate.  To get any kind of proper supply of water there must be a deep well.  To sink a well at the present time, particularly in my own constituency where there is limestone land, it would be necessary to go to a depth of 120 to 180 feet.  That, with the amount of equipment that has to be put into the bore after it has been made, gives rise to considerable expense.  Some people may say the grant is generous &mdash; and I agree it is certainly generous to provide a grant at any stage &mdash; but one of the things not readily available to farmers is credit facilities to enable them to participate in these water schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the provision of a sum of money for bulk milk collection.  I should like to hear more from the Minister in regard to this.  A sum of £18,000 is involved; £10,000 has been taken up and now £7,000 is being provided.  This sum was made available to a co-operative in Waterford.  The Minister says this is by way of testing the operation of bulk milk collection under Irish conditions. What I am interested in is what exactly has the Minister in mind in regard to this pilot scheme?  At the moment various co-operatives in the south are shifting milk themselves quite successfully from the point of collection for manufacturing purposes.  In my constituency milk is moved over considerable distances to manufacturing concerns associated, for instance, with Golden Vale, to Mallow for manufacture there and to Rathmore for processing into chocolate crumb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we find a sum being made available for Waterford Co-operative Society; this is described as a pilot scheme.  I am intrigued, to say the least of it.  Is this something in the Minister's mind for the future in relation to the dairying industry?  Is it part of a <Col N="812" /> scheme designed to deal with the rationalisation of the dairy industry?  I should be glad if the Minister would elaborate on this.  We shall have an opportunity of asking a number of more fully on the main Estimate.  In 1966 I spoke about the disadvantages the dairy industry suffers in my constituency in relation to the removal of milk.  I do not know if that is what is involved here.  That is why I ask the Minister for more information.</P>
    <P>In this Supplementary Estimate we are voting moneys which have already been spent.  This Supplementary Estimate will have no effect on farmers' incomes.  However, this does give us an opportunity of dealing with the matter questions in relation to the various subheads and, when the Minister comes to reply, I hope he will find it possible to answer these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be too strongly emphasised that our Standing Orders preclude us from discussing, even on a Supplementary Estimate of this considerable size, more general questions of policy.  It is a matter of regret to me that this Supplementary Estimate does not provide that opportunity.  It is a matter on which the public at large should be fully informed from the point of view of the restrictions which our Standing Orders put on the debate. We are dealing with the actual subheads introduced to meet charges which came in course of payment in the current financial year and we are labouring under the further disadvantage that, under our new rules of procedure, we are not yet aware of the terms of the main Estimate for the coming financial year.  Up to last year we would have had in our hands at this point of time the main Estimate for the coming year and some of these charges could have been examined in the light of the general pattern that main Estimate would reveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised that this Supplementary Estimate contains no provision for the expense the Minister referred to in answer to a Parliamentary Question today of some thousands pounds spent on an advertisement he recently published.  I do not know where that money came from.  I suppose <Col N="813" /> it will have to be provided because it is charged on public funds.  The Minister said it did not very much matter where it came from: it worked. Worked, I wonder, to do what? Perhaps, when the Minister is concluding, he will tell us what.  What was it intended to do?  It seems to underline one fact, a fact I hope the farmers will take note of, namely, that the Minister disposes of very large sums of money which he uses for his own purposes and with which he believes apparently he can achieve almost everything.  The farmers ought to remember that, great as are the resources at the disposal of the Minister, they have in their hands an instrument more powerful than anything he possesses, if they will only learn to use it &mdash; the simple instrument of the vote; that is more powerful than all the propaganda money the Minister can muster.  I should like to elaborate on this but, out of deference to you, Sir, I shall reserve my elaboration on that topic for the main Estimate.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the subheads in this Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister speaks of the provision for cattle headage payments in the context of weakening prices, which, he says:</P>
    <P>had been brought about by a number of factors outside our control, the principal ones being the sluggish demand from Britain for our stores and the virtual closing of the EEC markets to imports of cattle and beef as a result of the imposition of very high levies. I think there can be little doubt but that the fat cattle headage payment scheme kept trade moving during a very difficult period and prevented what could have been a serious situation in the market.</P>
    <P>The man who believes that what the Government did, in fact, prevented what could have been a serious situation in the market is living in Cloud-Cuckoo-Land.  I have a certain sympathy with the Minister's predecessor, who came from Clontarf, if he did not understand the gravity of the situation for the small farmers of this country over the past 12 months, but the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries comes from <Col N="814" /> North Donegal.  He was born and reared amongst small farmers and he ought to know their problems.  I do not think he can avoid knowing their problems, even though he has become a resident of the city of Dublin.  To say that any steps the Minister took relieves the circumstances of the small farmer who was depending on calves and yearling cattle is to delude himself to a degree I did not believe possible.  Within the past six months, I have met men coming from fairs, driving home their yearling cattle before them: I have asked them: &ldquo;Were you buying or selling?&rdquo; And they have told me they were selling and that the best offer they could get was £20 for a beast 14 months old.  They added: &ldquo;We bought that calf within a week of its being dropped for £23&rdquo;.  There were calves sold in the marts of the south of Ireland last week for 15/-.</P>
    <P>Now, mark you, when you go to the relatively well-to-do areas of the south of Ireland, where farmers have large creamery connections operating, substantial as their loss is on their calf, they have the compensation that their prime occupation is the dairy industry.  When you reflect on the condition of the small farmers in the west of Ireland, in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, however, who have not got that compensating condition but who depend very largely on the value of the calf, either as a dropped calf or as a yearling, and recognise that such cattle have become virtually unsaleable at any price, then to hear the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries saying that he thinks there can be little doubt but that the fat cattle headage payments scheme kept trade moving during a very difficult period and prevented what could have been a serious situation in the mart, would suggest to me, to put it at its most charitable, that he has not had sufficient time to catch up with the realities of the Department for which he is now responsible.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to a new menace which I watch with alarm in connection with this whole question of fat cattle and meat exports.  It took this country 40 years to eliminate the scrub bull.  In two <Col N="815" /> years we have brought back the scrub heifer.  Mark you, eliminating the scrub bull was quite a formidable undertaking &mdash; I suppose there were a few thousand bulls in the whole country&mdash; and our efforts were immensely facilitated by the emergence of artificial insemination, but when you come to eliminate the scrub heifer, which we ourselves have generated by the heifer scheme, God help the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who undertakes the task.  I see on farms a growing number of low grade, poor heifer cattle which I gravely apprehend will pull down the whole reputation of the Irish store cattle on the British market over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>One of the most formidable tasks of any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the immediate years that lie ahead will be to prevent a grave deterioration of quality in our livestock exports which is a direct consequence of the crazy heifer grant scheme which has not only reduced the standard of quality in our cattle but because it was formulated for the purpose of increasing numbers without any corresponding market plans whatever, has brought upon the most vulnerable, although the most valuable element of our rural community, a greater catastrophe that any I recall since the Economic War.  I want to say that very substantial sums of money are being and have been made available under this whole scheme of headage payments for our fat cattle exported for immediate slaughter.  I believe the previous Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries thought that when he negotiated this trade agreement in London under which the British Government undertook to pay headage payments on beef supplies, and to pay a subsidy on beef bought in this country and which could be converted into a headage payment here, and when he persuaded the Government to carry on this after the total amount of beef provided for in the agreement had been exported, that the proceeds would go to the producers of the cattle.</P>
    <P>I wonder did he ever ask himself <Col N="816" /> what was likely to happen.  I do not suppose the man knew how the cattle trade operated at all.  He pictured a farmer marching cattle up to the meat factories, getting paid the current prices for the cattle plus whatever bonus he had undertaken to pay the dead-meat factory.  Of course, the thing is utter nonsense.  What the dead-meat factories did, and what they could readily have been expected to do, was they went out to the fairs and markets and if the particular mart they went to, or the fair they attended, was over supplied with cattle, they bought cattle as cheaply as they could get them.  They brought them to their slaughter houses, slaughtered them, skinned them, dressed them and exported them, and at the point of export they collected the headage grant.  However, the farmer who sold the beast saw none of it and could not see any part of it unless there was an absolute shortage of fat cattle available for slaughter on the domestic market.  But this crazy scheme which the Government inaugurated created a situation in which there was a surplus of fat cattle.</P>
    <P>I do not minimise the problem which the Minister had in trying to ensure that whatever headage grant was made available for cattle would go to the people who produced the cattle.  It is done in England and it is done in the North of Ireland and it should not have been impossible to devise a scheme to ensure that it would be done here.  As it is, I doubt very much if those who sold cattle derived any benefit at all from it. However, whatever loss they were at as a result of our failure to ensure that the headage grant went back to the producers, their losses are microscopic compared with the losses sustained by the small farmers, the price of whose young stock has collapsed.  For me the tragedy of that situation is that those hurt most understand least the nature of the catastrophe that has overtaken them.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to know if the Minister has yet had time to examine this problem and whether he can suggest to us any scheme or plan whereby <Col N="817" /> the critical situation of the small farmers in the congested areas who now have very large numbers of surplus cattle on their hands can be resolved and they can hope to sell those cattle at anything approximating to an economic price.  By an economic price, I mean a price which would bear some relation to the cost of producing and feeding them over the past 14 or 18 months.</P>
    <P>I met a man within the past month who professes to be not only a veterinarian of experience but a statistician of high standard and I think his claims are not unfounded.  I said to him: &ldquo;What in the name of God is happening to the cattle trade?&rdquo;&ldquo;I will tell you, Mr. Dillon, what is happening to the cattle trade,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;We have by the heifer scheme created a surplus of approximately 100,000 two-year old cattle and upwards, and a surplus of approximately 100,000 cattle under two years old.&rdquo; I said I was not interested in these elaborate statistics and I asked him: &ldquo;What would you do to resolve that situation? How would you restore a reasonable price level for the small farmer who depends on the production of store cattle?&rdquo; He looked me straight in the eye and said: &ldquo;If you want to know, there is only one way and that is to slaughter 100,000 calves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very grim diagnosis of a very urgent situation.  We have created this extraordinary, crazy, surplus condition in our cattle trade, the end result of which I confess myself unable to see.  I want to remind the House that I have interested myself primarily in agriculture in this House for 35 years, for six of which or nearly seven I was Minister for Agriculture.  If anyone had suggested to me over that whole period that we would be reduced to the state where we had to subsidise cattle exports I would have laughed.</P>
    <P>Does anyone realise that up to two years ago the British farmer was dependent on us for the raw material of his industry?  Does anyone realise that up to two years ago the most eloquent and vocal defender we had in Great Britain was the British farmer? He was solicitous to say to the British <Col N="818" /> Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;Whatever else you do, do not place any block or hindrance to the free access of Irish store cattle to the British market, because we, the British farmer, depend absolutely on that source of supply for our industry.&rdquo;  Do Deputies realise that public meetings have been called in Norfolk and Scotland by enraged British farmers clamouring for their own Minister of Agriculture to stop imports of Irish cattle?  I do not know if Deputies realise the magnitude of that catastrophe.</P>
    <P>I am in the retail trade all my life, and I am in the wholesale trade all my life.  There is no stock question I cannot resolve by prudent buying and administration.  There is no finance problem, no financial business I cannot control in consultation with my bankers, and by the prudent administration of my own resources.  There is no question of premises I cannot resolve by appropriate remedial steps. In addition to premises, and stock, and sales organisation, and finance, there is one asset which is of incalculable value to me as an ordinary trader, that is, goodwill.  This has been built up over 120 years' trading, not by me but by those who went before me.  If by my folly I let that goodwill go, if I so conducted my business today that that goodwill evaporated, I could not get it back.  I certainly could not get back in a week, or a year, or ten years, what it took 100 years to build up.  I saw a firm in this city throw away their goodwill and when they tried to come back and trade again, although they had been nearly 100 years in business here, they never got their trade back.</P>
    <P>I think that is a terrible danger to the cattle industry of Ireland.  It has expanded in numbers.  That I concede most readily, but I cannot claim that I believe the quality of the cattle being produced today is as high as it was before the heifer scheme.  I believe the scrub heifer is steadily operating to reduce the standard.  I apprehend that though we may be able to obtain the goodwill of the British Government, this will be worth Sweet Fanny Adams if we have lost the goodwill of our customer, the British farmer.  That is what I seriously apprehend may be <Col N="819" /> one of the most deep-seated problems with which we have to grapple at present.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister when he comes to reply on this Supplementary Estimate, so that we can consider his reply in preparation for the main Estimate, does he believe, surveying the markets available to us, that we have an absolute surplus of cattle, and if that diagnosis is correct, has he yet had time to formulate any plan that would be economically sound.  If he has, when those plans come to operate, has he any means of securing that, whatever provision he makes to restore the price of cattle to an economic level, the money will reach the farmers who produce the cattle and will not stick to the fingers of those who come between the producer and his ultimate customer, the British farmer, who wants to buy them for conversion into fat stock which will enjoy the benefit of the British subsidy <i>in toto</i> as provided under the 1948 Trade Agreement?</P>
    <P>I want to turn for a moment to the question of pigs.  It is perfectly true that, over many decades of our history, all of us in the Department of Agriculture were afflicted with the quinquennial picture of the pig cycle. I thought we had broken that cycle by the introduction of a guaranteed price for pigs.  I do not see why we have not.  Remember, in the old days what happened was that the supply of pigs went down and the price of pigs went up.  Everybody got into pigs when the price began to move up and continued in pigs until the supply equated the demand, whereupon the price of pigs began to fall.  There was a short period of surplus.  The price fell catastrophically.  Again, the price began to rise, the people went back into pigs and the price fell &mdash; and there you got a typical picture of an up and down wave of pig production.</P>
    <P>We introduced a scheme in the Department of Agriculture in which we said: &ldquo;We will provide a guaranteed price for pigs and we will relate that price to the price of feeding barley and, further, we give a <Col N="820" /> guarantee that that price for pigs cannot be changed without six months' notice to the farming community at large&rdquo; so that any man who brought a pig to the boar knew what he would get for the progeny, finished, fit for the factory, five months after the sow's insemination.  I thought that scheme worked.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that there has now entered into this equation a new element, that is, that the price of feeding stuffs is creeping up.  Whether that is due to the restrictions placed by the Minister on the imports of milo and maize which form the constituent parts of a pig compound mixture or what the reason is I do not know.  It certainly is not due to a rise in the price of feeding barley because no rise has been granted.  In fact, I think that when I fixed the price of pigs, the price of feeding barley was 48/- a barrel.  I think it is at that price, or less now.  It may be that our arrangements have been thrown out of kilter by fluctuations in the price of feeding stuffs for pigs.  If that is so, I suggest to the Minister that the remedy for the recurrence of the pig cycle to which he refers in his statement is a six months' guarantee of a standard ration at a standard price related to the guaranteed price for pigs over the same period.</P>
    <P>There may be another element in this but it should not give rise to the cycle.  It may be that the small pig producer is being squeezed out of the pig business as he is being squeezed out of the fowl business.  I remember that when I first went to the Department of Agriculture there was a very large and prosperous business in the production of fowl in West Cork. That is completely gone.  It is not gone through any fault of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or of his predecessor.  It is just one of these things that happen as a consequence of a changing world.  The broiler chicken has eliminated the old industry with which Deputy M.P. Murphy was familiar and for which, at one time, West Cork was internationally famous.  That trade is dead and it will never come back.  I think it was a great pity.  A good chicken <Col N="821" /> from Rosscarbery had a flavour that no broiler will ever have but we &ldquo;just ain't going to have&rdquo; any more Rosscarbery chickens: those days are gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only in Rosscarbery that it is happening.  They gave it up for economic reasons: the Minister for Finance gave it up for Raheny reasons.  He thought hens laid golden eggs.  He discovered, by bitter experience, that all that glitters is not gold and he beat a prudent retreat from that adventure in agriculture.  But there may be happening to the pig industry what happened to the Rosscarbery fowl industry.  There is no doubt that when you guarantee the price of pigs, the situation can arise in which the person who keeps 1,000 pigs under highly specialised conditions in Jordan houses can take a smaller profit per finished pig than the person who is in a relatively small way of production.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister when he is concluding on this Supplementary Estimate, whether the pig fattening centres, some of which have been inaugurated in the country, have in any measure operated to correct that tendency of driving the small producer out of the pig industry altogether: I had high hopes they would.</P>
      <P>I understand that the pig fattening centre scheme was based on the proposition that the pig fattening centre chose sows of excellent breeding and maintained boars of suitable quality and they distributed the sows to the small farmers in the immediate area and that the pig fattening centre stood ready to buy the bonhams at ten or 14 weeks at so much per lb. which kept the small man in pig production. I understood that, turning over so large a number of pigs as they did, they were able to trade on the same margin of profit as the industrialised pig operator has been able to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that if you are in a position to buy feeding stuffs on as <Col N="822" /> large a scale as that kind of operation would justify and in large measure mix the feeding stuff yourself and avail of the cheapest kinds of raw material that are from time to time available, pig feeding might become economic again.  The plain truth is that pig producing for small producers has ceased to be economic, bearing in mind the heavy labour it involves.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is but I think it is common knowledge that sows, being capricious creatures, choose to farrow, seven times out of ten, at 3 o'clock in the morning.  If they do start farrowing at a reasonable hour of the day, they elect to carry on the operation for about 15 hours so that they keep you up until about 3 o'clock in the morning in any case.  That is a serious matter if you have three or four sows in operation because, if they are doing their business, they ought to have two clutches per annum and that means that, eight months out of every 12, you have one of them operating at about 3 o'clock in the morning.  It is hard work.  It is work that requires to be highly remunerative if small family farms are to carry it on.  Certainly, in the old days they did but unless they are assured of an economic return, they become less and less inclined to do so. I doubt if pig factories will fully take their place.</P>
    <P>There is an additional evil in the present situation.  In the constituency I represent, Monaghan, before the last war, we had an immense export trade in pork and that meant a pig of approximately 100 lbs. weight, dressed.  It meant a younger pig than a mature bacon pig.  It was a very profitable branch of the pig industry.  One of the strange provisos of the so-called Free Trade Agreement with Great Britain was that we undertook to supply a certain minimum quantity of bacon to the British market.  Having given that undertaking, we now find that we have not got the bacon to meet the quota we undertook to supply under the Trade Agreement and we are providing bacon over and above that which would ordinarily be available from resources that were ordinarily employed to furnish a relatively profitable pork <Col N="823" /> market.  So that we are not only abandoning a valuable market but we are undertaking an additional burden of subsidy because we have promised to export the pigs in the form of bacon which fetches a poorer price than if we shipped them in the form of pork and at the same time, we have to keep them from three to six weeks longer than we would have to keep them if we were free to ship them as pork.</P>
    <P>The more I see of the so-called Free Trade Agreement the more bewildered its provisions appear to me to be.  We have succeeded in alienating the British farmer in the cattle trade. We have succeeded in imposing on ourselves an obligation to sell bacon we have not got and bacon on which we have to pay a very high rate of subsidy at the expense of a pork market which was very valuable and out of which we are being pushed and on which we had to pay a relatively trivial export bounty and into which some people claim they could export pork without any subsidy at all.</P>
    <P>I do not say that I am prepared to vindicate that.  The Department's answer is: &ldquo;We do not believe it.  We believe that when we started licensing them they would be back on our doorstep a week later claiming that they wanted a subsidy&rdquo; but I have heard men make the claim that, given freedom of opportunity, they could pay a competitive price for pigs and export them free of all subsidies.  I do not assert that because I think there may be some wangling in that and what they want to do is to sell it on the domestic pork market, get a preferential price for it and then blackmail the Department into giving them a subsidy afterwards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> I see some of my colleagues here long experienced in the creamery trade and I want to raise a thing that has puzzled me a good deal.  I hear of the price of creamery milk going up by 1d and going up by 2d and then the Minister says in the course of his statement:</P>
    <P>The general creamery milk price allowance paid by the Exchequer was increased from 4d to 6d per gallon as from 27th May, 1966, and the extra sum required to meet this is £2,305,000.</P>
    <P>Do the farmers get it?  What becomes of it?  My neighbours tell me.  I admit that although we had a creamery in Ballaghaderreen in 1906, I could not claim that the area in which I live is primarily a creamery area.  This is what raises my suspicions and anxieties: Deputy Jones was talking here earlier of the Minister's pilot scheme for the bulk collection of creamery milk.  I understand that there was already a pilot scheme in operation for the bulk collection of creamery milk operated by Lough Egish in Monaghan but what puzzles me is that I think the farmers who bring milk to Lough Egish do get the extra 1d we provide. My information from my own constituency is that there is a corresponding increase.  I should like to hear from the Minister when he is concluding has he heard any complaints from certain areas of the country that this 2d and 4d he speaks of as costing the Exchequer £2,305,000 to provide is, in fact, being passed on to the creamery rather than to the milk producer?  It is an extremely difficult thing to determine.</P>
    <P>I was looking at some of my creamery cards and I discovered that in the month of July last year my butter fat content was 3.7; this year it was 3.2. How am I to check that and is the machinery provided by the IAOS adequate to deal with that question? Is the machinery provided by the Department of Agriculture adequate to deal with it?  To tell you the truth. I do not believe the Department of Agriculture has any very effective check on that whole question of testing butter fat content at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> I will blame the Department for what it is responsible for.  I resent its being blamed for what it is not responsible for.  I heard somebody recently in a very public place blaming the Department of Agriculture most eloquently because he was not allowed to change from one creamery to another creamery.  My recollection is that the Department does not give a fiddle-de-dee where he draws his milk to.  They made an agreement, at the farmers' request, with the IAOS that such transfers would not be allowed but that agreement was made at the request of the farmers and the co-operative movement, not at the request of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture in so far as it is concerned with the matter at all is merely acting in support of the IAOS which represents the co-operative societies in the country.  So that whatever blame attaches in relation to that problem certainly does not attach to the Department of Agriculture because it does not give a fiddle-de-dee where a man leaves his milk, but, once having agreed with the IAOS to support the <i>status quo</i> situation, the Department does its part and no more than its part.</P>
    <P>I think there does devolve on the Department and on the Minister responsibility to see that there is some check to ensure that if we provide finance to increase the price of milk by 2d a gallon to the creamery milk supplier the creamery milk supplier gets it.  I recognise the problem.  We cannot determine in this House what the butter fat content of any particular man's milk will be from one month to another.  I am not sure of any certain remedy for the situation but this I do say that in certain areas of the country, there is a growing impression, which I believe to be justified by the evidence of the creamery cards I see, that the full extra price being made available by this House for creamery milk is not reaching the creamery milk producers and I think it is a matter that requires investigation and examination.</P>
    <P>I am a little surprised to read that 40 per cent of the milk delivered to <Col N="826" /> creameries is all that qualifies for the quality bonus.  I remember my old friend Deputy Corry whom I thought would burst a blood vessel here in the House when Deputy Donegan was speaking on the creamery industry and thought that some measure should be taken to encourage farmers to improve the quality of their milk so that we could diversify into cheese, dried milk and chocolate crumb. Deputy Corry was tortured by the thought that Deputy Donegan should say that Cork farmers were delivering dirty milk to their creameries and that only a villain like Deputy Donegan would say such a thing. He cried loudly and repeatedly over this foul slight on the creamery farmers.</P>
    <P>Then his own Government introduced a scheme to provide a bonus for what they call quality milk.  I am surprised that Deputy Corry has not been in here to challenge his Minister over the fact that the quality bonus was paid to only 40 per cent of the creamery milk suppliers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said 49 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister said 49 per cent, but I am speaking of the time when Deputy Corry nearly got a stroke in Dáil Éireann because Deputy Donegan suggested that, in order to expedite diversification, some improvement in the quality was desirable.  I was going out to get a bucket of cold water to pour it over Deputy Corry's head for fear he would burst a blood vessel in my presence. Bad as he is, I would not like that to happen.  For that reason, we had a Minister for Agriculture bringing in a scheme to provide a bonus of 1d. per gallon for quality milk and, instead of 100 per cent, only 40 per cent qualified for that bonus.  I think it is time Deputy Corry came back into the House and told the present Minister what he thinks of him for stating in Dáil Éireann that only 40 per cent of milk is worthy of the quality bonus, in view of Deputy Corry's past passionate indictment of Deputy Donegan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to the opportunity of discussing the Minister's main <Col N="827" /> Estimate.  He will know more about his job then than he now knows, and we will have a more widespread and interesting discussion.  He will then have had time to consider the consequences of what some of his predecessors have done; he will have time to tell us what he intends to do. Perhaps before he finishes today he will tell us what he meant when he said that, even if he spent £2,000 on newspaper advertising, it was worth it.  What was he trying to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> One matter mentioned by Deputy Dillon prompted me to intervene in this debate, the matter of the rights of farmers who supply milk to our creameries.  Everybody is familiar with the complaint by some farmers that they cannot understand the figure they get for their butter fat.  That is the factor on which their monthly cheque is paid and some of them have expressed serious misgivings on occasion. Apparently a scheme is in operation by agreement with the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society that, unlike the farmer who takes his barley to a factory and gets a sample, the farmer who takes his milk to the creamery does not get similar facilities with regard to a cross-check of his butter fat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> One supplier felt so dissatisfied that he took samples of his milk and sent them for analysis to different laboratories. He went so far as to have a guard accompany him to the creamery and then to the local post office from which he posted off the samples. Apparently there was considerable discrepancy between the findings of the creamery and the return he got from the analyst.  He carried the matter further and took legal action but it was discovered that a case like that cannot go into court.  It must be dealt with by arbitration.  He felt that the arbitration scheme was not satisfactory and, in general, he felt dissatisfied with the whole procedure.</P>
    <P>If that is the system, it does not seem to be completely satisfactory.  If a man feels he is being prejudiced in relation to the percentage of butter fat in his milk, there should be some machinery by which he could cross-check his milk against the findings of the creamery.  I will ask the Minister to examine that aspect of the matter. I know the scheme is not being directed by his Department and that it has been handed over to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society but I would ask him to see if he can bring about any improvement in the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I would like to bring to the Minister's attention. One is the fat cattle headage export grant.  Most Deputies will recall this was introduced some time last autumn. I do not know how much money had to be provided for that purpose ultimately. Owing to the bottleneck in our cattle exports, many farmers had to hold over their store animals and they proceeded to fatten them.  The Minister, in an effort to relieve the situation, introduced this headage grant.  Different grants were given from week to week.  They were gradually increased as the year progressed from autumn onwards.  They suddenly terminated early in December.  I understand that the British Minister for Agriculture intervened and practically told the Minister for Agriculture here to stop it and that he agreed to stop it somewhere about 1st December.  I want to ask the present Minister if it is envisaged, in the event of a similar <Col N="829" /> bottleneck in our cattle exports next autumn, to re-introduce this fat cattle headage export grant.  Are we permitted under the Trade Agreement to re-introduce it or is the British Minister for Agriculture empowered to tell us not to introduce it?  I understand he objected to our Minister here, under pressure from his own British farmers, who resented the subsidisation of the export of fat cattle to the British market as distinct from the deficit help from the British Exchequer for stores under the 1948 Agreement.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to put to the Minister is again in the form of a question.  It relates to our subsidisation of carcase meat.  How much money are we likely to get from the British Exchequer and when are we likely to get it?  Has the Minister given up all hope of being able to pay this type of subsidisation directly to the farmers?  I put down a Parliamentary Question here and he gave an explanation of the administrative difficulties involved in giving it to the Irish farmer.  I raise the matter again to exhort him to bend his mind to this question because it is causing dissatisfaction.  I believe this matter could be re-examined to see if any means could be devised by which this subsidisation we give to our factories and local slaughterhouses could be made available to the producer. Until that is done, there will be all sorts of suspicions, recriminations and dissatisfaction.  Therefore, I request the Minister to have another look at this matter and see if he can devise some means of achieving that.</P>

      <P>A great deal has been said in a very short time on this Supplementary Estimate.  Not all of it was necessarily relevant but, nevertheless, it was interesting to listen to, if not amusing in some cases.  I am sure, however, that some of those parts of it that were amusing were not intended to be.  Deputy Clinton kicked off.  He did not kick for touch early on but he did later.  I want to run through the things he said without going into them in any great detail, as this is not usually done in a Supplementary Estimate debate.  Some things were brought in which require comment. <Col N="830" /> He talked about the wage gap. By some peculiar reasoning, which probably seemed quite reasonable to him, he told us there is a gap now of £5 between the amount earned by those working on the land and those working elsewhere, that this was a higher gap than statistics show but that the statistics are unfair to his way of viewing things because they contained a high quantity of female labour in the comparative figures.  I want to say I do not agree either with that figure or the figure the Deputy says is wrong.  Neither do I agree with the figures about the number of people getting so much or less than so much in agriculture at present because they are not right either.</P>

But the Statistics Office figure which I would publish without comment is the latest Population Census figure that 101,000 people are returned as land owners who do not earn their livelihood mainly or solely from agriculture. I would suggest to those who want to do a little exercise that they should put those two figures together and try to get an answer out of them.</P>

    <P>The NAC was brought up here, as one would expect.  I would like to congratulate Deputy Clinton and others on their acceptance of the general idea of the usefulness of a National Agricultural Council, representative of all the various sectors of agriculture, with which the Minister for Agriculture and the Government may consult and get the best possible advice before making a decision on any aspect of agricultural policy.  What I do not like is the carping criticism of what may or may not be done by way of its composition.  This sort of criticism at this time, while it may be well meant &mdash; although I doubt it &mdash; is not <Col N="831" /> conducive to getting the sort of council the Opposition give us to believe they would like to see set up.</P>

      <P>I accept it in the spirit in which it is offered, despite the evidence otherwise.  The NAC has been mentioned.  Deputy Clinton is such a great advocate of this body that about a week or a fortnight after I had first mentioned it, he asked a question as to what I was doing and why I had not already set it up.  He suggested to quite a responsible body that they should set it up and push the Minister into it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first request here today was that the Council should be set up.  There is nothing to prevent it being set up for some months past except one thing.  It was also requested that it should be independent, that it should have a secretariat, research officers, statisticians and various personnel so that it could be completely clear of the influence of the Minister for Agriculture and, by this fact alone, ensure that its findings would be independent and worthwhile.  I wonder if the Deputy or other Members of the House realise what they are talking about when making these generalisations. <Col N="833" /> Statisticians and research officers of the calibre useful to the Government, the Department of Agriculture and the farming community or to any organisations that may be represented on the NAC, are not easily come by. We have no surplus of them; we cannot give so many here and there.  The whole problem is, with the limited numbers we have of these very valuable people, to spread their usefulness and divide their services among various bodies who really want that service.</P>
      <P>It may not be possible to find a new secretariat or a new research group that can be given to this new organisation, or any other new organisation, because these people are not plentiful and are hard to come by, and we must use them for other purposes also, regardless of how this or any other organisation gets its information.  If they get it from really efficient and qualified people of high standard, regardless of whose employment they may be in at the time, surely the value of their advice and knowledge is not diminished if they are not tied hand and foot to the organisation requiring the information?  Is this not an implication that these people are not to be trusted, that they must be owned by somebody in order to get the answers wanted rather than answers based on knowledge and experience? We should keep this in mind when we talk of independent people.</P>

People of the calibre we have in mind and who are as useful to us as these people would be cannot be depended on to be honest in their reports, it is suggested, unless they are completely free and cut off and apart from the influence the Minister might have.

It is my intention that the NAC should come into existence in the very near future and that I shall have the benefit of the advice of that Council at a very early date.  It is necessary to have that sort of contact with the farming community and agricultural industry as a whole.  It has been no pleasure to me that for all the time I have been in the Department, I have been bereft of that sort of contact with the farmers and have not had the advice of bodies such as those I have already invited to become members of the Council.  In my opinion, that would be remedied in this body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefaced my remarks last night by saying that I completely agreed with Deputy M. O'Leary when he talked about a practical rather than a sentimental approach to this Bill such as Deputy Ryan indulged in.  This is a real problem and, as I said last night, the Labour Party have perhaps done a service in bringing the problem forward. Nevertheless, the terms of this Bill are such as to make me ask questions, some of which I asked before we adjourned last night.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary made a good point when speaking about the situation in other countries on the Continent.  I have not had an opportunity of studying that situation, nor have I the information available.  However, I seem to remember that in regard to England this type of legislation was post-war legislation in relation to people disabled during the war in the service of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not quite the type of legislation we would require in this connection. The problem is fundamentally different from that in England where they had a number of service men who, <Col N="837" /> prior to the war, had been fit and thoroughly employable and who were thrown on the community at the end of the war physically disabled in some form or another.  That disablement had a particular claim on the community.  That disablement was not, so to speak, an act of God.  It was a direct result of the service which these people had given to the community, and the community felt that even balances would have to be disturbed in order to cater for such people.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the type of disability involved was of a more limited type than that anticipated in this Bill.  For instance, Section 1, the definition section, includes congenital deformity and also seems to include mental incapacity.  It reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  In this Act the expression &ldquo;disabled person&rdquo; means a person who, on account of injury, disease or congenital deformity, is substantially handicapped in obtaining or keeping employment, or in undertaking work on his own account, of a kind which apart from that injury, disease or deformity would be suited to his age, experience and qualifications; and the expression &ldquo;disablement&rdquo;, in relation to any person, shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of the definitions contained in the preceding subsection, the expression &ldquo;disease&rdquo; shall be construed as including a physical or mental condition arising from imperfect development of any organ.</P>
    <P>A further difference arises here.  In the case of war disablement, there had been an anterior position where there was complete ability.  One has to be careful in introducing legislation on the same pattern for one case as for the other.  I instanced last night the difficulty where, say, a person is to be employed in circumstances where he may be a danger to the other people in the same employment.  I know the answer to this is that there would be a segregation or a classification, but even if there were, there still would be &mdash; and this is a particular point for the Labour Party &mdash; the question as to <Col N="838" /> whether able-bodied people working in these circumstances would be prepared to take the risk that might be involved.  If we are going to arrange statutorily that people in a certain category are to get a certain type of employment, percentage-wise or otherwise, this seems to me to be taking the first step towards the regimentation of all labour in industry.  The Labour Party should consider that point.  It is a short cry from saying that such-and-such of a particular class will be employed in a particular place to saying to the worker: &ldquo;You must go to a certain place to work.  That is the job you must take and no other&rdquo;. I do not think these difficulties are insuperable; recasting can possibly deal with a number of these points.  However, we must ask ourselves at the outset in regard to legislation like this: where are we going?</P>
    <P>The main point to be made in this connection is that if we are going to embark on this type of legislation, legislation that will direct the individual employer as to whom he is to take, direct the worker where he is to go, then we should not do it piecemeal. We should look at the overall structure of labour disposal.  That is a most important point and a fundamental reason for my speaking on a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <P>Coming to the details of the sections, I still find it very difficult to see how sections 6 and 7 can be operated.  Last night I asked whether one would not have at the outset to classify people by their type of disablement.  That, of course, may be intended in the register but, if we have to classify people by their type of disablement, it seems to me that will raise difficulties in two directions.  Assume, for a moment, that there are telephone exchanges in which blind operators can operate, exchanges which are not wholly automatic.  How will you work that?  First of all, the question is how many opportunities are there for employing blind persons? Telephone exchanges may provide opportunities but frankly I cannot think of many other opportunities. There are types of quality work, such as basketmaking and so forth, which blind operatives do, but the scope is <Col N="839" /> rather limited.  So is the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The question then is will you reserve certain employments for the disabled or will you say that there must be a proportion reserved for them?  The position will be that a certain percentage will be employed and the rest will be as unemployable as before.  The thing becomes a mockery.  Perhaps it is better that some should win prizes but, in the net, will it work any better than any other approach?  I am rather vague about another approach because I have not thought this out.  There were people here who were blinded in unfortunate accidents.  They were successfully employed. If one analyses the entire situation, would the position be better as things are at the moment or is it worse than what might happen under this proposal?  We have no idea what percentages the Minister might lay down. It is left to the Minister to compile a register and lay down percentages. What percentages could be laid down? I do not know.  These questions have to be asked and these questions must be answered before we legislate.</P>
    <P>The next point is the position in workshops.  Take people who are suffering from some disability who are employed where lathes and other machinery are being used.  What percentage could safely be employed in those circumstances and how can one ensure there will be no risk to other workers?  How can one ensure that other workers will find this acceptable? There is a really big problem here and I frankly do not know what the answer is.  I agree that the State service is probably the best place in which to make a start.  It is large and representative, particularly so if one takes the State-sponsored companies and undertakings. There one has a broad area over which to work and I suggest the experiment might be tried out first in that limited area.  It is, after all, more directly the community; but even there I am at somewhat of a loss to see how these provisions can be made effective.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Labour Party to have more research done and to have consultations with the Department before we accept this Bill as it stands. Sympathetic as we may be to the principle <Col N="840" /> involved here, this Bill does not seem to give us a basis on which one could make amendments in Committee. It does not lend itself to Committee amendments which would make it workable.  Any attempt of that kind would lead to a mass of detail which would have to be grafted on.  Where that exercise would get us I do not know.</P>
    <P>Nobody has referred to the point of view of the employer.  There is difficulty in the private sector nowadays in securing a proper balance in employment. Sometimes there is a scarcity of employment and sometimes there is a surplus.  The difficulty is that the acceptance of a proposal of this nature is bound to upset the balance.  Compulsorily installing certain people in particular employments would deprive an industry of the elasticity which is so essential.</P>
    <P>One can, I suppose, afford a certain amount of inefficiency in big State undertakings.  There is plenty of inefficiency in some Departments.  Perhaps a little more would still be tolerable. Any rigid arrangement would be bound to lead to inefficiency in the private sector and that would be very hard to carry.  Initially, the experiment, if there is to be an experiment, should be restricted to those areas which are large enough to carry such an experiment. The State complex would be ideal.</P>
    <P>Lastly, no matter from what angle one looks at it, opportunities will be limited.  The Garda Síochána and the Army were mentioned.  Let us not forget that essentially members of both these organisations must be able-bodied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know which Deputy it was.  There may be certain clerical jobs.  Deputy Dunne would, I am sure, object if I wanted to limit his Bill to clerical work.  I think he would.  This is not aimed merely at clerical work.  In fact, where clerical work is concerned, it is possible that the penalty of disability is less for those who are able to do clerical work than <Col N="841" /> for people in other categories.  It is the people in the other categories who cause the difficulty.  One thing about the Bill is that there are so many questions of this sort when one comes down to details.  Admirable as the intention and purpose of the Bill is, and suggestive as the sections are in many respects, I would say to Deputy Dunne that it would be premature to take this Bill as it stands.  This is a problem that might be pursued by the Labour Party, who sponsored the Bill, and who feel so strongly about the matter, in further detail.</P>
      <P>I should like them to have regard to some of the points I mentioned. My remarks were specifically directed to the Labour Party who took the trouble to go into this matter in some detail.  It is quite possible that within a broader framework, not in a Bill specifically for this purpose, but a Bill dealing with other matters as well, the matter could be allowed for, if not solved.  That is about as far as one can go on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne introduced this Bill because down through the years nobody seemed to <Col N="844" /> worry very much about the people referred to in the Bill.  We have in the country many people who in one way or another are disabled.  Those who are only slightly disabled very often find it impossible to get any kind of work, not to talk about work that would enable them to sustain themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>I had experience some time ago of talking to a person who had been involved in an accident.  The accident was of the type for which there was no compensation forthcoming.  The unfortunate person recovered reasonably well because of modern medicine but he was unable to return to the job which he had held before the accident.  When I asked him how he was getting on, he said: &ldquo;Very well.  Between prayer and the assistance of the expert medical people who dealt with me, I am as good as I can be, but the one thing which is worrying me is that I cannot get a job.  I would hate to be useless for the rest of my life.  Other people who may not be as gifted in many ways are working but I cannot get a job&rdquo;. I said that surely there were a number of organisations through which he could be rehabilitated and eventually be re-employed.  He said: &ldquo;The unfortunate thing about those organisations is that they seem to have a long waiting list and they do not seem to be able to find room for somebody who has just come on to the field&rdquo;. I checked on this and I found that while there are quite a number of voluntary organisations with really dedicated people doing their level best to beg or borrow the money which they need to carry on their excellent work, it is only a grain of sand on the seashore compared with all the people who require some type of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart entirely from those who meet with an accident, apart from those who through no fault of their own fall into bad health and are unable to continue with the job they had and have to seek another job, there are those who are never able to work because they have no special training and who do not appear to have very much future in store for them.  It is a terrible thing to <Col N="845" /> go into the house of a family in which there is somebody in that category and who is sitting around the house all day. Even when some of these people do get a little training, the employers have a suspicion that they are not as good as they should be, and they do not want to employ them.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of people coming to me as their parliamentary representative and pointing out that even those who were trained &mdash; girls have been trained as shorthand typists or as book-keepers &mdash; and could do an excellent job, could not get a job because they were not the same as a normal person.  There is no use in saying that employers will go out on the streets and look for them.  We want to give a chance to deformed people and people who are not in full possession of their faculties.  We want to give these people a chance, and we want them to get a reasonable rate of wages. Usually we find that if these people are employed, they are paid less than other people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne's Bill specifically sets out that if these people are employed in any job, they must be paid the rate for the job.  We have the name of being a Christian country.  A clergyman said to me recently that Ireland was a great Catholic country but he added: &ldquo;Is it not a pity that there are not more Christians in it?&rdquo; Our outlook on things like this is not what it should be.  It does not seem to matter to most people that in their own neighbourhood there are people who have not got very much of this world's goods, people who through no fault of their own are left short of food, clothing and the normal comforts of life.  The fact that there are people who cannot get a job because there is something wrong with their health seems to be accepted.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy de Valera yesterday evening and again this evening saying this was the wrong way to tackle the job.  He did not tell us what he considers to be the right way to tackle it. In view of some of the comments made by the Government Party spokesmen, I feel sure the Government intend to dump this Bill.  I have no doubt that it will be after Easter that this will be <Col N="846" /> done.  Whether I am right or wrong, if the Government will not allow this Bill to be passed, the onus is on the Minister to say what he thinks should be done.  It is not enough to say they do not think this is the right approach. It is not enough to say that there are too many loopholes in the Bill.  Of course, there may be loopholes in the Bill, and things which would not operate in the way in which we would hope they would, but this is an attempt to give a new deal to the people referred to in the Bill, an attempt to give them a status which they have not got.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced, Deputy Ryan referred to the fact that in this country we employ a smaller percentage of disabled persons than any other country in Western Europe. He made what I consider to be a very good point when he said that we have not got the high percentage of disabled people who can be found in other countries which were ravaged by wars.  But we still cannot make provision even for the relatively small number of such people in this country.</P>
    <P>I made some inquiries from my own local authority a few weeks ago.  I wanted them to tell me the number of what are known as permanently disabled persons in the county, the number of those who had been trained or offered training over a period of years.  Of course, I was told that there were a number of people who if offered training would not take it.  Eventually I got the answer.  I was told that over a period of five years about 60 people had been trained or sent for training and that eight of those had obtained employment subsequent to that training.  If it is not possible under the existing regulations to get employment for those who have got some little training, what hope is there for those who have received no training.</P>
    <P>When he was concluding, Deputy de Valera said to Deputy Dunne that if everyone who was not in the clerical class was excluded from the Bill, he was sure Deputy Dunne would not approve of the Bill.  Deputy Dunne said that of course that was so. The plain fact is that Deputy de <Col N="847" /> Valera was saying that the people who are generally referred to as the labouring class would be more difficult to deal with under a Bill of this sort than anyone else.  Of course, unfortunately, that is only too true, because whether we like it or not, the heavy work in this country is done by the lowest paid people, by those who are referred to generally as being in the labouring class.  Their work is hard and backbreaking.  Deputy de Valera was trying to put across the idea &mdash; and he was right &mdash; that it would be extremely difficult to find a job which a man or woman &mdash; and particularly a man &mdash; not in full possession of his faculties would be able to carry out.  This of course is a special problem.  It is a big problem.  If the situation is so serious, as we believe it is, what do the Government think should be done about it?  Do they believe that giving what has become generally known as a DPA &mdash; a disabled person's allowance &mdash; which can range from 10/- a week to £2 7 6 is a better way to deal with this problem?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that a person who has less than 156 insurance stamps on his card for one reason or another &mdash; either because he is selfemployed or because he is young, and was unable to have that number of stamps before he became ill or was injured &mdash; can draw social welfare benefits for 52 weeks, and at the end of 52 weeks, is left in a position in which he must go on home assistance, or depend on his relatives, or if he is lucky, get DPA?</P>
    <P>I have in my constituency &mdash; and I am sure that other Deputies if they go to the trouble of checking will find in their constituencies &mdash; people who worked hard all their lives but because of the fact that they have not got the minimum requirement of stamps now find themselves in absolute poverty. There is no use in asking why they did not stamp their cards for a longer period.  As I said, age might have precluded them, or they might have been self-employed.  It is too bad that those people &mdash; proud people, people who were very independent and who gloried in the fact that they could earn their <Col N="848" /> own living without reference to anyone else &mdash; have to come to a public representative and say: &ldquo;I am sorry to bother you, but myself and my family are hungry. Is there anything you can do about it?&rdquo; This does not really strike home to the ordinary people of the country until such time as a situation like that arises.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies may, from time to time, contact these people.  I also know that, like everybody else, they feel that these are things which cannot happen to them or to any member of their family: they happen to other people.  Some people have children who are unable to get employment. Some people have brothers or sisters who get injured or become ill and are unable to continue work.  I think that if Deputies just stop to think, they will realise that, in this life, what happens to somebody else can happen to anybody.  They will realise that it is only a matter of God's providence that it does not happen to themselves or to some member of their family.  If it did, I am quite sure they would have a different outlook on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is all right to be smug about this. It is all right to say, in effect: &ldquo;Oh, it is not necessary to have this Bill which was introduced by Deputy Seán Dunne: it does not do what is required or what the Labour Party would require. We will do it the other way.&rdquo; What has been done about it so far? Since its formation, the State has not done anything about it.  In my opinion, the year 2,000 will come in and the State will not have done anything about this matter unless it is forcibly brought to their notice, as in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are far too anxious to try to pass off our responsibility on somebody else and to say: &ldquo;Oh, it will turn out all right.  If we do not look at it, it is bound to be all right.  Nobody need worry.&rdquo;  I am quite sure that, even in this city, the State itself and many semi-State bodies could help considerably in this problem.  I believe there must be literally hundreds, even thousands, of jobs which can be done by those who are partially disabled, by those who are not able to do hard manual work, and so on, but who can <Col N="849" /> in fact do certain types of work.  From time to time, those of us who go abroad, particularly to Britain, note that it is quite common to find somebody working in a factory sitting at a machine in a wheelchair.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy de Valera talk about the jobs which the blind could not do.  Of course the blind should not be put operating machines where their hands could get caught. Of course the blind should not be asked to climb ladders.  Of course the lame should not be asked to go up ladders or to jump across holes in the ground or something like that.  We all know that.  Let us look for the jobs they can do rather than dwell on the jobs they cannot do.  There are many jobs they can do and do well and conscientiously. The blind telephonists who have been trained are able to carry out their jobs conscientiously and efficiently as anybody who takes the trouble to find out will discover.  If they get to know the way the exchange works, they are as good as any type of person who can see.  In many factories in Britain, we can find machinists who are not alone partially disabled but some of whom are gravely disabled.  They are doing their job and doing it well and they are being paid a decent rate for it.</P>
    <P>I know that part of our trouble here is the fact that we have not got full employment.  We are interested in finding work for people who are fully able to work and because we are not able to do that, we have a tendency to try to brush off those for whom we can excuse ourselves for not trying to find employment.  That seems to be the general idea.  If we have to wait until we have full employment, or until something like this is done, then people have not very much to look forward to.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Seán Dunne that it would be no great harm that very many firms in this city who could employ a proportion of disabled people and who could thereby set a headline to solve this problem should do so.  It is true that a small number of people with a Christian outlook have in fact given employment to disabled persons, in and around the city <Col N="850" /> particularly, but it is also true that there are many others who could do likewise but will not do so unless there is compulsion.  That is why I am opposed to the idea put forward by Deputy Kitt and Deputy Gibbons that they are opposed to compulsion. If we do not have compulsion, how do we do it?  There is no use in appealing to their better natures.  Somebody recently said that some of them have not got any.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing which rather puzzles me, that is, that, while we have these voluntary organisations which do such excellent work, there is a tendency among some of the people who run the organisations to, shall I say, fight shy of legislation for the purpose of remedying their problems.  This is their hobby.  This is their aim in life &mdash; to look after the disabled &mdash; and, in their minds, nobody else &mdash; most certainly not the State &mdash; should come in.  I know that people with the very best of intentions do tend to feel, when somebody else suggests helping out on something they are doing, that they are in fact trespassing on what they would themselves feel to be their particular field.  It is rather a pity that this is so.  I do not mean any disrespect to them when I draw the attention of the Minister to it but I think that fact must be drawn to his attention.  I am sure that some of these people have said in effect: &ldquo;We feel we are doing all right: we feel we are the people to do this: we do not want State intervention: we do not want compulsion.&rdquo; Might I point out that they are not the disabled people?  They are not the people dependent on it.</P>
    <P>The big point about this is that I honestly believe &mdash; and we in the Labour Party believe &mdash; that this is something which the disabled person should have by right, not by charity.  It is one of these things which people in every country should have as of right, particularly in this country where so many people resent charity, even those who have to accept help.  They resent the fact that it is a type of charity.  Independent-minded people get it very hard to accept something which is given to them because people feel sorry for them, because it is given out of charity. <Col N="851" /> They feel it in some way lowers their dignity.  We know it must be done as things are at present.  We know the organisations are doing a really excellent job.</P>
    <P>I would ask those who feel that the State should not interfere to think again, to think of the people they are trying to help and to think of the many thousands in the country whom nobody so far has bothered to help and whom nobody has considered it their job to help.  If they do that, then I am quite sure they will welcome a Bill of this kind.  We were perhaps optimistic enough to feel that if the Minister was not prepared to accept the Bill as it at present stands, he might say he agrees with the principle of the Bill and that he would prefer if the Government would ask to have it withdrawn on the understanding that they would submit a measure which would cover the points which we are attempting to cover.  That is why I was so anxious that the Minister should make his point of view known to the House. The fact that he has not done so, so far, would lead me to believe that, much as we dislike it, the Government intend to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is just too bad if they do because it is hitting back right in the face of those unfortunate people who when the Bill was first published had got the idea that, at last, somebody was trying to do something concrete for them, at last Parliament would give them a status to which they felt they were entitled.</P>
    <P>Now it appears from the Minister's silence that that is not the situation. It appears that he feels it is quite sufficient to let the voluntary organisations deal with those whom they are aware of, give them whatever assistance they can and that those who have nobody to look after them can just do without any assistance.  It is too bad because I felt the Minister was a reasonable sort of person who would appreciate this problem.  From his profession I am sure that in the past he has met many of these people and as a politician he, like all of us, must have come in contact with many more than he realised <Col N="852" /> existed.  I would have thought that the Minister would be only too glad to give whatever help he could.  However, it does appear that here again we have misjudged, here again we have expected too much of the Government. We felt that it was reasonable that they should be as interested as we are in dealing with the really underprivileged, as Deputy Dunne said, the people who have no privileges. We felt that these people would be entitled to get some hope.  But, it now appears as if the old order will prevail, that they can muddle along any way they like and that those who have not got any hope or any help or who will not be able to be trained or to find employment themselves will have either to accept home assistance or the disabled person's allowance and for the rest of their lives live in semi-starvation and the type of misery in which many of them, unfortunately, have had to live.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne sets out in his Bill to describe disabled persons. That is a very difficult thing to do but he made a good attempt at it, and I congratulate him on it.  I also congratulate him on the interest he shows in the disabled persons.  I know his motives are of the best.  Our concern is with the best way to help disabled persons, blind persons, epileptics and others handicapped in one way or another who are unable to work for themselves or to take their rightful place in the community.  Deputy Dunne has made a good job of defining disabled persons.  I do not think it has been done as well anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not look at British or Russian or any other Acts.  Deputy Dunne says that the expression &ldquo;disabled person&rdquo; means a person who, on account of injury or disease, is sufficiently handicapped so that he cannot obtain employment.  We have always, to the best of our ability, endeavoured to help that kind of person who, according to Deputy Dunne's definition, are unable to provide for <Col N="858" /> themselves.  We believe that by retraining these people, by rehabilitating them with a view to making them suitable in some capacity, they, because of the aptitudes and skills which they succeed in obtaining, will be able to take their place in society and make their proper contribution to the community.  That is the basic difference.</P>

What about jobs which do not need re-training, such as the many hundreds of jobs in the Civil Service and the semi-State bodies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he can be forced into a job and an employer can be compelled to take him, although he is not able to do anything.  Would it not be better for an employer to get some person who would be suitable for him by virtue of the training or re-training he has received, a person <Col N="859" /> who has acquired the skills and aptitudes I mentioned and who will be able to play a more important part in community life?  He will no longer be an object of pity.  Mar a deireann Seán Ó Duinn, ní bheidis in a ndíl truaigh.  An dtuigeann tú é sin?</P>

      <P>A training authority has been established.  They have been given powers to engage in this work. They had not to be prodded by the Labour Party or urged by men like Deputy Dunne to go ahead with it. It is the intention of the Government to co-operate with the various organisations criticised by Deputy Tully.  It is the intention of the Government to see that these voluntary organisations expand and develop and that existing training methods are developed in full. I know of two young men in my own locality who became blind and were <Col N="860" /> re-trained by one of these voluntary organisations.  One has been employed in Galway County Council and the other in the Board of Works, both as telephonists.  I do not believe you would find in any office telephonists as efficient and as courteous as the two young men I have in mind.  They are getting the same rate of pay as those who have the faculty of seeing and are also employed as telephonists.</P>
      <P>The correct way is to have these young men and women trained, making them so skilful that the local authorities and Government Departments want to take them on and give them the same pay as those who have no disability. That is the basic difference between our outlook on the matter and that of the Labour Party, as evidenced by the speeches heard here tonight, the night before and the night before again. We were told there are prejudiced employers in this country.  I feel sure there are prejudiced employers, those who do not want to take on disabled persons because they think they will be taking them on as charity and carrying them.  If the disabled persons are properly trained there will be no great problem in placing them.  There is a scheme afoot to have placement services expanded, not through compulsory methods but by making the skills and aptitudes of these people so attractive to employers that they will be taken on.  In the voluntary organisations to which I have referred there are many men and women who have known of these problems for years.  They know the outlets available, the jobs for which disabled men and women can be trained.  The Government themselves, through the Department of Labour, are taking an active interest in these outlets. They are continually searching for them.  They have not to be prodded by the Labour Party into doing this work,</P>

      <P>We do not want to get employers to take on workers against their will because at the first opportunity they would fire these disabled workers.  In Britain, we had an example of compulsory methods, of forcing employers to take on these people, but I do not think that even Deputy Dunne would claim that these methods were successful.  The British, from whom the Deputy got his definition, as he told me some time ago when I congratulated him, not knowing it was in the British Act, introduced a Bill to compel employers to take on disabled persons.  Deputy Ryan said that in Britain as a result <Col N="862" /> of war &mdash; the same applies to Germany &mdash; there was a big number of disabled persons.  Many of them were servicemen who had fought for their country and it was the duty of their respective Governments to do something for these men and women who became disabled as a result of services to their country. We had no such problem here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The British Act was not outstandingly successful.  It concentrated on taking disabled persons which it was felt the country had a duty to employ.  The training schemes were very hurried affairs and the result was reflected in the type of employment the men and women got and the length for which they held down that employment.</P>
      <P>We believe voluntary placement is a far better method of dealing with the disabled and that we should work along those lines, the lines of training and voluntary placement, and that employers will then take full advantage of the skills and services of workers so trained.  We think that will give a better return than the British Act which was praised implicitly by some speakers here.</P>

      <P>Whatever defects one may see in the Bill, I think there is no doubt about the sincerity of the mover of the Bill.  He has brought to light a certain lack in our scheme of things and, at the same time, has been very critical of what is being done by people engaged in this work already. The only opposition that has come from this side of the House is to the element of compulsion in the Bill, that an employer is to be compelled to employ a handicapped person.  This is the very point on which, if we must reject the Bill, it must be rejected.  Can one imagine the feelings of a handicapped person forced into a job against the wishes of the employer and, human <Col N="863" /> nature being what it is, against the wishes of some of his fellow workers?</P>
      <P>This country is too poor to forgo the services of all its people, handicapped or not.  Therefore, our plan must be to train these people to play their part in our society.  They cannot do that unless they are trained to the greatest degree possible to overcome their physical disability.  We should not be as harsh as people on the opposite benches were on some of the institutions and organisations at present training people to take part in the economic life of the country.  Perhaps one way of encouraging employers to take on disabled persons would be to pay a capitation grant for each disabled person employed.  If the State would pay a grant to the employer, I think we would have no trouble in overcoming employers' opposition to employing such people.</P>
      <P>I want to mention an organisation with which I have some slight connection, the Polio Fellowship.  Thank God, polio is disappearing and in the next decade or so it is hoped it will disappear completely.  Meantime, the Polio Fellowship, with headquarters in the city, has done tremendous work for polio victims.  It has trained many of them so that they can lead a full life in the community.  They are so well trained that they can vie with normal persons in commercial and industrial life.  That is a tribute to their training.  That shows we must first train these people before forcing any employer to take them.  An employer is in business to make money and if he finds a handicapped person can give a return for his money, he will employ him, but it would be almost cruel to suggest that we should force people into industry, not because of their ability but because of their disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another organisation known as the Rehabilitation Institution which is doing tremendous work to rehabilitate and train people and give them confidence to enter commercial and industrial life.  There is much that each of us can do.  I serve on a voluntary hospital board where we try to <Col N="864" /> employ all blind telephonists.  This can be done in certain places but the operators must be trained.  Some years ago the corporation decided, as a gesture to the disabled, to give blind people special consideration in house allocation, but while the members were unanimous in this view, all we could get finally was a motion that all things being equal, blind persons should get preference for houses.  That is a very small gesture in the face of the terrible affliction of blindness.  We do not think as much about this problem as we should, or do as much as we should. We must first have a panel such as is mentioned in section 10 of the Bill to examine the capabilities of the person seeking employment and then find out what industries or commercial posts are most suitable for him.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the NAC, I did not mention the other matter that was raised, somewhat related to it, that is, membership of the NIEC.  Membership of the NIEC is a matter which has yet to be arranged. What I can tell the House is that agriculture will be represented in the future on the NIEC.  Whether it remains the NIEC or what I cannot tell Deputies, but it will be the same body with agricultural interests added to it.  How many representatives of farming interests will ultimately be accommodated within the overall NIEC I do not know.  This has not yet been arranged, but as soon as it is I shall tell the House what will be the additional membership in order to accommodate the agricultural members.  The main thing is that agriculture will be brought into the NIEC, and that in the near future.</P>
      <P>The drop in pig numbers has been mentioned by a number of speakers. It is pretty well accepted that this is a drop which has taken place in many other European countries and that has taken place here time and again.  There does not appear as yet to have been found any real answer to this cycle of up and down in numbers of pigs, either in this country or in any other of the west European countries.  At the moment we are in a valley period in regard to pig numbers.  The indications are that a slight upturn can be expected but not quite as big an upturn as the indicators would imply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are studyng at the moment what can be done ultimately to sort out this rather difficult problem, but it does not seem to be related only to the price of pigs or the price of feed in relation to the price of pigs or the price of bacon relative to the price of pigs, relative to the price of feed. If it is not these factors, then our <Col N="866" /> problem is to find what are the factors. As I say, we are not alone in not having found the cause of this recurring problem, but this is not in any way taking from our enthusiasm in pursuing the problem in order to try to find a solution to it.</P>
    <P>The questions of meat marketing and cattle sales have come up here in a big way, not for the first time but what I rather liked to hear today, between questions and the contributions made on this Supplementary Estimate, was the two approaches: one suggesting meat marketing standing alone, as it were, and implying trading in the full sense, and the other suggesting sales promotion which, I take it, would be rather less than the overall meat marketing arrangements that the others had been talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy knows, but that is neither here nor there.  This market for our meat and cattle is, as everybody will admit, the most important sector of our economy and the most important element of our export trade.  Any change we make in regard to sales of cattle and meat must be treated with the utmost caution.  Before we make any change we must be sure that the new system of organisation will do a better job than is being done at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to an overall trading organisation for cattle and meat, I would say for the benefit of the House, which seems anxious to know what I think about this, that I do not agree that it has been proven that any new organisation could, without endangering our present situation, take over from our present system even though <Col N="867" /> it may have defects.  What I am trying to get across is that a full trading board for cattle and meat has yet to be proven to be a better thing for the future than what we now have. Therefore, in so far as I shall be making a recommendation to the Government, I shall be recommending against any board that would take over the sales of our cattle and meat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to promotion, with the demands that are being made and the advocacy of some sort of board rather undefined by many people and, having looked at the situation, I have come to the conclusion that what is required is a sales promotion board, probably not just for meat but for livestock, not just cattle but sheep and lambs as well.  What I have in mind is an organisation for meat, cattle and sheep which would be to the agricultural arm of our economy what CTT is to the industrial arm.  Something roughly on those lines is what I have in mind, but without being tied to definition and details with which I could not be expected to deal unless and until the Government agree to such an organisation, this would be the line on which I believe some usefulness could be got from a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree it would be very hard to measure the performance of such a board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude is that unless you have these things it is purely a hypothetical exercise to try to measure their worth.  If we are to take it from there I am afraid the answer would be that since we cannot determine its value before we try it, there is no point in trying it.  What I am saying is what I would be prepared to recommend to the Government for acceptance is an organisation for agricultural produce which would bear an analogy to CTT which caters for industrial produce.  If it comes into being and proves itself, then we can see by stages whether or not a trading board <Col N="868" /> would be to our advantage, and then steps towards that could ultimately be taken.  I am not at all hopeful that this will be proved but I am prepared to go as far as I have said to consider sales promotion, giving assistance to existing sellers of our produce, existing shippers and existing exporters to go into new fields and try to find new markets and, generally, to lay things on for them through our own trade representatives and our Embassies abroad in order to make it easier for them to get into such new fields, to probe them and find out what they are worth right on the spot.  That is what I believe the role of such a board should be and, so far as that goes, it is a line on which I would be prepared to make a start.  It might be the only thing we would ever do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not even say that.  It might prove not to be as good as nothing but, at least, if we try, we can find out.  If it is a failure we will know it is not the right way.  If it is a success, or a near success, we will have gained something, and it may be that from our experience we will find even better ways than any of us have thought of so far.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton talked about our efficient meat industry, but he also alleged that there seemed to be dumping on the British market.  Now he cannot have it both ways.  If they are as efficient as the Deputy says then dumping cannot possibly be the end product of efficiency.  I will give the Deputy one but not both.</P>
      <P>There has been talk of promises made and debts unpaid by my predecessor. Big play has been made of the £10 million increase and the £5 to £7 a head increase in cattle; it is alleged that it was said that this would be the result of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Maybe I am innocent but my recollection &mdash; I am not depending on quotations either in or out of context &mdash; of that matter is that it was claimed that the Free Trade Area Agreement would be worth in a 12 month period anything up to £10 million to us.</P>

We have really only been operating it for the past nine months.  It has not been running so very long.

      <P>The Deputy has not learned any lessons from it.  We have got this abuse which comes with hindsight and our great agriculturalists in this House on the Opposition benches say that our difficulties are related to the calved heifer scheme.  I have not taken the trouble to go into the records of the time that this scheme was introduced but I am quite sure that there is far more criticism being expressed now by these learned agriculturalists, with the hindsight they have now got, compared with what they could have said but did not say at the time the scheme was being introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that only three years ago, approximately, the scheme was embarked upon to push the total cow herd up from about 1,300,000 to approximately 1,700,000 in order to give us an export figure of approximately 1,500,000 head of cattle per year.  This seemed to be a very laudable thing to do particularly at a time when cattle prices were good and the general outlook for cattle sales was good and continued to be good until a very short time ago.  This scheme operated to bring up the cow herd to <Col N="875" /> around 1.6 million and it is possible that it may go to the 1.7 million.  Let me say that it is not true, as has been asserted by Deputy Dillon and others, that we have undone the work of 40 years in the Department of Agriculture, in the last two years.  Deputy Dillon said it took us 40 years to eliminate scrub bulls and that in the past two years we have introduced scrub heifers. All I can say is that if we had eradicated scrub bulls, there would be no scrub heifers.  This is a true situation.</P>
      <P>We have not yet eradicated the scrub bulls and despite Deputy Dillon's claim about his own participation in this when he was Minister for Agriculture, I am sorry to disappoint him and I can tell him that my belief is we have far too many scrub bulls still.  We are taking the steps which I hope will eradicate if possible, or trim down to a very small number, the unsuitable scrub bulls which are all too numerous today.  It is not right to say that the calved heifer scheme has been a failure, that it has been the cause of all our difficulties and that we should never have introduced it.  Hindsight is a great thing and the people in Fine Gael seem to have an abundance of it in this regard.  I do not agree with them.</P>

      <P>The advertisement was well worth the money it cost.  This money is being used to offset the excess on other items.  We heard a bit about the delays on the land project. I must say I agree with these complaints about delays because they are far too long and they are not conducive to getting farmers to avail of the scheme.  It is a very good scheme.  If there are delays of five, six or ten months it is not desirable, because when a farmer decides he wants to drain a field he has the following season in mind. He wants to apply, to get approval, to get the job done, to get paid for it, and to get on with his business. That is not possible in many cases.  We are trying to take the steps open to us to remedy this situation and to reduce the delays between the date of application and the initial inspection and preparation of the scheme.  We hope to make progress in that direction.</P>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with those who complain about the inspectors being rather sticky about passing work unless it was approved before it started, because if the work is up to standard, as is often the case, even though it was commenced before it was cleared, I do not see why we should stand on ceremony and say we cannot pay because we did not approve the job before a spade was put in the ground or a machine was operated.  I hope to see if there are any outstanding cases of that nature which have been dealt with in that manner in the past, and where it can be shown that a good job was done even though it did not meet the procedural arrangements in existence at the time and I hope we can be flexible within reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few Deputies expressed their dissatisfaction with the system of grading pigs in factories.  This is a matter on which I already have quite a bit of information.  I have talked to the interests <Col N="877" /> concerned on the curing side and in the Pigs and Bacon Commission. This may well be one of the features which are not giving satisfaction to the producers, but which are capable of being eliminated.  We must remember, however, that the grading of pigs is for the purpose of providing good bacon for the export trade.  This is bacon of a very high standard.  Even though grading may be irksome from the point of view of the producer it is necessary to ensure that what we are sending out is a first class product that can compete with the best coming from any producing nation in the world.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Esmonde who was opposed to the export of live cattle as stores or fats.  He suggested they should be killed at home and exported as carcase meat.  This could not be done over-night and even if it were capable of being done a very valuable store trade has existed for some time with England.  Dead meat would be very little compensation for people who want stores.  We would want to have an absolute surplus and we would be very foolish to jettison in any way our store trade and convert it to killing at home and sending out carcase beef. Our store trade is a very valuable trade indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the fact that there might well be difficulties at the back end of this year.  I have already said in many places outside the House that difficulties could arise at the back end of this year.  This could be brought about by the imposition of levies such as last year's levies.  The only thing is that this year we know in advance that this could happen. This time last year no one &mdash; not even the Fine Gael Party &mdash; knew that levies would be imposed on 1st June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Chair.  Deputy Murphy talked here today on many matters, including a West Cork bacon factory.  I think I am correct in saying that he appeared to be against central pig fattening stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to dispute what Deputy Murphy has said on this matter but I should like to say that somewhat of a survey has been carried out in regard to these stations. Further informations are being sought by my Department in connection with the survey.  I would sound a little note of warning that the preliminary information we have got does not encourage one to believe that the establishment of more and more of these pig fattening stations may be the answer to any problem we have in regard to the bacon or pig industry at the moment.  I cannot say any more than that because it is only preliminary information. <Col N="880" /> However, I should like to sound that note of warning to approach the setting-up of these stations with some caution until we get a full evaluation as a result of the survey in regard to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy made the case that it is unfair that pig curing should not take place where the pigs are produced. If enough pigs are not being produced somewhere to justify the curing of them there, I think the Deputy will agree that they must be moved further afield to be cured.  This is not to say that I am either prejudging or judging the West Cork claim that they should have the factory but I would reiterate that we have excess capacity in our existing factories.  They have a throughput of 2.6 million and the throughput this year is 1.5 million.  In other words, well under one million of the throughput capacity is left unused. In these circumstances and in a competitive market in which we sell no bacon without subsidising it, it seems to me that the rational approach should be that we should go very warily on the creation of and addition to our killing and curing capacity until we know where we are going.</P>
      <P>In regard to the West Cork claim for a factory, this question of a factory for curing bacon in the ordinary traditional way is not new.  At the same time, there being no factory there already, it cannot be regarded as an adaptation job which would qualify for particular grants and, not being a business of a new nature, it does not appear to qualify for industrial or Foras Tionscal grants.  While the Deputy would appear to think that I and my Department are responsible for whether or not West Cork gets the grants for the pig factory there, I would point out that if it is a question of an industrial type grant it will be a matter for An Foras Tionscal and not for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <P>Figures were quoted of various prices for wheat and barley, and so on. Claims have been made here which I think require some sort of reply.  There was the claim that it was Deputy Dillon who announced a price of 50/a barrel for the 1948 barley crop.  Of <Col N="881" /> course, what was not added to that was the fact that this was all malting barley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my statement. The 50/- a barrel announced by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture in the first Coalition Government in 1948 was for a barley crop that consisted of malting barley.  It was strange &mdash; I know Deputies on the Opposition benches will not like to hear this &mdash; that it was another Minister for Agriculture, who is now no longer with us, unfortunately &mdash; the late Deputy Thomas Walsh of Kilkenny &mdash; a Fianna Fáil Minister who, in 1952, made an arrangement under which Irish growers would receive 48/- a barrel.  Now, this was done in an effort to popularise the new feeding barleys because, from a cash crop growing point of view, feeding barleys began to emerge in the early 1950's.  If any claim can be made about feeding barley in those early years the credit should go to the late Deputy Thomas Walsh, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, who, in 1952, introduced this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1954, a floor price of 40/- a barrel for the 1955 crop was, for the first time, put under the barley crop.  Even though it was 1954, again it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who did it.  So much for those who want to talk about what Deputy James Dillon did when he was Minister for Agriculture or about what Fine Gael or the Coalition Government did for the growing of feeding barley.  They did nothing to my knowledge.  The claim that they did all about it is only typical of the sort of claim they make about most things that turn out to be successful but they disclaim anything <Col N="883" /> that did not turn out so well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan said the milk position is good.  He went on further to say that it is nice to see Bord Bainne doing so well on the British market and selling our butter there with a new brand name and getting more for it than we got before.  I shall add nothing to that.  It is enough.  It is what Deputy Donegan had to say on milk, butter and on the lesser subsidy we have to pay because these people have apparently been doing a good job.</P>

      <P>We shall leave that for another day.  On 1st April, we pay another 1d for quality milk.  Deputy Jones was concerned about a matter which I am sure has given much trouble to Deputies.  It concerns the position where the basic herd, for the purpose of heifer grants, consists of what was on a particular farm in a datum year and the further position that arises if conacre lands are taken or a new bit of land is bought and with that bit of land, the purchaser takes over some part of the herd that would have been on that land in the datum year and then finds, after he has paid for the bit of land or taken it in conacre, that his basic herd goes up by so many cows but when he seeks heifer grants, he does not get them. I know it is difficult to get this across and at times it is very hard to understand and people do find themselves disappointed.  The only thing I can say is that if it is not working in this way, if mistakes have been made and people have been done out of grants, not through that process but through misapplication of that process, I would be glad to try to have them straightened out in the Department and grants paid where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the gems of the evening came from Deputy Dillon, as is usual.  He was waxing eloquent about sows and pigs and pork, scrub bulls and scrub heifers but the one that tickled my fancy most and which is somewhat typical of Deputy Dillon and which I <Col N="884" /> know Deputy Clinton copped also because I saw him smiling, was where he talked about pigs being ready for the factory five months after the insemination of the sow.  All I can say to him is, would he please let us know where that breed is and we will put it around the country and wipe out all others?  This would be the greatest thing that ever struck this country since Moses struck the rock: five months for the lot.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy inspired the next onslaught by Deputy Dillon.  If I wrong him he can correct me.  When it was asserted by Deputy Dillon that something was as fraudulent as Deputy Haughey's hens, it seemed to emerge that Deputy Haughey no longer has the hens that laid the golden eggs and that all that glitters is not gold.  The fact is that I personally know that he is still in them.  This will be great news to Deputy Murphy and he should have that visit that was talked about.  He still has them, unless I do not know a hen when I see one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some complaint, as usual, about the butter fat content of milk and the manner in which it is arrived at.  I would say that this is the sort of thing that there always will be cribbing about by those who get less than they think they should get and about which there will <Col N="886" /> be not one word of complaint from those who are getting a higher return than they thought they might.  I am certainly not going to suggest that the present method of testing is absolutely infallible but if there is any suggestion from Deputies worth examining as to an improvement in the method of testing that would be feasible and reasonable to carry out, we will have it examined and if it proves itself there is no reason why we could not change the method.  Any suggestion in that regard would be very welcome so far as I am concerned and we will have it checked and put into operation if it should appear to be desirable.</P>
      <P>Somebody asked in regard to the fat stock temporary headage grants of last year if the British Minister for Agriculture can or did stop these.  The answer to that is that he did not.  He did not stop those grants but some people in the trade in Britain certainly made it known in no uncertain terms repeatedly during the months of operation of the headage grants that they did not like them.</P>
      <P>Somebody also asked in regard to our beef support repayments from Britain how much is due.  I think this was in the original brief but the figure is approximately £1 million, speaking from memory, and as to when it will be paid, I have also already said that it is likely to be practically all paid in the month of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been this complaint about brucellosis eradication, particularly in the south, where the compulsory scheme has not yet reached.  The point is made that it is rather a difficult thing for individual farmers when there is an outbreak to this disease.  I fully subscribe to that.  I am very sympathetic towards anybody who runs into this trouble, particularly dairymen with a lot of cows.  On the other hand, we have started this eradication scheme in the north-west which will follow the general lines of the TB scheme that is to all intents and purposes finished and a good job done.  Unless and until we reach the south, I am afraid that in regard to this question of the individual farmer suffering hardship, this is something that he has been suffering and the <Col N="887" /> fact that we have initiated a scheme in the north-west does not imply that we must step in in every case where an outbreak occurs in other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any regulations under which a few extreme cases that have arisen in the south could be dealt with?  I know the scheme has not been extended to the south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The only thing I can say again is that if there are any extreme cases, and I have no doubt that there may be the odd one here or there, without implying any promise of any kind of being able to do anything, I would be glad to be given the information and I can tell the Deputy if there is anything we can do. There is nothing that we can do at this juncture.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton made some comments about the veterinary colleges.  All I can add is that not only is he unhappy about the situation but I do not think there is anybody who is happy about the situation.  The expense of maintaining the two faculties is one which I do not think anybody desires but this arrangement was not wanted by the Government of the day.  We did not seek such an arrangement.  It was forced upon the Government of the day by the inability of most of the interested parties to agree on any proposal for a joint school.  I suppose that this may be the position still, although we may have come a bit of the way since then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was asked as to whether or not a milk collection pilot scheme started and under way in County Waterford was really necessary, whether it had not been done by Lough Egish Creamery in Monaghan already. I want to say that this is bulk collection <Col N="888" /> in bulk containers collected at the farmer's stand or yard and is an experiment which, if it works well, could well teach all of us a lesson in this matter for the future.  It could be a more economical method of collection than the old system that still obtains in many parts of the south and in the country generally.  It is, in our estimation, well worthwhile to pursue this experiment of this bulk or tank collection to find out if we cannot apply it to our general advantage in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much more I have to say except that these moneys are not required merely because of bad estimating a year ago or because of deliberate underestimating for some other purpose.  The necessity for them has arisen for the reasons I have given and the fact is that there is little credit due to those who say that the farmer will not get a halfpenny out of them because a great deal of it goes to the relief of rates and not to the farmer. This is the woolly thinking that the advertisement about which so much has been said was intended to combat and I have no doubt it did combat it.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies on the Opposition benches as well as those on my own benches who have wished me success.  It may be that some of them said that with their tongues in their cheeks but I will take it in the best of good faith that they meant what they said.  I hope they will not be disappointed in me and that I will have success.  In so far as the immediate future is concerned, might I say that the small farmer will be my particular concern.</P>
