      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent visit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Brussels was one of a series of Ministerial visits arranged at the meeting which the Tánaiste and I had with members of the Commission of the European Economic Community in Brussels on the 20th September last in accordance with our policy of periodic contacts between Ministers and the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent visit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not, therefore, suggest an individual application on behalf of this country?  Our application is collective with that of the United Kingdom? That was stated by the Taoiseach the last time in a reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what steps he proposes to take to increase the number of pigs available to enable the bacon factory in Limerick to resume full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are already guaranteed minimum prices for good quality pigs.  As further measures to encourage pig production, a scheme of headage grants for farrowed sows and an increase in the rates of piggery grants for small farmers under the Farm Buildings Scheme have been in operation since last autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the bounty given on sows has no effect on pig production as far as the bacon industry is concerned, that what matters in this case is a standardised ration at a subsidised price?  As compared with the price in Britain, it is between £6 and £8 per ton dearer on the Irish farmer and so he is not encouraged to rear and produce pigs for slaughter in our bacon factories. What does the Minister propose to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy about the desirability and the effect of standardised rations and subsidised prices in regard to pig production. If we do not have the sows, we cannot have the pigs.  This scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister trying to tell me which came first&mdash;the hen or the egg?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that there has been a fall of 188,000 pigs for slaughter up to January, 1967?  The Minister says the subsidy for the sow will improve matters.  Is the Minister aware that, on 26th March, 1966, the inevitability of our present position was pointed out to him unless suitable action was taken by him and that neither he nor his Department took any action to save the bacon industry?  In Limerick, we are now faced with the closing-down of one bacon factory and others to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has mentioned the price of pig ration and that of pig rations in the Six Counties and in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the cheaper ration in Britain, they also, for some inexplicable reason, show a downward trend in their numbers at the same time as we do here.  What the Deputy says does not seem to be the only cause and factor in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratio between the downward fall in England and Ireland bears no comparison.  The Minister will recollect the warning he got in March, 1966, that this industry was in a chaotic condition and was threatened with a close-down.  He certainly went out of his way to deceive the people of Ireland and the people engaged in this industry.</P>

      <P>I would agree to a certain extent with the Deputy's concluding remark.  These discussions have been going on for quite a long time, but there has been a number of people involved who have had various suggestions to make.  These suggestions have had to be examined and they have not been found to be really acceptable, and this is the cause of the delay in coming to a conclusion on the matter.  There were so many interests concerned in the matter&mdash;and a very important matter it is&mdash;that time was necessary in order that the various proposals and suggestions could be examined to find out which is best. That is what we are trying to do.  We are not sitting on the matter in the Department.</P>

What would be proposed by way of a scheme would have to be generally acceptable; otherwise, the whole thing would not work.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> and <b>Mr. Gilhawley</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why it appears to be administratively possible in the UK to pay subsidy directly to <Col N="163" /> farmers on the sale of cattle to factories while in this country the payment is made to the factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between the British Fatstock Guarantee Scheme and our beef export support arrangement.  The British Scheme applies to all fat cattle certified under the Scheme, irrespective of whether the animals are consumed in the UK or are exported alive or in carcase form.  The support payments made in this country apply only to beef of the prescribed standards which is exported to Britain. They do not apply to fat cattle slaughtered for the home market or for a market other than Britain or to such cattle exported live.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the payment of the beef export support to producers here, including the administrative aspect, I would refer the Deputies to the reply given to questions on this subject on 28th September last.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Schemes under section</i> 11 <i>of the Housing (Ireland) Act</i>, 1919.</P>
    <P>(1)  In some schemes individual prices are fixed for a great variety of different houses.  To give the price for each house or house type would take up a disproportionate amount of time.</P>
    <P>(2)  The approved terms are based on multiples of the rent or on the outstanding loan for the house.  They are minimum terms only.  The Minister's approval is not required to any increase in these terms.  Approval was given on 22nd December, 1955, to a reduction of approximately one-third in the sale terms applicable to the lower priced houses in the 231 house scheme in Cashel, and on 23rd June, 1954, to a reduction from 7/1 to 6/4 in the weekly payment for the 11 house scheme in Tipperary.</P>
    <P>(3)  Tenants have an option in most cases of purchasing their dwellings by way of weekly payments over a number of years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Schemes under section</i> 13 <i>of the Labourers Act</i>, 1936.</P>
    <P>(4)  Copies of approved schemes are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(5)  Schemes quote prices for each cottage to which they relate.  To give these prices for each cottage would take up a disproportionate amount of time.  In general, schemes made up to 1951 were based on minimum purchase annuities of 75% of the rent payable while those made from 1951 onwards were generally based on minimum purchase annuities of 50% of the rent.  Annuities are generally of the order of £2 to £11.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Cluskey</b> asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that there are over 10,000 applicants for housing on the Dublin Corporation waiting list; that there is no immediate prospect of all the existing applicants being housed; and that the institution of a purchase scheme would seriously affect the existing pool of the corporation's rented accommodation; if he has received any proposals from Dublin Corporation regarding a tenant purchase scheme; and if in view of the fact that it is his policy to encourage tenants to buy their own houses he will state what measures it is proposed to take to control the sale of such houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Dublin Corporation have a total of 9,649 applicants on their waiting list of whom 3,924 have already been recommended for rehousing by the Chief <Col N="171" /> Medical Officer.  I understand that, on the basis of present trends, the corporation should be in a position to offer accommodation to most, if not all of the families on their existing approved waiting list within the next few years.</P>
      <P>Formal proposals for a house-purchase scheme have not yet been submitted to me by the corporation.  I have, however, informed them that my agreement to certain changes in their differential rent schemes was conditional on their submitting a scheme.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that a scheme under which tenants would be permitted to buy their houses would seriously affect the number of houses available for letting by the corporation.  On the contrary, receipts from sales, which must under section 108 of the Housing Act, 1966, be applied to a capital purpose approved by me, would provide a further source of finance for housing purposes.</P>
      <P>The conditions to be applied to prevent abuses are a matter in the first instance for the corporation who are aware of the specific powers to be given to them by section 90 of the Act to control re-sales.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Yes.  I said in my answer that having regard to the <Col N="186" /> special research carried out by Building Design Associates and to the wide scope of their expertise, substantial benefits will accrue from the arrangement whereby they will act as consultants in relation to the provision of Regional Technical Colleges in the centres, including Cork, where architects have already been engaged.  I might also say that the size and repetitive character of the buildings required at the four centres to which the consortium's appointment primarily relates, would justify the development of a building system, based on coordinated modular principles, for the whole project.  The use of such a system will, it is estimated, mean a saving in cost in the region of ten per cent as compared with the cost of buildings erected by traditional methods of construction.  The co-ordination of effort aimed at both preplanning and building methods will, it is estimated, result in a reduction of about 20 per cent in normal building time.  The use of a modular system as envisaged will achieve considerable freedom at the planning stage for room sizes and, in the future, for probable change, re-arrangements and extensions.</P>

I believe that to be true and the Minister tells me it is not.  I should be glad if he would state that he does not believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the position is not this at all, that any discussions that have taken place with the Cork groups who have been appointed&mdash;Messrs.  O'Flynn and Green, the architects, the consultant mechanical engineer, Mr. B.K. Reilly, of Messrs.  Varming, Mulcahy Reilly Associates, the consultant constructural engineer, Mr. John O'Donovan, and the quantity surveyor, Mr. James Sheehan&mdash;have been discussions with Building Design Associates simply on the specialist knowledge and research <Col N="187" /> that Building Design Associates are putting into this project, and as a result of which they have visited several countries to get the information which is not available to these individual firms in the seven or eight areas throughout Ireland.  The whole purpose of having a consortium was to avoid the need for repetition and having the groups in the eight areas going off to do research on their own. I might say that Deputy Barrett does not seem to grasp this.  He seems to think that I will have further consultants appointed.  The analogy might not be a strong one but it would be like having a solicitor to handle a case with two junior counsel and they might have two senior counsel.  Building Design Associates are the people who have done the research in consultation and co-operation with the steering committee.  I think this proposal is an eminently sound one, sound from the point of view of time and particularly from the point of view of the economics.</P>

      <P>(3)  A witness under subsection (2) may be cross-examined and reexamined on his evidence.  His deposition shall be taken down in writing, read over to him and signed by him and by the justice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me since Committee Stage by people outside the House that it should be made clear that the accused person should be entitled to give evidence himself on sworn deposition at the preliminary examination, if he so wishes.  That is the reason for the amendment to subsection (2).  The amendment also gives a similar right to the prosecutor&mdash;a private prosecutor, for instance, might wish to avail himself of it.  The new subsection (3) is designed to meet another point which has been made to me, that is, that to facilitate proofs at the trial, it should be provided that the deposition should be in writing, read over to the witness, and signed by him and by the justice.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  This is Report Stage, and it is difficult to keep track of the amendments.  I apologise if I seem to go back.  The question is this.  The Minister has presented to the House, and the House has accepted, an amendment which requires a District Justice not to send a defendant forward until he has heard any statement the defendant wants to make.  Is there a corresponding obligation on the District Justice to inform the defendant of his right to make a statement?</P>

      <P>There is one small point on amendment No. 7 which deletes lines 41 and 42.  I suppose <Col N="193" /> there is no danger that by deleting this we are running the risk that a statement which was not signed by the justice would be allowed in.  At first sight I am inclined to agree with the Minister and he is probably right. I take it that the position is that if it is shown at the trial that the justice did not sign the statement it will not be allowed in.  I imagine that is the position and consequently the words are unnecessary but having put them in there seems to be some suggestion of departing from that situation by taking them out.  The Minister is aware, for example, that in the issue of some types of summonses in the District Court it is the established and recognised practice and procedure, not that the court clerk will sign all the individual summonses but that a rubber stamp will be used.  I do not want to see a situation arising whereby statements of this kind can be simply rubber-stamped with the District Justice's stamp.</P>

      <P>In their present forms sections 8 (4) and 13 (2) (a) allow of an offence being dealt with summarily, where the Attorney General does not object to the adoption of this course.  It has been suggested to me that this could give rise to difficulties in the case of a private prosecution, as the Attorney General would not be represented and might not even be aware of the prosecution.  The absence of objection by him to summary disposal in such circumstances would have no meaning.  I propose, therefore, amendments Nos. 8 and 13 to provide that the actual consent of the Attorney General will be required to summary disposal under sections 8 (4) and 13 (2) (a).  The new section proposed in amendment No. 19 provides that such consent may be given in writing over the signature of the Attorney General or orally by his representative in court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where a deposition has been taken from a witness for the defence it may be admitted in evidence without requiring that the accused person, or his legal representative, had an opportunity of cross-examining him.  Cross-examination implies that the witness is hostile to the party doing the cross-examination and there can be no question of an accused person being required to treat his own witness as hostile.  This could arise in the case of medical evidence. It provides for the situation where medical evidence has been taken, say, from a foreign doctor who may have been residing here.  It happens quite a lot in accident cases.  The witness may have departed to a foreign country and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that such evidence can be taken at the summary stage and admitted in evidence at a later stage in the actual trial.  We do not want to have it that the accused or his legal representative did not have an opportunity of cross-examining the witness. <Col N="198" /> As the section stands, he has that opportunity.</P>

      <Col N="199" /> On Committee Stage I accepted an amendment to subsection (2) of section 19, the effect of which was to empower a justice to treat any offence under the Larceny Acts of 1861 and 1916 as a minor offence fit to be tried summarily under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  However, on further consideration of the matter, I feel there should be some limit to this power. There might be serious cases involving large sums of money which the Attorney General might consider ought to be tried before a jury.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment, therefore, a District Justice will be obliged to obtain the consent of the Attorney General before he can deal summarily with an offence under the Larceny Acts involving property of a value of more than £200.  At present the District Court has jurisdiction up to £50 and we are here extending that jurisdiction under the Larceny Acts of 1861 and 1916 up to £200.  In any cases above that figure the District Justice must have the consent of the Attorney General before he deals summarily with the offence.</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 23 and 24, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where an applicant for bail is already on bail in connection with another offence, information regarding such existing bail may be given by the prosecutor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 26, at subsection (5), already provides for the giving of evidence of previous convictions on an application for bail, where these previous convictions were for offences committed while on bail.</P>
      <P>The amendment I now propose extends this principle to cover the case of a person who commits an offence while he is on bail in respect of another offence.  It proposes that evidence of the existing bail may be given by the prosecutor in connection with any bail application the offender may make in relation to the second offence. It is only right that the court should be aware of the existing bail situation in these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things involved here.  As I understand the Minister, the purpose of the new subsection is to enable the court to be given information in respect of a person who is out on bail and who commits an offence while he is on bail. I have my doubts as to whether this section would permit of that interpretation by the court.  The court might decide that it does not permit that information to be given and I think the court might probably be reluctant to hear that kind of information because it would be information obviously prejudicial to the accused.  It would be a different situation if the person, while on bail, committed the offences of which he had been convicted, in which event it would be quite proper that the court should have the information.  If, however, a person is simply charged with another offence while he is on bail, when the case comes on for hearing it may ultimately be established that he is not guilty but, in the meanwhile, he will have been prejudiced on the bail application to the court.</P>

      <P>No.  I think it is proper that, where a person has committed an offence and has been convicted of that offence, the court should know about it.  It is a matter which would touch on the bail.  But I do not think it is right that the court should be told that a person has been charged with another offence, of which he has not been convicted.  In that <Col N="203" /> event it is going to prejudice the mind of the court in relation to bail and ultimately the man might be found not guilty.  Meanwhile, damage has been done as regards his bail.</P>

I am not certain, in any event, that the wording in that would be accepted by a court as enabling them to receive any information other than information regarding the actual bail, that is the amount of the bail, and the names of the bailsmen.  But I am quite happy if the Minister will look into it.</P>

      <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 40 and 41, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 52 of the Extradition Act, 1965, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>'(2A) A recognisance may be taken from a person under this section by the member of the Garda Síochána into whose custody he has been committed.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, along with amendment No. 25, accounts for the Motion I moved before Report Stage.  These amendments are designed to meet minor matters which have arisen in the practical operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, which deals with the backing in this country of warrants of <Col N="204" /> arrest issued by the judicial authorities in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under amendment No. 24, where a person is committed to the custody of a member of the Garda Síochána and the justice or peace commissioner remanding him has consented to his being bailed and has fixed the amount of the recognisance, it will be possible for the Garda concerned to take a recognisance from him in the amount fixed and release him on bail on condition that he surrenders himself at the specified time.</P>
      <P>This is a fairly routine procedure which, as the Extradition Act now stands, would not be possible.  Its absence has caused some administrative difficulty.  The amendment will allow this procedure to continue to operate as it has operated over the years in other respects.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 declares that the term &ldquo;imprisonment,&rdquo; as used in Part III of the Extradition Act, includes any form of lawful custody of the person concerned.  It will ensure, for instance, that mentally ill offenders who escape from mental hospitals in Britain while undergoing special treatment will be recoverable from this country.  The position is that such people undergoing special treatment for their benefit in institutions in Britain may not be extradictable under the Act as it now stands by reason of the fact that the term &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; might be interpreted in a narrow sense.  But if it is defined as &ldquo;any form of lawful custody of the person concerned,&rdquo; as proposed in amendment No. 25&mdash;the example I have given is the one that comes up most, that of a person undergoing treatment in an institution in Britain&mdash;such a person on foot of a criminal offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is an old gentleman prancing about London at present, who has been <i>habeas corpused</i> out on bail, and the Ghana Government are trying to get at him.  If he was not in Ghana, in lawful custody until such time as they slaughtered him, and if he managed to get here, was he in lawful custody? Does &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; mean in accordance with our law?</P>
      <P>In regard to the second question, I think the Minister has given us the assurance necessary by saying &ldquo;as a consequence of criminal acts.&rdquo; There are unfortunates who commit themselves to some of these mental institutions, both here and in Great Britain, who commit themselves into lawful custody as dypsomaniacs to get dried out.  I have great sympathy with the fellow who commits himself voluntarily for three months to get dried out but who at the end of six weeks hops on the mail boat and comes here, saying &ldquo;I have had enough.  I am not going back to be dried out any more.&rdquo; Is that &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo;?  He can be in lawful custody if he voluntarily commits himself.  Can you extradite him if you insert this subsection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has covered the general Fine Gael attitude to this Bill in considerable detail.  I am primarily concerned with the implications of Part V, first, in regard to their constitutionality and, second, in regard to the propriety.  I believe I am the first Deputy to draw the attention of the House to the fact that it was my profound belief that, if we could eliminate drunken driving, we would eliminate 50 per cent of the road accidents in this country.  I think I was thought to exaggerate when I mentioned that formerly in this House, but I believe that a great number of people are coming to agree with me.  Even proceeding on the assumption that my belief is correct, I think we must be vigilant to see that in our solicitude to set that matter right, we do not go to extravagant extremes.  We propose to do several things, first, to fix what I call a statutory definition of drunkenness, that is to say, if a person has more than 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, he is deemed to be unfit to drive a car as a result of the consumption of alcohol.  Many people will argue, and I think with great force, that that blood level in one person leaves the person stone cold sober, whereas in the case of another person it may mean that he is physically unfit to drive a car.  I think all reasonable people must admit the truth of that but our difficulty in the past has been to determine what is drunkenness and we are driven to the course of saying that drunkenness as a general term is now eliminated and we fix a statutory limit of blood content of alcohol above which nobody must drive a car, drunk or sober, in the ordinary acceptance of those words.  In view of our acute problem in this regard, I think that is a proper decision and one over which I am prepared to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now to come to the question of determining whether in fact that condition of statutory drunkenness exists. <Col N="208" /> I ask the House to pause here because in our desire for reform, we may go overboard altogether.  When we think of a procedure <i>in vacuo</i> in this House, we sometimes commit ourselves to things that we would never dream of sanctioning if we thought of them <i>in persona.</i> It is going a very long way to bail up a citizen travelling on a road on his lawful occasions and have a young garda demand that he blow into a bag but I am prepared to concede that there is a great problem confronting us and that the Minister for Local Government is casting about for some satisfactory means of bringing it under control.  With great reluctance, I am prepared to agree to that, but I would regard it as being a power in the hands of the garda far in excess of what I would normally think appropriate, and if I did not believe that drunkenness was making so devastating a contribution to the slaughter on the roads, I would resist this proposition energetically.  But in the special circumstances in which we find ourselves, as do many other countries, I am prepared to concede that we must ask our neighbours to make this contribution of submitting to the indignity of going through this operation.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the next proposal, that the garda is entitled to bring any person whom he choses to bail up and whom he says he suspects is not drunk in the ordinary accepted sense of the word but who has more than 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood to the local police station and there provide a sample of urine or a sample of blood.  First, I want to deal with this on the basis of a person who is in fact perfectly normal and is going about his lawful occasions and is not involved in an accident.  Can you imagine a garda bailing up an elderly lady of eminently respectable background and general conduct and having first required her to blow in a bag, which she does with reluctance and only because she is conscious of the need for this contribution to social order and to set good example, then requests her to go to the local police station.</P>
    <P>These things are very nice to think of <i>in vacuo</i> but suppose it happened to <Col N="209" /> your own mother. I ask the younger Deputies to consider their own mothers, ladies of standing and eminent respectability and with ordinary delicacy of feeling.  The lady is brought into the Garda station and told: &ldquo;We are going to send for a doctor and take a sample of your blood.&rdquo;  She says: &ldquo;You cannot do that because I will faint.  The sight of blood makes me faint.&rdquo;  I think I am not exaggerating when I say that an unknown percentage of people who are asked to give a blood sample, in all the amenities of a hospital find that the sight of blood and the insertion of a needle in a vein causes them to faint.  So she says: &ldquo;You cannot do that because if you do that I will faint.&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;Very well, ma'am, give us a sample of your urine.&rdquo;  I am not simply saying that by way of a joke.  We are legislating for our own neighbours.  It will not upset some young fellow to be offered these alternatives in a police station but I am thinking of the people whom it will upset and I think the first person to be shocked if he came into a situation like that would be the Parliamentary Secretary himself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree; fundamentally, I think he is a decent man, and I think if he came upon such a spectacle and found a woman in great distress, he would ask himself: &ldquo;Does this situation correspond with what we had in mind when in Article 40 of the Constitution we laid down in paragraph 3: &ldquo;The State guarantees in its laws&rdquo;&mdash;that is what we are doing today, making laws&mdash;&ldquo;to respect and, as far as practicable by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put this question to the Chair: has a woman the right to drive a car in this country without being dragged off to a police station by a member of the Garda Síochána old enough to be her grandson not because he believes she is drunk but because he believes that the formula has been breached, and asked to submit in the surroundings of a police station to the <Col N="210" /> drawing of her blood or else providing for the custody of the Bureau which is to be established under the Bill, a sample of her urine?  I want to suggest to the House that not only is that a revolting proposition in itself but I believe that if the Constitution is invoked, the Supreme Court would hold that, in passing such legislation, we have failed to observe the obligation put upon us to guarantee in our laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by our laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of Part 3 of that Article on Personal Rights says:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws, protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>I believe this proposal is unconstitutional. But leaving out the constitutional issue, I am addressing myself to the ordinary decent reactions of the average Deputy.  What I am afraid of is that in considering this proposal, Deputies are thinking of irresponsible brats driving sports cars who would not give a damn if they were stripped naked in the station, and to whom it would be no psychological shock to undergo any kind of physical jostling of that character.  But we are not legislating exclusively for such persons; we are legislating for everybody.  I ask the House: is it a reasonable suggestion that a procedure of this kind should be imposed on a man of standing, or a Deputy, for instance, under sanction of six months' imprisonment if he does not submit to it, if that gives Deputies even reason to pause, and I think it should?  Then there is the case of a respectable woman who is exposed to this test and I say it is unthinkable for a body to provide that, under penalty of six months' imprisonment, a woman should be asked to submit to a test of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is a third aspect of this situation to which I think the House ought to direct its mind.  I have been dealing up to now with people who are going <Col N="211" /> about their lawful duties who are stopped by a garda on suspicion that they have violated the blood sample formula provided in the Bill.  Now I come to the case of a person who has been involved in an accident and such a person, the gardaí may come to the conclusion, smells of drink.  Remember, we are legislating for the imposition of a penalty.  I was driving during the Waterford by-election campaign and not every Deputy will remember the Saturday night before the poll was the coldest day which came out of the heavens.  After coming off the platform, somebody gave me a Baby Power, which is a thing I do not ordinarily drink and said: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, you ought to take that on your way home or you will die of the cold&rdquo;.  I was very cold but I did not drink the whiskey.  My apprehension is that a man in a similar circumstance to mine might strike his head against the car and the whiskey bottle be broken and spilled, and in fact I might be seriously concussed without any drink of whiskey.</P>
    <P>Now even an experienced, sensible and prudent member of the Garda Síochána might legitimately, in that context of the section of this Bill, bring me to the police station and go through all this formula and I might &mdash;being concussed and shocked&mdash;give him a very sharp answer, rendering myself liable to six months in jail.  But what is worse, gradually subsiding into a coma, whereupon an ambulance would be sent for, which might arrive within the next half-hour or so, I would arrive in hospital, only to be told later that I was suffering from sub-arachnoid bleeding, from a fracture of the base of my skull, or something like that, and there was now a doubtful question as to whether or not I would recover at all or, if I did recover, that I would suffer permanent brain injury.</P>
    <P>Now, you think that a desirable situation to create.  I want to put it to the House that the place to take a person who has been involved in an accident, and who may have all the exterior signs of having partaken of alcohol, is to a hospital and there in <Col N="212" /> the hospital&mdash;having had him examined in the casualty department&mdash; let the Garda then proceed to lay any charges, or go through any formula they want, but the first thing is to see that the man is not dying, because certainly it is not our intention to sentence irresponsible motor drivers to death.  Now I know there are some Deputies who will say: &ldquo;Deputy Dillon is a foolish man; he will be portrayed as defending drunken drivers&rdquo;.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee what I am portrayed as; I am here to do my job.  My job is to stop drunken driving by legislation which will commend the assent of all reasonable people in this country.  I do not think this Bill will.  I think, if this Bill passes in its present form, the President ought to send it to the Supreme Court for examination.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to recognise the difficulties and problems of the Minister for Local Government and I would be quite prepared to go as far as I thought it humanly reasonable to go.  I think it is ample to say we have put upon everybody the obligation to blow in the bag and mind you, I do not minimise it! I think it is a grave offence to the legitimate personal dignity of the average person. But I think it is a contribution most people would be prepared to make in the common effort to suppress drunken driving.  But I would be prepared to say this: on a person being charged, he or she should be informed: &ldquo;You are entitled, ma'am, to ask for a doctor and the police doctor will attend or your own if you want him, but if you ask for one, the police doctor will attend right away.  We cannot answer for what your doctor will do.  If you like, we can have a sample of your blood taken and other tests made.  If you want to do that you are welcome.&rdquo;  I am prepared to go further and provide that in the event of a person being informed of that right and refusing to accept it, the Guards will be entitled to tender that in evidence in court.  It will be up to the defendant to say: &ldquo;I refused that in the Garda station because it was something I could not face&rdquo;, and the justice will determine whether the man or woman is speaking in good <Col N="213" /> faith when he or she say that, or determine whether he or she is trying to suppress the true position in which he or she was.</P>
    <P>We are not forbidding the Guards to go through the existing procedure. If they arrest a person for drunken driving of a car, they can send for the police doctor and ask him to apply the ordinary tests&mdash;walking a straight line, the defendant expressing himself in tortuous sentences&mdash;and they can produce the doctor who may say that by all ordinary tests he thought the man was drunk.  I am prepared to agree to that.  Over and above that, the Guards will be entitled to say: &ldquo;We offered him the right to submit to the blood test and the urine test and he refused; we told him he would not be confined to the police doctor, that he could get his own doctor, and he refused that&rdquo;, and let all these facts be brought before the court where the justice can evaluate them and determine whether the person was fit to drive a car or whether the person turned down the tests in an endeavour to suppress the fact that he was unable to drive a car.  To make it a statutory offence punishable by six months in prison for failure to submit to the two tests is, in my opinion, a horror.</P>
    <P>We are drifting into these situations not in one leap of indifference to human rights, but inch by inch we eat into human rights until eventually we find ourselves quoting past precedents to justify our actions.  That is what a Constitution is for.  I have never had any great esteem for Bunreacht na hÉireann which I think is mostly cod, most of the Articles in it being largely suspended, nothing there except Article 40 which is enforceable by the courts.  Article 40 was put down as representing the general consensus of opinion on the fundamental rights of the people of our country, and formidable as is the danger, and I do not deny it, of drunken driving, and shocking as are the consciences of people who drive cars under the influence of drink. I still think there are limits beyond which this House should not go in <Col N="214" /> legislation of this kind for the purpose of suppressing this evil.</P>
    <P>Again, I press very strongly on the Minister, to try out what I am proposing to him now.  If that does not work, let us think of the problem again and see whether these precautions are deflecting our purpose to prevent persons under the influence of drink from driving according to the formula set out in this Bill.  Deep down in our hearts we know there is only one sure guarantee against the drunken driver, that is, to teach every man and woman: &ldquo;If you drive do not drink; if you drink do not drive&rdquo;.  That is the real guarantee and it is not an intolerable argument.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in pressing young people too far in regard to certain standards of conduct but one standard I would insist on for four or five young fellows going out in a car for a night is that one of them will go on the wagon, on the understanding that on the occasion of the next four hooleys, he will not have to go on the wagon. I can best illustrate this by experiences which we had ourselves.  Thanks be to God, I was only once in a car that killed a person.  The night I was called to the Irish Bar we dined in the Kings Inns.  We dined well, as we intended to, and we proposed to drive to Harold's Cross to the dogs&mdash;four of us who had been called to the Bar&mdash;and none of us was on the wagon.  However, I had taken the prudent precaution of saying: &ldquo;Now boys, the car stays in Henrietta Street.&rdquo;  We hired a car with a responsible driver and the four of us piled in and all my life long I shall thank God for that decision.  As we were driving along the canal bank that summer evening with little children playing, a little child, about five years of age, darted out from behind a lorry.  The car struck the child and by the time we got the child to Temple Street&mdash;I think it was Temple Street we took the child &mdash;it was dead.</P>
    <P>That fixed in my mind the rule that the only safety is: &ldquo;If you drink do not drive; if you drive do not drink&rdquo;. I do not honestly think that any one of the four of us was drunk on that occasion but none of us would ever <Col N="215" /> be easy in our minds the rest of our lives if we had not taken the precaution of insisting that the driver of the car had no drink and that we did not take out our car.  If we had killed that child&mdash;I believe the driver was utterly blameless and he was so found subsequently to be: the child, playing, looked over its shoulder as it ran out &mdash;whatever the attendant circumstances, there would have been a psychological trauma that we would have carried through life.  But for the fact that we had foreseen the essential urgency of the rule: &ldquo;If you drink do not drive and if you drive do not drink&rdquo;, one of us would have had regrets for the rest of our lives.</P>
    <P>Mind you, I believe it largely devolves&mdash;I will not say exclusively&mdash;on parents to teach their children that lesson in their adolescence, not by assuming the attitude of excessive rigour and undue capacity to be shocked, but simply to lay down that minimum standard of conduct.  It may be disedifying to take a drop too much, but it is unworthy and it is criminal conduct when going out not to provide that at least one of you will be on the wagon and that he will be the only one to touch a car.  Therefore, with all those things present to my mind, I am prepared to go a long way to help the Minister for Local Government with the problem he is called on to deal with.  I exhort Deputies to join with me to ensure that there are limits beyond which we should not go, conscious as we are of the gravity of the problem and the magnitude of the difficulties associated with its solution.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are some relatively minor matters in regard to this Bill on which I should ask for specific information, although I imagine Deputy Fitzpatrick has already mentioned them.  I cannot understand why the Minister wants power under section 9 to control the importation of vehicle parts.  I do not know what that has got to do with a Road Traffic Bill. I can understand it in the context of a general policy of protection or something of that kind but I cannot see how it comes into the context or relevance <Col N="216" /> of this Bill.  I would be glad, when concluding on this stage, if the Minister would give us a more concise explanation of why it is here.</P>
    <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to section 27.  This deals with the person who is in charge of a car.  Subsection (3), paragraph (b) says:</P>
    <P>a person who is or has been in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place with intent to drive or attempt to drive the vehicle but not driving or attempting to drive it and who, in the opinion of the member, is commiting or has committed an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>Offences under this section are set out in subsection (1) which states:</P>
    <P>Whenever a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place has consumed intoxicating liquor, he may require him to provide in the prescribed manner a specimen of his breath by exhaling into an apparatus designed for the purpose of indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>A person who refuses or fails to comply forthwith with a requisition under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person who has been driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and who, in the opinion of the member, is committing or has committed an offence under this section, or</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to this.  I have had cases drawn to my attention about a man who comes to the conclusion that it is not wise for him to drive a car, and who has deliberately gone into the back seat, divorcing himself from the wheel and <Col N="217" /> from the ignition.  He has gone to sleep because he knew he was not fit to drive a car at all and he wanted to get into a condition in which he would be fit to drive a car.  Short of lying down on the grass margin in the lane or going away into a field and abandoning the car, he deliberately got out of the front seat and went into the back seat in order to recover himself and be fit to drive a car.</P>
    <P>I have also known of cases where people found they were getting sleepy. It has happened to myself.  I have been driving a car and I have been conscious that I was getting sleepy.  I have stopped the car and gone into the back seat.  I went to sleep and slept for ten or fifteen minutes.  I then got up and walked up and down the road for five minutes to get some fresh air.  I got into the car and was able to drive perfectly safely.  Under this section, as far as I can see, if a Garda Síochána comes along in either of those situations, he can find me guilty of an offence because I am in charge of a car which is actually stationary. Suppose I have a higher alcoholic blood content than the Bill allows, and have put myself in the back of the car to keep away from temptation or danger, am I not substantially complying with what the law requires, that is, that I have effectively prevented myself from driving a car?</P>
    <P>Now, I know some scrupulous Garda Síochána will say: &ldquo;You could not be up to them.  He would know you were coming to get your claws on him and he could jump into the back of the car&rdquo;.  It is like the Revenue Commissioners who want the right to put the ball and chain on to every person who has not paid his tax.  They want to get their claws on to him and they are prepared to swear that if they have not the right to put that manacle and chain on to that person, they cannot get the tax from him. Take the manacles and chains away and the Revenue Commissioners get their tax the same way.</P>
    <P>Every police officer will always ask for more and more power, accompanying it with the assurance: &ldquo;We are neighbours' children.  You do not expect <Col N="218" /> us to act like lunatics or madmen. Those powers will be used reasonably&rdquo;.  Of course they will be used reasonably in 70 or 80 per cent of the cases but it is the 20 per cent we have got to look after.  I love the story of the man driving his car without due consideration from St. Stephen's Green down Grafton Street and the garda who used to be on duty there, being a man of long experience, protected him from the manifest gesture of careless driving.  He walked over to the car with great solemnity. The man in the car felt he was guilty and was bracing himself for a serious assault.  The experienced guard looked in through the window at him and said: &ldquo;Do you, know, you are driving like an ould wan&rdquo;.  He then waved him on.  That was a sensible man but you could get a young lad dealing with that situation and there would be ruaile-buaile, with patrol cars coming from the four corners of the city and blue murder, whereas when the man was told by the experienced garda: &ldquo;You are driving like an ould wan&rdquo;, he said to himself: &ldquo;I made a damn fool of myself at the top of Grafton Street.  I was lucky to get a reasonable guard and it will not happen again&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are not legislating in the belief that all public servants are experienced, prudent and sensible; we are legislating in the knowledge that we are human and that public servants are human.  Therefore we must put into the hand of the public servant no more power over the individual citizen than can be safely committed to him.  I should like the Minister to look at that question and ask himself if the man has taken precautions to preclude himself from driving in the manner described by me, it is appropriate to describe him as in fact being in charge of the car and in the process of committing a statutory offence.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at section 34.  I think he will agree with me that to understand that section is extremely difficult:</P>
    <P>(1)  On the hearing of a charge for an offence under section 49 or <Col N="219" /> 50 of the Principal Act, it shall not be necessary to show that the defendant had not consumed intoxicating liquor after the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed but before the taking or provision of a specimen under section 29 or section 32.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, on the hearing of a charge for an offence under section 49 or 50 of the Principal Act, evidence is adduced by or on behalf of the defendant that, after the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed but before the taking or provision of a specimen under section 29 or section 32, he had consumed intoxicating liquor, the court shall disregard the evidence unless satisfied by or on behalf of the defendant that but for that consumption the concentration of alcohol in the defendant's blood (as specified in a certificate under section 42 (3) or 44 (2) ) would not have exceeded a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
    <P>That is pretty complicated but I can follow it on close study, but now I come to subsection (3) and I would like somebody to explain that to me:</P>
    <P>A person shall not take or attempt to take any action (including consumption of alcohol but excluding a refusal or failure to provide a specimen of his breath, blood or urine) with the intention of frustrating a prosecution under section 49 or 50 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>A person who contravenes this subsection shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Can anybody make head or tail of that because I cannot and I did not begin construing Bills today or yesterday? I would invite the Minister to have a confidential chat with the draftsman and to ask him whether he understands it.  I shall not ask the Minister to state explicitly to the House whether he, the Minister, understands it or not, but I suggest to him that whatever that subsection is meant to mean could be more explicitly expressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> I pass to section 41:</P>
    <P>No action or other legal proceeding shall lie (except in the case of wilful neglect or default) against the Director or against the Bureau or any members or officer or servant thereof by reason of, or arising out of, the carrying out of any analysis or determination under this Act.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; should be in there at all.  It may be that by a catastrophic disaster a person may have a positive test produced by a servant of the Bureau.  You might find a citizen who feels confident and says: &ldquo;Certainly, I submit to both tests most willingly; I am not in the least afraid of them.&rdquo;  He provides a blood and urine sample.  He knows he has not touched alcohol in 48 hours. The tests are then made.  Remember, by definition, the man is not drunk. All that is charged against him is that he has more than 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood.  The samples are taken and the Bureau takes them in charge.</P>
    <P>In the Bureau is a drunken bowsy who has got the job there because he could not hold any other job and because he knows a Fianna Fáil TD who said: &ldquo;He is on the batter night and day; he has a wife and a long string of delicate children.  Give him a chance; he cannot do much harm in the Bureau.&rdquo;  He takes the sample and he returns a report to the effect that this fellow was as drunk as a flute-player. The man is prosecuted.  He knows he has not had a drop of drink for 48 hours before those samples were taken but the Bureau says: &ldquo;You were as drunk as a flute-player.&rdquo;  The man will call evidence.  He will try to get somebody who has been with him for every minute of every hour of the previous 12 hours to demonstrate he has not touched alcohol but there will be at least 40 per cent of the charitable citizens of this city who will say: &ldquo;There was never smoke yet without some fire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He establishes a defence of his character with the impeccable test that he was in company&mdash;mind you, that is not an easy thing to do&mdash;for every minute of every hour of the previous <Col N="221" /> 12 hours.  He then establishes that the drunken ex-secretary of the Fianna Fáil cumann could hold down no other job and that he has not been sober after midday for the past 15 years.  He establishes that he was weaving drunk when he made the test and that, in fact, he reported on the samples provided by a drunken coal-heaver from the North Wall, in respect of a leader of the Bar, the medical profession or even a Deputy of this House, perish the thought.  He sues the Bureau for damages for slander or libel, if that is the appropriate word.</P>
    <P>The Bureau says: &ldquo;Yes, we hired a drunken old bowsy who was kicked out of every other job because he was the displaced secretary of the Fianna Fáil cumann and they could plant him nowhere else.  They had him above in Lower Mount Street for a while and they had to push him out of even there and all he had to do was sit below in the coal-cellar and he would not even sit there.  They got rid of him and put him into the Bureau.  We admit he was as drunk as a flute-player.  We admit he made a report on the samples provided by a drunken coal-heaver from the North Wall and we admit that he produced them in the court because he got them.  We admit this person was convicted on false evidence and that he suffered great damage in his reputation and heavy financial loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 41 of the Road Traffic Bill, 1966 says that unless you can prove wilful neglect, you are down the drain. You get up and say: &ldquo;Well, I came to court principally to get damages; I am entitled to damages.  I came for litigation.&rdquo;  The answer is manifest: &ldquo;You are not entitled to succeed. Section 41 of the Road Traffic Bill precludes you from succeeding, not only against the director of the Bureau, not only against the Bureau itself but against any member or officer or servant thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that that word ought to be taken out and that the Bureau itself ought to be liable for neglect or default the same as anybody else.  If not, I do not doubt that the servants in the employment of the Bureau will be eminently satisfactory. <Col N="222" /> I do not doubt the director, and I do not doubt that one of the conditions of his employment is that he will appoint people directly on the basis of &ldquo;appointing those who support us, all other things being equal&rdquo;, but bearing constantly in mind that those belonging to Fianna Fáil cumainn are a little more equal than anybody else. I think people appointed on that basis are at least liable for neglect or default on the same terms as anybody else.</P>
    <P>There is an odd feature, Sir, in section 58.  It provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  A person who is found in a public place in such a condition, because he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug, as to be a source of danger to traffic or himself shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person charged with an offence under this section shall not, in respect of the facts alleged to constitute such offence, be charged under section 12 of the Licensing Act, 1872.</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means.  Where is the penalty clause?  What penalty clause covers section 58?  I could not find it.  This is capable of explanation and I should be glad to have it when the Minister concludes.</P>
    <P>These are points upon which I call for review and consideration.  They are relatively unimportant, though I do not think they should be regarded as unimportant.  I think it is necessary to have negligence attached to members of the Bureau.  The other points I mentioned are worthy of careful consideration but the matters I have mentioned in connection with Part V of this Bill are, in my judgement, of fundamental importance.  I do not think the matters I have mentioned should be made the subject of a Party whim.  I want to proceed on the assumption that, whatever our differences in this House may be, we share a common purpose in vindicating the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution for all citizens of the State.  Part V of this Bill is gravely trespassing on these rights.  I can see readily that the quality of this trespass may not be of a kind <Col N="223" /> that is immediately manifest to everyone but I am certain that it is a very real trespass.  I am certain it is a very substantial step along a very evil road. I hope the Constitution is strong enough to arrest it.</P>
    <P>On these grounds, I direct the Minister's special attention to what I have said in regard to these matters and I urge him strenuously to promote general support against that which I think is a draconian method of control of what I can see readily to be a great evil.  He should remove the penalties to which I have referred and substitute therefor a right in the Garda authorities to offer this procedure to any person, and in the event of his refusing to avail of that, to authorise the Garda Síochána to state that fact in evidence in court at the time of prosecution.  The court can then determine on the facts whether the reluctance to submit to these personal indignities, was in fact a genuine reluctance to submit to such indignities or a desire to cover up the plain fact of intoxication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start with a quotation from Isocrates:</P>
      <P>When there are a number of laws drawn up with great exactitude it is proof that the City is badly administered; for the inhabitants are compelled to frame laws in great numbers as a barrier against offences.</P>
      <P>I chose that quotation because I think this Bill in the form in which it has been presented to us is a reflection on the Government's inability to carry out existing laws which deal with these matters adequately.  I believe that the laws at present on the Statute Book are adequate and are in very little need of improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As most Deputies have dealt with Part V of this Bill first, I shall do so also.  In this Bill as in most legislation we get from the Department of Local Government, the word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; or &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; appears 99 times.  It is most significant to note that this word, &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; or &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is almost completely absent from Part V of the Bill.  Part V of the Bill was ill-conceived and <Col N="224" /> put on the Statute Book casually and without any proper study or consideration of the problem with which it tries to deal.</P>
    <P>The demand for legislation of this nature has changed in its concept from the time of the last Road Traffic Bill.  Now, it appears to me that the Government is introducing this Bill to get into a campaign against drinking as such, instead of trying to improve the position in so far as accidents are concerned, and that it has been framed out of emotion.</P>
    <P>I remember that, during the debate on the 1957 Intoxicating Liquor Bill, I verbally opposed&mdash;not, naturally, in the Lobby&mdash;the proposals to do away with the <i>bona fide</i> law.  These were supported, in the main, because it was held at that time that all these accidents were being caused by people rushing out to the <i>bona fide</i>, getting drunk and coming home and bump ing off people like nobody's business At that time, the Taoiseach gave us statistical information to the effect that, of all the accidents, less than three per cent involved drink.  However, we did away with the <i>bona fide</i> system.  Many publichouses and places of entertainment on the outskirts that had invested large sums of money to cater for this demand found themselves seriously hampered.  Most of them, I am glad to see, have now provided other entertainments and food, and so on, and have managed to preserve their business.  The point is that we did away with this <i>bona fide</i> trade.</P>
    <P>One would expect, in view of what was said in 1957, that there would be a sharp decline in the number of accidents in which drink was involved but this did not happen: the number of accidents went up.  Instead of improving the situation, we in fact worsened it.  As Deputy Dillon said, let us not confuse this issue with a couple of irresponsible young people in their sports car.  We are dealing here with the ordinary man who drives a car, the man who, if he thinks he had a little too much at a party, will cling to the kerb, observe the speed limits and drive with complete excess of caution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> I often wonder why there are so many deaths and accidents&mdash;in far greater proportion to the numbers we have here&mdash;in countries that have these blood tests, breathaliser tests and far stricter legislation.  It seems to me that these countries would do well to adopt our present laws, under which we get better results, instead of our adopting their statutes which, in those countries, are causing a far greater problem than we have here.</P>
    <P>Many of the findings of the commission on driving under the influence of drink or drugs were based upon supposition and personal opinions.  Paragraph V of the Report says:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the nature of our published statistics, we can only infer one conclusion that drink plays a more prominent part in the cause of accidents than the accidents would suggest.</P>
    <P>At Appendix 6, Table 1, we read that of the average percentage of yearly motor accidents, where the condition of the driver was considered to be a primary factor, drink or drugs was 2.16 per cent.  What about the problem of the 97.84 per cent?  Are we not to concern ourselves with these?</P>
    <P>As I say, this legislation appears to me to have been conceived for the purpose of window-dressing and to appease some anti-drinking, total abstinence organisations rather than for the purpose of preventing accidents.  These associations will say of Deputy Dillon and of me that we should not encourage drunken drivers.  I, like Deputy Dillon, and as he said, will not give a fiddle-de-dee.</P>
    <P>When this State was founded, we took over the laws that were framed in England and we amended these from time to time.  Some of the laws were good and some of them were bad. There was one good feature which has persisted in Irish law since the establishment of the State, that is, that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.  Long before we come to Part V of this Bill, there is an attack on that position.  In section 10, Part II, we read of being presumed guilty unless such and such.  Right through the Bill, one is presumed guilty unless <Col N="226" /> such and such.  The whole principle of being innocent until proven guilty is done away with in this Bill and it is a principle which I think we in this House should defend very strongly.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to have a long look at and to give very serious thought to this Bill because to ask Deputies such as myself to come in and to support this Bill is to put a very serious strain on our personal conscience.  I realise that I have been elected to Dáil Éireann as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and as a supporter of a Fianna Fáil Government.  If this principle of being deemed guilty until proved innocent is upheld, then I must say that I could support the Party only with great reservations of conscience.</P>
    <P>I can leave here tonight at 10.30 without taking a drink at all and, as a result of this speech and other matters that will happen, feel rather tired and exhausted.  Suppose I get home at 11 p.m. and decide to sit up for a couple of hours and have a drink or two to relax my nerves before I go to bed.  Suppose a policeman comes along at 1 a.m. and knocks at my door and says: &ldquo;Somebody said you were driving your car erratically in St. Stephen's Green at 10.45 p.m. I am here to take a sample of your breath.&rdquo;  If I refuse, I am guilty of an offence and liable to jail for six months.  If I give the sample, and it proves positive as a result of drink I took after I got home, I am still guilty of an offence.  This, to my mind, leaves wide open the principle that if a policeman has some justification for thinking that a man is driving erratically or sees him approaching in an erratic manner, then certainly the policeman should take steps and such steps, I think, as were suggested by Deputy Dillon rather than those suggested in this Bill.  But to leave it, for example, wide open for a political opponent who has some spite against me, for some reason or another, to be able to phone up the local police station and to say that I was driving erratically in St. Stephen's Green so that a policeman comes along three hours later to take a breathaliser test <Col N="227" /> is draft.  It is nonsense.  It does not make sense.  I cannot see its being upheld if sent to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann decided to test this breathaliser test live on TV.  One of the reporters on Telefís Éireann drank one glass of Irish whiskey.  He took the test and gave a positive result. We are told by the Minister that one can drink, I think, 2½ glasses to fit in with the formula but one glass gave a positive result with this Radio Telefís Éireann reporter so he was guilty of an offence after one glass of whiskey.  The breathaliser is not proven an accurate instrument.  The television test proved that.</P>
    <P>The British Dental Association made an investigation with people with cavities in their teeth.  It was found of people with cavities in their teeth who took a drink that the alcohol lodges in these cavities which is not the case with people with false teeth or with no teeth or with a full set of good teeth. The reaction to the breathaliser test is quite different.  A far more positive reaction is always procured from a person with cavities in the teeth&mdash;so now it is an offence to have cavities in one's teeth.  One might pass the borderline as a result of not seeing one's dentist often enough.</P>
    <P>I took one or two clippings from newspapers since this Bill was published. In the <i>Sunday Press</i> of approximately April, 1966, Frank Ward wrote that he read of an instance where three liqueur chocolates were taken by a young woman reporter in Britain as an experiment and that she breathed into the plastic bag which is part of the alco-test kit.  According to that device, the alcohol in her case registered at a point which proved she had drunk the equivalent of nine small whiskeys.  This is very pertinent when we consider the Dental Association report.  Obviously, the liqueur sweets lodged in the teeth whereas the nine small whiskeys would mostly pass down into one's stomach.</P>
    <P>The column goes on: &ldquo;While in Chicago I saw seven judges sit down in their circuit court chambers to see if they could produce the alcohol content in the blood.  One of them took three <Col N="228" /> martinis and the other six had double bourbons but none came to the drunk point in the breathaliser.  They then sent their findings to the chief judge of the circuit court.&rdquo;  No matter what we hear about the breathaliser and its use, we find that it is inaccurate and has been proved to be so.  For that reason it should be taken out of the Bill in its entirety, whatever about the blood tests and the urine tests.  Let us get rid of the breathaliser first, even if we cannot get rid of the whole Bill.</P>
    <P>On January 30, 1966, in the John Gordon column of the <i>Sunday Express</i>, it is asked what is the weight of expert evidence which human life leaves to the expert judges and the writer points to two outstanding examples.  One is where traces of arsenic were reported to have been found and it was held that they were administered by the accused person. However, it was ultimately found that the arsenic had been in a filter used in the test.  In the second case, the amount of alcohol reported in the system of the accused person was found to have been enormously increased by the use of an instrument which had been sterilised in alcohol.  I hope the Minister will accept these quotations as evidence that the breathaliser must go.</P>
    <P>I also read an article by J. Devlin in the <i>Licensed Vintner</i>, which could probably be accused of being prejudiced. It appears in the form of a question-and-answer session with Mr. Brian McConnell, the Minister for Home Affairs in Northern Ireland in which he said that before accepting the suggestion of the use of certain tests, it would be necessary for him to be satisfied of the accuracy, reliability and standard of maintenance of these machines which, he said, were still only in an experimental stage.  The Minister also pointed out that the machines, if used in certain circumstances, could not be anything more than a rough indication of the capabilities of a potential driver.  So it is not only here that the breathaliser has been seriously questioned as a reliable instrument on which to form a judgment.</P>
    <P>Another objectionable thing is that this test can be demanded, whether or <Col N="229" /> not the driver shows any visible signs of drunkenness.  This gives to the Garda an excessive authority, an excessive authority which also occurs in section 12.  I know of an individual, an Englishman, now an Irish citizen, who had a serious disagreement with a sergeant of the Garda not so very far away from Dublin, in the Dún Laogh-aire-Rathdown district.  This sergeant was apparently very displeased at whatever took place between the two of them and each time that man drives through the sergeant's district, his car is stopped, he is asked for his driving licence, his insurance certificate, his lights are tested and his tyres examined. This has happened two or three times a week.</P>

      <P>As a result the gentleman in question does not now drive through the sergeant's district. He has found an alternative route into town.  Or take a small town where the sergeant's daughter is married to a publican and where there is only one other publican in the town.  All that sergeant has to do is park himself outside the opposition public house and put everybody coming out of it under the breathaliser test and ask them to take the blood test and the urine test, or else they will go to jail for six months. What sort of legislation is that?  The Minister is taking the power from himself and giving it to the individual garda.  Under this Bill justice cannot appear to be done and individual private prejudice can interfere with the administration of the law.  It is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon rightly quoted Article 40 of the Constitution.  If he had not done so, I would have done it.  It says that all citizens as human beings are equal before the law and that the State should have regard to the different capabilities of its citizens.  Under this Bill the State is not having regard to the different capabilities of people to <Col N="230" /> drink.  It has been demonstrated that some people, after the consumption of two glasses of whiskey, instead of being dulled, are affected in the reverse way.  It could be said that a 20-stone labourer has a much greater capacity for alcohol than a lightweight office clerk but while this might be accepted as a general rule, it cannot be defined as a definite rule.</P>
    <P>How are we going to equate people? How is any judge going to equate people who are not average?  If we are to equate people, a lot of individuals will be left out.  Sections 27, 28 and 29 of this Bill are in serious conflict with Article 40 of the Constitution which says that the State in its laws protects the subject and, as far as practicable, by its laws defends and vindicates the personal rights of the citizen.  I would expect the State to defend my right not to urinate in a bottle at the back of some police station.  As Deputy Dillon so rightly pointed out, a respectable lady is brought in and is asked, not by a bangarda but by the member in charge of the station, who must be a male person, to give a urine sample and I gather it will have to be given where he is a witness that it is a genuine sample if it is to be upheld in evidence. Is this what the Minister envisages? Is this what he has in mind?</P>
    <P>To revert to my original concept, this is an emotional section of a Bill. The Minister was not able to give me any statistical information.  There was no study of statistics.  The Minister was unable to give me any guidance as to why this part of the Bill was necessary. I was given no reasons at all either by the present Minister or his predecessor.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with facts based largely on study carried out by the Council of Europe. I have often heard it said that probably the most effective way to deal with the driving offender is the removal of his licence.  However, it has been found in the United Kingdom as a result of a special survey that the number of people driving cars without holding a driving licence is rapidly increasing and it is suspected that some 75 per cent of the people debarred at some time or other drive vehicles without possessing a licence.  This type of statistical survey should have been carried out by the Minister before he came in here with recommendations. It was found in this survey that 50 per cent of the pedestrians who were killed were either drunk or very drunk.  The World Health Organisation made that report.  Nevertheless, when the Minister comes to deal with pedestrians in section 59, he refers us back to an Act of 1800 and something.</P>
      <P>This Part of the Bill, like practically every Bill we get from the Department of Local Government, is probably put in as a bit of window-dressing in the hope of getting popular political support and not in the hope of dealing with the question of road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the study carried out by the Council of Europe, it was discovered that there is a relationship between accidents and the number of years spent at school and that people who could not hold down jobs for long periods or people who chop and change jobs, people who could not stay in one job, were more prone to accidents than people who stay in constant employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a summary of the report which says that criminologists have known for a long time that short-term prison sentences from three months to six months do more harm than good, <Col N="232" /> that in the past 20 or 30 years, such sentences, therefore, have increasingly been replaced by fines and have only recently become more prevalent again due to the steep rise in road offences. This raises the question of the six months' sentence which runs through this Bill.  Obviously, I am not going to read even the summary of the Council of Europe Report.  I am just mentioning some of the points made there to show the type of study carried out at European level and which should have been carried out here before legislation was introduced.  The legislation should be introduced backed by a study of sociological, medical and educational aspects having been considered.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with what Deputy Dillon suggested, in so far as there is an alternative.  Deputy Dillon suggested that a person suspected of being drunk can be brought into the station and told that he or she will be charged, or they can be charged and they can be told that they may take, in the presence of their own doctor, a blood test or may give a sample of urine and, if they refuse to take this blood test or to give this specimen of urine, this evidence will be presented to the judge and the judge can bear it in mind when adjudicating on the case.  This, to my mind, would uphold the spirit of the Constitution. It would deal with the serious problem of doing away with the basic principle of being innocent until proven guilty, which is a principle we should defend.</P>
    <P>I read of an experiment which took place in one of the States of the United States of America.  In the precincts of the police station, there was a movie camera and a movie film was taken of a person taken in to be charged with drunken driving.  The next day, when the person was about to be charged, he was shown the film.  The result of this experiment was an enormous increase in pleas of guilty, when people saw themselves and their behaviour in the police station.  That is an experiment that the Minister might consider. We must experiment in these fields before we enact legislation that goes to the extent this Bill goes, which is <Col N="233" /> far in excess of what the Commission recommended.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude my references to the drunken driving provisions by saying that the pressure groups the Minister, apparently, has tried to appease are not guilty of trying to make us think as they do but are guilty of trying to make us do as they think.  There is a serious difference there.  I do not think any Government should fall into that trap.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is in section 10, subsections (4) and (5) that we first see this business about people being presumed to be guilty unless it can be shown that the contrary is the case. That section deals with the control and operation of trailers.  No longer can a person get the benefit of the doubt if subsections (4) and (5) of that section are enacted.  In most cases there must be conflicting evidence if the matter is contested.  Every justice should have, and should be guaranteed, the right, when there is conflict of evidence, to give the benefit of the doubt or not to do it, according to his own judgment.  That is what he is there for.  It is not for us to tie his hands in that regard by enacting legislation of this kind.  As I already mentioned, I feel in regard to section 12 that there are sufficient opportunities under existing legislation for the possible victimisation of people by policemen who fell out with them for some other reason and I do not see why we need to strengthen the position in section 12.</P>
    <P>All that I have to say about the Bill is not critical and I have a good word to say about section 18, which relates to the control of driving instruction and which is most timely and essential.  I suspect that without any firm say-so from the Government, or from the Minister, that such-and-such a school is qualified to teach you to drive a motorcar means that there must be people operating such schools who are not qualified, and for the Minister to make regulations in this regard is overdue.  I hope that this part of the Bill will be enacted as it stands.  I can see no reason for any change in it.  If it is enacted, I hope the Minister will not leave it on <Col N="234" /> the Statute Book for a long time and that the regulations will be brought in speedily.  I hope that he has already started to examine the regulations that might be desirable under this section. It is something that was mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Briscoe, on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, and I am delighted to see it incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Of all the matters in section 18 I consider subsection (2) (g) to be the most urgent and the most important. Unfortunately this part of the Bill is spoiled by subsection (4) where it says:</P>
    <P>without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign it or that he was the proper person to issue it, the evidence in any legal proceedings until the contrary is shown of the matter so stated.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this type of phraseology rearranged so that the judge can at least have the minimum of discretion, should there be offences under this section.  It goes on in subsection (6) and this is the underlying feature of the Bill which first made it repugnant to me and not just Part V. I have dealt at greater length with Part V because of my suspicion, because of the different method of drafting this part of the Bill from the rest of the Bill, that it was introduced hastily and emotionally and not as a result of clear, precise statistics of experience in other countries.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is a section which requires looking into.  Section 25 (a) says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2A)  In a prosecution for an offence under this section for driving a mechanically propelled vehicle, at a speed exceeding the built-up area speed limit or a special speed limit applying in relation to the vehicle, on a road in respect of which the built-up area speed limit or a special speed limit is indicated by one or more than one traffic sign within the meaning of section 95 of this Act, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that the limit so indicated applied in respect of that road at the time when <Col N="235" /> the offence is alleged to have been committed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be presumed until the contrary is shown.&rdquo;  This, to my mind, on the same principles as those upon which I have been arguing, does require to be looked into again.  It could be tidied up to conform with the matters about which I have expressed concern.  I was glad that Deputy Dillon referred to section 27 (3) (b).  My comment is that it is one of the worst provisions in the Bill.  It says:</P>
    <P>a person who is or has been in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place with intent to drive or attempt to drive the vehicle but not driving or attempting to drive it and who, in the opinion of the member, is committing or has committed an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>This is something with which the Bill is trying to deal, something which nobody can prove.  It is dealing with conjecture. That is all it can be.  The court is supposed to decide on whatever may have been the guard's opinion at the time and that is very bad.  Then we go on to section 28 which deals with blood tests.  As I have said, the Constitution states that all people shall be equal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that I should draw the attention of the House to the manner in which this matter of the treatment of the disabled is dealt with by the media of public <Col N="237" /> communications.  Yesterday we had here an exercise in futility.  We had a convocation the day before of the Council of State in relation to an archaic provision which has not been implemented for several years, and which has little or no reference to or bearing on the ordinary lives of the people of the country.  We had the Front Bench of Fine Gael filled last night, and we had the ears of certain Deputies strained in a discussion on a matter which I suggest could have been settled in three minutes, without taking up all the time it did, and which is outside and above the concern of the mass of the people.</P>

This is far more important than considering to the extent which was done here yesterday what might happen to a few wealthy people who may be evading tax obligations.</P>
      <P>I feel incensed at the manner in which this whole matter has been neglected so far as the public organs are concerned, and indeed by television. I listened to the news last night during an interval in the compulsive viewing of &ldquo;Rush to Judgment.&rdquo;  It is odd that it should be on at the same time as we had this performance in connection with income tax as a smokescreen.  We heard of Suharto, Sukarno, Grenoble in France, singing in church, Vietnam and Signor Fanfani's views on it, pictures of people being killed in Vietnam, which we see almost every night, mention of the Common Market, the inevitable pictures of the Taoiseach and the farmers, our old friend U Thant, a household figure who is beloved of the Irish nation, the Fenians in the North which is topical, and Jimmy Hoffa.</P>

      <P>We wound up with the Reverend Adam Clayton Powell whose motto, I am sure, is well known to the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;Keep the Faith&rdquo;.  I believe that the question of the disabled supersedes in importance any of these side issues.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as I indicated at some length yesterday, seeks to do something for the disabled.  It seeks to do a very small thing for the disabled. I hope I am not being repetitious, but there are some Members of the House here who were not here yesterday. The Bill seeks to provide by law that every substantial employer shall be required to take into employment suitable disabled people up to a limited percentage to be determined by the Minister in association with the voluntary organisations.  The voluntary organisations which are now dealing with the disabled in such an excellent manner should form a national advisory council.</P>
      <P>I do not yet know officially what the attitude of the Government will be.  I have heard rumours about what their attitude may be, and they are not very encouraging.  I presented this Bill in the most reasonable fashion which it is within my competence to achieve.  I refrained from making the criticisms which would come trippingly to my tongue so far as the disabled are concerned, in the hope that reasonable men can be prevailed upon by argument to see their duty, and induced to do it.  I am still not without hope that that may be the result of my efforts.  At any rate, as the debate progresses we will see what the attitude of the Government is, and the attitude of the Government will determine the fate of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For most of us it is true to say&mdash;for most people; not only for us but for everyone&mdash;that the brightest days are darkened by the sight of disabled people, and particularly handicapped children.  Very few will pass quickly by the collection box without putting something in it on those days when collections are held.  They buy a flag, or they contribute to pools, and so on. When they see someone who is handicapped, the thought comes into their <Col N="239" /> minds of how badly the world is divided, to use the vernacular.  That is all.  It stops there.  Interest after that largely ceases.  Public interest ceases. It is all part of the great development of materialism in the world, selfishness and disregard for the plight of others, and all of us, I suppose, are victims of this trend.  I am probably a greater sinner in that regard than most other people, but there does devolve upon the elected Members of Parliament a duty to devote some of their time to the most deprived of our society.  It does not require much courage to enact a law which will make a very minor change in our social set-up and impose upon substantial employers the obligation to allot a percentage of their vacancies to the disabled.</P>
    <P>Can there be any possible argument advanced as to why this cannot be done in the Civil Service?  Yesterday I instanced a case of a man who had been in the Army, who had developed TB while a soldier.  There was no escaping the fact that it was during his Army service that this disease struck him because he was 21 years in the Army and he was never in any other occupation.  At the end of his 21 years, he was in St. Bricin's Hospital.  Eventually he went to another hospital and had further very considerable ill-health. He got the opportunity of applying for a suitable light job in a Government Department and, in spite of his Army service and the fact that he had incurred this disease during that service, he did not get the job because he could not pass his doctor and was rejected on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of publications existing in relation to the treatment of the disabled in many parts of the world and it often strikes me that if half the money that is spent upon the production of these publications were devoted directly to the relief of the problem, it might be a far better thing.  This does not apply to the disabled alone but to most other governmental activities here and elsewhere. As all of us know, hardly a day goes by but some exotic publication or other arrives through the letterbox.  I <Col N="240" /> challenge any Member of this House to say that he has read every document that has gone through.  I had them weighed on one occasion after a year, and they came to nearly a quarter of a ton, all kinds of things in relation to agriculture, social welfare and so on. There would not be enough hours in the day to read them.  All this money is devoted to the publication of documents that are never read.  That is an aside, but it applies in this case as well as in the others to which I have generally referred.</P>
    <P>However, I have in my hand a document to which I want to refer. It is the Report of the Ninth World Congress of the International Society for Rehabilitation of the Disabled which was held in Copenhagen in 1963.  In page 199, there occurs what is described as an intervention by Mr. A.A. Bennett of the Vocational Rehabilitation Section, Manpower Division, International Labour Office, Geneva, Switzerland, in a discussion on the disabled and the labour market. Amongst many other things he has this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>One of the biggest obstacles to the employment of the disabled is still the pre-employment medical examination which many employers require as a first condition of engagement. This is particularly so in civil service jobs in many countries where the physical requirements for entry are laid down in great detail.  Far too often medical examinations of this kind exclude otherwise suitable disabled persons because they cannot satisfy the rigid and artificially high physical standards imposed which usually have no relationship to the specific job requirements of the actual work in question.</P>
    <P>Is that not true in regard to our Civil Service?  I am sure the civil servants would be the first to admit that though they are often given sedentary jobs which do not require them to engage in any strenuous physical activities, they require a physical standard in passing the doctor more fitted to membership of Rugby Union teams. This seems to be ridiculous, but it is followed because it is precedent, and <Col N="241" /> we know how sacrosanct precedent is in the Civil Service.  If it has not been done before, it is impossible; if something has been done before, it does not matter if it is the greatest crime ever committed against humanity, it is a precedent and therefore justifiable.  This is the kind of freedom we inherited from the British, I suppose under Article 10 or some such proviso.</P>
    <P>While many of the peculiarities of the British Civil Service were admirable and, indeed, are admirable, this business of precedent and the business of medical examinations where they are manifestly unnecessary, particularly as applied to minor posts, cannot be justified.  One hesitates to talk about the major posts that higher civil servants have to fill and the great burden of responsibility they have to discharge. One hesitates to enter that territory at all because of the possible consequences of one's comments, but dealing with minor forms of employment in the Civil Service, I cannot see any reason why the principle of this Bill should not be applied thereunto and to semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The late William Norton was the first Minister to ensure that there were employed blind telephonists.  Now there is a certain proportion of blind telephonists in the Civil Service and they give an excellent service.  I can think of many.  I can think of one not more than 50 yards from the entrance to this House, working in the National Library, an unquestionably good telephonist. There are many other instances which could be cited.</P>
    <P>Think of the very considerable number of jobs which could be made available to those whose physical handicap is not of a major nature and who would be very glad to earn their own living and be of service to the community instead of being dependent upon the miserly few shillings they get by way of disability benefit.  For those partially disabled as a result of accidents, in industry or elsewhere, or who suffer from some congenital deformity, there is no reason why a certain proportion of vacancies available should not be reserved.  The employing agencies which come immediately to mind <Col N="242" /> are the Civil Service, the local authorities, the State and semi-State bodies and other employing agencies supported in one way or another by State funds.  There is no reason why this should not be extended further into commerce and industry generally.</P>
    <P>The inhibiting factor is, of course, prejudice, fear on the part of employers that they may lose money or may not make as much money if they employ physically handicapped.  That has proved to be a fallacy.  I will not bore the House with long extracts from this booklet; mark you, it looks as if this subject does bore many Members of this House.  In this booklet there are many affirmations of the fact that most disabled people have in them an urge to prove themselves, not alone as good as others, but, in many cases, better than others.  That translates itself into making them excellent employees whom any employer would willingly employ if he knew on which side his bread was really buttered.</P>
    <P>However, the inhibiting prejudice is there.  It does not exist in all employers but there are certain organisations which have a prejudice against compulsion, a prejudice against compelling employers to take on certain people even to this very minor fractional extent suggested here.  Such people belong in another age.  Such people get, perhaps, a vicarious pleasure out of the exercise of what they choose to call charity.  That particular kind of charity has not grown in warmth over the centuries.  I am sure the House knows the kind of charity to which I refer.  There are people who luxuriate in self-righteousness.  I make no criticism at all of those worthy people who are doing great work, but there are elements in our community who regard themselves as having a vested interest in disablement or some kind of title to righteousness where the disabled are concerned.  These are the people who argue that these things should be left to the free play of conditions and any action by the State is an interference with human liberty.</P>
    <P>Did anyone ever hear such nonsense? Imagine anyone interfering to <Col N="243" /> the detriment of a badly disabled person or, indeed, any kind of disabled person.  It is possible to drag in this hoary old excuse about the sacredness of the individual and human liberty and the inviolability, moryah, of his right to sell his labour in whatever market is available to him.  How many times have we heard this nonsense? There is no market, and if such a person appears at the gate of a factory, looking for a job, his very appearance will condemn him.  Yet there are people who push these nonsensical ideas.  I refer to this in passing now; I shall refer to it in greater detail later.  I trust those members of the Government who have been displaying recently a certain liberalism of thought will join me in condemning these attitudes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to Mr. Bennett dealing with the question of resettlement.  At page 199, he says:</P>
    <P>In the long run the ease or difficulty of resettling the disabled depends upon the state of the economy and the existence, or otherwise, of full employment.  In a buoyant, expanding economy, where labour is hard to come by and workers are sought in all quarters, it is not difficult, often quite the reverse, to fit disabled persons into suitable job openings.  But in a stagnant economy, in times of depression, or where there are problems of overpopulation, heavy unemployment or under-employment, which is unfortunately only too common in many parts of the world today, the situation is quite different.  The placement of anybody is difficult.  The disabled more so.  We should be deceiving ourselves if we pretended otherwise.</P>
    <P>I referred to that yesterday.  We are in a condition of unemployment which appears to be, if anything, worsening. We have 6,000 more unemployed this year than we had this time last year. If things go on as they are, it does not appear as if the situation will rectify itself to the advantage of the national economy.  In that situation, it is all the more necessary that we should have <Col N="244" /> laws to protect the weakest and the weakest in our society are unquestionably the disabled.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate what the Bill provides: the Bill provides that a register should be set up by the Minister for Labour in which any disabled person could apply to have his name entered as a disabled person; the Bill provides that there shall be placed on every substantial employer&mdash;I repeat, because it cannot be repeated too often, beginning with the Civil Service, the semi-State bodies, the local authorities and all other State or semi-State agencies, or employing agencies of any kind supported by State funds, and going down the line to substantial employers of all kinds&mdash;the obligation to provide out of any future vacancies a certain number of jobs suitable for disabled persons.  The number will be determined by the Minister in consultation with a national advisory council which will have consultations with the provincial advisory councils.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to assume that the national advisory council will be composed of representatives of the Minister, the trade unions, the employers and of the various voluntary bodies who are so highly experienced in this field.  The number of people to be employed by a substantial employer would be a matter for determination by the Minister in consultation with these interests.  As I said, this legislation has been on the Statute Book in Britain for the past 24 years.  It was brought in by a Labour man, Ernest Bevin, but welcomed, I notice in Hansard, by every Party in the House of Commons.  So that everybody will have a clear idea of what the Bill entails, there is no attempt made by me to say how many workers an employer should be required to take on.  Even if he were to take the English example of three per cent, is that not a very small number?</P>
    <P>The Minister may have consultations with these other interests I have mentioned and may, if he thinks it desirable, designate certain forms of employment as being particularly suited to disabled people; for instance, forms of light work in the Civil Service of a semi-manual or partly clerical <Col N="245" /> nature.  We can all think of instances in industry and commerce where there are jobs for which partially disabled people would be suitable.</P>
    <P>That, more or less, is what is in the Bill.  It is a very modest proposal for the relief of a long-suffering section of the people.  Inherent in it, of course, is the question of whether or not the Government are going to accept what one can describe as a socialist principle, that is, that the Government, the central authority, accept the responsibility of discharging a social obligation to protect the needy.  This Bill, in its small way, can divide people, divide progressives from reactionaries.  I was going to use another phrase, but I shall leave it on the shelf for future use.  It can enable the Government to demonstrate what they have for so long claimed&mdash;a preponderance of concern for all the children of the nation.  It can show where the Government truly stand&mdash;with the most helpless or with prejudice and reaction.  That is the simple issue.  But I am not pressing it in that sense.  I am not endeavouring to give this very simple Bill any high titles or clothe it in glittering garments of righteousness.  I am simply trying to help these people, and I ask the House very sincerely to bring to it their utmost attention&mdash;to bring to this problem the sympathy and concern which I am aware, knowing most Members of the House, they feel in their hearts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a well-intentioned Bill and it is at least entitled to the most careful consideration.  I regret I have not gone into it in anything like sufficient detail to speak intelligently on it.  Listening to Deputy Dunne for only a short time, I have got a rough idea of what he has in mind.  As he says, the biggest factor operating at present against the employment of the disabled is the fact that we have in this country between 63,000 and 64,000 unemployed.  It is a question of the survival of the fittest in a scramble for too few jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two questions I <Col N="246" /> should like to ask Deputy Dunne. Perhaps he dealt with them when I was absent.  He referred to the fact that there has been legislation in Britain for the past 24 years in relation to compulsory employment of the disabled, but he did not tell us&mdash;not today at least&mdash;how well this legislation has worked there.  I have heard considerable criticism of it.  I have heard it said that it has worked very badly.  I admit I am only saying what I heard about it and I have no sound reasons for believing whether that is true or not.  But I would like to hear Deputy Dunne tell the House how well this legislation has worked.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to hear from the Minister in the course of this debate is how well our efforts up to date have succeeded.  How good is the placement service?  How good is the general rehabilitation service? What, if any, improvements have we in mind in relation to the placement of disabled persons?  I dislike compulsion because I feel the very word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; is something that does not appeal to our people here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy but I would like to ask him one question: Is not the entire body of law compulsion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might agree to go a certain part of the way with the Deputy, but the point I am making is this.  You are dealing with incapacitated or partly incapacitated people. You speak about manual or partially manual work.  Manual work is often very suitable for a disabled person.  If such a person is mentally disturbed, there is nothing at which he is more contented than partially manual work. Such people have a limited capacity for partially manual work, but unfortunately this is not recognised.  The unions should consider that a partially disabled person would not be entitled to the same remuneration as a person capable of going out and taking his place in competitive employment. There is not much charity in industry and commerce today, either here or elsewhere, because industry has to compete and it can only compete <Col N="247" /> without raising prices, if it gets the same output from the disabled person and gets that output at the same price as from the ordinary fit employee.</P>
      <P>The voluntary organisations have done a good deal of work in this field and have got insufficient recognition and insufficient State assistance.  An effort is being made at present&mdash;I do not know how good it is&mdash;to improve the placement service and give it financial assistance and, I suppose, the partial direction it needs.  A voluntary agency has a far better chance of finding employment for the disabled or partly-disabled than has a State organisation.  What voluntary agencies need are recognition and assistance and, from the experience I have&mdash;I have some experience in this field because we have partially disabled people in the institution to which I am attached&mdash;I have found a great measure of co-operation and sympathy in securing work for partially disabled people, but at the same time, the product of the disabled must be as good as that of ordinary workers simply because it must go to the same market and the job must be well done and done at the right price.</P>
      <P>There may be need for the type of legislation Deputy Dunne proposes but I think we have not tried out sufficiently the machinery and organisation at present available to us.  If it were given the assistance and encouragement it needs and also the publicity it is entitled to get from the State, and if we first appealed to the various employment agencies and industries either to employ disabled people directly or assist people who are trying to employ them, assist them by giving them suitable work to do, it would be a big step forward.  In every industry there are jobs particularly suitable, I should say, for disabled people, but I think it is better to hand out that sort of work to an individual employment agency that is set up and is suitable for this type of people who require such close supervision in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many disabled persons do not require that sort of supervision and, as Deputy Dunne says, they are as fit to do certain jobs as any medically <Col N="248" /> fit person.  In some cases they may be even better but if proof can be produced that they are in fact so capable, I think there would not be any difficulty about getting an employer to take them on, in the first instance, on a short-term trial basis and either prove or disprove that they were able to fill the position satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The voluntary effort has not been sufficiently tried and those working in that field have not been State-assisted sufficiently and encouraged by the State Departments concerned up to the present.  It will be very interesting to hear what the Minister can tell us in relation to future plans for the employment of disabled persons and how far they expect to advance on the present situation.  I should like to hear if we have any count of the present number of disabled or partially-disabled people and what percentage of them is already placed and in what type of employment, how much the State is doing in this regard and how much local authorities are doing and where the greatest response has been up to now.  I believe that an agency that is not a State agency has done very successful work in the placement of disabled persons but has got insufficient assistance up to now.</P>
    <P>I fear my contribution to this debate has been very scrappy but I want to support any effort that would have the best effect in finding employment for these unfortunate people and to that extent I think this Bill merits the closest examination.  If it is found that it is not the most suitable type of legislation for this purpose, I should be very interested to hear what alternative the Minister has to offer and what he thinks of the facilities available for dealing with this problem up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in principle with Deputy Dunne's proposal but I feel that those who have any close contact with disabled people would conclude that his proposal is not the answer to their problem.  First, I do not think any disabled person would like to go into employment in the circumstances envisaged. They are a very proud people. <Col N="249" /> Before going further, I want to pay tribute to two organisations in Cork city, the Cork Polio Association and the Spastic Clinic which are doing tremendous work in this field.</P>
      <P>One must first assess the whole position as regards the people seeking employment and try to find out what kind of employment is most suitable.  Many of them have taken up employment in Cork industries and some, we hear, are doing excellent work and any of their employers will give them excellent references.  There are others who prefer sheltered employment, such as when industries send work to their homes so that they can work at home.  I do not think we should talk about telling an employer to employ physically handicapped persons.  The Minister should direct his attention to the many organisations catering for such people and with the co-operation of such organisations as I have mentioned and the unions and the employers, I believe some definite policy could be implemented for the employment of the disabled.</P>
      <P>I have pretty close contact with the physically handicapped and on many occasions on which we discussed this, it was found that in the case of about 90 per cent, employment on their own merits rather than by compelling anybody either to give out work to them at home or take them into a factory, was what was required.  I really appreciate what Deputy Dunne has said but I do not think this is the answer to this problem.  I would rather see the Minister, as I have said, directing all his energies towards the many organisations who are providing shelter employment, who are trying to build factories for the physically handicapped, to the many industries throughout the country who are distributing their work to these people and to the trade unions who, to my mind, are more sympathetic in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, all this must be assessed and then we should see how best we can tackle this whole problem.  I feel there is something like a &ldquo;for God's sake&rdquo; attitude about this whole matter. It is like going to a physically handicapped person, who is a very proud <Col N="250" /> person, and saying to him: &ldquo;Look, it is hopeless; we cannot find employment for you; we will just have to compel an employer to employ you.&rdquo; I feel it would defeat the whole attitude and principle of those voluntary organisations who are working for the disabled. I would ask Deputy Dunne to consider that aspect of it and have second thoughts on moving to compel employers to employ the physically handicapped.</P>
    <P>Many of these people are quite capable of employment and have proved that but I think it would be very wrong to compel anybody, either the employer to employ, or the person concerned to take up employment in a particular industry.  I had no intention of speaking on this until I came into the House but, as one who has some contact with the physically handicapped, I feel this Bill would defeat the whole attitude and principle of the many voluntary organisations working in our city of Cork and throughout the country in their efforts to try to provide the necessary employment, the shelter of employment for the physically handicapped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill introduced by Deputy Dunne and the Parliamentary Labour Party.  I feel confident that Deputy Dunne, in particular, has already won the commendation of all our people for his tact, wisdom and foresight in putting forward this measure.  Any measure which has as its aim the alleviation of human suffering and misery deserves the full support of this House and the Irish people.  It is a simple measure but its repercussions will be far-reaching in that, for the first time, it will give hope anew to a section of our people who, up to now, have had no real hope in life, no real opportunity in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed by the comments of Deputy Wyse and I sincerely hope the sentiments he expressed do not represent the views of his Party and the Government who, to all intents and purposes, have accepted this Bill in principle; they at least have allowed it to be printed and come in here for Second Reading.  I heard the Deputy say he spoke having <Col N="251" /> come into the House only within the past hour and I excuse him in very large measure for what he said on those grounds.  It is clear to us that Deputy Wyse did not have a true understanding of the intentions of this measure and it was quite incorrect of him to imply that there is any element of compulsion in this measure directed to the disabled persons.  There is compulsion in respect of disabled persons to come in here for Second Reading.  I and there always has been, because they have been condemned to exist at a subsistence level, condemned to a position about which no one seemingly cares.</P>
    <P>Despite the great work of the voluntary organisations, the State, up to now has failed miserably to tackle the problem of the mentally and physically retarded, and the disabled generally. We all have evidence of that as members of our local health authorities where we know there are mentally and physically retarded children, as well as some adults&mdash;waiting interminably for proper institutional treatment, waiting five, six, seven or eight years to find a home where they can be suitably trained and their aptitudes developed.  Therefore, until the advent of the voluntary organisations in very recent years, nothing was done to help the disabled in this country and we want to pay a tribute to those voluntary organisations who have done very commendable work in the setting up of establishments where these people are trained.  This is very laudable work and it is quite evident now that these voluntary organisations could not, and cannot, be expected to take on the full brunt of this responsibility. Clearly they do not have the financial resources to cope effectively with this gigantic problem.  They are depending, in the main, on fund-raising efforts of a voluntary kind, on what is commonly known as the non-stop draw means of raising money.</P>
    <P>Alarm was rightly expressed in the papers in recent days by reason of the suggestion that the Irish Hospitals Trust might depart from their present method of fund raising and enter into this field of the non-stop draw, thereby destroying the hopes of many of those <Col N="252" /> voluntary bodies and charitable organisations of continuing in this fund-raising effort.  Certainly, if such a gigantic organisation as the Hospitals Trust were to enter this field of financial endeavour, they would make things, to say the least, very difficult for the Rehabilitation Institute and such bodies who are doing very commendable work.  That is not to reflect in any way on the outstanding work of the Hospitals Trust, but many believe they would be better disposed by continuing to raise their moneys in the traditional way by means of sweeps, which one might say have an international character, rather than by making inroads in the manner I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse will appreciate that there is no hope that these people will ever get reasonable jobs if the State does not come to their rescue. Clearly, normal persuasion has failed to convince employers and the State of their obligation to come to the aid of the disabled by placing them in employment. That being so, it is only fair to suggest that some element of compulsion should be applied and that this House should be asked to enact legislation making it obligatory on employers and the State to provide a minimal number of jobs for these persons.</P>
    <P>The number of jobs is not stated in the Bill.  Something like three per cent of the labour content in any worthwhile enterprise could hardly be objected to.  I anticipated that there would be opposition to this measure because I can understand the difficulty of enforcing such a measure in a country scourged with unemployment and under-employment.  It is easy to bring a measure of this kind before the House and insist that an employer, according to his capacity, should employ a number of disabled persons but it becomes a difficult thing in a situation of a surplus in the labour market at all times.</P>
    <P>Clearly, employers want the very best, the most effective, the most intelligent, the most energetic workers.  It can be understood, therefore, that there <Col N="253" /> will be ingrained reluctance to employ people of lesser capability.  Employers may feel that it would increase costs and reduce production, but in a Christian society such as this, it is only fair to recall that many employers have realised the need and have engaged a number of these disabled people and put them to productive work.  Many of these employers pay glowing tributes to the work of these persons. When properly trained and put to suitable occupations they can be very effective and cannot be regarded as a burden on the employers concerned.</P>
    <P>We are also aware there may be reluctance on the part of trade unions to agree to the employment of such persons.  Again, where there is a constant surplus of labour, it is understandable that many unions might embark on a closed shop policy in order to maintain the security of their members, but I feel sure that this measure sponsored by the Labour Party will receive the enthusiastic support of the many trade unions in the country.  We believe that despite the fear that exists of under-employment and unemployment, the trade union movement, because of its social philosophy and its conscience and its desire to help the under-privileged, will support this measure as far as they possibly can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton rightly adverted to the conceivable objections of employers and unions to a measure of this kind. He said an employer could hardly be expected to pay the same rate of wages to a man or woman so handicapped as he would to a normal, energetic employee.  I do not think an issue should be made of this.  It is usual and customary to negotiate for benefits at this level and it has never, to my knowledge, been a problem.  Wage rates have been agreed on and increases granted on the basis of suitability and ability and there never has been any real problem in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne has outlined the problem of the medical examination which is a prerequisite to securing employment in this country.  It is normal practice, on the recruitment of new labour, to have a medical test applied <Col N="254" /> and this is a real barrier to progression as far as handicapped people are concerned.  The medical test is a rigid one and if there are any signs of impairment of sight, of limb or of mental retardation, a person is unlikely to get a job.  Here again it is desirable that the State should help.</P>
    <P>What we are asking in this measure will not prove to be a great imposition or a hardship on anyone.  We feel that all Christian-minded people who are aware of the problem will react spontaneously and enthusiastically to this measure and help to implement it. It is a hopeful sign that the Government have seen fit to have the Bill circulated and at least put through the House for a Second Reading.  We hope it will commend itself to everyone in the House and the country.  It has been demonstrated practically and effectively in Britain during a number of years and they have a very high percentage of disabled persons as a result of the various wars in which they have been engaged.  Therefore, I think the State should face up to its responsibility and not leave such a formidable task to the already heavilyburdened voluntary organisations. They are grappling with it as well as they can but obviously they are incapable of making any real impression on this serious situation.  The Government are now being afforded an opportunity of making a very practical contribution to the welfare of all the disabled in the country in ensuring that those people are put to suitable work.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the inadequacy of institutional treatment, the extreme difficulty in securing beds for the mentally and physically retarded, the difficulty of finding a place even with the rehabilitation institution for that kind and the difficulty of securing admission to the various training centres.  Those people who cannot find admission to training of this kind are expected to live on what is termed a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  This allowance stood at £1 per week for a great number of years.  I believe it was Dr. Browne, the then Minister for Health, who first introduced the idea <Col N="255" /> of the disabled person's maintenance allowances.  He provided them at £1 a week and for a considerable number of years, despite the spiralling cost of living, these allowances remained static.  Only in recent years were they increased to 25s and they now stand at 27s 6d per week.</P>
    <P>There is the tendency not to apply a disabled person's maintenance allowance to anyone for whom there is a hope of being trained.  There is, to my knowledge, as a public representative, a reluctance on the part of the authorities to grant a DP allowance, lest it might dissuade that person from taking up light work of some kind or other.  Some people seem to think that the granting of a disabled person's allowance would act as a disincentive in the future.  Consequently we have a large number of those people who have no income from any source at all. We are not merely asking for a minimal allowance of this kind from the local authorities; we are concerned about helping those people to pick up the threads of life, to achieve a sense of independence, of wellbeing, of standing on their own two feet and providing in some measure for their own livelihood.</P>
    <P>Those who are afflicted with disablement of some kind suffer this great lack of independence.  They have the feeling that they are a liability on their families, that no one cares for them and that they will never be able to provide a means of livelihood for themselves.  This is the sorry situation which we have to remedy.  This Bill very definitely gives new hope and new courage to all those disabled persons, in the clear knowledge that where moral, Christian persuasion has failed to make the Government do their job in respect of those people, this measure will at least provide that in every worthwhile undertaking, wherever there is substantial employment of labour, a minimum of those categories of unfortunate people shall be employed in the future.</P>
    <P>It is not right that people should talk of compulsion in regard to this matter.  There is no compulsion on disabled people to take a position if they <Col N="256" /> do not want to take it.  The element of compulsion in this Bill, as far as the employer is concerned, is very slight, if any at all.  We have not specified the number of persons per 100 who should be employed.  We have merely said that in Britain the number is some three per cent.  If that is thought to be too high, let us reduce it but at least let us open this door of new opportunity for disabled persons.  Let us not allow the Bill to fall by reason of a difference of opinion about percentages.</P>
    <P>It is with those sentiments that I second this Bill and commend it to the House.  I feel sure that Deputy Dunne has the blessing, the gratitude and the support of all right-thinking people in this country in relation to the measure he has introduced.  I am sure also that if left to a free vote of this House, it will receive overwhelming support.  We have not yet heard the views of any Government spokesmen, except those of Deputy Wyse, who was sceptical about the aspect of compulsion.  I sincerely hope that his views are not the views of the Government on this matter.  I would ask all my colleagues in this House, irrespective of Party, not to fail to avail of this unique opportunity to make rapid strides forward in a very practical way towards solving, or helping to solve, this problem of the most unfortunate and helpless section of our community, the disabled persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the bringing of this measure to the House helps to underline the magnitude of the problem with which we have to deal, it will have justified itself for that reason alone.  I do not know, any more than the previous speaker, what the attitude of the Government to this measure will be.  I think Deputy Treacy was not quite aware of the wonderful and very adequate work which is being done by certain voluntary organisations in the country.  I, like Deputy Wyse, live in Cork county and I think I can claim, without being called chauvinistic, in respect of local pride, that Cork, in many ways, was the birthplace of any help for the unfortunate people to which this Bill applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Polio and After-Care <Col N="257" /> Association has been very generously encouraged by the Minister.  It has done an immense amount of work and it has employed many of the people referred to in this Bill on its own premises.  The same can be said for the Cork Spastic Clinic and the Cork Rehabilitation Institution.  They all do wonderful work.  I do not know how things are in Deputy Treacy's part of the country or in the parts of the country where other Deputies come from, but if the same voluntary effort is put into attacking the problem in other parts of the country as has been put into it in Cork, I do not know if any necessity for this Bill arises.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that the Department have generously aided those organisations.  No doubt no matter how generous a Minister may be with any number of organisations, the organisations would feel that there is room for further generosity.  I would prefer to see a generosity of the type experienced from the Minister already.  I feel that once State interference comes in the door, voluntary effort goes out the window.  I do not think anything could attack the problem as well as the type of voluntary effort which has been put into this matter in Cork city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to something to which I referred on the Health Estimate last week.  It is undoubtedly quite true that a great threat to the continuation of the type of effort I have been referring to here is that there should be a suggestion from the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes that they would engage in active competition with people like the Cork Polio After-Care Association who rely almost entirely on the proceeds of the weekly pools they run.  If Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes are allowed to engage in this activity, I feel there will be an immediate need for some measure such as this, but if the close liaison which has been maintained between the Department and those organisations continues and if the availability of funds which is afforded to these organisations by their weekly pools continues, this will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>If this Bill prompts the Department to popularise the formation in other parts of the country of voluntary organisations <Col N="258" /> similar to the one to which Deputy Wyse and I refer, the Department would be doing a good day's work and would be certainly going some of the way without any element of compulsion towards absorbing these unfortunate people who, through no fault of their own, cannot actively compete in the labour market.</P>
    <P>I commend the spirit in which this Bill was profferred to the House.  I do not know if any of its proposals are practicable.  My objection would be that too much State interference where there is already voluntary effort is not a thing greatly to be desired.  I hope the Minister will indicate that he has a benign attitude towards the efforts I refer to and that the Government generally are keeping in mind the problem which is presented to us, a Christian community, by those unfortunate people whom we find in our midst.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated my interest in this problem last year when I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Health.  I mentioned that I thought the Government should make a start on employing disabled people and I suggested some of those people should be taken into the Civil Service.  I then thought, and I still think, that there are many people rejected for various jobs in the Civil Service because of health conditions, particularly heart and chest conditions, which would not prevent them from working efficiently there.  Deputy Dunne has taken this idea a step further.  He proposes to pass this measure through the House as an Act. I think this is a laudable effort and we must all appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first things that strikes me about this is how you decide on those people who would be included in the register.  One would want to know. Would it be necessary for them to have had some training?  Would they have to have attended an institution for some time or would they have to be approved of by some rehabilitation society or organisation?  It would be unfair to ask an employer to take on such people without the employer <Col N="259" /> having some understanding as to what they were capable of doing.</P>
    <P>Another thing that strikes me is this: when one thinks of the rural areas and some of those disabled people who have been employed, they have their difficulties.  When they leave their home, it is essential that they have a patient and considerate landlady or else they must live in a hostel.  I know that in some cases these people are not satisfied with that and they have returned home.  They just seem to miss that satisfaction and contentment that Deputy Dunne hopes to provide for them.</P>
    <P>The element in this Bill which makes it objectionable is the element of compulsion on employers.  One feels that an employer must have the right to decide whom he employs and whom he retains, particularly if they are unsatisfactory. This is a right it would be difficult to take from him.  The number of employers in my area is very limited but my experience of them is that particularly in the breadwinner section they have a fair share of disabled people in the upper age groups on their books and they keep them in employment because they have sympathy for them.  Those people are breadwinners and they feel that to terminate their employment would mean that their families would suffer.</P>
    <P>If we compel those employers to take in a certain number of people, three to six or whatever it may be, in the lower age group, I feel there will be a tendency to displace what I call the breadwinners the employers are now carrying.  I feel that this, in the long run, would cause a bigger problem than the one Deputy Dunne is trying to cure.  I propose to conclude with those remarks.  I do not like to accept this compulsion end of it.  I do not think it would work.  It would be unsatisfactory.  I think it was Deputy Clinton who suggested that we should still rely on voluntary effort and persuasion rather than anything else, and I agree with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I wish to compliment Deputy Dunne on his initiative and on the way <Col N="260" /> he has brought this measure before the House.  I happen to be a member of two boards which deal with the type of person in whom he is interested and with whom this Bill deals.  One is the National Organisation for Rehabilitation and the other is in my own constituency, the Toghermore Re-ablement and Training Centre and I can appreciate therefore the laudable sentiments of Deputy Dunne about finding employment for disabled persons, whether physically or mentally disabled.</P>
      <P>One of the points which, like other Deputies who have spoken from this side of the House, I do not like in this Bill is this matter of compulsion.  One volunteer is better than 100 conscripts at any time.  When you compel people to do something which their hearts are not in, no matter what legislation is to govern that, you will not get the same result as if the action were voluntary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was going through various sections to most of which I took exception and some of which I approved of.  I hope the Minister will read the remarks I made before the adjournment.  It is not in order, nor is it my wish, to go over the same ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My last remarks were on section 27 (3) (b) and I should now like to refer to section 34.  I referred to it in dealing with Part V of the Bill in my general statement.  This is a section under which a person can be found guilty of an offence which he has not, in fact, committed.  I explained that a person like myself leaving this House <Col N="261" /> after a long day, going home and having his first drink of the day at home, could be approached by a police officer up to three hours afterwards who could say to him: &ldquo;We had a complaint that you were driving erratically in St. Stephen's Green two and a half hours ago and we now have reason to believe that you may have alcohol consumed and so you must take the breathaliser test.&rdquo;  If it is positive, in accordance with section 34 of this Bill, the person is guilty of an offence which he did not commit.  This is a bit totalitarian and I do not think the Constitution or the House can uphold it.  I suggest that the section as it is put here is badly conceived, badly drafted, bad in its intention and bad in any interpretation that can be put on it. To my mind, it must be taken out.</P>
    <P>In section 37 (3) we come to what the Minister should have done before he attempted to put such a drastic piece of legislation on the Statute Book.  The section prescribes:</P>
    <P>The Bureau may, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister, arrange for research into&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the physical and mental fitness of drivers of vehicles,</P>
    <P>(b)  the medical aspects of road safety,</P>
    <P>(c)  the effects of the consumption of intoxicating liquor or the taking of drugs on drivers of vehicles and the methods of measuring such effects,</P>
    <P>(d)  the methods of determining the extent to which alcohol or drugs is or are present in a person's body.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Bureau may, with the consent of the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  arrange for the supply and testing of equipment or apparatus for the obtaining or testing of specimens of breath provided under this Part,</P>
    <P>(b)  render such assistance, whether financial or otherwise, as it thinks proper to persons carrying out or intending to carry out research of a kind which the Bureau is by this Act authorised to carry out.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of that section had <Col N="262" /> been in effect here for some time and if the things which the Bureau are empowered to do had been done and had the Minister been able to come here and say: &ldquo;This research was carried out and these are my findings,&rdquo; excepting the conflict I see with the Constitution, I would be in favour of this Bill.  These things have not been done and the only conclusion I can come to is that this particular part of the Bill is giving in to people who are seeking prohibition or total abstinence, and not for the purpose of increasing road safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon dealt with section 41 at some length.  I should like to know why this section was put in at all. Surely you cannot set up a Bureau like this, that may through some mistake or other or through its own inefficiency deprive a person of his character and of his livelihood and then say they cannot be held responsible.  Section 41 would leave this Bureau in a position in which it could not be prosecuted and, therefore, it can be as irresponsible as it likes and there is nothing the man in the street can do about it.</P>
    <P>That is what is in the Bill; but there are things which are not in the Bill and which I should like to see in it.  However, there is one other thing to which I should like to refer first.  It relates to the provision for restoration of licences by the Minister.  I was opposed to this power of the Minister being taken out in the previous Road Traffic Bill.  I thought it was a useful safeguard to have in legislation.  I think, especially as I have not seen any newspaper since this morning, that if the leadership of the NFA agree to take up the offer of peace and new co-operation in their dispute with the law, the Minister can only restore the licences if this section is passed.  Under the legislation we have, these licences cannot be restored after a period of six months.</P>

      <P>I cannot discuss the affairs of the NFA, much as I would <Col N="263" /> love to, on the Road Traffic Bill.  If laws are prescribed under a Bill passed in this House, judges have discretion to impose sentences as they see fit.  The Minister has no discretion to reverse the decision of the judges under existing legislation, unless this Bill is passed.  If Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick believes that the Minister should not have this power, let him say so and say so openly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other instances, which have been referred to in the past, where this provision is necessary.  It occurs to me that people engaged as professional drivers, van salesmen, commercial travellers, merchandisers, advertising agents, advance men, and so on, are dependent on their driving licences for their livelihood. They are all very much aware of that fact and these are the people who will be most careful not to take any chance that will lose them their driving licences.  If a judge were confronted with one of these people, having committed an offence, and somebody else who is not dependent on a motor car for his livelihood and the judge imposes the same suspension on both of those people, the man who is dependent on that licence for his livelihood is, in effect, being fined £500 more than the other man and he certainly could not get a relief driver for anything under £14 to £15 a week. There would be an imbalance and, I think, from court to court different judges have different views.  There should be a higher authority that could balance the weight of evidence and the weight of the effect of the sentence on the individual concerned.  I am glad to see this section coming back and I support it absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is stiff is proven by the fact that over 50 per cent of new applicants for driving licences fail in their first attempt.  It is right that this test should be stiff.  This is the type of thing we should do first because it is the bad drivers who cause most accidents. Statistics show that less than three per cent of these accidents are caused by <Col N="264" /> people under the influence of drink. That is the only statistic we have available. The relevant statistic in Northern Ireland is between three and four per cent.  They have statistics there but we have none.  The Bill is presented without statistics.  However, the last we had was that less than three per cent of motor accidents are caused by people under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>Eventually, the new applicants get their licences and reach that degree of proficiency which I think, quite rightly, they should have.  We let them out on the road where the vast majority of drivers would have no hope whatsoever of passing the test, never mind at the first attempt but even at their second or third attempt.  The new drivers who have acquired the requisite degree of efficiency go out with the bad drivers and pick up all the bad habits and the object of this stiff test is defeated.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take steps, under the regulations he can make under the previous Acts, to extend the area of driving tests.  Let him do it by age groups, in alphabetical order, and so on, but the sooner every driver holds a licence which is up to the required standard of efficiency the sooner our accident rate will come down.  Our accident rate is much lower than that of most other countries.  It is probably only half the Northern Ireland accident rate.</P>
    <P>Another consideration that must be taken up is the fact that when an insurance company is going to insure a driver for the first time, or on a change of company at some subsequent time, it does not ask him if he takes a drink but it asks him his age.  In certain age groups, they impose a levy.  They used also put a levy on actors, Jews and commercial travellers.  The levy on actors and Jews has now been lifted but it remains for commercial travellers. I realise that country travellers have a greater road mileage but not city travellers.  What we gather from the insurance companies is that we should be concerned with age groups. The insurance companies consider age significant while they do not consider the question of whether or not a man takes a drink significant in any insurance cover.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> There is nothing in the Bill that I can see that deals with wandering animals.  I think that wandering animals and unlit vehicles parked on the side of the road contribute very greatly to fatal accidents throughout this country.  It is time very serious consideration and positive action were taken in respect of these two factors. This is a matter which has come up time and time again before the Irish Commercial Travellers Federation from the rank and file members for consideration by the executive.  The executive has sought an interview with the Minister who has acknowledged by letter their representations but has not met them.  People who are professionally required to drive in their jobs are concerned much more by wandering animals and unlit parked vehicles than they are about the remote danger of meeting an irresponsible drunken driver coming against them or getting in front of them.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with everything Deputy Dillon said.  He was quite unkind to the Fianna Fáil Party, as such, in some of his remarks.  However, in the more responsible part of his contribution, I agree almost entirely with what he said.  If this Bill passes in its present form, it will be a matter for the Council of State and probably for the Supreme Court.  Article 40 of the Constitution is quite precise.  I cannot see how sections 27, 28 and 29 of this Bill could possibly be proven to comply with the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the study that has been carried out by a committee set up by the 18 nations of the Council of Europe.  One of the points they noted is that unless a driving offence case goes to a higher court, very little note is taken of any record the person might have outside a driving record.  If there is a minor sex case, note is taken of everything&mdash;of the person's mental condition, and so on.  However, if there is a road accident, everything else does not matter very much.  It is pointed out in this report that Doctor Selling in 1949 had a survey of 500 drink offences at the traffic court in Detroit. He found that only two per cent in <Col N="266" /> these 500 cases were not suffering from some classifiable mental illness and that includes alcoholism, by the way&mdash;only two per cent.  My complaint is that this type of research has not been done here.  We cannot say that this would be the situation if such research were carried out in the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Report says that there is a growing body of research which shows that some motoring offenders have characteristics that are typical of offenders whom we normally call criminals, namely, evidence of personality disturbance, poor school and employment records, unhappy marriages, previous convictions, possibly low intelligence and excessive contact with the rescue type of social service.  This is a matter which I am sure the Minister did not take into consideration when he was farming this Bill.  This is a report by a committee of 18 nations of Europe.  They made this report for a very good reason&mdash;because, in 1964, 68,510 people were killed in these 18 countries and 1,840,910 injured.  The economic losses caused by traffic accidents correspond roughly to between one and 1.5 per cent of the gross national product of most European countries. So, as I say, the Council of Europe realise the great loss that traffic accidents cause both economically and in terms of human suffering.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the provisions in this Bill, when enacted, will help the situation.  As I said earlier today, in countries on the Continent, where they have breathaliser tests, blood tests, and so on, the record of accidents is far worse than it is here. It would be much better for them to adopt our present system which, in my view, if applied correctly, is adequate to deal with any problem we might have in this regard.</P>
    <P>It transpired in the research of the Council of Europe that there is a growing number of people driving vehicles without a licence and without insurance because they are unable to procure the driving licence.  They instance the case of a young boy who has got his first autobike or motor cycle.  This machine is his very life.  He commits <Col N="267" /> an offence and is debarred from cycling for a year or two years.  Can anybody reasonably expect that that boy, if he gets the opportunity, will not take out that bicycle and cycle it again?  These are matters that should be considered. In our laws and in all our approach to this whole problem, the emphasis is on deterrents and retribution.  The European committee claims that the emphasis should be on reformation. That is the key word, &ldquo;reformation,&rdquo; not as is provided here, deterrents and retribution.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect which is important and which should be examined by the Minister, that is, that there should be a medical examination for applicants for driving licences. Experts of the Council of Europe agree that if there were such a check-up, the number of accidents would most likely be greatly reduced.  This examination would naturally reveal any infirmities that might lead to accidents. These experts also state that applicants for driving licences, after their test, should be told of any infirmities that might make driving more dangerous for them than for other people.  A candidate for a driving licence would have to be told, for instance, if he had a tendency to epilepsy, which has been the cause of a number of accidents.</P>
    <P>Apparently the only thing we, the drunken Irish, can suffer from in this country is too much drink and that is all we have to safeguard against.  In Europe, it has been recognised that infirmities such as epilepsy have been as great a cause of accidents as other factors.  I opened with a quotation from ancient times and I would like to conclude also with a thought from ancient times.  It is from Polypus who said in 125 BC: &ldquo;A statesman who is ignorant of the way in which things originate is like a physician who does not know the cause of the disease which he tries to cure&rdquo;.  The Minister does not know the cause of the disease which he is trying to cure and therefore does not know how to cure it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the fact that the issue at stake here is the saving of life, the contributions of the <Col N="268" /> last two Deputies could be described as hilariously funny.  I have not heard anything as funny for years as the remarks of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lemass about the effects there might be on unfortunate rich old ladies who might be seriously discommoded if they were found drunk in charge of a car.  These Deputies feel that it would be just too bad if these rich old ladies should be put to the indignity of doing certain things which would not be wrong at all if they were to apply to what Deputy Dillon calls a coal heaver from the East Wall.  How foolish or stupid can we get in this House?</P>
      <P>This Bill is a definite attempt to cure or prevent a serious social evil and the comment made by Deputy Lemass that some kind of pressure group is being built up by the anti-drink people to force the Dáil to take certain measures is too stupid for words.  I am a Pioneer but that does not mean that I object to anybody else taking drink.  If people want to drink and can afford it, that is their business.  Nobody I know of in the non-drinking organisations has any objection to people drinking in their own time, if they do not make a nuisance of themselves outside this House or inside it, but when they do indulge and try to force their views on everybody else, we are all inclined to take umbrage.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Bill lays down that a person found in possession of a car and showing evidence of driving erratically may be asked to take a breath test.  Apparently Deputy Lemass does not know that the results of this breath test is not evidence of an offence in a court of law.  If the breath test gives a certain reaction the Garda are entitled to ask that that person go to the local Garda station and have further tests carried out, either by the police doctor or by the person's own doctor.  Deputy Dillon's harrowing description of the unfortunate who may have a Baby Power and a small syphon in his car, who has a crash and ends up unconscious, and is then dragged into the local Garda barracks instead of to a hospital is too ridiculous for words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sort of overplaying of an argument <Col N="269" /> does not do any good.  I believe that this test is, if anything, a limited test.  The allowance of 125 milligrammes of alcohol to each 100 millilitres of blood is quite generous. Deputy Lemass does not even appreciate the fact that what he argues should be in the Bill is, in fact, in it. The person who is able to take more drink than another person is subject to this particular test.  Deputy Lemass seems to ignore that and to be under the impression that whether a big man or a small man takes a drink, the same result would follow from the same quantity of alcohol.  This is completely ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the faith which Deputy Lemass seemed to have in random cuttings from various newspapers and magazines, including <i>The Licensed Vintner.</i> He seemed to think that these quotations were absolute proof of his argument and ignored the fact that the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The necessity for the amendment of the Road Traffic Act of 1961 arises mainly out of the report of the Commission on driving while under the influence of drink or a drug which was presented to my predecessor in 1963.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to give the information that Judge Davitt, President of the High Court, was Chairman of that Commission and that it was established in 1961.  Deputy Lemass apparently did not hear that, did not read it and does not know it.  Deputy Lemass was apparently under the impression that this was something that should not be done, that no research into the matter had been undertaken. That seems to me to be somewhat foolish.  For somebody of Deputy Lemass's standing, it was worse than foolish.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a rash of references to the constitutional issue at the present time.  We will need to be very careful on the questions we put down because I have no doubt, a Minister will get up and refuse to answer a question on the ground that it impinges on the constitutional rights of some individual or Deputy.  The <Col N="270" /> dire threats to the Minister of referring this to God knows whom were just a little bit silly.  Either we are going through with this or not.  If we feel strongly enough about it, we will vote for or against it.  We introduce amendments if we are allowed and, if we are not allowed, we should keep our mouths shut.  That is my attitude to it.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion that in the case of a driver who had been out in a car and had gone home and in his own home consumed liquor, a guard could come in within three hours and say, &ldquo;I heard you were driving erratically and I am taking you to the station for a blood test&rdquo;, that is not provided for in the Bill.  If it is, I cannot find it.  We will see.  As far as I can find, Deputy Noel Lemass's interpretation on that issue is entirely wrong.  If a person is found in charge of a car, he can be taken to the station but there is no suggestion that he can be arrested in his own home afterwards on some anonymous report that something happened several hours earlier.  I think that is not in the Bill.  If it is in it, it should be taken out, but I do not believe that it is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We do tend to stick to Part 5 because it appears that we think the Bill was brought in for the purposes of Part V.  There are quite a number of important issues covered in the Bill but there are a number of important matters that are omitted and which, in my view, should have been included.</P>
    <P>There were references to the question of drivers' licences and the tests which should be carried out.  I was intrigued by Deputy Lemass's suggestion. Having said that it was a desperate thing to take a driver's licence away from somebody on suspicion that he was drunk, he followed that up by saying that everyone should have a medical test in addition to a driving test and if the licence was taken on medical grounds, that was all right.  I do not agree that the driving test at the present time is fair.  I believe that the people carrying out the driving test are not doing a good job; they are doing a damn bad job.  I say that because of the fact that numerous people have been failed the test because <Col N="271" /> they used the mechanical signalling devices on their vehicles and did not use hand signals.  Who uses hand signals?  Does the Minister's driver use hand signals?  Does anybody here use hand signals?  It is absolutely ridiculous to continue to fail people for not using signals which are absolutely out.  We are back in the Stone Age.  We might as well say that a man should be failed because he had not a whip to crack out of the window to show that he was in control of the ten or 12 horses, as was the practice when driving first started.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I consider to be awfully stupid and about which the Minister even at this late stage might do something.  His predecessor said that the first opportunity he would get he would try to have it remedied. Somebody applies for a provisional licence and gets it and while in possession of it, his wife or mother or girl friend asks: &ldquo;Why do you not apply for a test?  You will pass the test easily.&rdquo;  He puts it on the long finger. Eventually the wife, mother or lady friend makes application in the person's name.  He passes the test.  He knows all the answers.  He is refused the licence because, when he comes to sign the document, the signature is not the same as the signature on the application form.  Could anything be more ridiculous?  It should be quite easy for the examiner to say: &ldquo;Let me see your provisional licence, which is signed&rdquo;, and if the signature on the provisional licence is the same as the signature on the document stating that he has passed the test, that should end the difficulty.  It seems very stupid that a person should be refused a licence because of the fact that the signature on the application form is not his signature. The original application may have been sent in as a matter of form and could be typed or printed, for that matter.</P>
    <P>There is another feature, showing how unfair driving tests are.  I have had half a dozen cases where people have been driving lorries for years as a means of livelihood.  Deputy Lemass spoke about the number of people <Col N="272" /> abroad, particularly in England, driving without a licence.  A number of people had been for many years driving them on licence and had renewed the licence and eventually it was forgotten about. When a bit of tightening up started they discovered that it was five years since the last licence was issued and that they must do a test.  Just imagine the reaction of a man who had been driving a ten-ton truck for 30 years and never had an accident when some whippersnapper driving tester tells him that he cannot drive even a two-ton truck.  I know of one case where a man with a wife and nine children to support lost his job because the driving tester said he was not able to drive. There are other cases where a man does a driving test and the truck he uses is a two-ton truck and because it is under two tons five cwts. he cannot drive a three-ton truck and subsequently has to do another test, and all this sort of nonsense.</P>
    <P>While I agree that it was right that some type of test should have been introduced, the matter is not being handled properly and will have to be regularised.  Teething troubles can cause queer things to happen but we should be over the teething troubles by now.  To try to lay down the law in the way in which it is laid down is not correct.</P>
    <P>A number of references were made to the question as to whether or not the Minister has the right to restore licences.  Personally, I disagree with the right of a Minister to restore a driver's licence because the Minister is leaving himself open, rightly or wrongly, to suspicion of political patronage.  If a man who belongs to the Minister's Party succeeds in getting his licence back while a neighbour who does not belong to the Party, who loses his licence for some trivial matter, does not get it back, that will cause a lot of talk.  Ministers may not mind what people say about them.</P>
    <P>I saw an extraordinary thing happening recently.  I am not going to talk about the NFA, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in case you think I am, but I saw a group of farmers going into court and, because of a certain manoeuvre <Col N="273" /> they carried out on one day, losing their drivers' licences and in the same court was a young brat who, some weeks previously, had been arrested for driving an untaxed, uninsured car, with no brakes and practically nothing on it. He had no driver's licence.  The driver's licence, which he had not got, was taken from him and he was suspended for 12 months.  A few weeks afterwards he stole a car, crashed two other cars with the stolen car.  The Guards found him and he smashed up the car he had stolen.  He said he had had drink.  Possibly that was the reason for the accidents.  He was taken into court with the farmers and had his licence suspended again and was sentenced to nine months in St. Patrick's.  One week afterwards I saw that young man driving a car around the country&mdash;the same car in respect of which he was charged, with no tax, insurance, or anything else.  Is it any wonder that some people say there is a peculiar type of administration of law in this country?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the question of the sergeant prosecuting some friend of his and stopping him every time he passed through.  I find it very hard to believe that.  If anyone I know had that type of experience, of a guard persecuting him, I would settle it very quickly.  I would go to either the superintendent or the Minister and I would tell the sergeant or guard that first.  I simply do not believe that a member of the Force would go to the trouble of trying to work out some kind of vendetta on an individual.  If he is doing it, he must be extremely stupid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in particular, referred to the fact that this Bill was going to give to the Garda the power to haul in unsuspecting persons to the barracks, that people were going to be dragged into the barracks on some pretence.  I do not think that that is going to happen.  We have a very poor idea of our Garda if we believe they are going to do that.  That should not be considered at all.  Incidentally, Deputy Lemass referred to pedestrians and he was very agreeable to the idea that the pedestrian who was caught under the influence should experience the full <Col N="274" /> rigour of the law and it seemed to follow that when a pedestrian gets into a car, he is a different sort of animal and should be exempt.  As long as he is on his two feet, he should not be allowed to move around and any penalty that could be imposed on him should be imposed on him.  I agree with Deputy Lemass and Deputy Dillon about the man who has had a few drinks and goes into the back of his car to sleep them off.  I do not think it is right that a man should be taken as being in charge of a vehicle because he does this and be charged with driving or attempting to drive dangerously. It is far better that he should do this than go into the front of the car and drive off and possibly hit something on the way.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Lemass about this question of animals.  For the past 12 or 18 months, it seems that there have been more stray animals on the road than there have been for many years.  There should be a special section to deal with this problem.  In my own constituency, two young men returning home after a dance struck two wandering horses.  It was bad enough that the owner of the car was killed but it was worse that the owner of the horses had the neck to sue the unfortunate family of the boy who was killed and got a decree for £160 because the horses were killed.  This problem should be dealt with in some way and the Minister now has the ball at his feet and should deal with it within this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of unsafe vehicles is mentioned in the Bill and I agree that it is long after the time when dealers should be allowed to sell unsafe vehicles.  It is long past the time when a dealer, whether he be a garage owner or some kind of secondhand car dealer, should be allowed to sell to some unsuspecting person a car which has no brakes, or which may have defective steering, or other defects which are likely to cause accidents. I am satisfied from my own observation&mdash;and I travel more than practically any other Deputy because I drive over 1,000 miles a week&mdash;that time and again accidents are caused <Col N="275" /> by the use of defective vehicles, by using vehicles which perhaps have bad tyres, or faulty steering, or no brakes, or bad lighting.  People seem to be able to get away with this all the time.  The way to stop it is to get at the source and the people who sell such vehicles should be liable to punishment.  If they were, there would be fewer defective vehicles on the road.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very long speech and I listened to the whole 38 pages of it, which included the one in Irish at the front.  It was quite an ordeal for the Minister and I can assure him that it was a great ordeal for those who were listening and that is no reflection on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite an ordeal to listen to that long speech. While it was very important that the matters in it should be covered fully, I still believe there was a lot of repetition. In the Bill there is a reference to abandoned vehicles.  Abandoned vehicles have been a bone of contention with local authorities over the years, and nowhere more than in this city.  One can look down practically any street in the city and see a vehicle abandoned on the side of it.  I had an experience some months ago in regard to a vehicle which was abandoned near my office.  Somebody threw a lighted match or a lighted cigarette into the vehicle and it took two sections of the Fire Brigade to put out the fire.  A number of the cars which were parked close to it did not benefit as a result of the conflagration. I understand that there is likely to be a claim for malicious damage to the vehicle concerned, although the tyres were gone and practically everything that could have been lifted off it had been taken by passers-by.  People who do not want these cars just push them into the side of the road and leave them there.  It is about time the necessary action was taken.  Those vehicles can be identified if the necessary steps are taken and if a few people were prosecuted, it would probably put an <Col N="276" /> end to the practice which should be stopped.</P>
      <P>There is also a reference to the appointment of wardens.  I would be very careful about giving wardens the right to inflict fines on the spot.  It is one thing to have the police doing this, but if every Tom, Dick and Harry who has a warden's uniform on is put in the position that he can fine people for parking or some such offence, then quite an amount of resentment is likely to grow up towards those people.  The Minister should have another look at this before he puts it into operation. I agree that it is rather a pity that garda who have been trained to do a special job should be wasting their time on traffic work, but at the same time, this is something which cannot be allowed to get out of hand.</P>
      <P>There is also a reference to compulsory insurance and something which has been drawn to my attention on several occasions recently is the tendency by people, when a State vehicle is involved in an accident, to be very chary about taking any action against the State.  Most people seem to feel that it is a question of going to court with the devil and holding court in hell, that they have not a hope of winning the case.  There have been a number of cases where people had very valid claims but because the people on the other side were the State and the case could be defended with unlimited money many cases were dropped.  I know of one case which involved a little boy who was knocked down by an Army lorry and his bicycle was smashed.  He has been attending hospital and his father, who is a butcher with a small income, has been paying a weekly amount to the local hospital for attention to him.  The only reason no case is being taken is that they feel the State cannot be contested and that it would simply mean that they would not win it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference in the Bill to the weight of vehicles and the damage done to roads.  I am glad that something is being done about this because it is a very cumbersome job to try to get the people whose vehicles do the damage to roads, and particularly to <Col N="277" /> road bridges, to meet their responsibilities. The fact is that up to now it has simply been the weight of the lorry or the vehicle that was counted and the wheel base was not taken into account, which meant that some huge lorries were allowed to operate and to do very great damage without any hope of recovering compensation from the firm concerned.  I am glad that something is being done, but I am not satisfied that this will go the whole way towards what should be done.  It is an attempt to remedy a rather awkward situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite complicated and I am sure there will be a very interesting discussion on it during Committee Stage.  Up to the present most speakers have referred almost entirely to the drunken driving section.  As a driver, I think it is time something was done to prevent the present situation from getting worse.  Deputy Lemass referred to the fact that according to statistics taken some time ago&mdash;and the Minister says they were abandoned because they do not truly interpret the position&mdash;only three per cent of the accidents in this country were accidents involving drink.  That represents a very high number of people.  I believe that even one life is very important, and if these regulations would save even one life only, they would be very well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke about the accident rate in this country <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries but I think he forgot the density of vehicles.  I understand that in Britain the rate would be one vehicle to 15 feet of road if all the vehicles were on the roads.  Here the rate is one vehicle to something like one mile or 1½ miles of road.  If that is true, I can understand why there are more accidents in Britain.  That did not seem to strike Deputy Lemass as an argument which might affect the issue.  Even if our roads are still relatively traffic-free, if we keep on at the present accident rate, it will be only a relatively short number of years until everyone in the country will have met with an accident.  That is a sobering thought.  When you divide the number of people who have met with accidents <Col N="278" /> on the roads into the population, you find that within a relatively short time everyone will have been hit by something.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also include the question of traffic control in this Bill. Even with a relatively free flow of traffic at present, unnecessary congestion is caused by the use of the roads in a certain way.  I travel a good deal on the Dublin-Belfast road and even within the city precincts, without going outside at all, it is not unusual to find someone with a slow-moving vehicle driving along the centre of a four lane road.  Unless you break the law by passing inside him, there is no other way of getting by.  It is quite usual in the evening going out of town to find a queue of vehicles half a mile long driving behind some stupid person who insists on having his right-hand wheel on the white line in the centre of the road.</P>
    <P>There used to be people called &ldquo;courtesy cops&rdquo;.  The motor cycle police do not seem to consider it necessary to talk to such a driver or, if there are a number of slow-moving vehicles, to attempt to get them into a lay-by until the faster traffic goes by.  This is done in other countries and there is no reason why it should not be done here. We have some heavily-laden lorries, but most of those drivers seem to have much better road manners&mdash;and a lot of the accidents go back to road manners&mdash;than other types of people. There are some people who insist on driving in the centre of the road and using far more of the road than they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the people who do the tests for the driving licences insist that hand-signals should be used, most drivers of motor vehicles on our roads give no signals at all, good, bad or indifferent.  They just cut in and out any way they like.  It should be an offence to move from one lane to another without giving the proper signal. The Minister might consider including these items in some section of the Bill. It is six years since we had the last Bill of this type.  The Minister rather apologised for introducing another Bill within such a short time, which suggests <Col N="279" /> that it may be quite a long time before the next Bill is introduced.  That being so, there is no reason why he should not attempt to include all the loose ends in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To go back to what seems to be considered the kernel of the Bill, the question of testing for drunken driving is tied up, in my opinion, with the question of whether or not the person concerned was driving erratically before the garda stopped him.  I remember some years ago when there was a court case in which a man was charged with hitting another vehicle. After he had been charged, someone was produced who swore that he had been driving up on the bank half a mile away from where the accident occurred.  This was ruled out as being irrelevant and having nothing to do with the case.  I thought at the time that it had a lot to do with it, because it proved the man had been driving erratically before the accident occurred. If the type of test which is now suggested had been in operation then, there would have been no doubt about the result.</P>
    <P>There was another case recently in which a boy, who, as they say where I live, has not a whole shilling, had a motor scooter.  He had no tax, no insurance, and no driver's licence.  He collided with another motor vehicle and he insisted that a garda should be sent for.  When the gardaí came, they did not charge him.  The man who was driving the vehicle had a few drinks taken and he lost his licence for 12 months and he lost his job for good&mdash;and a good job he had.  These are matters which have to be taken into consideration when a Road Traffic Bill is being considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the administration of the Bill will be the responsibility of another Minister, but he must see to it that the highest possible standards are included in the Bill.  I would seriously say to him that the comments of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lemass, who seemed to find common ground against the Bill, would suggest that he should discount their arguments.  It appeared as if they were <Col N="280" /> speaking for some type of group, not exactly a pressure group, who think they are entitled to be heard but are not prepared to agree that the other side of the story should be heard.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, as a Pioneer, I have no objection to people drinking. I do not mind a man drinking if he wants to, but if he does he should not get behind the wheel of a motor vehicle after taking a lot of drink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker rightly remarked that this Bill is not solely concerned with Part V.  There are other very important provisions in it.  I propose to deal with Part V when I come to it in its order.  There can be no doubt that we need to reconsider this problem of the roads.  There can also be no doubt that the Minister is fulfilling his ministerial duties only in bringing this provision before the House.  Furthermore, in the very nature of this type of legislation, there must be discussion on it and it would be rather extraordinary&mdash;in fact, it would be very disturbing&mdash;if a Bill of this nature were to pass through the House without having the benefit of some amendments arising from the discussion.  I am pretty certain that will happen in the case of this Bill.</P>
      <P>However, let us be clear in our minds as to what is the purpose of the Bill and ask ourselves, first of all, are we for or against it?  That is the real function of the Second Stage; we go into details on the Committee Stage. Let us ask ourselves, therefore, should provisions be made on the general lines of this Bill?  We are all agreed that the general provisions relating to vehicles call for review.  Part I is Preliminary and General.  So far as I have looked through Part II, it seems to me to be a Committee Bill, and we can deal with any problems arising there in Committee.  All that is necessary to say on this Stage is that the approach to this legislation is to be welcomed, that if we are going to provide for the future, some move in these directions is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before leaving Part II, a few general remarks might be in order.  I agree with Deputy Tully it is dangerous to consider that, because we have at the <Col N="281" /> present moment a relatively low accident rate, the problem is not as important here as elsewhere.  Deputy Tully has drawn attention to traffic density. This is a great social problem.  With the increasing number of motor cars, when indeed the motor car is rapidly becoming a necessity for the individual this problem will grow.  There is going to be a further aggravation of the problems which are already there: the problems of traffic control, traffic flow, road safety, vehicle disposal and vehicle maintenance.  All these problems are inescapable in front of us and now is the time to consider them.  The Minister was being unnecessarily apologetic in bringing in this Bill.  As I see it this problem is likely to grow until it reaches saturation and at that stage if we are doing our duty as representatives of the people, we must be prepared, by legislation, to cope with the problems as they arise.  This is a subject on which one cannot hope to legislate finally and to say: &ldquo;That is done for good.&rdquo;  Changing circumstances will evolve here and with these changing circumstances legislation will have to evolve.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with driving licences.  This is essentially an amending part and it raises some interesting points some of which have been raised already.  It is very necessary that all new applicants for licences should be competent.  It is not a question of the better way; there does not seem to be any other way than to have some system of controlled tests.  That in itself creates problems.  The problems that will be involved here will be the type of problems that should be involved in policing generally, the type of problems involved in the courts where one human being has to make decisions for another.</P>
    <P>In this regard I should like to make a couple of suggestions to the Minister. I should like to emphasise they are merely personal opinions.  Sometimes we are inclined to be dogmatic about our personal opinions and fail to differentiate between what is just an opinion and what is a grounded argument. For that reason, with a certain amount of deference I make the following statements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> There is always the danger that people carrying out examinations will be hidebound by certain formalities of procedure.  They must be bound by procedure to some extent, but they may be so bound that they lose sight of what they are after.  It is most important for people who are testing for driving licences never to lose sight of the fact that it is not a mark-scoring competition but that they are really there to find out if the applicant is competent physically and technically safely to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle on the road as a normal unit in the traffic flow.  The important point is to see that they are competent drivers and not that they are erudite in a number of disjointed rules.  It is perfectly conceivable&mdash;and this is a defect in all examination systems but we cannot do without examinations&mdash;that a person can be very glib in doctrinal details and deficient in essential knowledge or skill.  I should like the Minister, in so far as that aspect can be emphasised&mdash; this is an administrative rather than a legislative matter&mdash;to bring home the importance of that point.  I was tempted to deal with that by Deputy Tully's reference to hand signals. Deputy Tully should be aware that hand signals may be most essential in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I for one would be prepared to listen to the people who have studied the matter more closely and who have more experience, but I would suggest that co-relative with ensuring that the people who test are testing for the essential&mdash;I am always assuming that there is no prejudice or anything like that&mdash;we must ensure the competence of those organisations that have been brought into being by legislation, that is the schools of motoring.  A school of motoring can be a very excellent thing.  It is very proper that if we are going to have driving tests there should be some institutions available for training people.  For that very reason these institutions are of interest to the Minister and to all who are concerned with this subject.  However, there should be some approach to seeing that there is a uniformity of doctrine, if I may say so, that the same spirit animates these schools as well as the <Col N="283" /> testers.  There is one danger in it.  These schools will be commercial enterprises. There can be certain drawbacks in approaching the matter from that point of view but, on the whole, it is preferable that they should operate in that way, rather than that they should be in any way State controlled, or anything like that.  The important thing is that these schools should be in reality schools designed to fit the driver into the scheme of traffic.  They should form an effective part of our attack on what has now become a serious social problem.</P>
    <P>Any further detailed comments on this can, perhaps, be better made on Committee Stage but, just as it is right to consider the whole question of vehicles in Part II, so in Part III, in relation to driving licences, after the experience we have had, it is right to consider this question of the attitude of testers.  I have no grounds for making complaint here.  The approach of schools of motoring to the problem is of no little importance.  I drive a great deal.  I have driven for quite a long time.  I am impressed as a driver by some of the younger people who have taken up driving in the last year or so.  I put that down to the good influence of training.  One notices amongst the younger drivers a certain uniformity of good practice, something that did not evolve by accident, and I can only suspect that this is one of the beneficial effects of our earlier legislation in this regard.  It is a matter, I think, of reasonable approach.  Here, again, I am tempted to agree with Deputy Tully.  It is better for us to look at all this from the point of view of preparation of the driver for the road, of preserving safety through traffic control and proper procedures, rather than relying on penalties and deterrents, although these will also be necessary.</P>
    <P>I come now to Part III.  This Part raises for me, and for a number of Deputies to whom I have talked, a rather fundamental problem and one which is not easy of solution.  Indeed, it is even difficult to state it for the reason that the very stating of it may <Col N="284" /> seem to imply some failure on the part of someone or other charged with a duty.  I want to make it quite clear at the outset that anything I say in this regard is said with a complete understanding of the various people who are confronted by the problem. Realising that then, we have, I think, to try to see how we will help these people to face these problems.  The people primarily concerned are the Garda.  As Deputy Larkin said the other night, and quite rightly, we have too small a force available to cope with essential traffic problems.  We are, perhaps, dissipating the energies of the Garda on incidental problems.  If that is so&mdash; I am afraid it is&mdash;the question is how are we going to effect economy of force and how are we going to get maximum efficiency?  It seems to me that our approach must be conditioned by two considerations.  First of all, let us get our priorities right.  What are the priorities?  Where are we going to concentrate? Secondly, having regard to the available administrative forces, including the police force, how are they to be disposed in accordance with our priorities?</P>
    <P>With regard to priorities&mdash;I shall refer to this again on Part V&mdash;we should, I think, ask ourselves what are the real problems on the road?  Is it the maintenance of speed limits?  Is that a priority?  Is it a question of traffic flow and, as Deputy Tully indicated, regulating traffic?  Is it a problem of the drunken driver?  Is it the problem of the parked vehicle?  Is it the problem of the animal?  All these are problems.  Where are we to start?  We cannot make a major isolated attack on all simultaneously with any degree of success.  Let us be practical.  Let us take, first of all, the question of speed limits.  As I said, my comments are being made without any reflection whatever on the forces involved in maintaining these.</P>
    <P>After the last Act, there was a rash of speed limit signs, particularly in the city of Dublin.  These are very important in certain places.  For instance, the 40 mph limits in the environs of the city were not only necessary but beneficial.  The same is <Col N="285" /> probably true of speed limits in country towns between faster stretches.  However, take this city: from Ballsbridge and corresponding areas in, there is a speed limit of 30 mph.  How many people are keeping to that speed limit of 30 mph?  I have experimented a little for some time with this.  I find that at 30 mph, I run a grave risk, particularly if there are cars parked, of being the slow driver holding up everything.  Secondly, the number of vehicles which pass me out are flouting the law.  They are a reflection on the law.  The law is flagrantly broken. Whether we like it or not, we have a situation in which a speed limit of 30 mph in the city of Dublin is being broken with utter regularity.  Occasionally the police, when they can get a stretch, try to control it.  Mark you, it is not easy to control it, especially when there are cars parked at the side.</P>
    <P>By and large, that speed limit is being violated and we have the very undesirable situation in which citizens are habitually breaking the law.  When that is done, the law immediately comes into disrepute.  That is something to which we must have regard in this House.  I am speaking now only of the city of Dublin.  In many of the speed limit areas of 30 mph, traffic will not go unduly fast and any vehicle that exceeds it is doing something which is obviously dangerous and the driver of the vehicle is driving dangerously.  It is not merely a question of 30 mph.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, a car coming down Northumberland Road, which has a 30 mph limit.  Most vehicles in the normal flow of traffic will run in or about that, maybe up to 35 mph or maybe, in other circumstances, down to 20 mph.  The general flow of traffic will be such as to control itself, with the result that anyone driving dangerously will be as dangerous at 30 mph as he is at 40 mph.  That is essentially a separate offence.  I ask myself in such a situation, again confining myself to Dublin and the centres of other cities and towns, whether such low speed limits are helpful or desirable.  They are undesirable if they are not capable of <Col N="286" /> being enforced.  They are undesirable from two points of view&mdash;as giving an impossible problem to the Garda and inducing the citizen to break the law.  Inevitably, there will be an unjust consequence because sometimes&mdash;occasionally it does happen&mdash; the Garda in an effort to perform their duty, catch somebody&mdash;and that is just a poor unfortunate who is caught.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in regard to speed limits.  One Deputy suggested there should be an overall fairly high speed limit for the whole country.  It is absolutely necessary in certain small towns and villages, where the main road runs through the centre of the town, to have speed limits.  I can think of certain such towns, but they are not in my constituency and I will not presume to name them.  It may well be that in such cases the limit should be down to 30 mph.  But, in the main, these are towns you approach from a fast stretch and go away from into a fast stretch.  As I say, a speed limit there is a necessity, but it is also relatively easily enforceable.  If discrimination is used in matters of this sort, the guards' problem is made a practical one.</P>
    <P>As far as Dublin is concerned&mdash;and the same may apply to the centres of the bigger cities and towns&mdash;the actual speed of traffic itself will exercise a control.  Therefore, the speed limits there can be higher or more average. The guards, if necessary, can be further empowered to deal with the irresponsible person who drives regardless. I realise that the matters I am dealing with now can provoke a debate, but, from a certain amount of experience, I put that aspect forward to the Minister. The indiscriminate labelling of speed limits by local authorities can be a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Basic to all this is the question: is speed the problem?  My own view is that speed can very well be a problem. I believe speed is often a big element in accidents and that it will be necessary to control it.  Therefore, speed limits for stretches and zones will be necessary and must be maintained.  But, if we are to maintain them, there must be an adequate force of gardaí to deal <Col N="287" /> with them.  This brings us to what is in many ways the kernel of the problem. I agree with the Minister, and I think any other Dublin Deputy will agree, too, that it is undesirable&mdash;I mentioned this on the Estimate for the Department of Justice&mdash;to have highly skilled and trained gardaí wasting their time, if you like, going around putting tickets on windscreens.  It is a waste of trained resources.  It also is bad in a subtle way for the image of the Garda with the citizens.  Some systems of wardens or auxiliary force should be added to that.</P>
    <P>Look at the parking problem here in the city.  That is tied up with the whole question of traffic flow.  In certain areas&mdash;Merrion Square, for instance, just outside the House&mdash;it is not a question of parking but a question of double parking.  You will find people temporarily double parking and blocking the traffic.  Any one vehicle may move on in a minute but, as soon as it does, there is another to take its place. While this is going on, you have around the corner in a side street the two guards for the area completely absorbed booking numbers for parking.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, this is also tied up with the experiments made in regard to freeway runs in Dublin.  I would like if the Minister would give us some information as to how that has been working.  Traffic flow, as I said, is like the flow of electricity&mdash;you have to consider the complete flow pattern. There will be some parts of that flow &mdash;through arteries&mdash;which are wide enough to take parked cars and there will be other parts which need every inch of the carriageway to keep the flow going.  That is a planning problem that only the people who have studied it and worked out a scheme for the whole area can answer.  Therefore, there is not much use in my pursuing it here.</P>
    <P>Complementary to that there is the question of the driver.  Therefore, having dealt with what our attitude to speed limits should be, what about the general competency, courtesy and order of the driver?  We will be coming in a moment to Part V of the Bill which deals with other offences.  Where <Col N="288" /> do we stand with the driver?  It is very clear that part of the congestion of the traffic in this city at peak hours is due to the fact that Dublin drivers do not seem to understand properly the concept of lane traffic.  The layout of our city is difficult enough.  Very often you meet the type of driver Deputy Tully mentioned, the driver who is, perhaps, too cautious and too slow, the driver who stops at the traffic lights and waits until the green is fully on before he wakes up to make a move with his gear lever, the driver who weaves from one lane to another because he thinks he will make progress, the driver who lies in on the left-hand side, although he knows in a few hundred yards he is going to turn out to the right.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing, more than anything, is our traffic problem in the city. How can we deal with the individual driver and the by-no-means criminallyminded driver?  I am sure many Deputies have noticed this sort of thing.  Suppose you are seven or eight vehicles back at the traffic lights.  You watch the lights, and if you have a stop watch, you could see how long it would be before you could allow your vehicle to move after the light has gone green.  It is a very interesting experiment because it will show what time blocks can take place in traffic. Almost invariably you find that you are a considerable time stopped before you can move your vehicle because the car in front of you has not moved because the car in front of it has not moved.  Although there is bound to be some time lag, it is often out of proportion to what it should be.  Why? Because drivers wait; they are not alert; they wait until the green is fully on and go through the whole process of becoming conscious of it, putting the car into gear and letting out the clutch, or if it is automatic, it does not seem to be very much quicker.  Then they drive off.  Then, there is the question of acceleration.</P>
    <P>Although it might be very good practice from the point of view of vehicle maintenance, I wonder in the teaching schools which I mentioned, are people being taught that they should not make the moves to start <Col N="289" /> until they see the green light?  One would imagine the driver waiting with his clutch out and his car in gear.  Is there something in our doctrines that needs to be looked at?  There may be something here concerned with mechanical maintenance which conflicts with what I am suggesting.  However, it serves to illustrate the point that traffic flow problems are not, I submit, problems of speed mainly.  As I shall say on Part V, they are not mainly problems of drink.  Even the safety angle of it can be traced to pedestrians running out or drivers not being alert and running into the back of somebody else's car.</P>
    <P>For instance, this morning I noticed a driver in front who was chatting to a companion and was slow at the traffic lights.  A car behind nearly ran into her.  She was slow in starting and the other driver had obviously become impatient and cut out on the inside, like Deputy Tully's driver, and there was nearly a brush between the two vehicles because he kept going and she kept going, and then he cut out in front of her.  It was an interesting case because it was hard to see how you could apportion blame.  The blame essentially on the first driver was the irritation of the second driver caused by a certain lack of skill.  He was, probably, from the legal point of view, the more culpable.</P>
    <P>That is an instance of the type of problem with which we have to deal. There is only one way of dealing with it and as I see it, it is (a) by education and (b) by proper policing.  You can only have proper policing if you have sufficient gardaí free to concentrate on the job.  You cannot expect a garda to keep the whole Statute Book in mind and enforce all of it simultaneously. He must get some practical help and direction as to what the priorities are and he must have sufficient support.  He must not be asked to do too big a job.  I am using that to reinforce the argument for liberating as many of our gardaí as possible to do essential jobs and getting non-essential jobs done by auxiliaries, if possible.  There, I am completely behind the Minister.  Here also the <Col N="290" /> question of the strength of the Force and the type of gardaí needed arises. The gardaí needed for this work are motor cycle and ordinary gardaí.</P>
    <P>Another thing that strikes me as regards the policing of our roads is this: too often at peak hours now we find our patrols completely immobilised. The habit seems to be growing of adopting the practice very largely at certain traffic control points of a motorised garda coming along and immobilising himself and taking control of the traffic point.  Is that the wisest way of disposing of him?  I am still talking of Dublin and its surroundings, the part of the country I know most about.  During non-peak hours, there is least need for detailed policing when in fact the only thing that goes wrong is the fellow who is positively a criminal and should be locked up in any case.  It is a matter of chance whether he is caught or not.</P>
    <P>At peak hour, there is need for these gardaí to be present and perhaps by driving along to correct motoring faults.  I also think motorised gardaí should be close by at peak hours to assist the pointsmen.  We still leave the whole load to the pointsmen and I have seen a pointsman placed at one junction in this city but, in effect, controlling a complex.  For instance, you will find a garda at the south or east side of Leeson Street Bridge at peak hours controlling the traffic and very often he is assisted by a motorised man at the end of Fitzwilliam Street.  Very often, there is no assistance and the unfortunate pointsman on the far side of the bridge has to control the whole complex.  It is quite a task.  Frequently, one finds the same thing on both sides of Ballsbridge.</P>
    <P>Traffic lights are not the complete answer; they are very useful and fulfil a great function.  They are generally successful but they require the supervision of a human brain sometimes at certain points at peak hours.  It is very gratifying to find that the young trained gardaí are up to the standard of their predecessors and are very good at traffic control.  Considering their numbers, they are extraordinarily good at it, but my point is that the men actually on point duty at this critical <Col N="291" /> period need supplementation by their motorised colleagues.  I shall not try to develop the argument any further because, frankly, I do not feel I am expert enough or competent enough to analyse a problem like that in detail. I have no doubt those with more experience than I have would have arious criticisms and answers to what I have said.  I am content to have raised the problem.</P>
    <P>I should be content to raise the problem and, as in other matters here, I am very content to take the Minister's answers in these matters because, after all, we should realise the Minister is in the best place to have all the best advice available on these matters. We can help with our discussion, but it is no harm for all Deputies to realise <i>prima facie</i> the Minister in charge of a measure is better informed and more likely to have the answers than we, especially in matters of this nature.  It is in this spirit I mention this to the Minister.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question of police control, or re-enforcement of the law, I now come to a fundamental question for the discussion of Part V&mdash;and indeed for all legislation which proposes to affect the organisation of our lives as a community.  It is time we asked ourselves in this Parliament how far we are legislating ahead of our ability to enforce.  I have given, for instance, an example with regard to speed limits.  We have legislated for speed limits.  We have gone in and done all this but the performance is, as I have said, what counts.  Perhaps in the Bill, therefore, we are too ambitious. In legislating for all sorts of situations and crimes that may take place&mdash;and indeed some that are likely to take place&mdash;are we sure we can enforce properly what we intend to do, or is there a certain danger that our legislation may degenerate into some kind of eyewash?</P>
    <P>The classic example, of course, of that in the old days is the famous licensing laws which are now largely gone.  The licensing laws were very admirable from the point of view of certain reformers, were maintained very strongly on all sorts of moral and <Col N="292" /> other grounds, but the fact was those licensing laws did not command, to the depth they were expressed to command, the sympathy and backing of the community as a whole and they largely became pious frauds.  Now we have got away from that and we have been able to have rational licensing laws, to the indeed, I think, benefit of the community as a whole.  I think the primary purpose of those laws is achieved as well as ever it was and, secondly, the citizen is removed from any terribly dangerous situation I spoke about earlier&mdash;breaking the law with impunity and, therefore, bringing the law into contempt, causing trouble for judges and everybody else.</P>
    <P>You will pardon me, a Cheann Comhairle, for speaking about those laws but I merely do so as an example, because it is difficult sometimes to speak about the actual thing you have in hand, without inadvertently saying something you did not intend to say or making a suggestion you had not intended to make.  That is why I took these licensing laws as an example.  But the lesson is this&mdash;as far as I am aware, today, you have as good a situation as you ever had under those licensing laws.  We have got away from the demoralising situation, not to say the tempting situation, for the police officer who had to exercise those laws. Temptation and difficulty&mdash;that was the problem of the police in enforcing those laws, and uncertainty.  We have got away from the problem of the courts, the problems of uncertainty, and the knowledge that public opinion was not really behind the laws.  I mention that simply for this reason, that there are certain dangers in dealing with problems of this nature and the road traffic problem is as serious a problem as the drunken problem ever was.  There are dangers, so to speak, of letting the heart run away with the head.</P>
    <P>We should not enact anything here which cannot be properly enforced.  I am asking myself this: we will have penalties and all the rest but, when we have a situation in this country where people, having committed serious crimes and offences, are being let out <Col N="293" />&mdash;for instance, Deputies might ask themselves how long a person convicted of murder will serve if he nominally gets life&mdash;are our resources there for implementing wholesale penal measures? These are all very pertinent questions, pertinent questions for the Minister and the problems he will have in this Department, pertinent problems for the Minister for Justice, who will have to deal with prisons, remands and all those types of problems, very serious problems for the courts and, then again, the whole matter an almost impossible problem for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>If we are to legislate here for a plan, I should like to urge strongly the point of view that its ultimate enforcement be kept in mind.  In my view, it would be better to under-legislate and, perhaps, over-administer, rather than the other way round.  There is also a hidden trap for all executives in this type of legislation.  I am regarding ourselves merely as the legislators and we should be conscious of it.  If we had completely separate functions, it would be our job to be very conscious of it, but all executives will like to have things cut and dried and the matter simple.  Unfortunately, that is not always the way with human society and sometimes a cut and dried situation&mdash;if it cannot be one hundred per cent enforced&mdash;can defeat itself, as Deputies can imagine, without my going into it.  I realise now I am perilously near lecturing and I hope the Minister, his advisers, the Garda and such people, will not take me in that spirit.  That is not my purpose and I freely acknowledge theirs is the more competent knowledge.  I would bow to their opinion in practically all these matters, particularly to the technical opinion of the Garda but, at the same time, it is only right that I should raise these matters.  In short, the plea is to keep our legislative efforts within the bounds of what we can actually achieve.  To do otherwise has so many disadvantages that I do not think I need enumerate them here.</P>
    <P>With those preparatory remarks, I come to Part V which, listening to some Deputies, one would think was the whole of the Bill.  It is not the whole of the Bill and the reason I am <Col N="294" /> talking now is to emphasise very strongly that it is not the whole of the Bill.  There are two points of view on this section and it is just as well to analyse them.  I have one definite suggestion to make to the Minister.  We have to make up our minds as to whether, firstly, for the Second Stage anyway&mdash;leaving out the technical details of how you will enforce it; that is Committee Stage work&mdash;whether or not we agree with the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves what is the Minister's proposal.  As I understand it, the Minister's proposal is a very reasonable and very simple one.  It has nothing to do with the statutory crime of being drunk in charge which still remains on the Statute Book.  The Minister is proposing to us that we make a new offence.  He is proposing that if a person has a certain alcoholic content in his blood, 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, he should not drive, and if he does attempt to drive, he is committing an offence.  It is as simple as that.  Should we legislate for that or not?</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister introduce this new crime?  Because there is the report of a Commission and because there is a large body of evidence which positively proves that any human being, on the average, apparently a fairly conclusive average, who has an alcohol content in his blood above a certain level is impaired in his functions and will be adversely affected in his driving of a motor car.  That is the case; that is the reason.  It is as simple as that.  After that, we have to make up our minds as to whether we are with the Minister or against him. Let us put out of our minds all questions of being drunk in charge. That crime is still on the Statute Book, and if anyone is drunk and incapable while driving a motor car, that is a separate offence, and I do not think there is any Deputy who would defend a proposition to abolish that offence.</P>
    <P>Here we are dealing with something separate and apart, something on which a commission has reported and recommended.  I will not repeat the Minister's reasons because we can accept without dispute the fact that <Col N="295" /> everything the Minister says here is true, that anyone with an alcohol content above a certain level is impaired in his functions.  That cannot be contradicted. I find myself listening to people speaking on this matter and, not having any particular emotional approach to it, oscillating between the watch-out merchants, on the one hand, and the let-us-have-a-go merchants, on the other.  My approach would be: a plague on both your houses.  There are the people who want to turn everybody into a pussyfoot.  That is not commonsense.  There may be others who want to give him every leniency. That does not make sense either.  What we have to ask ourselves is: What is the risk to the community?</P>
    <P>In approaching this matter, there are some questions I would like the Minister to answer because I cannot answer them for myself.  The first one is: Is the taking of drink before driving at this stage so big a part of the problem: having regard to all I have said before as to the difficulty of administration and so on, is it of such a magnitude that we should do this now?  That is an important question.  There will be a load on the Garda.  My own feeling is that by and large inconsiderate driving, taking risks with speed, and inattention on the road are more important.  On the other hand, I agree with Deputy Tully that the drunken driver is a desperate menace.  But is the law not already sufficient for that?</P>
    <P>This I pose as a question and on the answer to that question I would either find myself with Deputy Larkin and Deputy Tully or else I would require to be persuaded that this provision should be in the Bill at all.  I have tried to look into some aspects of this matter and the results of my efforts have been inconclusive.  I have not enough knowledge to come to a judgment myself as to whether this provision is necessary at the moment.  Therefore if, after due consideration, the Minister and his advisers consider that it is, I am prepared to line myself with Deputies Larkin and Tully rather than with the other people.</P>
    <P>But if I am, I have some comments <Col N="296" /> to make in more detail on the sections. The Minister proposes a new offence; he gives his reasons for that proposition and if he maintains that position, he will have the support not only of his own Party but others as well.  I will accept his decision on that.  If he is going to do that, is Part V of the Bill not altogether too complex?  Are we not going to be too scrupulous in the whole business?  I would prefer Deputy Larkin's approach to this.  His attitude is that anyone who has imbibed so much alcohol should not drive, that driving is a privilege, that a driver is responsible to the community and that he should not drive a car if he has so much alcohol in him.  If it is not necessary to bring in this it should not be done.  After all, it is a certain curtailment of the freedom of the individual. That curtailment is, nevertheless, balanced by the fact that the community will allow him to use a dangerous weapon, if you like, and the community are entitled to specify the conditions where driving a motor car, having regard to the impact of it on individuals, as Deputy Tully said, may be prevented.  Therefore, the freedom of the individual does not come into this at all as it would in other cases.</P>
    <P>I want to say, if the Minister is concerned with this, that the breathaliser is fair, if that is the only way you test the alcoholic content.  Let me preface my remarks on this matter by saying that this Bill is unnecessarily complicated, particularly in regard to the provisions for blood tests and all the other tests.  I am sure the Minister has taken advice from his advisers and I am sure he is bringing in these provisions with the best of motives and is being scrupulously fair and scrupulously just to any one individual who may be involved.</P>
    <P>That is a laudable aim.  The consequences as worked down have definite disadvantages.  I should like to cut right to the heart of the thing and say: &ldquo;Look, if this is serious enough, merely take the breathaliser test and that will be sufficient evidence,&rdquo; that is, if you can work the test down to that. It is simple and it is direct.  It may suffer from the defect that in individual cases it will not give you 125 mg. per <Col N="297" /> 100 ml.  There may be many variations there.  There may be a risk that a person who has 122 mg. per 100 ml. might come out of the breathaliser all right or a person who has 130 might not come out at all.  That is fundamentally the reason why the Minister has brought in the other tests.</P>
    <P>When dealing with driving schools, I said that you could have confusion with a lot of details.  The same can happen in this case.  There are a lot of objections to the blood test and to the urine test.  In the last analysis, I wonder can they be as reliable?  On the face of it, they are good.  I want to say this now, as somebody who has had some practical experience, both as a chemist and as a practical lawyer and who can speak about this with some knowledge.  You may dismiss the breathaliser test as inaccurate and say it has its defects.  It has, but so have all the other tests.  Incidentally, if any Deputy is interested, I read an article recently&mdash;I hope to have it located before Committee Stage&mdash;which, to say the least of it, was rather disturbing. It dealt with these tests in the USA. The thing I do not like about the procedure here, either from the scientific or the legal point of view, is that in this whole chain of tests, although they are designed to be fair to the individuals concerned, you are always taking the chance that something can go wrong.</P>
    <P>I believe, to a large extent, that the breathaliser test, with all its risks, is the safest thing for the community, having regard to the fact that you are not engaging in something where the fundamental rights of the individual are involved.  The best thing is to have a simple test like the breathaliser which does not involve any inroad on the individual's privacy or on his person, as do the other two tests.  I should like to say to the Minister that if he believes that the creation of this offence is necessary and desirable for the purpose for which it is done, we are with him, but I believe that the straightforward breathaliser test is good enough.  There may be an outcry about this as there has been in other countries when they were dealing with this matter.  This will control the matter as well as anything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> I understand that in Sweden one form of the breathaliser test is that you blow into a tube and that you can see the result of the test straight away. That test is done in front of the police and the accused person and both of them see the result of it straight away. Of course, it has rather ludicrous consequences. In some countries you can pull a tube off a wall in a pub, blow into it and you can test yourself as you go along.  Maybe this is all to the good. That will bring in an element of prevention rather than a deterrent.  It is probably as good a test as you want. This test does not interfere with the person concerned; it does not interfere with a person's privacy as the other tests do.  I am, therefore, making a strong plea to the Minister to have particular regard to this breathaliser test. It has been adopted in other countries. It is a matter for the Minister to decide the type of breathaliser test he brings in.</P>
    <P>Another point about this is that I intensely dislike this blood test on a compulsory basis.  There are people who regard a blood test as a major operation.  I wonder how many Deputies have had a blood test?  It is not a question of a simple nick on the finger; it is a matter of taking a sizeable sample of blood.  It is very often taken from the elbow.  It is taken by a syringe and is tested in a laboratory afterwards.  These procedures are not any more infallible than the breathalisers and the more changed they are, the more dangerous they are.  Apart from that, there are certain reasons why the individual should not be subjected to them.  It is all right in hospitals. Doctors and people who know about this minimise these procedures as much as they can.  If you are going to have a blood sample taken in a police station as a kind of routine under compulsion, far be it from me to cast any reflection on any profession or person, but you are not giving a doctor a chance of doing it in the safest situation.  There must be risks of infection.</P>
    <P>One can develop this further.  It is something to be avoided.  The Minister has admitted that because he has provided the alternative, and very properly, <Col N="299" /> but I think that compulsion is not desirable.  To argue that there is no compulsion does not make sense because the fact is it would be, in effect, compulsory.  I feel that we should forget about that test.  It is not necessary here.  If there is a risk of the breathaliser going wrong, all right, we are taking the risk.  We are fixing the alcohol level at a high level of 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres of blood and if it gets to 122 or 120 milligrammes, there is no injustice being done.  I am assuming, of course, that the levels are properly chosen a little high, and if an odd person who should be caught gets off, it is not going to be a terribly serious thing because the breathaliser did not take him right up to the value.  It will not be a terribly vital thing for the community.  The important thing is that, on the average, a proper level of alcohol content will be enforced and you do not have this very objectionable interference with what should be, as far as possible, inviolate to the person. Therefore, from two points of view, I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    <P>The other test is less objectionable. One can argue that it is no more than a breath test: at least it does not involve a wound.  The blood test does involve wounding the individual at some risk.  The urine test at least does not involve that but there is a rather undesirable invasion of privacy which should not be, unless it is absolutely necessary.  Not only is there what one might call the ordinary delicacy of the situation involved but an examination of this nature may reveal and make available information about the general health of the person.  That goes for the blood test, too.  That is information that properly is the very private business of the person and which even his medical adviser is bound by the Hippocratic oath to hold sacred. I do not think we should go in on these grounds.</P>
    <P>You cannot make absolute rules. Deputies will notice that I have not made any point about constitutional law.  I am not making a point about <Col N="300" /> constitutional laws; I am making a point that we, as lawmakers, should have regard to these things.  One may plead that on certain occasions we have to do it.  Yes; but on these occasions we have got to do it.  For instance, there was a time when it was deemed to be necessary to make smallpox inoculation compulsory.  In fact, if smallpox inoculation had not been made compulsory, the menace of that disease would not have been wiped out.  It had to be handled in virtually the same way as TB in cattle.  It had to be compulsory but there was no way out.  Secondly, one was not compulsorily inoculated.  If one refused to be inoculated, he was fined or something like that.  In times of epidemic, it may be necessary to take special health precautions.  There was a case of foot and mouth disease in England where it was necessary to isolate an individual, to take away his liberty for a time because of the risk to the community.  I do not want my argument to be carried too far but the essential part of it is that I want to draw the Minister's attention to the objections that are there which I and others have enumerated against these tests and on top of that, I am submitting to the Minister that these tests are unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I now submit the tests are unnecessary from another point of view.  There is a large amount of procedure laid down which the Minister and the harassed administrators and executives will have to administer, to say nothing of the courts, the police and everybody else.  This will put a whole train of procedures into effect.  If the garda were to enforce this law 100 per cent, until people get used to it, it would nearly be necessary to have a police officer at every centre where drink is being consumed and there are cars parked.  I am talking from the point of view of educating.  Assume for the moment that the officer is only there to try to make people used to the situation.  How many garda are needed if we are going to do that? Suppose the garda take all these samples, start with the breathaliser, and park themselves outside a certain establishment.  I shall not mention a <Col N="301" /> location, but Deputies can imagine for themselves places in this town and around the country where you will see a large number of cars outside a large number of establishments.  If you had been in those establishments earlier, you would have seen a large number of people, by and large very well behaved, but a certain percentage of whom will be over this level.</P>

It is that the Garda will breathalise everybody&mdash;it seems to me it will be very difficult not to breathalise everybody&mdash;and the traffic congestion thereby occasioned will pose its own problems.  My sympathy in all this is with the Garda.  The next thing is there will be a large number of people brought somewhere, to see a doctor or elsewhere. After that, there will be the administrative problem that there will be a large number of samples of two sorts in the police station, or wherever they are being examined.  This is not meant to be a joke.  If we are enforcing this law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You will then have all these samples consigned to be analysed.  If those analyses are to be done as analyses should be done to achieve the purpose for which this is in the Bill, it will take some time and skill.  I talk with authority, both as a chemist and a lawyer on this, and I wish to be taken as such.  If these tests are to be properly done, first of all, the samples will have to be labelled and arranged.  They will have to go to the proper place to be tested.  They will have to be tested and the reports will have to come back.  That will involve a terrific amount of administration. This is only on a superficial reading of the Bill, much of which will be Committee <Col N="302" /> Stage discussion.  Will they all come to a central laboratory in Dublin?  There you will have the risk of communication.  How will they be brought up?  Are you sure they will be labelled correctly?  Are you sure the results of the tests will be applied to the same samples?  I am assuming that this law will be impartially enforced.</P>
      <P>Again, I say that the more I think of it from this point of view, the more my sympathies go out to the Garda, if we legislate in this way.  They are the people who will have to enforce the law.  A serious thing is that here we can mislead ourselves in our desire to be scrupulously fair.  I do not want to be taken as criticising the Minister's proposal from an unreasonable or unsympathetic point of view.  We owe a lot to the Minister for bringing in this legislation.  I hope the Minister will bear with me in this analysis of the situation, as it is very pertinent.</P>
      <P>The whole procedure seems to involve a large mass of administration. Will the tests be done at local centres or will they come to Dublin?  There is a whole mass of organisation involved in this, that is, assuming that it will be done impartially.  This law will be a reality for the whole community and will not just act as a special deterrent, that we will hit on a few unfortunate individuals and hold them up as an example, hoping that that will keep the rest in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point for equality of justice.  It is terribly important.  Let me go back to my analogy of the old drinking laws.  That is where they became so unpopular.  Some unfortunates were caught one night and pilloried and made an example of for the rest.  Those who were caught knew that 100 per cent were getting away every night of the week, and that bred resentment and disregard for the law. Let us beware that we will not do this here.  If we are to have this crime dealt with, it must be on a fair basis; it must not be on the basis of a spot check and pillorying one unfortunate person.  That was all right in the days when there was no other way of dealing with sheep stealing.  We cannot approach it in this way.  We must <Col N="303" /> approach it on the assumption that the Garda will have a specific level of alcohol content to correspond with this crime.</P>
    <P>The more I see the amount of administration that will be involved in this and the problem for the Garda, the more I urge on the Minister to come back to the simple test, and that quite apart from what I consider to be very weighty reasons why these intimate personal tests should be abandoned. Remember, they are not necessary. My case is not that they should not be there, but that they are not necessary.  All this is not necessary.  I for one am prepared to stand up and say that if the Minister thinks this crime is sufficiently important to establish these tests, I heartily will support it.  But I will go further and say: &ldquo;Make it a simple average for the community and go on the breathaliser test.  It may have wider tolerances, but in these wider tolerances there is much less difficulty than in efforts to be scrupulous in any one individual case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the 125 milligrammes, there is all the rest of this procedure just to verify a nice clean figure of 125.  What we have to do then to enforce the law is to remember that our real intention is not to enshrine a figure of 125 milligrammes or 100 millilitres; our purpose is to see that the alcohol content in a driver is at the safe level, and we do that by fixing the mean value at 125, and then try to determine.  We should not be too closely concerned with variations of a milligramme, or anything like that, that is, from the scientific point of view of what is involved in these tests. It is just to make sure you are 125, no more or less; in other words, to make your tolerance closer than you would make it with the breathaliser test.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that if he is going to do this, let him take courage and do it the simple way: stand by the breathaliser.  It is the least invasion of the individual's rights.  If a person objects, you have a very fair answer: &ldquo;If you drink, my boy, do not drive.  We are not making you drink; there is an overall requirement <Col N="304" /> for the community here; we have to have some standard for enforcing prudence here; it is up to you to see that this level is maintained and it is in the interest of the community we are doing this.&rdquo;  It is not a basic inroad on the rights of the individual, as I tried to explain earlier tonight.</P>
    <P>On this section we can debate such things as to whether 125 is the right level, and so on, but I shall not delay on that now.  I should like to refer to a particular aspect of enforcement.  I have traced the consequences to the Garda enforcing this section as it should be enforced if we are serious about it.  I think the thing almost becomes an impossibility.  We are really running a risk in making this kind of legislation, which I condemned earlier. On the other hand, if it is merely the breathaliser test, the situation can be much more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>First of all, the Garda can dispose of the matter at the moment.  By means of breathaliser tubes, the Garda can use their judgment.  They test people and can dispose of it straight away. They do not have to send off samples, and all the rest.  If he finds that the breathaliser gave him 124, and the fellow looks all right, the Garda can use his judgment.  If he finds it is 125, then he will be forced by the law to bring him to court and he can give his evidence then.  If it is over 125, the Garda can deal with the question on the spot and there will usually be other symptoms to help.  The matter can be disposed of there and then and there is not a whole load back.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to get it into one's head that the Garda will be unfair or will be out to hang people, and so on.  That is not our general experience.  I think the public will allow that, by and large, the Garda have been very considerate, perhaps over-considerate on this matter of drink in other cases because of the difficulty of enforcing the law as it stands.  This may make their job easy.  However, it should be made simple in that way.  Therefore, without labouring the point any further, I shall come back to it again.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this whole <Col N="305" /> mechanism both from the point of view of the unnecessary tampering with the person and privacy of the individual: the important word there is &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;.  Secondly, I would ask him to do so from the point of view of the administrative load and the difficulties of enforcing it.  I would ask the Minister to look very carefully at that.  In saying that, lest I should appear to be making an adverse comment on the commission's report, I, too, should like to pay a tribute to that commission and to all other commissions that do valuable work for us.  These jobs are difficult.  Commissions have the job of reconciling experts, of being both experts and not experts at the same time.  Experts can be dangerous when they go too closely into a matter.  The more closely you study a thing, the more involved and more complex it is.  That is why we should ask ourselves the following question: What are we getting and how do you do it and in the simplest and most clearcut way, even though that may involve approximations? However, approximations are generally necessary when dealing with large numbers and that is our case with the community.  It is vitally important to underlegislate and administer efficiently rather than the other way around. As in all these things, I think we should be willing to listen to the other side of the story.</P>
    <P>I shall finish by developing the point made by Deputy Larkin.  On the question of motor insurance, here again it is a matter for the Committee Stage. This Bill is really largely a Committee Stage Bill.  There have been, as the Minister probably knows, some serious insurance problems in England recently in connection with road traffic.  Is there any need for us to look at that situation?  Is this the right Minister and the right Bill to do it?  I do not know.  But, in case the matter has not been adverted to, I should like just to mention that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The point which is involved is that we maintain a proper level of insurance cover to achieve the intention, that is, that for anybody who is injured through the negligence or fault of another person, or indeed through a <Col N="306" /> motor accident, there will be some compensation&mdash;in other words, that the concept of insurance for motor vehicles is really insurance and is not meant primarily to be a concept of paying for accident claims.  What it is really meant to be is to ensure that provision is made for individuals who suffer as a result of a mechanicallypropelled vehicle on the road.  I think that is the basic reason for insurance here.  With that in view, and the recent experience in England, I would mention it.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to say about Part VII.  I have dealt with the regulation of traffic.  I personally should like to reinforce the pleas made by Deputies in regard to wandering animals.  I very nearly had a nasty accident not so long ago due to a wandering horse.  I have recently, on a number of occasions in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, come across cattle on the road.  It had not struck me until he mentioned it but I agree with the Deputy that said that this has become more common than it was.  I am inclined to agree with that.</P>

      <P>That is a very serious problem and a very likely cause of accident just as the parked vehicle, whether with or without lights, at the wrong place can be a serious matter, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 has been mentioned.  I think it is mainly a matter for Committee Stage.  To some extent, I would share the questions asked if not the objections under that section.  There is one question, but this, again, is a Committee Stage question.  Why is it necessary for us to bring in this section?  I thought it was adequately covered in the law.  I should like the Minister to deal with the matter when he is replying.  Maybe I missed it when he was saying it, in which case I apologise.  Driving without reasonable consideration and careless driving&mdash; why should it be necessary to amend that?  I thought the law was adequate. <Col N="307" /> That will do on Committee Stage and we can talk about it then.  However, I was rather surprised that it was necessary to amend it.</P>
    <P>In short, I think that this Bill is a very proper one to come before us. I should like to express appreciation particularly of the Minister's opening speech, which, incidentally, I think is the finest type of White Paper that one can get.  I think it is much better than the explanatory memorandum.  I, for one, am very grateful to the Minister for the trouble he went to.  I think Deputy James Tully was a little ungracious there in that connection.  I think it was very helpful indeed to get the detail the Minister gave.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on&mdash;not to controvert&mdash;a lot of the statements which were made here but I shall not delay now because it does not help the House to do so but I think it was a very fine thing to have got that.</P>
      <P>By and large, the Bill is a good one.  If it has come under fire because of one Part it is because there was scrupulous effort and attention to try to be fair and just in the interests of all of the people.  Too often in the past Deputies and others have complained that Bills have been insensitive, rough-riding over the rights of all and sundry.  My main criticism of some of the provisions in Part V has been about their complexity, but I realise this is due to the desire to achieve fairness scrupulously.  I suggest that the Garda will make every endeavour to do a simple and straightforward job here. Further remarks I reserve until Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Seldom in my experience <Col N="308" /> of the business of the House have we had such a lengthy and forthright discussion on a measure.  I was deeply impressed by the obvious sincerity and deep conviction with which many Deputies spoke from all sides of the House.  The debate has been unique in that the Party line has not been adhered to and this was amply demonstrated by the speeches of such Deputies as Deputy N. Lemass and Deputy de Valera.  This, perhaps, is a good thing. These two Deputies, with Deputy Dillon, were very critical of many of the features of the Bill, particularly in respect of the alleged violation of the rights of individuals and of fear of encroachments on the personal affairs of individuals.</P>
      <P>I choose to think that the Minister, in bringing forward this measure, had as his primary aim a step towards the elimination of the slaughter on the roads, a practical step to render our roads safer.  It is true there are many severe provisions in the Bill, and many severe penalties, especially pertaining to driving while drunk.  I submit that such measures are long overdue, but one must have regard to the fact that all the speeches made, all the written admonitions and warnings to people to keep death off our roads&mdash;the appeals to people to be more responsible, and more restrained and to have regard for the rights of other road users&mdash;have very largely been a wasteful exercise. All the spouting and the shouting about drunken driving, at banquets, lectures and seminars, all the toasts drunk with enthusiasm, have been, by and large, a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of death, destruction and the inflicting of human misery through road accidents seems to be increasing rather than diminishing.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that the Government and the Minister should decide to take positive steps and lay down penalties of sufficient stringency to shock all road users, including pedestrians, into a sense of responsibility at this juncture rather than allow the slaughter and carnage to continue unabated?  If the severe penalties laid down in this measure have the result of shocking all those who <Col N="309" /> abuse their privilages as road users to a greater realisation of civic spirit, then it is to be commended.  If it saves one life, it is a good measure and I believe the public at large have been crying out for a long time for more effective measures, particularly against drunken drivers, by way of stricter penalties.</P>
    <P>Indeed, private conversations with many of our friends and their expressions of abhorrence at death on the roads and the manner in which these awful accidents take place convey to us that they feel nothing will be bad enough to do to the drunken driver. Therefore, I am very slow to row in behind Deputies Lemass and de Valera in efforts to compromise the Bill in any way.  We on this side of the House have been as great advocates of preserving the rights of individuals and of safeguarding the democratic way of life as any Deputy but when it comes to the awful picture of death and destruction going on our roads, we feel obliged in conscience to support any Minister who will take steps to ease and to mitigate this terrible situation.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been road users for some time realise that there is no longer any joy in driving.  Every time we get into a car we take our lives in our hands.  Vehicles&mdash;I mean not merely cars but bicycles, trucks, tractors and so on&mdash;are essentially vehicles of destruction and it is only right that legislation should be enacted to ensure that the people who operate them should be made to realise that they must do so with responsibility and restraint.  My only concern in regard to the provisions in the Bill, especially those relating to drunken driving and the application of the various tests which the Minister has decided to impose&mdash;breath, blood and urine&mdash;is that they may be maladministered. We are giving very wide powers to the Garda Síochána in particular in the administration of this legislation.  One hopes it will be administered in a fair and impartial manner and that the fears, mainly expressed from Fianna Fáil benches, of unfairness in their application <Col N="310" /> will never be realised.</P>
    <P>The possibility that a sergeant, as suggested by Deputy Lemass, or a garda would harass one individual whom he did not like and impose on him the full rigours of the law is hard to contemplate, but it is quite possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera gave us a rather graphic picture of what can happen if through spleen, rancour, political bias or any other human failing, the administrators of this Bill select for special treatment individuals, publicans, hotels or hostelries where drink is consumed. The implication is serious.  The Minister would need to be satisfied that we do not have cases coming back to this House of discrimination of the kind outlined here by various Deputies or the possibility of there being discrimination of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was very forthright in his denunciation of this measure in its entirety.  He stated that it was illconceived, ill-considered and produced on an emotional rather than a practical basis.  He implied that the Minister and the Government were influenced by a pressure group or pressure groups.  He mentioned the Total Abstinence Society in particular as having some influence on the Minister in introducing this measure.  He went so far as to say that this was a matter of conscience with him and he told the House how reluctant he would be to vote with the Government on this measure, so keenly did he feel about very many salient points in the proposals.</P>
    <P>I would have been inclined to congratulate Deputy Lemass if I felt that it was a matter of conscience which activated him to say these things but having listened to him very closely I am inclined to think that Deputy Lemass was representing the views, not of the Total Abstinence Society&mdash; he accused the Minister of doing that &mdash;but of some other vested interests&mdash; the beer barons and all those engaged in the liquor trade.  I would be very concerned if any Deputy would represent a vested interest of this kind in a matter in which the people are so vitally concerned and where it is a question of safeguarding human life.  I respect men of conscience but one cannot <Col N="311" /> respect one who would come in here and use conscience for an ulterior motive.</P>
    <P>There are very many aspects of the measure with which I should like to deal.  Great emphasis has been laid on the various devices to deal with the drunken driver.  Is it true that alcohol is responsible for a very small percentage of the accidents on the roads?  The figure mentioned by the Minister is as low as three per cent.  I believe the figure is much higher.  There is probably good reason why the figure is put so low.  I understand there was reluctance on the part of many people even in high authority to give proper figures and proper evidence as to drink as a cause of accidents.  If the figure is as low as three per cent or even five per cent, I would agree with Deputy de Valera that there would be no justification for the very stringent measures contained in the Bill, such as the application of breathalisers, blood tests, urine tests and the fact that people can be arrested without warrant, brought to a police station and the tests carried out there.  I believe that the true percentage is much higher and I would ask the Minister to comment on the low figure given and say if he feels with us that, in fact, the figure is much higher.</P>
    <P>There are very many factors other than drink which contribute to or cause accidents.  For instance, take the condition of our roads.  The white line marking has contributed to road safety and county councils are to be congratulated on extending the use of the white line marking in recent times but there is one matter to which I should like to refer in that connection.  When road widening or re-alignment has taken place, there is a tendency to leave the old white line there even where there has been a diversion.  There is a particular instance of that on the Naas <Col N="312" /> Road.  On leaving the dual carriageway and coming to a narrow bottleneck, one sees the old white line there and if a driver were to follow that white line, he would meet with disaster. There should be an obligation on local authorities or the responsible authority to obliterate white lines where they are no longer required so that people will not be led to disaster by following them.</P>
    <P>When men are working on a road it is usual to erect signs saying: &ldquo;Men at work&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Go slow&rdquo;, and so on. A driver slows down on seeing such signs, sometimes only to find that that was unnecessary, that the work had been completed some months, weeks or days previously.  Why should such signs be displayed after the necessity for them has disappeared?</P>
    <P>The question of animals on the road has been adverted to by many Deputies.  This is a most serious problem. Trucking in animals, particularly horses, would seem to be a lucrative trade for the itinerant element in our society.  The number of animals on the roads would seem to be growing. It is not uncommon to see large numbers of horses, asses and ponies on main roads.  Neither is it uncommon to see itinerants with quite impressive limousines and living-wagons.  The Minister should take positive steps to ensure that these animals are not allowed to stray on the roads.  Too many accidents are caused by these straying animals.  The Garda are doing all they can to cope with the situation but not enough of these animals are finding their way to the local pound and there are not sufficient penalties imposed for offences.</P>
