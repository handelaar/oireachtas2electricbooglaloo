      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,288,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grantsin-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet excess expenditure on certain subheads in the Vote which could not be foreseen when the original Estimates were framed.</P>
      <P>In the case of Subhead C&mdash;Advertising and publicity&mdash;a sum of £3,420 was provided in the original Estimate. Due largely to an unprecedented increase in the volume of Press advertising in connection with the issue of prospecting licences under the Minerals Development Act, it is now anticipated that expenditure in 1966-67 will amount to approximately £9,420.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant-in-aid provision for Córas Tráchtála for the current financial year is £550,000, out of which £50,000 was earmarked by the Board as a grant <Col N="315" /> towards current and capital expenditure of Kilkenny Design Workshops Ltd.  This company was set up by Córas Tráchtála to operate design workshops for the production of well designed prototypes for industry. Quite recently in the House on the occasion of the debate on the Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, I paid tribute to the work of the Kilkenny Design Workshops and to the valuable contribution being made by them to Iris industry in relation to both home and export markets.  There are now five fully active workshops in operation there for silver, pottery, wool weaving, textile printing and wood-turning; others will be established shortly.  To meet the costs of the workshops and to provide for some very necessary reconstruction work, it has been agreed that the Board should increase the current year's grant to the workshops by £25,000.  To enable the Board to do this without any slackening in the pace of its export promotional work, it is proposed in this Supplementary Estimate to provide £25,000 for the Board in addition to the grant-in-aid provision already made by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Increased industrial production and employment are vital to the country's economic wellbeing.  This increase cannot be achieved without the expansion of existing industry and the establishment of new industry.  Responsibility for the necessary promotional programme, particularly the attraction of industrialists from abroad, is assigned to the IDA.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimate of £190,000 was presented, the international climate for industrial expansion has worsened. In a number of European countries growth rates have declined and this has affected the financial policies of some of these countries.  The efforts of the IDA to maintain the flow of proposals for new industries in this country have in consequence been hampered and it has been forced to intensify its campaign in all areas where there seems to be some prospect of success.  This intensification will lead to increased expenditure of about £20,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> The framing of estimates of annual expenditure by An Foras Tionscal presents unusual difficulties inasmuch as the amount of expenditure to be met in grant payments depends upon the rate at which projects for which grants have been approved proceed and the extent to which claims for payment are made by grantee firms.  The timing of such claims, especially in cases where the industry is being newly established, depends upon a number of operations, for example, company formation, site acquisition and clearance, negotiations between various interests regarding management, directorships, production plans etc., provision of balance of capital, planning and erection of factory premises, purchase and delivery of machinery and plant etc.  The time required for the completion of these operations in any particular case is determined by factors outside the control of An Foras Tionscal and, for these reasons, it is extremely difficult to forecast what payments from grants approved are likely to be made in a particular period.  Estimates made at any time will also be affected by claims for payment of grants approved subsequently.  The requirements of An Foras Tionscal for the current financial year have also been affected by the provisions of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act. 1966, passed on 26th May, 1966, which extended the adaptation grants scheme due to terminate on 31st March, 1966, to 31st December, 1967, and empowered An Foras Tionscal to proceed with the setting-up of industrial estates.</P>
    <P>Out of the Vote of £4,000,000 for the year 1966-67, £3,902,771 has been expended by An Foras Tionscal up to 6th February, 1967 as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The technical assistance scheme of grants is designed to encourage and assist firms to improve the efficiency of their organisations.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme grants are available to manufacturing firms towards the cost of engaging consultants to advise on matters directed to the improvement of productive efficiency and to examine aspects of the distribution and sale of goods on the home market.  Córas Tráchtála provides assistance in regard to export sales out of its grant-in-aid.  Grants are also available to manufacturing firms towards the cost of sending certain managerial and supervisory personnel on training courses or on visits abroad by representatives of the firms to study aspects of industrial organisation.  Up to 50 per cent of the cost to the firm of any particular project may be provided by way of grant.</P>
    <P>The amounts of grants payable in respect of the engagement of consultants represent the bulk&mdash;of the order of 70 per cent&mdash;of the expenditure under this subhead.  Technical assistance grants are also available to the distributive trades.</P>
    <P>While I would like to see the technical assistance scheme being used on a much wider scale, it is encouraging to know that many progressive firms have availed of the scheme and have expressed satisfaction with the work carried out by the consultants engaged.  These concerns generally have been encouraged, by the results derived from productivity schemes installed by consultants, to embark on additional schemes aimed at improving their productive efficiency <Col N="318" /> still further and have sought extra grants for this purpose.  The extensive use of the scheme in this way has resulted in an increase in the amount of technical assistance paid to individual firms and consequently, in an overall increase in expenditure under the subhead.  In the nine months to the 31st December, 1966, the total amount paid in respect of technical assistance grants was £254,000, compared with £188,000 in the corresponding period of the previous year.  It is estimated that by 31st March, 1967, claims to be met will total £370,000 for the year 1966-67.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the House will agree on the importance of continuing to offer the fullest encouragegrants, to our industries to equip themselves as fully as possible for the ment, by way of technical assistance advent of free trading conditions.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible to dispose of all the outstanding accounts arising from Ireland's participation in the New York World Fair as certain payments could not be determined exactly until recently and some relatively minor claims are being disputed by my Department.  In the current financial year expenditure on the subhead amounted to approximately £5,000.  The items constituting this sum include outstanding expenditure on the display, miscellaneous charges for services rendered in New York in connection with the disposal of the exhibits after the Fair, together with certain balances of fees and expenses of the architect and the pavilion staff.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide formally for financial assistance made available to Castlecomer Collieries Ltd. during the current financial year to enable them to continue certain development and exploratory work.</P>
    <P>In December, 1965, the House agreed to a Supplementary Estimate which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for a sum of £50,000 to meet the cost of re-opening the mine at Castlecomer and of carrying out development and exploratory work.  The purpose of the re-opening was to investigate the possibilities of a <Col N="319" /> particular area where there were indications of a large coal deposit.  The mine re-opened in November, 1965, and normal development operations were resumed concurrently with the exploratory work.  While, as I have said, the provision made in the Supplementary Estimate for expenditure on this work was £50,000, the amount actually advanced to the Company during the financial year ended 31st March, 1966, was only £23,000.  The amount sought by way of the present Supplementary Estimate, £12,000, represents further advances made to the company for the same purpose during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The initial exploratory work which consisted of a drivage extending for about 1,000 ft. was completed some time ago and has indicated the presence of an extensive deposit of coal.</P>
    <P>There are now the questions of gaining access to this new deposit and proving whether it is economically extractable. It is difficult to be precise where mining operations are concerned but it is hoped that a reasonable assessment of the future prospects of the mine can be made about the end of the year; at this stage we can only hope that our aim to revive the viability of the Castlecomer mine will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The gross amount required is £1,638,000.  There are, however, offsetting savings of £350,000 on other Subheads of the Vote which bring the net requirements to £1,288,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main item in this Supplementary Estimate is the increase in the amount of money which will be made available to be spent during the year on grants for An Foras Tionscal.  The figures given by the Minister indicate that there has been a large increase in the amount of money being paid towards adaptation grants whereas previously when the figures were made available to us, we found that the grants for new industries always involved much larger amounts <Col N="320" /> of money than the grants for adaptation of old industries.  We now find that the expenditure forecast for this year produces a 50-50 situation roughly.  Old industries are availing of adaptation grants to the same extent as we are getting new industries in from abroad.  I welcome that fact.  From the time we first talked about entering the Common Market and got down to preparing for it seriously, I always felt it was not fully appreciated that many of our old industries were supply industries for the home market.  They can now gird their loins and try to enter the export market.  The fact that they are adapting themselves, as is indicated by the necessity for this Supplementary Estimate, is something which I welcome.</P>
      <P>The report of the Federation of Irish Industries issued a few days ago made the point that there was not enough encouragement for the adaptation of old industries.  There is some degree of truth in this point made by them because the maximum grant to a new industry can be up to 50 per cent, and they can then go to the Industrial Credit Company and talk about a loan and the conversion of portion of that grant, but the figure in relation to an adaptation grant is a maximum of 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>I did some homework recently on the manner in which Northern Ireland encourages existing industries and new industries.  The main difference I found between our system and theirs seems to be that they can get an automatic payment of grant on the production of invoices, statements and receipts for the goods they bought.  I want to quote now from a leaflet entitled &ldquo;Opportunities in Northern Ireland for faster, more profitable Expansion&rdquo; It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediate cash grants of 40 per cent of the cost of new plant, machinery and buildings are offered by Northern Ireland automatically and they are not dependent on the number of new jobs an industry will create.  But where a manufacturer undertakes to create reasonable employment, then the Government can make 45 per cent cash grants towards the cost of new plant, <Col N="321" /> machinery and buildings, and, in the case of a project offering exceptionally attractive returns in employment or which is to be located in an area urgently requiring industrial development, grants towards operating costs can be made available in the initial stages of development.</P>
    <P>The automatic payment of a grant there to any industrialist who purchases an article of industrial machinery is not available here.  We have certain industries which got a global refusal.  I can think of two of them offhand.  One is the baking industry and the other is the laundry industry. Our definition is that they must produce something for export.  My purpose in bringing this up is to indicate that a defence of the jobs in our existing industries which are supply industries for our own people is as pertinent today as we approach the Common Market as is the desire to produce new industries.</P>
    <P>The anomalies presented by our system here, which I maintain is an inflexible one in relation to old industries, are demonstrable by these figures. I will not give the names of the companies involved for obvious reasons; if the Minister wants them, he can get them from me privately afterwards. There is one factory which employed a couple of hundred people, mostly girls, for 20 or 30 years in very bad premises. They eventually succeeded in getting new premises in a building which had been used as the office part of the factory.  There was good space available for a new building.  Eventually the whole production section of that factory was entirely new.  Their adaptation grant was £16,000.</P>
    <P>About a half a mile away there was a new factory producing almost identical products which got a grant of £138,000.  The number of people employed in the old factory is slightly higher than the number employed in the new factory.  Because the people in the old factory had been operating for 20 or 30 years in very bad conditions they were classified as being eligible for an adaptation grant only. I suggest that we should have a more flexible approach towards the old <Col N="322" /> factories as well as the new ones. This would improve our system.  I have a large volume of documentation here which proves that the position in Northern Ireland is much more flexible.</P>
    <P>We have to compete with Northern Ireland as well as with other countries in the attraction of new industries.  Another difference between Northern Ireland and here is that they tend to give help in the provision of factory space.  They build factories which remain the property of the Minister. They are leased at a certain rate per square foot to the manufacturers, so the authorities always maintain their ownership of the factory.  I do not want to harp on some of the costly failures we have had here, but I do want to suggest to the Minister that the fact that we have factory space which cannot be taken back by the Minister is a flaw in our system.  We know that one of the reasons why a manufacturer would wish to own the factory is that if he owns it completely and entirely, he can use it as security for a loan for liquid capital for running his business.  I suppose that is an argument why a manufacturer should own the factory.  But, at the same time, the system in the North of Ireland is that they lease factory space to manufacturers, and they have been considerably more successful in the expansion of industry than we have been here.</P>
    <P>I quote from the same booklet, which is just a resumé of all the things they have up there, and it is of interest on page 3:</P>
    <P>There are no problems in finding a factory or building site in Northern Ireland! To encourage rapid industrial expansion and enable manufacturers to start production quickly, the Government builds in advance of demand, standard factories without a particular firm in mind.  Ranging from 18,000 to 70,000 square feet, and with all modern services, these factories are ready for immediate occupation. Rentals are very low, from 1/6d. to 2/9d. per square foot per annum for a 21-year period which may include an option to purchase.  Room for expansion of the production area <Col N="323" /> by at least 100 per cent is always provided.</P>
    <P>We have touched on this system in the Shannon Free Airport situation, where the Industrial Estate there has provided factory bays and leased them to factories, which has been a successful method of providing factory space. We are now moving a little closer to it again by the provision of industrial estates in specified places but, while we are, I think the restriction at present placed on this system is a mistake.  There are certain instances in which I am sure the Minister, in his wisdom, would prefer to take a decision to provide factory space, rather than provide a large cash grant from which people build their own factories.</P>
    <P>If, near a town of fairly large population, factory space can be created and there is at the back of somebody's mind the possibility that in ten or 15 years the first occupant might not be as successful for ever, as we would hope, then the fact that the space is there is really the best guarantee or encouragement we can get that it will be occupied again.  In my own constituency I have seen certain factories left idle.  Happily, they were reoccupied, not&mdash;in one case I shall not mention, by people who are employing male labour, as the first people were&mdash;employing labour in the same volume but, nevertheless, the fact that there was factory space there, near a centre of population where employees were readily available, meant that these were occupied again. In another town in my constituency a much smaller factory has had this experience, a factory which got a grant.  The factory space was built and then production ceased but now, happily, another manufacturer has come in.  He is starting and we hope in perhaps a year he will be in full production there as a small factory employing, possibly, 50 people; at the moment there are 15 to 20 employed. But the fact that we can provide factory space is most important.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on 2nd March, 1967, replied to a Parliamentary Question of <Col N="324" /> mine as to whether or not he had received representations for the establishment of an industrial estate at Tom Roe's Point, Drogheda, and the answer was no.  He indicated that Government policy was to develop certain centres. I think large industrial towns all over Ireland&mdash;if they can provide a suitable site&mdash;should be in a position to have factory bays built there, if there are people to occupy them.  Even if the planning were allowed to proceed, it might be a very good thing.  The question raised by the Federation of Irish Industries as to whether or not there is sufficient encouragement for adaptation is one which, six to 12 months ago, could be entirely substantiated because it appeared, as I said, as if there was far more activity in the provision of new factories than the adaptation of old ones.  But, as I said also, it appears now as if the amounts of money are about equal.</P>
    <P>Also in the Report on Progress of Industrial Adaptation of March, 1966 issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce applications for adaptation grants and loans are added, again, up to 31st December, 1965.  I refer to page 30 of the document.  I indicated that the total capital investment represented by applications for grants and loans would be of the order of £55 million which is the figure given in this document and approved up to the same date there was a figure of £42 million. It means, of course, that the Industrial Credit Company are co-operating, when the adaptation grant is provided. Whether or not that can go the whole way, I do not know, but it is quite certain, with commercial banking in its present state of restriction, there is very little hope anywhere else and the industrialist who would desire to adapt is certainly in the position that he will not get the 75 per cent he desires from a commercial bank to put beside the grant of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another matter which gives Northern Ireland the edge on us is the fact that all industrial buildings there are derated as to 75 per cent.  This is a considerable attraction and I have been quoted an instance of a very large factory in Belfast where the total rates <Col N="325" /> paid are £500 a year.  I am quite certain the volume of rates paid by relatively small industrial operations here would be as much as £2,000 a year.  I am aware that if one is in full production, the rate figure will be a very small part of the prime cost but, at the same time, when one is trying to encourage people to come in, everything counts and it is clear that this is another advantage Northern Ireland has over us.</P>
    <P>The Minister answered a Parliamentary Question by me, also on 2nd March, 1967&mdash;Question No. 46&mdash;when I asked for the total amount of grants sanctioned for industry by An Foras Tionscal to date, and the total sum represented by cancellations of projects since a reply in June, 1966, relating to industrial grants.  The Minister's reply was that the total sum represented by cancellations of applications for grants, abandonments, or postponements of projects since 31st March, 1966 was £1,532,000.  These are the official cancellations and abandonments.  My opinion&mdash;in the credit squeeze situation as it is&mdash;would be that, internationally as well as at home, the real figure for postponements, abandonments or cancellations would be much higher.  I say this in no spirit of blame to the Minister, An Foras Tionscal, or anybody else, but the facts of life are there and it is clear that people who were bent on expansion here in the past few years&mdash;and these projects generally take a year or so to get under way&mdash;will have found themselves in the position where they have had to retrench, and where cancellation at the worst and postponement at the best may be the order of the day for many.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who answered a question by Deputy L'Estrange recently and the information given was that there were 170,000 fewer people at work in this country than in 1951. This means that the industrial effort to employ the same number of people, or even more in order to compensate for those who have had to leave the land because of mechanisation, has <Col N="326" /> failed.  We face that situation with our grants and our encouragement system.</P>
    <P>There are features of the industrial expansion programme which are not to be commended.  I have observed that a very high percentage of new factories in and around my area employ perhaps as high a proportion as 50 per cent girl labour.  I was at a chamber of commerce dinner some years ago.  I do not remember the exact year but the present Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, spoke there.  Sitting beside me was the managing director of a firm who employ about 400 people in that town and when the president of the chamber of commerce mentioned employment in a certain new factory and the fact that the new factory would give employment to girls, the managing director nearly swallowed his coffee cup because the main employment in his factory was girl labour and he was in a situation in which he could not get any girls.  Therefore, the large grant given to that factory was, from the point of view of employment promotion, wasted.  To give the name of the factory and town concerned would be, for a politician, to commit <i>hari kiri</i> and I have no intention of doing it.  If there was a scarcity of girl labour in that town, the payment of a large grant for a new factory to help it to do something which had been done already was largely a waste of money.</P>
    <P>I shall give another instance.  A firm went into a premises which had been vacated and they were confronted with the problem that they could not get enough girl labour.  I submit that we must concentrate in such cases on the establishment of factories that employ men at a good living wage.  I can point to two examples in Drogheda&mdash;it is permissible for a politician to mention the name of the town when it has been a success&mdash;the asbestos pipe factory and two others, where a large percentage of men are employed at fair wages, enabling people to rear families and to keep them at home.  The other system does neither.</P>
    <P>Another feature about which I am <Col N="327" /> not happy is the proportion of factories established which are using Irish raw materials.  It is, of course, a good thing to take in materials from abroad, employ people here to convert them into manufactures and then to send the finished products out again.  However, experience in this city, particularly in recent months, has shown us that this is dangerous because if a big combine abroad find that the shoe is pinching, it is very easy for them to lop off the small arm in a small country like this, repatriate their executives and find jobs for them elsewhere, and no one in the organisation of such a large international combine will be hurt to any great extent.  It leaves us with an empty factory in which there is no employment. That is why I asked the Minister on 23rd February, 1967&mdash;Question No. 70&mdash;for the number of new factories established in 1965 and 1966 based on raw materials available in the country at a competitive price, and the present number of people employed.  The reply was:</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give the precise information requested by the Deputy.  He may, however, be interested to know that out of a total of 47 new industries established in 1965, 15 use mainly Irish raw materials and 4 use some Irish raw materials; these 19 undertakings employ approximately 1,100 persons. Out of 54 new industries established in 1966, 19 use mainly Irish raw materials and 4 use some Irish raw materials; these 23 undertakings employ approximately 500 persons.</P>
    <P>The financial year does not end until 31st March, 1967, and we are now discussing a Supplementary Estimate for a large sum to bring total expenditure and grants up to £5½ million; yet the number of persons employed in these two calendar years in industries established on Irish raw materials is far too low.  We must concentrate on encouraging industries to come here for the reason that the raw materials are available here.  It is a safety measure against the time when the wind blows cold, when there are credit squeezes internationally, when employment in industrial <Col N="328" /> production in the world is falling and when industrial products are not going so well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the action in regard to Castlecomer Collieries.  It would be a pity if we were to let the labour there in the production of Irish goods in the shape of coal to emigrate without a fight.  Perhaps because of our tie-up with and our thinking on Bord na Móna, we have been concentrating so much on the production of turf that the question of our collieries, as far as State capital investment is concerned, has been neglected.  For use in industrial boilers and for the central heating of houses, there is a very big market for the type of anthracite we produce.  In small undertakings in which I am involved, I installed two industrial and one domestic boiler consuming all Irish anthracite and I can assure the House and the Minister that the cost of heating from this fuel has been less than half that of oil. The work involved is merely refuelling once a day, which takes about two minutes, and looking at the boiler after 12 hours in case a clinker may have formed, which takes half a minute because of automatic riddling.</P>
    <P>This is something which should have been developed but we have been so involved in turf production that we may have neglected our Irish anthracite. If the costs are examined, they will show that Irish industry here would be well advised, before installing any boiler, to consider Irish anthracite fuel.  For that reason I welcome wholeheartedly the investigation work going on at Castlecomer and wish it every success.  The total sum at the moment would seem to be £62,000.  This seems very little, by the standards we employ here and by the expenditures we are involved in here today, to keep an oldestablished Irish industry going and to try to bring it right up to its optimum in employment and in production.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have got a small increase.  I want, specially, to pay a tribute to the work of Córas Tráchtála. The people there are extremely good and diligent.  There is another thing <Col N="329" /> about them.  They are as far removed from civil servants&mdash;I say this not in condemnation of anybody present&mdash; as it would be possible for anybody to be.  They are the sort of people who will make absolutely any kind of effort, orthodox or unorthodox, to get Irish exports.  Some of them have reached the stage where the volume of knowledge and experience that can literally be given to you verbatim on the telephone is extraordinary.  They have a wonderful knowledge of every facet of Irish industry and the details of production of different items.  I would suggest to the Minister if money were ever to be the limiting factor in regard to Córas Tráchtála, the best thing he could do as Minister would be to see that such limitation were removed.  I do not think any Government has, in fact, restricted Córas Tráchtála in this way and for that reason I welcome this item in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance grants are important and it is good to see them being availed of.  The fact that the Minister says his Department is arguing about certain small items in relation to this matter does not shock me.  I presume we have got some benefits from our capital investment and our efforts there.  I do not want to delay the House very long as this is a Supplementary Estimate and I presume we will be dealing with the main Estimate after Easter.  Therefore, I end by saying that I believe the Federation of Irish Industries, while there is some evidence of improvement in the amount of the adaptation grants being availed of, have a case when they say our system is inflexible and that sufficient is not being done for old industries.</P>
    <P>They also have a case when they point to the fact that the State took £40 million from the capital resources for private enterprise industry this year and that while there is a suggestion that there is some loosening within the last month or so in the shape of an announcement that £10 million more would be available for the private sector, such has not been the experience of people in industry.  Capital is extremely scarce still.  The Federation <Col N="330" /> of Irish Industries in their report a few days ago made the point that while the balance of payments difficulties was corrected to a large degree, the price was high and the price was the compulsory slowing down of our industrial effort here over a year.  The fact that the private enterprise industrialist found himself hampered by lack of liquid capital or lack of investment capital for the purpose of developing his plant or his building and the fact that we are restricted in our adaptation grants approach did not help.</P>
    <P>I should now like to mention something that has been argued by me and others, to some extent, that is, our costly failures.  When you mention costly failures of industries that got grants, you are very often told you are unpatriotic and that the percentage of failures is very low.  I submit that the percentage was not low in regard to those costly failures.  I would insist on the Minister having a full examination of the situation and taking any precautions that are necessary to see to it that those failures do not occur again in such numbers.  I know we have to take risks and also, just as the banks will do, the Government should see to it that salvage is available to them and that at least the building will come back to them.</P>
    <P>During the past week or so, I was reading the Acts of Parliament in Northern Ireland relative to industrial grants and incentives.  I found there were the most stringent sections in those Acts whereby seven days after production ceased in any of those enterprises which had got grants, such had to be reported to the Ministry.  In fact, the machinery could not be removed from the factories and the buildings themselves reverted to the Minister if production stopped for a period of six months.  I am not suggesting that stringent measures such as those would encourage industrialists to come here but I feel if an industrialist is entirely <i>bona fide</i> in his effort to come here, he will have no objection to normal safeguarding precautions by our Minister.  I feel such should be incorporated in new grants.  I feel also <Col N="331" /> that the system is, to some degree, inflexible and has not been changed in hardly any way since the Government I supported then, with the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, introduced the Industrial Grants Act.  It was in fact introduced by the late Deputy Norton in 1956.  The Miscellaneous Provisions Act was also introduced in that year.  As this is a Supplementary Estimate, I know that this can only be discussed in passing so I will not go into it further now.</P>
    <P>The incentive by way of relief of tax will be continued until we go into the Common Market.  It would help industrialists and the House if the Minister would indicate, as he has just come back from Brussels, if there is any truth in the widespread rumours that when we go into the Common Market, we will not be allowed to give incentives to industry by way of relief of tax.  I believe that market development grants should be expanded and that there should be a more detailed approach to them.  The work of Córas Tráchtála is very good but perhaps the whole idea needs to be expanded.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate for what it is doing.  I have given whatever views I had in relation to certain changes which I feel might be of value.  I hope that the Minister will see to it that more Irishmen are employed at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the sneak punch Estimates which are thought up at a late hour at night and thrown at the Dáil the following morning. There was no indication that this was for discussion this morning.  However, let us proceed to examine the Estimate and to give our views on what little it contains.  The actual number of items referred to in the Supplementary Estimate is not large.  The amount is considerable.  It is £1,288,000 and it is proper that we should have a look at what is to be done with this money and indeed to think in terms of what is happening in regard to industry generally in this country, and particularly so far as we are concerned on these benches, what is happening to <Col N="332" /> the people who work in industry, the various groups of skilled and unskilled operatives in Irish industry.</P>
      <P>The first fact that hits me in the face is that there are 6,000 more unemployed in the country than there were 12 months ago.  Of course this must be the acid test in so far as the policies of Government are concerned. One may travel in various directions of fantasy and indulge in fantasy in so far as imaginable benefits of industry are concerned.  One may enlarge, at great length, upon status and prestige, but the basic test of the value of any Government activity in this field is how many jobs have been provided or how many have been lost.  Here we find what I would describe as a calamitous decline in the number of people involved.  Perhaps they are not all disemployed in industry as such; perhaps they are not all factory workers now out of a job; but I would say that the greater number of them, by far the greater number are.  When one thinks in terms of those who emigrate as well, without even getting the opportunity of taking up employment, it shows that it is not unreasonable nor would I think it an exaggeration, to suggest that there are 10,000 people more, either working in England or out of jobs here, than there were this time last year.  I think that is a moderate estimate.</P>
      <P>One must look at the operation of the Department and Government policy against that background because much was promised by this Government in so far as the provision of jobs was concerned.  I am not one who is given to repetition&mdash;I hope anyway. I hope I will never fall into the trap of being repetitious in so far as political discussion is concerned.  I do not want to recall too painful memories of promises made in days gone by.  I know there are some Members of this House to whom it is dearer far than the choicest of wines that they should travel back the years and the farther back they go, the sweeter the vintage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the mouths and minds of many people Potez does not, to say the least of it, ring musical.  I shall not say it is a dirty word, but it is not too euphonious at the same time in our ears.  I am prepared to say, and any reasonable man would be prepared to say, that it is possible for anyone <Col N="334" /> to make a mistake.  Anybody can fall for a well told tale at the international conference level as well as at any other level.  I do not know if this applies in so far as Potez is concerned, but what I am concerned about is this: We have this large building there and all sorts of rumours circulate in public as to what is to be done and what is not to be done.  The representatives of Potez apparently make odd visits here and disappear again into the night. The factory building remains and let me say it is a very fine building out there on the Naas Road.</P>
      <P>Are we going to make a national monument of it or what?  Are we going to leave it there with a maintenance party in it or what is going to happen to it?  People are very interested to know will Potez make anything there. It is some years now since the arrival of this great industry, heralded by the Government as another great Fianna Fáil achievement.  We were all very happy to think&mdash;I certainly was as a Deputy for the area&mdash;that a large number of people would be provided with work there, but it has not materialised and, except for the limited number who are in employment there, Potez really is held up as a failure rather than anything else.</P>
      <P>We read in the newspapers recently of a proposal to make a radio station of it.  I do not know what is in this. Telefís Éireann could do with a bit of competition in many spheres and in many of its activities, although I dare say it is hardly reasonable to suppose that there is sufficient advertising revenue available in this country to support two television stations.  Nevertheless, this impression is abroad. People have read in the newspapers that there is a group interested in converting the Potez factory into a television station.</P>

      <P>Let us treat this with maturity.  People must creep before they walk.  Let us leave the matter alone from that point of view.  I am not concerned with discussing the affairs of Telefís Éireann at all.  I want to ask a simple question. It is getting more and more difficult, not alone to get answers but to put questions and still be regarded as being in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> I should like to find out from the Minister what he considers to be the future of this building.  Is there anything in what is being said about a group being interested in turning the Potez factory into a television station? Everybody is anxious to see that the building is used to its maximum capacity, whatever that may be.  Is there any prospect that Messrs. Potez will return to the country and do something to provide the promised employment?  We do not know.  The factory is there.  Are we going to make a national monument of it?  Or will the Minister hand it over to his colleague and instal the Board of Works there to keep it in order?  I hope I am in order in inquiring about that.</P>
    <P>I had great hopes, too, of a blossoming of industry in the country following the arrival of the new men, particularly following the arrival of the present Taoiseach.  There does not seem to me to be any difference.  The trend is downwards so far as employment is concerned.  It would appear that no matter who is at the helm of the Fianna Fáil Party, we are not making any progress towards the promised goal of prosperity for all which was the panacea offered by this Government on the occasion of each successive election.</P>
    <P>Some people&mdash;I am sure many members of the Fianna Fáil Party earlier this year and indeed many Deputies&mdash;took heart from the forecast made by the celebrated international man of information, Mr. Maurice Woodrow, who forecast that we would have an excellent Taoiseach, although he would come in for criticism, he said, and a rough passage.  But, he said, it would not be fair criticism and the reason it would not be fair criticism is that it would not be fairly based.  I should add that Mr. Woodrow is a clairvoyant by profession.  He states he does not use crystal balls or packs of cards.  He has this as a gift from his mammy.  It was published on the front page of the <i>Evening Press</i> in heavy type in support, no doubt, of their excursions into the fantasy of the so-called Programme for Economic <Col N="337" /> Expansion.  We were assured by this projection&mdash;because that is what it was&mdash;because it appears as valid now as the projection in the document to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Mr. Woodrow's projection was qualified by Mr. Woodrow's affirmation in the end that he was not completely infallible.  This was one of the things utilised by the <i>Evening Press</i>, which we know is Holy Writ to the faithful, in support of the activities of the Government, in support of the general impression that here you have a Government full of youth and vim and energy, the youngest Cabinet in Europe, and the devil knows what.</P>
    <P>The net result of this administration is, as I have said, a reduction of 6,000 jobs in the past 12 months.  In this Estimate fewer than ten pages, in treble spacing, are taken to describe the expenditure of £1,288,000.  Among the subjects mentioned is Córas Tráchtála.  We all hope that the Kilkenny Workshops will have every success.  It reflects credit on this enterprise that their designs have gained fame&mdash;perhaps I should not quite say fame, but certainly considerable note.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible for the design of the carpet on the floor of this House.  I do not know that it is the Kilkenny Workshops.  Whoever is responsible for it, the design does not indicate too rich an imagination. In fact, it seems to most people that the change in the carpet design is not very important&mdash;I am not suggesting that in any utilitarian sense the design in a carpet is important.  It is desirable, however, that we should strive for achievement of the highest level in all matters of human activity.  We will fail 99 times out of 100 but we should strive all the same.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the design of the old Donegal carpet, with which we were all familiar, which was taken up, was infinitely superior to this modernistic one.  I would describe the design of the carpet which replaced the old one as a kind of lounge bar design.  I merely mention that because if you forgive the expression, it is against my aesthetic sense.</P>

      <P>The IDA is referred to in the Supplementary Estimate.  I hope I shall be in order in referring <Col N="339" /> to that.  On occasion, when the opportunity presented itself of discussing matters relating to this Department, I have spoken and perhaps some will think repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;and in the minds of the Government Party, perhaps to the point of boredom&mdash;of my idea that we do not appear to have awakened to the conditions into which we are inevitably and inexorably moving in Europe, that is, the highly competitive conditions we shall face in selling goods.</P>
      <P>I again make the appeal to the Minister not to be content with the forms of organisation which now exist in this State in so far as the exploration of European markets is concerned or in so far as the recruitment of suitable commercial explorers&mdash;young, active men, trained to whatever level is necessary&mdash;is concerned.  I choose the term &ldquo;commercial explorers&rdquo; of some agency under his control which could send them into Europe for the first purpose of fixing where the markets are which we may be able to service, of finding out if they are there at all, of fixing, as it were, our targets.</P>
      <P>What does Europe need that we can provide?  All we hear about is that the farmers will do well because we have plenty of cattle.  We can export agricultural produce.  However, I recently read in a book, which purported to describe the origins and development of the Common Market, a statement to the effect that small agricultural countries such as ours have no guarantee at all that prosperity will come to them because they are able to export agricultural produce to a vast and an allegedly hungry mass of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement of these matters, even within the Common Market, has not reached such a high stage of planned organisation that the agricultural interests of even every member country are looked after properly. Therefore we need not place too much reliance on these vague generalisations that the farmers will do well and that anybody who produces cattle will come well out of it.  In a minor way, from recent sad experience of the Free Trade <Col N="340" /> Area Agreement, we know that we were assured by the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that this agreement would be of benefit to the farmers in the matter of cattle prices but nevertheless cattle prices fell. Therefore, we simply cannot assume that, if and when we go into the Common Market&mdash;which will be determined by Mr. Harold Wilson's success in his negotiations with General de Gaulle&mdash;our economy will boom.  Let us face it.  These are the facts.  The rest is just a lot of window dressing. Whatever these two gentlemen decide, we have no alternative but to follow. Simply because we are an agricultural country and can produce cattle, it should not be assumed that that will bring immediate prosperity either to the farmers or to our country.  I have never been persuaded that the cattle industry, apart from rectifying theoretical adverse trade balances, was of that tremendous value in terms of jobs provided, which is the acid test, to this nation.</P>

      <P>The Minister, of course, has no responsibility for a debate on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I merely mention it in passing.  I am trying to emphasise that we have got to attack very vigorously on this front, with which he is concerned, which is that of industry and commerce.  One of the means I am suggesting and have suggested of developing in the future is that we should make an intensive effort to find out what is needed in Europe in this great market in whose direction we seem to be moving that we can supply or prepare to supply. To my mind, the way to do that is to get trained, qualified people, young people, preferably, with plenty of patriotism and push, to go out and to discover what needs we can fill.  That is a first essential.  If we do not do that, anything else we do is quite haphazard. I do not think the range is too great but, with the application of Irish ingenuity and genius, I am certain we shall survive.  I am certain that the number of people who will be left on this island will survive but I should not care to make any projection as to <Col N="341" /> how many will be left inhabiting this&mdash; to use the phrase&mdash;grand old country.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the need which I mentioned, not just now but on many previous occasions, to be alive to what is required.  I merely want to comment in regard to what he has to say about outstanding accounts in respect of our participation in the New York World Fair of 1964-65, that it surprises me that it has not been possible to dispose of the outstanding accounts, as he says.  I had not thought that the money shortage, which had done such damage in so many different ways to our economy, particularly in regard to housing, extended to the point where it made it impossible for us to meet bills incurred in respect of the New York World Fair.  This, of course, is the explanation as to why we did not participate in Expo 1966: we had not the money to do it, apparently.</P>
      <P>I have been talking to workers in industries.  There are one or two cases I suggest the Minister should have a look at.  I do not propose to give the names here but I will do so when it is necessary.  It might be advisable to keep an eye upon one or two manufacturers who availed of grants and, possibly, loans to set up industries, allegedly for the purpose of exports, if not exclusively, certainly principally. The Minister should have a look at the so-called export industries to see whether in one or two and perhaps more cases, I have in mind, they do not, in fact, neglect the export side, which it was an obligation on them to develop when the loans and grants were first being provided, and lean almost 100 per cent on the home market.  I should like to hear the Minister say if he knows of any evasion of this kind.  Are there in existence any regulations against evasive tactics of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may not be making myself too clear but the point I am trying to make is that an industry which is provided with public moneys and enabled or helped to be established, partially, by public moneys on the general proposition that it will engage principally in exports has an obligation <Col N="342" /> to make every effort to export and to strain every sinew in that direction.  It has been suggested to me by certain workers that there are industries which came into existence on the basis of that proposition but whose efforts or activities in regard to exports are minimal, if at all.  I would ask the Minister to say if he has any information of this kind.  If the position is as I have suggested, that is a matter which needs to be corrected.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are very anxious to see that the Department of Industry and Commerce will be successful in the promotion of the interests of Irish industry, and always have been.  It is an interesting point, referred to by Deputy Donegan, that the Industrial Development Authority, which is one of the main organs of the Department, was brought into being by a former leader of the Labour Party, the late Deputy Norton, and had as one of its chief directors, the late Senator Luke Duffy, who will be remembered by many for the considerable work he did in building up the Industrial Development Authority from its inception.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be going back but I remember what was said when we indicated that we were considering the setting-up of an Industrial Development Authority.  These were days when the Minister was not taking much interest in politics.  The Industrial Development Authority has become part of the apparatus of the Minister's Department.  We are very anxious to see that his Department should function to the fullest possible extent for the benefit of those with whom we are primarily concerned, that is, the people who want to stay in Ireland and work in Ireland.  That is not to say that we do not appreciate the very grave difficulties which face industrialists on such an occasion.  That is not to say that we opt out of our responsibility as a national Party, to offer to Irish industrialists who are making the effort every assistance we can within reason and such as lies within our power and, certainly, our good wishes for their success.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the efforts of <Col N="343" /> the Minister will be directed towards a radical alteration of the present industrial picture as we see it to the end that, instead of there being a reduction in jobs, as there has undoubtedly been over the past 12 months, there will be an increase in employment.  I know very well that we could engage here in a statisticsswopping game that could go on all day or for a month or a year, as a result of which nobody would be any the wiser in the heel of the hunt and both sides should be convinced of the absolute authority with which they speak.  All I have to go on are the figures issued by the Minister's Department, or the Department of Labour, which we get every Friday in the post. They indicate greater unemployment than there was last year.  It is a serious matter and one to which I hope the Minister will address his mind and tell us whether we can expect an improvement and how soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate because it provides money for a few very important undertakings.  The first item comes under the heading of advertising and I want to talk about the subject matter of the advertisements, which is most significant.  We in this Party have always stressed the importance of the full development of our natural resources.  It is very gratifying to see that there is an increasing amount of activity in this field.  I am glad to see that the amount of money under this heading is increasing because it indicates that the Government are doing a good deal more than has been done in the past to ensure that every effort is made to develop and explore our mineral resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I want to refer to the amount included for Castlecomer Collieries.  This again is a most important item.  Castlecomer Collieries were closed in 1965, permanently, as it was thought at the time, but after the efforts of the local people, local representatives and the unions representing the workers, the Government agreed to advance money in order to explore <Col N="344" /> further the possibility of getting coal more economically there.  Everyone in the area is grateful to the Government for taking that step.  The £12,000 now being provided is most welcome.  They have reached the point in Castlecomer when money should be made available to them, possibly more money than is itemised here, because it is generally felt that the decision to re-open the mine was wise.  In order to prove that conclusively, it is necessary to spend more money, and in order to keep up the exploratory work and the work of proving that the coal can be economically mined.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is any need for me to impress on the Minister the importance of this.  When the Minister for Health, Deputy Flanagan, was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he visited the area and made a detailed tour of the surrounding district and he came to know first hand the serious social difficulties as well as the economic difficulties that would arise if the mine was not kept going.  If the Minister gets the opportunity, he too should visit the area and there he will see the full worth of the money which the Department is spending in the area.  To keep the trained labour force there is most important.  Unfortunately all of the trained labour force originally employed in the mine did not find employment when the mine reopened but every effort should be made to keep the present labour force in employment there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the necessity for increasing tax remission as an incentive to industrialists.  I would ask the Minister to have a word with the Minister for Finance to see if he could get some special income tax relief for coal miners.  It is a very difficult and a very laborious kind of employment and it is no encouragement to giving increased productivity if one finds that one's pay packet is seriously reduced by income tax, especially when one is working hundreds of feet down in the earth, perhaps on the flat of one's stomach for most of the day, hammering out coal.  Every special provision should be made for these workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> I should also like to refer to the almost complete lack of advertising in regard to the sale of coal.  The main competitors in this field avail themselves of television, the newspapers and all the media of communication to get across the desirability of using their particular type of fuel but no significant effort is being made to put across to the people the economy and the usefulness of this coal, or the fact that it is a native product and has the added advantage of keeping our balance of payments problem that little bit less embarrassing. Most other types of fuel are imported. Also, more could be done in regard to the marketing and advertising of our coal.  I give my full support to the Minister on this aspect of the Supplementary Estimate and I want to pay tribute to his efforts and the efforts of the Department in regard to the work they are doing in Castlecomer and I hope that this assistance will continue.  Much more money is necessary to permit this colliery to work more economically and to give employment to people in the area.</P>
    <P>Looking through the remainder of the Supplementary Estimate, I hoped to find some reference to the Minister's recent announcement regarding the development of small industries in the rural areas.  Perhaps some of the additional money being given to the Industrial Development Authority will be earmarked for that purpose and when the Minister is replying he will clarify the position.  He should follow up his recent announcement with positive action.</P>
    <P>In that connection I would like to refer to the work of local industrial development committees.  These are voluntary committees composed of local people who do very valuable work.  They are dedicated people who give their time and money in the attempt to develop industry in rural areas.  They come on deputations to the Minister and the Industrial Development Authority and are received very well.  No objection can be taken to the manner in which they are received by the Minister, the officials of the Department and the Authority. They are received courteously and are <Col N="346" /> given all the advice and assistance that can be given.</P>
    <P>However, it is very frustrating for them to go back and tell the people who sent them that they have been well received, that those who met them have promised to do what is possible but that still they have not got anything definite.  I know that neither the Minister nor the Authority can direct an industry to go to any particular area but when local people make such a determined effort, they should get extra consideration from the Minister and the Authority.</P>
    <P>I want to refer in particular to the work of the County Kilkenny Industrial Development Committee which had a pilot study made of the Kilkenny region at great expense.  That effort put the individual members of the committee into debt but they were prepared to do it in order to get all the available information about the region into book form.  I hope their efforts will be more fully recognised by the Department in time to come and that other areas will be encouraged to do likewise.</P>
    <P>The main point I want to make is that there are many private individuals who are spending a lot of their free time and their money in an effort to bring industries into their areas, industries which would be of no direct benefit to themselves.  These people have the good of their country and their particular areas at heart and it is time some recognition was given to them.</P>
    <P>There is one big hindrance to the development of industry, not alone in the rural areas but also in Dublin and the urban areas, that is, the price of land where new industries are concerned.  The Minister has concerned himself with the price of land for housing and I would ask him to have a look also at the problem of land prices for industrial development. This is becoming a major obstacle to the development of industry.  When it is rumoured that somebody is interested in setting up an industry, people who own land in the neighbourhood immediately jack up the price.  Unless something is done pretty soon about this matter, many foreign industrialists intending to come here <Col N="347" /> will be discouraged.  It is most discouraging to find local people demanding a price above the normal market price for land for the development of industry.  I would ask the Minister to give this matter the same attention as he has given to the price of land for housing.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to Kilkenny Design Workshops.  I have said before, and I find it necessary to repeat it here today, that there are some Irish industrialists and managers who are not fully conscious of the value of the work being done by Kilkenny Design Workshops.  Steps should be taken to bring these people to realise that there is this very valuable amenity on their doorsteps here in Ireland.  Not alone have the Kilkenny Workshops been responsible for new designs but they have also been responsible for the production of items such as some types of candlesticks which were thought for many years to be unsaleable. Kilkenny Design Workshops tackled this, and developed good designs with the result that a market has developed for these items over the past number of years.  In Kilkenny, they are now at the point where they are finding it rather difficult to get trained personnel and with the expansion that is taking place there, more skilled personnel will be required.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in that connection to have a word with the Minister for Education to see if some branches of higher technical education, and possibly some other courses, could be established in order to train the local people to take on this work.  With the expansion of the workshops, it is getting more and more difficult and they will run into difficulties because of a lack of trained personnel.  There is a difficulty in attracting personnel from foreign countries.  Efforts are being made by the vocational committee in Kilkenny to provide some of the courses required, but further assistance will be needed from the Minister and also from the Minister for Education in order to expedite the provision of these amenities.</P>
    <P>It is also important that money is available for capital development in <Col N="348" /> these workshops because space is all important in the development of design. A correct environment is equally important.  The setting of the workshops in the Ormonde Castle has given an environment which lends itself to good design.  It remains now for the expansion of the workshops and the provision of the extra workshops to take full advantage of the work which is being done there.  The results of that work have shown that they are good, and locally they are beginning to bring results because in the silversmith end of the business there are definite proposals for the establishment of a small workshop for the provision of the items that have been designed in the workshops. With the provision of silver items designed in the workshops and their marketing, it has been established that there is a profitable and valuable market for these products.</P>
    <P>As I said before, this is a double achievement.  They have made the designs and they have also discovered markets and outlets for those designs, and for items which were believed to be unsaleable many years ago.  I hope the Minister will continue to give the necessary money to the Kilkenny Design Workshops in order to help them to continue with this good work and to expand it.  I also hope he will take steps to bring to the notice of the remaining few people in the industry who are not fully aware of it the valuable assistance which these design workshops can be to them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the granting of assistance to managers and industrialists to go to foreign countries to examine production methods.  I seriously suggest that the Minister should encourage these industrialists and managers&mdash;and even pay their fares&mdash;to go to Kilkenny to see these workshops first.  They can then go to foreign parts and see if they have got anything better, and see if they can improve themselves in other directions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that we welcome this Supplementary Estimate and the provision of extra money for Industry and Commerce.  We hope it will give the good results it is intended to give.</P>
    <Col N="349" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Minister said that we had never been faced with the problem of full employment and that he would not mind facing up to this problem.  I think that is the sentiment of everyone in this House.  Full employment has its problems but we would be willing to swap them for the problem of unemployment, and on this Department must fall the greatest part of the task of trying to create jobs for our people.  While I have every confidence that the Minister will do this eventually, at the same time, I wonder are we going fast enough towards creating more jobs and absorbing those workers who are becoming redundant through efficiency in industry.</P>
      <P>There are two large concerns in the city which I know of which have had efficiency experts in.  They bought £9,000 worth of new machinery, and they produce better and cheaper articles.  Unfortunately, this involves redundancy of workers.  The replacement of workers is more a problem for the Department of Labour than the Department of Industry and Commerce. At the same time, unless we go on to create new jobs for people who become redundant, and for youths leaving school, we will be in a bad way indeed, and we will hardly be in a position to enter a European community with any hope of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to see this Supplementary Estimate being brought in, because it shows that the Department is alive and spending money on such things as the support of Córas Tráchtála which is doing an excellent job in trying to attract industries, and help small industries like the Kilkenny Design Workshops.  The achievement of these workshops is a great step forward because some years ago we were slated by European experts for lack of design.  The Government took notice of that criticism.  The establishment of these workshops is tied in with the Minister's hope for the preservation of small industries.  I do not think we will ever attract huge industries such as they have in the United Kingdom and on the Continent. Perhaps we do not want them.  We <Col N="350" /> want industries which will give our people an opportunity of displaying their talents, and ensure them a full life in their own country.</P>
    <P>On the point of the attraction of outside industry and outside investment, one can only deplore the outlook of certain sections, of the Luddites, who oppose investment by outside industries.  I have always found that the people who oppose the establishment of industries by outside investment come from the more affluent sections of society, the people who are in good jobs and good homes and who would not feel the pinch of unemployment or any scarcity.  I think the House is behind the Minister and the Government in trying to attract outside industrialists.  From time to time we have heard criticism of some of them and, probably in a few cases, it was justified.  Some of the things on which we based our hopes did not come to fruition and we lost a lot of money on those industries.  But just as you cannot have an omelette without breaking eggs, you certainly cannot expand industry without having some casualties on the way.  These should not discourage us but rather should encourage us to continue expanding our efforts to develop industry, by showing European or American industrialists what we have here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have not got a great deal of natural resources but I wonder if we are using even those we have to the fullest extent, and in the proper way.  Deputy Pattison mentioned the Kilkenny coal mines.  It would seem very important to us that those mines be kept going there but we have got to face the fact that the days of solid fuel have gone. Even in the United States and Britain &mdash;with their vast coalfields&mdash;they do not use them any more.  But I think in Kilkenny, where we had that vast coal mine, it was a major disaster. It is to the credit of the Minister that he came to their assistance and we can only hope that the new investment in the mines will help to preserve present employment.  But we have got to face the fact that we are only staving off the day when people will no longer <Col N="351" /> use solid fuel.  Apart from turf and the small amount of coal we have, we have little other resources of fuel. But we are glad to see the Minister spending quite a lot of money on mineral research.  I wonder if it will be the responsibility of the Department to encourage mining companies to tap the coastal areas for natural gases and oil.  It seems to me&mdash;if they can find all this natural gas under the North Sea&mdash;there must be some around our coast and surely we have, in our universities, sufficient geologists to give us some good line on this?  If we did have any natural gases or oil around our coast, it would certainly change our whole economy for the better.  I feel there must be some there and it would be well worth going after.  I hope, when the Minister submits his main Estimate&mdash;if it is his responsibility&mdash;he will see that some money is provided for exploration of the coastal waters for oil and natural gases.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the technical assistance offered to firms by the Department has been fully taken up.  One gets rather uneasy about these matters because we have a lot of inefficient industries here and the time has come in industry when both labour and capital must get together and realise there is one side only in industry, that there are not two sides.  If a firm fails, the workers will be the first to feel the pinch and, after that, the executives. At the moment what we have to do &mdash;apart from planning expansion of production&mdash;is to safeguard present employment and we have to face the fact that we are not doing this.  There have been grave irresponsibilities in industry, on both sides&mdash;capital and labour.  We are coming to the point now when a hurt to one in industry will hurt everyone.  If we can adopt this outlook, we would do far better in attracting outside industries, and do far better ourselves.  While industrial peace is not the responsibility of this Minister, at the same time&mdash;by his legislation for industry&mdash;he can contribute much which will ease out, or remove, irritants which cause <Col N="352" /> people to strike or be discontented. Now, with the setting up of the Department of Labour, we feel the Department of Industry and Commerce have a much better opportunity of doing their job with even more effect than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how many firms have availed of improvement grants for their managements. I think they have not been availing of them and, on this point, we need to be very careful when we bring in experts.  There was one very old-established firm in the city here who brought in a cross-channel firm of experts and, in six months, the firm was bankrupt.  I passed the site recently and I saw the whole building being pulled down; yet that firm of consultants are so-called experts. We must all guard against those firms. It has ruined one very old-established firm here and, unless we are very careful, it could do the same to others. That firm of experts is located in Britain but has an American title. This is one of the pitfalls we must guard against&mdash;these quack practitioners in efficiency.</P>
    <P>I have little more to say, except to impress upon the Minister again the terrible need for a quickening in the industrial rate of progress.  We still have far too many people unemployed and we cannot sit back and accept that we have the perfect society while we cannot offer full employment to each person who needs it and is willing to work.  It is worrying to most of us when we think of all the youngsters who will leave school in the near future and wonder what we can offer them.  We do not want to offer them merely messenger boys'jobs, <i>et cetera.</i> If we do not alter the system which permits this kind of thing, somebody, some day, will alter it and, perhaps, not in the best way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take advantage of this Supplementary Estimate to give some information to the Minister in connection with a grave uneasiness developing in the National Board and Paper Mills of Waterford. I am quite sure the Minister is aware <Col N="353" /> of the fact that almost a year ago this firm had a 16 weeks strike when great hardship was suffered by the workers there.  Naturally, any suggestion now that circumstances are about to evolve which will reduce the employment content by some hundreds of people will give rise to a great feeling of uneasiness and, possibly, lead to unofficial action, unless something is done about it.</P>
      <P>Some three weeks ago a meeting of Deputies from all sides of the House in the counties of Waterford and Kilkenny was called by the workers to hear their grievances and to ask them to use their good offices to arrange that the Minister, the union representatives and the firm would get together to see if there is any truth in the suggestion of the workers, and if anything can be done to allay their fears.  I understand that meeting had been sought by some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party resident in Waterford.  In fact, a tentative date has been arranged, provided the Minister will, either himself or by detailing officials of his Department, meet all the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies from all Parties are more than anxious that no hitch should occur, now that peace has been restored in this important Waterford factory.  It is just as well, however, that the Minister should hear some of the story so that if he decides to go there himself or to allow someone to go on his behalf, he will have a rough idea of what the dispute is all about.  Briefly, it is that a grant of £50,000 was given to the firm concerned to build a storeroom to contain pulp as the raw material for the making of cardboard.</P>

      <P>Briefly, anyway, it is suggested that manufactured material is coming into Waterford Harbour in the form of waste, that it has the relief of a duty-free licence and that this manufactured material is endangering the livelihoods of 200 men now employed. The meeting arranged is to discuss that matter so as to keep the manufacturing part of it in Waterford where the workers claim it has been for a number of years instead of allowing it to come in duty-free.  That is the kernel of the case.  The workers feel something should be done about it and I suggest that the Minister should endeavour to have an early meeting with representatives of the union and of the employers and the Deputies for the area, if necessary. What help the Deputies can give I do not know because this appears to be a matter for experts and that is where officials of the Department could come in.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on the establishment of the Waterford Industrial Estate.  It is said we shall have the first of our new industries at a cost of £200,000.  It represents terrific progress for the city of Waterford but, coming from the small industrial town of Dungarvan, I wish to point out that there is grave danger, if all industries are concentrated in Waterford, of many problems arising, not only a manpower problem but the problem, if a commuter service is established to take the workers into Waterford, of traffic congestion on roads leading to the city.  There may also be the problem of housing the workers not only from Great Britain but from the hinterland of Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion is that some subsidiaries of these industries should be directed as much as possible to small towns in Kilkenny and Waterford such as Kilmacthomas, Dungarvan, Lismore and Cappoquin.  These are four small towns all with unemployment <Col N="355" /> problems.  In Lismore, there are scarcely five people working&mdash;those employed by the Library Committee. All the others are messenger boys or shop assistants working in places depending on the trade of the rural community. The others all have to find employment in Youghal to which Sunbeam Wolsey run a commuter service to take them to and from work. If a subsidiary of this industry were established in Lismore, it would be to the benefit of all.  Cappoquin has a small bacon factory employing from 60 to 70 people but a considerable number of people would continue to live in the town instead of commuting outside if subsidiary industries were established there.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the proposal to give special grants to small factories.  I had work from a firm in Douglas.  They were seeking grants for the enlargement of what might be called one-man owned factories.  I can instance the case of a light engineering factory established by one man who has built it up to a level at which he employs 15 to 20 people.  He was disappointed, and so was I, to learn that these special grants were confined to a certain number of counties.  Unfortunately his business in Waterford is on the wrong side of the river: if it were situated on the other side, it would be in Kilkenny and would qualify for a grant.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not consider in relation to these special grants that a better method would be to seek out a number of typical factories the grants would help rather than to confine the scheme to a certain number of counties?  I submit that the scheme would be of much more widespread benefit if it were not confined to location but to a particular type of industry. I hope the Minister will endeavour to extend this scheme because the type of economy I have suggested is much more suited to Ireland than a concentration on big estates.  If for any reason big firms employing from 2,000 to 3,000 people, fail or if raw materials run out, as in the case of Castlecomer Collieries, it results in loss of livelihood for entire communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> I agree with Deputy Pattison's references to Castlecomer.  Any money spent by the Government on endeavours to keep these mines open would be a good investment because we must look at such investment not only as an economic effort but as one to provide social benefits.  In Castlecomer the life of the community depends on the continuation of mining there and until alternative employment can be found through the establishment of some new industry there, the mines should be continued.</P>
    <P>Encouragement should be given to the small industrial development associations established throughout the country in small towns.  I know the Minister is not empowered to direct industrialists away from Dublin and other big centres to remote parts of Ireland but I suggest that much more encouragement could be given to these local development committees. It is true they receive courtesy if they send a deputation to the IDA, who give them all the necessary information. Indeed, we feel that a good deal more encouragement could be given by sending from the Minister's office somebody who would talk to the committees, give them a reason for establishing an industry and suggest plans to them that they might keep or hold and give them any special knowledge of industrial development. I believe a trained man coming to one of those places could examine the natural resources of the place, whether the raw material was there or not or in whatever way he likes, could advise them whether they were wasting their time in endeavouring to establish an industrial development in such a community or whether it would be better to go into tourist development in a much larger way and leave aside their efforts to attract industry.</P>
    <P>In my own town of Dungarvan, our local industrial development company there have in reserve a plot of six acres of land.  We have had numerous inquiries regarding this plot.  We even had one American <Col N="357" /> firm who had an office established there.  We are beginning to wonder now if there is any hope in a small rural community such as Dungarvan, which has only a population of 5,000 people, of attracting tourists especially with the talk of an industrial estate where not only can you buy a factory already built and sheds but can rent them on a temporary capacity, if you so wish.  It would be important if the Minister would direct some of his expert investigation to the local development communities and enable them to decide whether there is any future in this wasting of money afforded to Germany, France and other countries, and indeed to America for the establishment of industries in such localities as those.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with his Supplementary Estimate.  Indeed, I can guarantee him that at all times he will have the support of the Labour Party in any efforts he makes and any money he requires to promote industrial expansion.  I suggest to him that he should endeavour to set up this meeting between the National Board and Paper Mills, the trade union officials and his officials because there is a genuine fear of loss of employment to the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the opportunity provided by this Supplementary Estimate to make some comment on the Department in charge of industries. It would be fair to say that there is considerable disappointment with regard to the unemployment position in so far as there are more people unemployed this year than there were this time last year, despite the high hopes that were held out under the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. We hope the Minister will make every possible effort to provide employment for our people.  Unemployment, unfortunately, has been a curse in this country over the years. It is sad to think after so long a period of native government, instead of that situation improving, it is in fact becoming more acute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department is responsible for the payment of very substantial grants to people who are enticed <Col N="358" /> here by agencies of his Department to establish industry and by doing so, to provide employment for our people. We in the Labour Party are prepared, and have shown we were prepared, to give support to any efforts that might be made which would result in achieving full employment for our people. However, we are concerned with the way some of those very substantial grants have been paid out of public funds and have not resulted in providing anything like the employment that was forecast or anticipated.  We are also concerned with the very substantial grants to industries that have been made without any return whatsoever, or very little return in most cases, to the people who are paying the piper, that is, the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>One of the most disappointing instances and the one that most highlighted the loose way in which some of those grants are made was the very unfortunate experience of Potez.  Nobody knows what the exact amount was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very definitely in excess of £1 million.  As a matter of fact, if we had been more careful with regard to the grant made to Potez, we could have given the Minister what he is seeking now and have some change.  We feel a much more thorough investigation should be made of the people who seek grants and other concessions to establish industries here and that a much more thorough investigation into the possibilities and potentials of the particular industries they want to establish should be made.  We also feel that there should be a great tightening up of the arrangements to ensure that if we have what can only be described as international con-men cashing in on these benefits and facilities we are prepared to offer them in order to try to secure employment for our people, there will be a definite means of dealing with any future Potez we may come across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of people coming in here to establish industry. We hear from Government spokesmen <Col N="359" /> that it is not their money we require but their technical knowledge and their ability in marketing, that they have already developed a market for the particular product and apart from their technical knowledge, we must have these people in order to ensure an outlet for the particular product they manufacture.  While this may be true, in very many cases there is no effort made to train or to give an opportunity for training to Irish nationals to acquire the technical knowledge these people have.  We feel it essential that when these people come in here to establish industries and have this special technical knowledge or ability, it should be a condition that our people be given an opportunity, and every opportunity, to train and acquire this knowledge and every effort should be made by some of the agencies which come under the Minister's Department to try to establish our own outlets for these products so that we will not be indefinitely dependent on outside people for the continuation of these industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned expenses in connection with the New York World Fair.  I am not sure whether this comes under the Minister's Department&mdash;it may be the Department of Agriculture&mdash;but I should like to mention it.  I saw a television programme recently in which it was stated that there was an international fair held in Paris in which we, as a Government, did not participate.  Individual Irish companies had displays there, some of them quite good and others which got very sharp criticism, justifiable criticism, from the commentator. Here we are about to enter the Common Market and an international fair was held in Paris which gave a wonderful opportunity to nations to display what they had to offer.  Governments as far away as New Zealand and Australia participated in this fair and it is a sad reflection on our Government that we had no pavilion. Except for a few isolated cases where individual Irish firms had a display, we were not represented.  Surely this was an ideal opportunity of showing <Col N="360" /> our goods to people who might be enticed to do business with us?  God knows, we need the business.</P>
    <P>With regard to our participation in the New York World Fair I had an opportunity of visiting the Irish pavilion in New York.  I can only say that I was more than disappointed with some of the features of that pavilion. I think I described the exterior of the pavilion as looking like a Mexican adobe hut that could not, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, be identified with Ireland.  There was nothing characteristically Irish about it.  I could not understand why, at a world fair of this type, we had not something that obviously represented Ireland, unless we were trying to perpetuate for the Americans the concept of the pig in the kitchen and that we had this type of hut in Ireland, as well as all the other misconceptions that many Americans have of us.  I will say that the interior of the pavilion was of a very high standard and it would be very difficult to find fault with it.  It displayed some of the finer things in our country.  There were recordings of poems by such people as Micheál Mac Liammóir, Siobhán McKenna and people like that.  It was very impressive.</P>
    <P>However, and this is what I took the greatest exception to, when one left the pavilion itself, in the grounds attached to it, a concession had been granted to a private individual to sell Gaelic coffee at an exorbitant price. Why we allowed a private individual, although he had a very Irish name and was possibly born here, to exploit and, in my opinion, downgrade a pavilion representing this country is something I could not understand.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that if we participate in any more fairs of any kind, this type of free enterprise will not be allowed and that we will not allow our pavilion to be downgraded in this manner.</P>
    <P>I have only one other comment to make.  I think it is very important that something which has recently cropped up should be explained to the public and that there should be no confusion in the mind of the public with regard <Col N="361" /> to the purpose and the affairs of the Department with regard to certain associations.  I have seen reference recently to an association of businessmen which has been formed: I think they go under the title of Taca.  The purpose of this organisation is to bring together businessmen whose sole purpose in coming together is to provide funds and moral support for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I believe the arrangement is that these people will meet three or four times a year and will be addressed by senior Ministers.  At a recent dinner in the Gresham Hotel, the dinner was provided at £100 per plate, the proceeds to go to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the House, in the main, for the reception given to this Supplementary Estimate. Most of the Deputies who spoke on it were constructive and endeavoured to be helpful.  There were certain exceptions, as one can expect.</P>
      <P>To deal with some of the more important points raised, I might mention first the reference by Deputy Donegan to the criticism recently made by the Federation of Irish Industries of our grant facilities and the way they are applied for the benefit of existing industries.  There is a strong case for a reassessment of what we are doing at the moment.  The Deputy will be aware that a survey is being conducted by a firm of consultants on the whole question of our grant incentives and the structure of the Industrial Development Authority. We hope to have the result of that fairly shortly.  Pending that, I do not think I should express any views on what changes might be made in our existing system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan also complained that certain industries do not qualify for adaptation grants.  I think he mentioned laundries and bakeries. Dry cleaning is another.  He did not mention it but it was treated in the same category.  The board of An Foras Tionscal had regard to the purpose of the adaptation grants, which is to assist firms engaged in programmes of expenditure on enlargement and adaptation to meet free trade conditions.  The board of An Foras Tionscal came to the conclusion that these industries and the moneys they might wish to spend on the expansion of their business did not come within this category.</P>

      <P>Reference was made by a number of Deputies to the industrial estate in Waterford.  I am glad to say it is expected that there will be six factories ready for occupation in that estate in July.  We hope that, at the very opening, there will be some worthwhile industry actually occupying the factories as they open.  It is intended also to have factory space available before industries come.  This is one of the objects in the industrial estate.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to the danger of industries employing too high a proportion of female labour.  It was pointed out that this leads to disruption of the labour market and, indeed, I do not know if it was said but it was implied, and rightly so, that it is a social disruption as well.  This, of course, is quite true.  There are areas in Deputy Donegan's constituency where this is particularly acute, I know.  However, it will be realised in this connection that the first thing to be thought of is that you do not want all male labour.  This can produce a social problem as well as a pattern of all female labour.  You may have men employed there and no women to marry them.  A certain balance is required between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority give details to people who are thinking of setting up industries here of what the situation is in a particular locality as regards female and male employment.  They endeavour, to that extent, to lead them by showing them the figures so that people can see for themselves whether or not it is an advantage to go into an area, having <Col N="368" /> regard to the kind of employment they intend to give.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by a number of Deputies to some of our failures in industries.  The firm of Potez has particularly been mentioned.  I deplore that two members of the Labour Party, in referring to this, used the word &ldquo;con-men&rdquo; or some such word.  Whatever view one may take of this particular project or of anybody connected with it, it is quite unjustifiable to make any suggestion or imputation that any confidence trick was operated here by us on behalf of Monsieur Potez.  The real test of his sincerity in this is the fact that he has invested a sum which I believe is in the region of £3 million of his own money.  This is a very genuine test of anybody's sincerity, quite apart from any question of judgment, so that, whatever may be said about this matter, I feel it is quite unfair to make allegations of bad faith.</P>
    <P>I am quite concerned about the situation that exists in regard to the Potez factory.  Monsieur Potez is under no illusion as to my concern in that regard.  Certain steps are being taken to try to remedy the situation, but, as yet, I am unfortunately not in a position to tell the House what those steps are or what the prospects are because disclosure of what is going on would be damaging to the proposals that are at present in mind.  I have no desire to keep information in regard to this project from the House any longer than is absolutely necessary. I repeat the undertaking given by my predecessor and, I think, repeated by me in the House, that at the earliest suitable opportunity a full report on this whole project will be given to the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much Deputy Donegan's very generous tribute to Córas Tráchtála which I think is fully deserved, as I have already indicated recently in the House.</P>
    <P>In regard to failures in general in industries which are attracted in here from outside, there are some things that have been said that are obvious but I do not think their import has been fully taken in.  Most Deputies <Col N="369" /> have said that they accept the fact that in a programme such as this, there are bound to be some failures. I think there are a number of Deputies who, although they have said this, have not really grasped what it means.  It means that we are bound to have some failures and, when we do, there is no use in saying at that stage that more care should have been taken, and so on, on general principles. It is all right if one can say in a particular case that care was not taken and one can show this.  This is legitimate criticism.  But, to say in general that more care should be taken simply because we have failures is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in attracting industry here, we are in a highly competitive business.  We are competing with other people, including Northern Ireland, which was mentioned here, some of whom have very much more money available for their programmes than we have and have other attractions that we may not have.  We are competing in a highly competitive market in attracting industry here.  Some Deputies have talked about the kind of safeguards that should be imposed.  If my object were to ensure that our interests were completely copper-fastened and there was no risk at all, I could devise many more restrictions that should be placed on industrialists coming in here, but, of course, I would effectively ensure that no worthwhile industrialist came in.</P>
    <P>This is something that must be borne in mind: not only are we competing with others but any worthwhile industrialist is a man who is in business and knows he has to take certain risks but he is not prepared to have his business so tied down that it is in the hands of our Government or any other Government.  If we want to impose these kinds of conditions, we can ensure that we have no failures but we may also ensure that we will have no industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne said that there was a drop in employment in the past 12 months and, although he did not know, that he believed that the drop was in manufacturing industry.  I have got <Col N="370" /> some figures in that connection which I should, perhaps, mention to the House.  In the quarter ended 30th September, 1966, employment in manufacturing industry was 2,100 above that of the corresponding period of 1965, while in the quarter ended 30th June, 1966, employment in manufacturing industry was 1,400 less than in the corresponding period of 1965. So it would appear that while there was some loss of employment in the earlier part of last year in manufacturing industry, in the later part of the year it was more than made up for. This, of course, was in circumstances in which, as we all know, our economic difficulties and the international economic difficulties were considerable.</P>
    <P>Just for the record, let me say that the story to which Deputy Dunne referred of the Potez factory being used as a television studio or some such is complete news to me.  I have heard nothing about this and I rather think it is untrue or I would know about it.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to embark on a fullscale debate on whether or not we ought to go into the Common Market but I do think it is time that members of the Labour Party who speak on this topic would start telling us realistically what they believe is the alternative to membership.  Do they mean staying out altogether?  Do they mean some form of association?  In either case, what do they visualise exactly would be the results politically, economically and particularly as regards employment? It is not good enough to go on forever expressing doubts about the Common Market and not saying exactly what they stand for themselves.</P>
    <P>There was some reference to Castlecomer and the assistance which has been given there to the coalmines.  I think it is clear from what has already happened that the Government have already shown their special interest in and concern for Castlecomer and their understanding of the fact that there could be a very grave social problem involved there.  The form of approach to this problem by the Government has been twofold.  On the one hand, as the House knows, further financial <Col N="371" /> assistance was given to Castlecomer to enable exploration to be made of further resources and, as I mentioned in introducing the Supplementary Estimate, the indications are certainly not bad and we would hope by the end of the present year to be in a position to make a reasonable assessment of the prospects.  It has been established, as I have mentioned, that there is a large deposit of coal there but what has yet to be established is whether it is economically extractable.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Government's approach to the Castlecomer problem has been to ensure that An Foras Tionscal now treat Castlecomer as a special area warranting the giving of a grant of up to two-thirds of the cost for a suitable industry in that area which would otherwise be eligible only for a maximum of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Pattison and Deputy Kyne made reference to the local industrial development associations and I concur in what they said.  I concur in the tribute they paid to the members of these associations and the very good work that most of them are doing, putting in a lot of time, trouble and money, as I think Deputy Pattison said, very often simply out of a sense of loyalty to the community in which they live and to the nation in general. These people deserve the thanks of all of us.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that they deserve more than thanks.  It was said that they get courtesy and assistance from the Industrial Development Authority and my Department&mdash;I hope they do &mdash;but that perhaps they could get something more in the way of contact with them and the extension to them of special knowledge that might be available to us.  I am glad to tell the House that the Industrial Development Authority is organising a seminar to be held in Athlone early in April for members of such development associations throughout the country.  I hope to be present at this seminar. It is hoped to make available to the participants the knowledge and expertise which have been acquired over the years by the Industrial Development <Col N="372" /> Authority and by certain local development associations and individuals who have been particularly successful in this kind of operation.  It is hoped to make available their experience and knowledge and to try to advise the members of these associations generally on how best to approach the task they have taken on. I hope that this will be a worthwhile operation and, if it is, and if it appears that there is room for expanding the scope of this kind of operation, then we will certainly do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne mentioned that he had certain fears in regard to the Waterford industrial estate, about the concentration within the estate operating perhaps to the detriment of small towns in surrounding areas.  I want to say to him, that it is envisaged that the development of an industrial estate would lead to the development of industries in smaller towns in the surrounding area of the kind he had in mind, industries which would make components or parts for industries located in the industrial estate.  This is certainly part of the plan in connection with the industrial estates. Having said that, we must also recognise the fact that more and more of our people are going to have to become commuters to a large extent and the idea of travelling a considerable distance to work, which might not have been acceptable to us ten years ago, is going to have to become more and more accepted.  Indeed, it has already become so in certain areas.</P>
    <P>For instance, in relation to Shannon it is well known now that workers commute quite a considerable distance. It is very likely that the pattern of industrial development in relation to those estates or growth centres could well lead to more and more of this.  Apart from any programme that might be developed for helping small industries, the main industrial development is going to be based on larger industries, particularly in growth centres, and this of necessity is going to mean more and more workers commuting to these centres.</P>
    <P>I might say to Deputy Kyne that he would be unwise to come to the contance <Col N="373" /> clusion that Dungarvan is not going to get any industry.  I can understand why he had this fear but it would be an unwise assumption and no industrial development association in an area should give up their efforts without having had a pretty clear indication that they are wasting their time.  I am not aware of any of them who are wasting their time at present, but in particular, they would not be wasting their time in Dungarvan.  I have dealt with most of the main points which were raised and if I have omitted any, it is not by design that I have done so.</P>

      <P>The sum required now by way of Supplementary Estimate is £21,500 arising under three subheads, A, B, and D.  Subhead A covers the sum of £5,000 to cover tenth round pay increases granted to the staff of the Central Statistics Office.  In fact, the increases would have amounted to £11,500 but they are partly offset by a saving of £6,500, due to vacancies not being filled.  Under subhead B, the amount we are looking for is £4,300. This is to cover extra amounts required by the Garda Síochána in regard to their assistance in carrying out the 1966 census of population and also some arrears of subsistence due to members of the Garda in connection with the 1965 census of agriculture. The final item, under subhead D, is for £12,000, which arises out of the work done by the civil enumerators in connection with the 1966 census of population.</P>

      <P>The amount sought here by way of Supplementary Estimate is £2,125,000. It can be divided into two parts.  First of all, I want to explain that this Supplementary Estimate covers only 31 Votes.  There are eight other Votes which also need extra amounts of money to cover increases in remuneration, but we are including the additional amount required for remuneration in respect of them in the separate Supplementary Estimate for the particular Votes.  For the 31 Votes, we are taking them all together in this one Supplementary Estimate for remuneration covering the whole 31.  This sum of £2,125,000 can be divided into two different amounts, one of £1,160,000 for tenth round increases and the other, £965,000, covering increases other than tenth round pay increases.  This is required because of delayed adjustments in respect of the eighth round for certain Post Office grades and certain officers of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

Nothing has yet been agreed about that and it is not included here.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £26,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1967, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain Miscellaneous Educational and Cultural Services and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Supplementary Estimates are required in the case of the following Votes&mdash;Office of the Minister for Education, Primary Education, Secondary Education, Vocational Education and Vote for Universities and Colleges and Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  The following are the factors which gave rise to the necessity for these Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> The additional sums required in respect of Vote 28 are for Subheads A 1&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances; A 4&mdash; Expenses in connection with Commission on Higher Education; F 1&mdash;Publications in Irish; and G 8&mdash;Scientific Research Grants to Students.</P>
    <P>In so far as Subhead A 1 is concerned, the excess arises from the implementation of the general agreement made at Conciliation Council Meetings in June and July, 1966, under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for payment as from 1st June, 1966 of certain increases not exceeding £1 per week to officers on salaries not exceeding £1,200 per annum.  Provision for such increases could not be made at the time of the preparation of the original Estimate as the agreement was not negotiated until July, 1966.</P>
    <P>It was also not possible to estimate with any degree of precision at the time of the preparation of the original Estimate the amount which would be required for subhead A 4&mdash;Expenses in connection with the Commission on Higher Education, and only a token provision of £10 was made.  The actual sum required for the financial year 1966-67 is now estimated at £910.  I may say that a Summary of the Report of the Commission was presented to me by the Commission on 24th February, 1967 and arrangements are being made to have it printed and published with all possible dispatch.</P>
    <P>The excess in Subhead F 1 is occasioned by (1) an excess of £4,000 in subsection F 1 (i) owing to certain publication costs accruing due for payment earlier than anticipated and (2) to a special payment of £19,000 to a firm engaged full-time in the publication of books in Irish.</P>
    <P>The other subhead in this Vote for which a supplementary sum is required is G 8&mdash;Scientific Research Grants to Students.  This scheme has been in operation for many years and the grants payable under it are in the form of maintenance allowances to graduate students for training in research in science departments in Irish universities. To be eligible for a grant, a <Col N="379" /> student must have secured at least second class honours, grade one, in his degree examination.</P>
    <P>A decision was made in 1965 to extend the scheme in two important respects.  In the first place the fields of research to which the scheme applied were extended to include engineering as well as pure science.  Secondly, it was decided that the grants, which up to then had been tenable for one year only, should be renewable for a second year and a third year subject to satisfactory reports on the progress of the student's work.  This decision was taken in the light of expert advice, which was that one year of research was no longer sufficient for the training of scientists either for industry or for the educational sector.</P>
    <P>The underlying purpose in expanding the scheme was to stimulate research in the science and engineering departments of the universities. This is important in making university teaching posts attractive to scientists and engineers of high calibre.  It also assists the university staffs to keep abreast of advances in their own fields and leads therefore to a strengthening of undergraduate teaching.</P>
    <P>In the current academic year, that is, the year which began in October last, there are 45 students in receipt of grants awarded for the first time this year and 36 students who are now in their second year or third year of post-graduate work.</P>
    <P>It was not possible to forecast accurately at the time of the preparation of the original Estimates the number of students who would qualify for new grants, or apply for renewal of their grants, as the revised arrangements had been only a short while in operation.  It became clear during the course of the year, however, that an additional sum of £5,700 would be required.</P>
    <P>Excesses in the Votes for Primary and Secondary Education are attributable to agreements reached at meetings of the Conciliation Councils under the Schemes of Conciliation and <Col N="380" /> Arbitration for the three groups of teachers&mdash;national, secondary and vocational.  The increases in salaries agreed upon were in line with those granted to civil servants with salaries not exceeding £1,200 per annum which I have already referred to in relation to the excess in Subhead A1 of Vote 28.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Primary Education Vote, the additional cost of the increases in salaries and capitation grants for the period 1st June, 1966, to 31st March, 1967, is estimated to be £377,000.  A further sum of £113,000 will, it is estimated, be required to meet the additional cost of salaries of an increased number of teachers resulting from the continuing improvement in school staffing conditions.</P>
    <P>The excess in Subhead D of Vote 29 &mdash;Primary Education &mdash; arises partly from the effects of the increases in salaries already referred to and partly from a marginal underestimation in the first instance of the amount required for the subhead.</P>
    <P>In relation to Vote No. 31 &mdash; Vocational Education &mdash; the educational schemes drawn up annually by vocational education committees are financed mainly from local rates and from State grants to the committees. The amount which may be contributed by the local rating authorities is limited, as a maximum, to the product of 24d per £1 of valuation.  The balance of the current expenditure of vocational education committees is met for the most part from the State grant from Subhead A of this Vote.</P>
    <P>In 1966-67 the amount provided in the subhead for State grants to the 38 vocational education committees was £3,091,100.  This sum was made up of two elements, firstly, annual grants which are paid by the Department to all committees in proportion to the amount contributed from the local rates and, secondly, special grants which are paid by the Department to committees whose resources would not otherwise be sufficient to finance their approved schemes.</P>
    <P>Due to the increased expenditure on salaries resulting from the agreement <Col N="381" /> already referred to under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for vocational teachers and to necessary additional expenditure on equipment and materials and extra teachers required urgently to cope with increased enrolments and wider courses of instruction, it has been found necessary to increase the total amount of the special grants for 1966-67 in the case of a number of vocational education committees.  The extra amount is £110,000 and this is the sum now requested in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Vote for universities and colleges.  A sum of £199,000 is being provided by way of <i>ad interim</i> grants to the university colleges in order to obviate the raising of fees in respect of the coming financial year.  I stated in Seanad Éireann on the 9th of last month that I had given most earnest consideration to representations made to me in regard to university fees particularly in view of the imminence of the Report of the Commission on Higher Education.  I came to the conclusion that it would be particularly inopportune for university tuition fees to be raised just now before the Government should have an opportunity of considering the recommendations in the Report.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made for an increase in the grant to the College of Surgeons from £8,000 to £16,000.  The additional money is required to meet increased expenditure on salaries and equipment.</P>
    <P>On the capital expenditure side, an additional £110,000 is being made available to University College Dublin to meet the balance of the expenditure on the science buildings at Belfield.  It was originally anticipated that the final accounts would not be ready for presentation before the financial year 1967-68 and accordingly provision for final payments was not made in the Vote for the present financial year. The accounts are, however, being presented to the college during the present year and the necessary provision to meet them is, accordingly, being made in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> Capital expenditure had not been anticipated in the case of University College Galway during 1966-67.  In fact, however, certain works had to be undertaken in connection with the heating arrangements of the quadrangle buildings and there are other capital costs also to be met this year in connection with the college's plans for the provision of extra accommodation.  The amount involved is £35,000.</P>
    <P>I trust that the purposes for which extra money is being made available in these Supplementary Estimates for the Votes, Office of the Minister for Education, Primary, Secondary and Vocational Education and Universities and Colleges, will commend themselves to the House and I ask for its approval accordingly of the Supplementary Estimates involved.</P>

      <P>In so far as these Supplementary Estimates are concerned and so far particularly as they refer to money required to pay additional salaries agreed at conciliation and arbitration, no exception whatsoever can be taken to them.  There is one item to which I should like to refer and perhaps the Minister would give us some information on it.  I refer to the excess in Subhead F.1. which the Minister states is owing &ldquo;to a special payment of £19,000 to a firm engaged full-time in the publication of books in Irish.&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister would let us have some further information on this matter, as to the firm concerned, and as to the type of publication to which he refers.  He does not give us any information on the subject.  Perhaps he will give us some information as to the expenditure of money under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the expenditure of money on primary schools, I know that most of the Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the additional costs of salaries of an increased number of teachers resulting from the continuing improvement in school staffing conditions. I should like to refer the Minister to a problem which has arisen in Dublin, and in other parts of the country too, that is, the problem of non-aided primary schools.  I understand <Col N="383" /> there are a number of these schools in Dublin in which the staff engaged have no qualifications whatsoever, and when the students move from those schools to secondary schools they are not up to the standard of what I might describe as recognised primary schools.  I wonder is the School Attendance Act being properly enforced in permitting students to attend such schools.</P>
    <P>I am personally aware that a number of primary teachers are very worried about the increasing number of these non-aided or non-recognised primary schools in the city of Dublin.  Perhaps the Minister would look into it with particular reference to the fact that the School Attendance Act may not be complied with in so far as these schools are concerned, whether he is satisfied with the standard of teaching in these schools, and whether the standard of teaching is sufficient to enable pupils from non-recognised primary schools to follow on with further secondary education.</P>
    <P>On the question of secondary education, I understand a survey has been carried out recently by the Minister and his Department and, as a result, there is zoning of secondary education in certain areas.  It is proposed to practically compulsorily boycott certain secondary schools in favour of other secondary schools.  I understand there is no county in which this is more prevalent than County Donegal.  I certainly hope no existing secondary school will be victimised in any way as a result of this zoning of secondary schools.  I am aware of two secondary schools in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, one in Dungloe and the other in Gweedore. I sincerely hope no official sanction will be given to any scheme which might militate against the curtailment of the catchment area for prospective students of those schools.  It would be a very bad thing indeed if such should happen and I sincerely hope it will not.</P>
    <P>Now, when we are so conscious of our prospective entry into the Common Market, I wonder is sufficient emphasis being laid on the teaching of continental <Col N="384" /> languages in our secondary schools? Perhaps it might be possible to give students attending secondary school more generous scholarships to enable them, in the modern era, to brush up their continental languages because, if and when we do enter the Common Market, that may be a very severe handicap.  After all, those engaged in the export industry will not be confined to university graduates, and a working knowledge of at least one continental language will be more advantageous to all those engaged in the export drive. Perhaps the Minister could, and would, consider more generous scholarships to enable pupils to visit the continent and brush up, or acquire, at least a spoken knowledge of one continental language.</P>
    <P>With regard to Subhead 4&mdash;Vocational Schools&mdash;it is very good to know the Minister has been so generous in his grants to vocational committees for the establishment and enlargement of existing vocational schools.  After all, as the Minister points out in his speech, the local contribution is limited to 24 pence in the £ and it is practically impossible for local authorities to carry out their planned programme of vocational school building on such limited funds.  Were it not for the generous grants procured from the Department, it would be impossible to carry on.  The Minister should ensure, when local authorities build such vocational schools, money will not prevent them being properly staffed.  Donegal Vocational Education Committee last year built a magnificent school at Gweedore but, when they came to apply for sanction for the employment of teachers they were shot down by the Minister and his Department, and no money was provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is, because protest meetings were held throughout the area.  I was not available to attend such meetings but I understand my colleague and friend, Deputy Breslin, did attend such protest meetings and, as a result, it was possible to syphon off teachers from <Col N="385" /> other schools to man the new school building.  In that way, staff was procured for this very fine school erected in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I am aware that Donegal Vocational Education Committee have plans for the building of many schools throughout the county and I sincerely hope there will be some liaison between the secondary education branch of the Minister's Ministry and the vocational education branch thereof.  Otherwise, they may find themselves drawing students out of a very small pool, particularly when this free-for-all secondary education becomes law on the 1st September next; there may be a rush for secondary schools, at the expense of vocational schools.  I sincerely hope that will not happen, and that the Minister will continue to emphasise the importance of vocational and comprehensive schools throughout the country.  I am a little disappointed at the delay in completing the limited comprehensive school programme the Minister announced some time ago.  I sincerely hope those comprehensive schools will proceed, as planned, and that there will be no difficulty about the staffing of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the universities&mdash; which are provided for under Vote 33 &mdash;we cannot take very much exception to the expenditure of money on enlargement of existing universities but, now that a controversy has again crept into the position of Dublin University &mdash;Trinity College&mdash;I think the Minister should use his good offices to try to clarify that position.  I am taking no sides in this matter, but here we have a magnificent university situate in the very centre of the capital, with a campus second to none, with building facilities available, and our sister university&mdash;the National University&mdash; is cramped for space.  We are aware that the authorities of Dublin University will welcome students from any part of the 32 counties of Ireland to the curriculum provided in their college, but certain people object to a certain section of the community attending Dublin University.  There appears to be new thought on this matter and opinion appears to be divided.  I think the Minister could <Col N="386" /> use his good offices in this matter and, possibly, consult the divergent views and try to unify them on this subject. It would be of considerable advantage to university education in this country; it would provide many more places for prospective students wishing to acquire a university education.  I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;knowing, as I do, he has got the ear of at least some of those parties with divergent views&mdash;to try to bring these together, particularly in view of the fact that one of the authorities of Dublin University welcomes this new outlook, and this new look.  Perhaps the Minister would try to do something in that matter and endeavour to make available to undergraduates and future graduates the advantages of Dublin University.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will state, in respect of £6,720,405 subscribed by way of share capital or loan in Shannon Free Airport Company, why only £122,017, or less than 2 per cent, was paid in dividends or interest in the year ended 31st December, 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The State subscription of capital to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company as at 31st December, 1966 and amounting to £6,720,405 comprised £4,319,000 in respect of share capital and £2,401,405 in respect of repayable advances on which interest is payable at the Exchequer lending rate prevailing at the time of issue.  The amount of £122,017 relates, therefore, to interest paid by the company in the year ended 31st December, 1966, on outstanding repayable advances.  No dividend has been paid on share capital because the company is in a development stage and has not reached a position in which profits are available for payment of dividends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why in the year ended 31st March, 1966 no interest or dividends were paid on £11,427,479 invested by way of share capital in Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the Government's policy that any profits earned by Irish Shipping Ltd. should be retained to finance the improvement and expansion of their fleet and the articles of association accordingly preclude the payment of a dividend. The net profits earned by the Company in the year ended 31st March, 1966 were £58,404.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it better machinery if profits by way of dividends were taken back into the Exchequer and then the House could vote whatever moneys were necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements have been in existence for a long time, during the terms of various Governments, to the effect that Irish Shipping should use any dividends that became available for the expansion and improvement of their fleet and this is incorporated in the articles of the company.  I made the position clear in the course of every debate on the Estimate for Transport and Power and it has equally been made clear in the company's reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why, in respect of £8,224,034 invested in or lent to Aerlinte Teoranta, the dividend and/or interest paid in the year ended 31 December 1966 was only £37,000, or less than ½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the £8,224,034 <Col N="391" /> capital employed in Aerlinte at 31st December, 1966, £7,217,034 was subscribed by the Exchequer in the form of share capital.  No dividend has been paid on the share capital issued because the improvement and expansion of the company's fleet has necessitated the retention in the company of profits earned to date.  The balance of £1,007,000 covers borrowings from commercial sources, on which the company paid in the year ended 31st December, 1966, interest at commercial rates amounting to £37,000 in respect of the periods for which the borrowings attracted interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think also in this case that the other machinery would be better, that interest should be paid on sums invested and that Parliament could vote any money that might be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says could in fact be done but I have gone out of my way to clarify the position in response to criticism by members of the Opposition.  I have made it clear that both Aer Lingus and Aerlinte were required to expand their services, that the expansion of their services involved further investment of capital of a kind which would not be entirely related to a purely commercial operation.  That applies to both companies.  In the case of Aer Lingus in particular, the Government allowed them to expand their operations and to engage in flights on routes for which they would not have earned the necessary depreciation profit fund to provide aircraft.  That has been made clear to the House on many occasions and I do not see any reason to alter the principle.  As and from two or three years ago, the Government decided that all new capital required by the two air companies should be provided by depreciation funds and that if capital were raised from outside sources or from the State, from then onwards dividends should be paid thereon.  That was a new policy device and the House can be assured that is the regulation now. Both companies have to remunerate <Col N="392" /> their capital for the very great expansion being carried out.  As I have said, the position has been made doubly clear on many occasions regarding the change over from one system to another.</P>

No dividend has been paid on the share capital issued because the improvement and expansion of the company's fleet has necessitated the retention in the company of the profits earned to date.

      <P>The amount of interest paid on the Board's Transport Stocks is in accordance with the terms of issue of these stocks.  The rates of interest on the Exchequer capital advances are the Exchequer lending rates current on the dates the advances were made to the Board.</P>

      <P>The figure of £1,600,000 represents the issued share capital of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited.  The company incurred a loss in the year ended 31st December, 1965 and was unable to pay a dividend on its share capital. The question of loan interest does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if the proposal to replace postmen with delivery vans is designed to reduce their numbers; and, if so, if he is aware of the hardship which will be caused to temporary postmen in the service by the loss of employment in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amalgamation of postmen posts is inherent in the extension of motorised services.  In order to avoid hardship, the policy has been not to displace established or quasi-permanent staff but to await the occurrence of suitable vacancies.  The men taken on to fill the vacancies pending the preparation and implementation of motorisation proposals have been employed on a purely temporary basis. Some have been kept on for longer periods than was originally envisaged but the great majority of them have had comparatively short service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department consider that the money would be better spent in the employment of local men to do the job of delivering the mails than on employing vans run on imported fuel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is a justifiable argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of those are only temporary postmen.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that established postmen will not be displaced.  Those who will be displaced are temporary postmen and there is a very large <Col N="394" /> number of temporary postmen in this country.  Most of those are the people who will be displaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in the reply, I agree that people will be displaced. In actual fact, no established postmen are being displaced.  We are awaiting vacancies.  There is a short delay between the time the vacancy occurs and the time motorisation can be introduced.  During that time temporary postmen are taken on, on the understanding that they will be replaced and that it is really only very temporary employment.  From that point of view, the Department should not be accused of doing people out of employment when, in fact, the employment is only on a very temporary basis.</P>

I also understand that the estimated cost of the work was £195 and that the upgrading of the grant originally allocated from £120 to £130 was at the time when the £30 per acre limit was <Col N="395" /> raised to £50 per acre but the two-thirds still operated regardless of whether the limit was £30 or £50.  The figure of £130 is two-thirds in this case.</P>

      <P>I will look into this but of course at this stage I can give no assurances as to the outcome.</P>
      <P>I should say, however, that over the last few years technical officers of my Department have devoted considerable time to devising means of improving this fishery and have made a number of recommendations to the local fishermen. I feel that an active fishermen's co-operative could make a substantial contribution to the improvement of these public oyster beds.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the confusion being caused by the fact that there is no clearly defined demarcation between the privately-owned and free fishing oyster beds in the Clarenbridge area, County Galway; and if he will take the necessary steps to have the limits of the free fishing areas clearly defined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The limits of the oyster bed in the Clarenbridge area which is the subject of an oyster fishing order are precisely set out in the order itself. I am aware, however, that there is some dissatisfaction on the part of fishermen, who engage in the adjoining public oyster fishery, about the local marking of these limits.  While the observance of the limits is essentially one for mutual arrangement between the fishermen and the grantees of the oyster fishery order, I will see what can be done towards improving the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, and orders made thereunder it is illegal for any person to have aboard a fishing vessel any fishing net the mesh size of which does not conform to prescribed standards laid down in respect of fishing in specified areas for certain varieties of fish.  In addition, the Act makes it illegal for any person to land, sell or have in his possession, aboard ship or elsewhere, for purposes of sale any undersized fish as defined by order.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the law is ensured by regular inspection of nets and fish by officers of my Department.  Where breaches of the law are disclosed it is the practice to take remedial action by way of warning or prosecution, should the nature of the offence so warrant.</P>

I think it has been said here in the House by Deputies from all sides that they are aware of efforts made in this regard.  The fact still remains that for any effective campaign to increase exports of Irish whiskey, we must depend on the distillers themselves whose primary business it is to do so.

      <P>Taking the position broadly, the filling of vacancies on nursing staffs does not present a difficult problem except in a relatively small number of cases of long stay institutions.

In the case of consultant medical staff the main difficulty arises in the case of radiological appointments and is a reflection of a world-wide shortage of consultants in this specialty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems relating to consultant staffing in health authority acute hospitals are at present being discussed by my Department with representatives of the <Col N="409" /> Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union and I am hopeful that as a result of these discussions agreement will be reached on means whereby such deficiencies and shortcomings as exist in consultant staffing will be made good.</P>

My anxiety in asking the question was to ensure that the plan would be furnished, well in advance of the introduction of legislation, to all those who are concerned, including local authorities, together with requisite information as to bed availibility, occupancy, population, medical staff, etc.  This information has not been given because of the absence of any reports from the Department of Health in the past nine years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the estimated total Government grant for health services for 1967-68 appearing in the provisional estimates of expenses and draft demands, as published in 1966, formed on the assumption that the supplementary grants would continue on the same basis as obtained in 1966-67 of (a) Dublin Health Authority (b) Cork Health Authority (c) Limerick Health Authority and (d) Waterford Health Authority; the amount of Government grant for 1967-68 subsequently notified to each health authority; the estimated short-fall in revenue in each case; and if it is proposed to amend the law to permit the health authorities to serve supplementary demands on the rating authorities or to allow the rating authorities to make loans to the health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to introduce legislation to amend the law so as to permit the joint health authorities to serve supplementary demands on the rating authorities.  I am advised that, if a rating authority is aware before striking its rate for any year that the amount which has been demanded on it for any purpose is likely to be insufficient, it may, in pursuance of prudent financial practice, raise a sum by way of its rate for that <Col N="411" /> year to meet its increased liability, which would be reflected in the demand for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 5 of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, a rating authority already has power to lend money to a joint health authority.

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there can be no doubt that the purposes for which the Minister requires the Supplementary Estimate must be accepted by the House.  It is for the purposes of paying additional salaries to teachers&mdash;primary, vocational and secondary&mdash;for publications in Irish and the payment of grants to vocational education committees who find that they have reached the statutory limit, and for the expansion in terms of fees and in terms of years of scientific research grants to students of university colleges.  All these things must be agreed and we can be brief in our references to the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to increased salaries for teachers as a result of wage increases under conciliation and arbitration, we believe that teachers are people who merit this increased pay, particularly teachers with salaries under £1,200 a year and others who are paid lower <Col N="414" /> salaries.  We in the Labour Party have always held that we should be by no means complacent with regard to our teaching force.  The present surplus recruitment position may well be due to lack of other opportunities for people with that level of education.  As we develop further, the same type of person might not so easily be got.  That is something we should keep in mind at all times to ensure that we get the best possible type of person into the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that £113,000 will, it is estimated, be required to meet the additional cost of salaries of an increased number of teachers resulting from the continuing improvement in school staffing conditions. That is something which should be very much kept in mind, regardless of what the Minister said in recent months with regard to the extension and improvement of post-primary education.  We believe that the pupil-teacher ratio in primary education, particularly in Dublin, Cork and large schools throughout the country, must be attended to because until the number of pupils per teacher is substantially reduced the type of pupil going forward for post-primary education will not be satisfactory from the point of view of earlier education.  In grossly overcrowded classes, it is not possible to give anything like the degree of attention which each pupil requires.  It is a matter of prime importance to reduce the numbers in grossly overcrowded classes as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one point which I would like to clarify.  There has been a misunderstanding about something I said earlier this week.  To be very brief about it, I might have given the impression that I myself, at any rate, felt at this juncture that the managerial system was in need of replacement. If I gave that impression, I did not mean to do so.  It does not represent my personal view on the matter. I must have given that impression because of a recent press report but I now want it to go on record that that does not represent my view.</P>
    <P>There is a very great need for more involvement by parents in the running <Col N="415" /> of primary schools generally.  We in the Labour benches have always pressed for the setting-up of managerparent-teacher organisations, especially at a time when there is no dispute. We believe that parents who are involved in the running of the schools which their children attend are performing a very useful service.  Many rural Deputies know that such organisations have been set up to cope with an emergency or a crisis&mdash;for example, to protest generally against the closing of a one-teacher or a two-teacher school.  Furthermore, misunderstandings sometimes occur between parents, the school manager and the Department and there might be a threecornered dispute.  It is a pity that such a thing should happen.  Therefore, it would be well if these committees were set up in a time of peace and as something in our regular school life.  It would be well to have such committees and to encourage them for the future rather than to wait for a crisis before a committee is set up.</P>
    <P>With regard to secondary and vocational education, we should be glad if the Minister would give us some idea of the position which he promised would come into operation on 1st September next.  Is he certain that he will have places for all the pupils who will require and demand post-primary education next September?  What progress has he made with regard to the co-ordination of the various services&mdash; the utilisation of various facilities between vocational and secondary schools and school authorities; whether the questions of finance and control have been ironed out and, if not, what progress at least has been made to date?</P>
    <P>It would now appear that a choice of school will not be available next September and this represents a very grave shortcoming in the whole system. We believe that post-primary education of some form is vitally important for every child.  We believe, also, that it is vitally important that the child will receive the type of post-primary education to which he is most suited. We have always pressed for a career guidance service.  At present, the <Col N="416" /> number of comprehensive schools to be built will be very limited.  The average child throughout the country will have to make the choice next year or the year after&mdash;if a choice exists&mdash;between vocational and secondary education. We should aim very quickly at a situation in which the child will have a choice and, with career guidance, will avail of the type of post-primary education to which his talents and bias particularly direct him.</P>
    <P>We should like to hear more from the Minister about the question of university fees being kept down.  We should also like to hear him say that he intends, before long, to introduce a system of maintenance grants for university students and, not alone that, but for vocational students and secondary school students.  This is another priority in education for all post-primary pupils in the lower income groups.  I believe we can do that.  I believe we can make that available to those in our society who need it and, by so doing, we shall make a tremendous contribution socially and economically to the welfare of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal first with the points raised by Deputy O'Donnell. I think he asked me if the School Attendance Act applies to private primary schools.  Actually, such schools, I am informed, come within the scope of the School Attendance Act and make returns to the School Attendance section of the respective local authority or to the Garda, as the case may be.  I agree with what Deputy O'Donnell said with regard to the standard of teaching in certain private primary schools: I mentioned this in the Seanad.  There are not a great many such schools but they are there.  Unfortunately, in these private primary schools there are unqualified individuals teaching the children.  When these children proceed to post-primary education they suffer a tremendous disadvantage because their educational foundation is weak.  Not only unqualified people but people absolutely lacking in any experience whatsoever in the art of teaching&mdash;and very often, lacking in knowledge in the actual <Col N="417" /> subjects they were supposed to teach&mdash; were in charge of them.</P>
      <P>I think everybody will agree that some of these inexperienced individuals inculcate a disgust in the pupil for the Irish language because, being unqualified and untrained, they are not able to teach the child properly.  Therefore, the child in some of these private primary schools starts off at a severe disadvantage and carries this dislike for the Irish language and, indeed, for some other subjects possibly through his entire school life.  I said in the Seanad that I was asked to interfere with private primary schools but I am advised that this is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I cited the case that the Government of the day had faced up to the fact that we could not have unqualified dentists in Ireland treating our children's teeth. While the analogy may not be complete, I think it is wrong that the State should not be in a position to insist on minimum educational standards for private primary schools.  I am having this very important aspect examined.</P>

      <P>It would be indeed a great tragedy if any arrangements made would have such an effect.  In that connection there was a lot of uninformed criticism.  Perhaps there was anxiety on behalf of individuals concerned and perhaps I and my Department were at fault in not doing an adequate public relations job, so to speak, in giving full particulars of the proposals and stressing that any suggestions were purely a basis of discussion and that no firm decision had been made and that before the final survey plan for Donegal and the other areas is arrived at, the educational interests will again be consulted.</P>

      <P>There, again, the position was not that the Department refused the money.  I or my Department did not turn down the proposal but the vocational education committee themselves did.  In effect, the advice tendered by the Department, as far as I can recollect, to the vocational education committee was that within the number of teachers in the employment of the Donegal Vocational Education Committee it was possible to employ one of these teachers in this school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise that I was not here for <Col N="419" /> the whole of Deputy Mrs. Desmond's contribution but I did get some notes on the points raised by her.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with these points, I want to deal with another matter referred to by Deputy O'Donnell with regard to Subhead F.1.  I refer to the printing of Irish books.  Representations were made to my predecessor towards the end of 1965 that the company in question was in serious financial difficulties and would have to cease operations unless it was put in a position to meet the deficit on its accounts.  From the point of view of the standard of its publications, its enterprise in this regard and its unceasing efforts to widen the reading market for books written in Irish and to bring about a better remunerative reward for writers in the language, this company did deserve the fullest commendation and was in this respect held in the highest esteem.  My predecessor was satisfied that these considerations were valid in connection with an assessment of the application made to him for special financial assistance.  They were not, however, the only factors which he would have to take into account in arriving at a decision.  It was necessary that the firm should show that there were reasonable prospects for its success as a viable commercial concern in future, if it were given the opportunity of a fresh start on a proper financial basis.</P>
    <P>The firm agreed to co-operate in every respect in making full information available in relation to its assets and liabilities and allowed an inspection of its accounts by an accountant nominated by my predecessor and then, following the receipt of the report of the accountant in question and having carefully considered all aspects of the matter in consultation with the Minister for Finance, my predecessor was satisfied that the circumstances did justify a special grant of £16,000 to place the company on a more satisfactory financial footing and a monthly payment of £250 for a maximum of 12 months to enable it to build up a suitable programme of organisation of work over the 12 month period.  The special payment of £16,000 and the monthly payments <Col N="420" /> of £250 which have been made since April, 1966, will amount to £19,000 for the year 1966-67 and these payments are, as Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, being made from subhead F.1, subsection (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond supported the steps taken to reduce the size of classes in the national schools.  It is my opinion, with my still limited knowledge of the various problems, that priority should be given to an improved teacher-pupil ratio, particularly in the poorer sections of our cities where we have what might be referred to as the backward or slow-learning child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I wanted to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that this would be one of my priorities anyway.  There is nothing wrong mentally with these children. We would all be appalled if anybody read into it that the phraseology &ldquo;backward&rdquo; or &ldquo;slow learning&rdquo; would suggest that this was the case. The children of poor parents particularly are at a very grave disadvantage. One cannot divorce the family environment and background of each child, because their home life does have a very real bearing on their capacity to learn and their general development in the school.  I respect very much the points put forward from time to time by Deputy Mrs. Desmond on these various issues.  Therefore, I am very glad she endorses my priority in this <Col N="422" /> regard, which is a matter very close to my heart.  The only solution is to have a very good pupil-teacher ratio in such schools.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Mrs. Desmond asked me how things were progressing for September.  There has been an improvement in the outlook of many of the schools which, let us say, were wavering. I am satisfied that all the schools within the fee range of £15 to £25 will come into the scheme.  May I repeat the proposals for September?  All schools with fees under £15 will be brought up to £15 and within the range £15 to £25 what was charged last September by the school will be paid next September by the State.  In other words, if, for example, the school fee was £16 last September, we will pay £16 next September; if it was £17 last September, we will pay £17 next September, and so on up to a maximum of £25. I believe all the schools within these fee limits will come into the scheme. May I say again, because there was some confusion on this point, that if a school say they are not coming into the scheme even though their fee is £18 or some such figure, I do not propose to compel them to come in?  These schools, both religious and lay, are private institutions.  But if they do not come into the scheme and are within the limit of from £15 to £25 and if a parent gets a bill for £18, £19 or £20 and sends it to me, I will ensure that that bill is paid.  I think that the situation could be met in that way.  But I do not think there will be many such cases, if any at all.</P>
      <P>It was most gratifying to have heard within the last ten days from the principals of some schools, both religious and lay, where the fees are in excess of £25 that they propose to reduce these fees to £25 as from next September. It is most heartening and encouraging. I hope the headline set by them will be followed in many parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us any idea what number of the total have opted into the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We sent out a questionnaire to every secondary school concerned asking them various questions. <Col N="423" /> We knew what they were charging last September and we asked them if they were going to participate in the scheme and what their fees would be.  So far, we have not got the full questionnaire returned and it is not possible to give statistics.  I simply point out that certain schools have made substantial reductions in their fees.  If this is any indication of the ultimate result, it is most encouraging.  The position did not appear so favourable a while ago.  However, on reconsideration, I think the schools have realised the position and now consider that they should participate in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond asked me whether parents would have a choice of school.  I think it will be some years before we are in a position to offer parents a choice of schools within the scheme.  Were there no so-called free education scheme next September, there would still be very many schools chock-full to the doors anyway.  Indeed, in many of the schools participating we know there is a waiting list as it is.  I have, however, a special section in my Department dealing with the problem and I do not consider the problem of a lack of teachers or schools as insurmountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There again I should say that in that regard no very great problem will exist outside Dublin.  The big problem in this free education scheme is Dublin.  We anticipate a very high percentage, it could nearly approach 90, of day secondary schools outside Dublin participating in the September scheme.  I may not be entirely accurate but this is my opinion from statistics I have studied. Unfortunately, it appears that, due to certain factors, the participation rate in Dublin will be under 50 per cent. This is very unfortunate but some of <Col N="424" /> the Dublin schools, however, have already written in to say that they will come into the scheme and are reducing their fees.  Could we get this pattern generally in Dublin with the schools with fees over £25 the problem would be solved.  I cannot give a choice of school.  All I can say next September is that free education will be available but I cannot say in what school it will be available.</P>
      <P>May I mention an important matter? A friend of mine lives in a certain part of Dublin where fees are over £40.  He says it puts him to the pin of his collar to pay this fee but he is paying it because his child is in that school, is happy there and has been brought up by the teachers there and the father wants to leave him there.  It is within a reasonable distance of the home.  If he were to avail of free education the child might have to travel a long distance and change buses and might get hurt and all the other things a parent worries about. These are people who deserve consideration. This man is anything but a snob.  It would be all wrong if it went abroad that because a child is attending in the future a school where fees are charged, the parents are socially rather better than anybody else.  You will have a small percentage of parents, certain mothers in particular, who will think this way.  That cannot be helped. We have that type in every community. But I am talking of the ordinary man in the street, doing his best for his children and accepting his responsibility.</P>
      <P>May I go back to the case of my friend who is paying just over £40.  I or the Government would have to consider taking some action if some of these schools should arbitrarily raise their fees next September.  It does not mean that because they are not in the range of free education, £15 to £25, that they can, next September, bounce this fee of £40 up to £45, £50 or £60. If I am not mistaken I think that school fees are taken into account in the calculation of the consumer price index.  Perhaps Deputy Sweetman would know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they are but I should not like to bet on it.</P>

    <Col N="425" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like these schools to know that if I have evidence that unfortunate people who are paying fees are going to face increases next September I shall have to consider whether I should recommend to the Government to take some action in the matter.  What that action would be I cannot anticipate but as everyone knows, we are paying the incremental salaries of the teachers in the secondary schools and we are also paying the capitation fee for every pupil, irrespective of the fees paid or whether it is a boarding or a day-school&mdash;even in the case of the most expensive boarding-schools in the country.  If these people want to raise their fees&mdash; perhaps I had better write to them and tell them this, but I am saying it here now, in case some of them may at this time be making up their minds about fees&mdash;they should be in a position to justify any increases in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To pay £40 or more, and in Dublin in some cases far more, is hard enough for a parent with one child and in the case of a man with two or three children the hardship is all the greater. As I have already said, this is a problem which, no doubt, will have to be tackled.  I think all Parties appreciate the problem.  Fine Gael, in their policy statement, referred to it, and while we might not agree with the different solutions they propose, at least they are talking about the matter and have made firm proposals.  The Labour Party have tackled the problem also and have made certain proposals about which we might not agree, but the great thing is that we are all discussing the problem and it is a very important one, one of the most important in the State at present.  I am very glad it is being discussed.  Those who say education should be taken out of politics do not know what they are talking about.  It is absolutely essential that the question of education should be a priority matter for discussion in this Assembly.  The ambition of the Opposition is to put us out of power and they can only do that by selling their wares to the public who, in the final analysis, are the people to decide who will sit on the respective sides of <Col N="426" /> the House.  Therefore, I expect every Party and individual to have a policy on education.</P>
    <P>The fact that a person on the opposite Benches may have a good idea &mdash;and there are good ideas&mdash;will not prevent me from using the idea.  I shall certainly use it without apology to anyone.  We would be completely immature if, because Labour or Fine Gael or anybody came up with a good idea, we rejected it.  I think we are all agreed&mdash;if not, we should be&mdash;that the primary consideration for everyone interested in education is the child.  We had a great discussion on this aspect in newspaper correspondence and articles.  I personally think that far more important than the decision on fees was the decision to give free transport, particularly in rural areas.  This is far more costly than fees.  I have been shocked to hear that some people in poor circumstances have been paying nearly 30/- a week.  Transport, therefore, is a matter of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a means test. I read an article today in <i>The Secondary Teacher.</i> First of all, one of the contributors said the free transport, which was costing £1 million, should be stopped.  That is a matter of opinion and I do not think that anyone, particularly with a knowledge of circumstances in rural Ireland, would agree with it.  I was also asked why was there not a means test: that, after all, there is a means test in differential rents; there is a means test in Social Welfare, old age pensions and so on.  This is quite true, but surely there is no analogy between such cases and the present scheme.</P>
    <P>Remember, that every parent is being told that education at no cost to the parent will be available next September.  I must admit that I looked at this question of a means test, and administratively it would have been not insurmountable, though difficult enough.  Administration and the examination required in means test schemes are costly.  Apart from that, however, from the point of view of the children such a scheme would not have been fair at all psychologically, particularly <Col N="427" /> in regard to children of tender years who feel these things far more than in later life.  From reading school books and from our own experience of school we all know&mdash; perhaps stigma is not the right description&mdash;how a child would feel if other children were paying fees and he was not.  There would be a psychological reaction which could be most upsetting for the child.  I do not say that the teachers, in the main, would rub it into the children who were not paying the fees, but I suppose teachers are human like everyone else and there could be the odd teacher&mdash;like the 5 per cent of dispensary doctors I mentioned who treated their patients like pigs; I said afterwards I thought my percentage was wrong&mdash;who would take it out on the child.  Anyway, I think it was a wise decision.  Looking at the overall position, free education is available to anyone, irrespective of his income, and if he does not want to avail himself of it and says: &ldquo;I am not going to accept free education.  I will pay the fees,&rdquo; that is his right.</P>
    <P>It was said correctly that there is no means test for transport but that there is a means test for books.  That is not entirely correct; it is not incorrect either.  Next September there will be approximately 61,000 secondary day pupils qualifying for free secondary education, and with comprehensive schools, primary tops and vocational schools, the figure will be something of the order of over 100,000 pupils who will qualify for free post-primary education up to leaving certificate.  On the transport question I cannot see why some should be taken free on the bus and others would not be allowed on that free school bus but would have to wait for some other service or, if taken on the school bus, would have to pay.</P>
    <P>There are very few people in Ireland who can pay the school fares involved. I cited the case&mdash;and it is not an isolated case as Deputy Mrs. Desmond will agree&mdash;of a parent in poor circumstances paying 30/- a week for bus fares to school.  I do not mind what a person's circumstances are, there are very few people who can be handing <Col N="428" /> out 30/- a week for one child.  Even in the cities it is quite costly, and our scheme caters only for those outside three miles of the nearest school. Therefore again a means test would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>There is not really a means test as far as books are concerned.  We have calculated that approximately 25 per cent of the pupils will be given free books in September.  That might have been misleading.  The phraseology may not have been as happy as it should be, but what we wanted to convey was that the national average of the pupils getting free books would be 25 per cent. For instance, there will be schools where no free books will be given. Those schools would be in the better off areas where it would not be a hardship on the parents to pay for the books.  However, there are other schools in poor areas of the cities, particularly, and in certain rural areas where the pupils attending just may not have the money for the books.  What we have said is that we will accept the discretion of the principal and, if he certifies to the Department the books supplied, we will reimburse him the cost of those books.  I do not think there should be any difficulty in that.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a certain lack of clear thinking on the part of some in relation to the question of double payment.  It is suggested that, if a person pays fees, he will be paying on the double because he will also be paying in taxation for free education.  One thing should be borne in mind here. Up to now it has been the poorer sections who have been paying and subsidising the better off by way of the capitation grant, the payment of salaries and other State contributions towards education.  The poorer sections who did not participate in post-primary education have been subsidising education for those better off by their contributions in taxation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, all the problems in relation to education will not be solved overnight.  Indeed, all of them will never be solved, in my opinion, because of the continuing evolutionary process and because of new knowledge.  There <Col N="429" /> will be changes.  There will be innovations. What we are doing is making a start in September.  There may be reasons why we should not make that start; there are always people everywhere who will ask why should we give free education.  There are always people who throw cold water on everything. In the main, I think there is widespread welcome for these anticipated developments next September.  I, for my part, want to reassure all the interests involved that I will co-operate as far as possible.  I will consult as far as possible.  I will discuss all the various aspects which are causing anxiety now or may give rise to worry in the future.</P>

    <P>The basis upon which accounts of companies are presented to the public and to the shareholders of those companies is governed now by the Companies Act, 1963.  It is, indeed, something of an anachronism that State-sponsored companies cannot be classified quite so fully within the scope of the particular sections of that Act but, if a State-sponsored company is able, purely by chance, to avoid the sections of the Companies Act, that does not mean that it should do so.  On the contrary&mdash;I think there will be little doubt the Minister will agree with me in this respect&mdash;we are entitled to expect from State-sponsored bodies a standard of honour, a standard of propriety and a standard of disclosure in relation to their accounts which should be a pattern for companies generally in the country rather than that a State-sponsored company should <Col N="431" /> endeavour to hide what an ordinary company is bound to disclose.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to explain at any great length to the Minister the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963. Even though he is not sitting there as a solicitor and even though I am not here as a solicitor, we each know them and we cannot forget them.  Section 165 of that Act gives members of a company who hold ten per cent of the share capital the right to petition for an investigation.  If this were a case of an ordinary public company, I have no doubt whatever that on the facts which have been partly disclosed, and which I am going to reveal again, one-tenth of the members would so petition, and properly petition, but all the shares are held by the Minister for Finance, not for himself but in trust for the public.  It is, therefore, clearly one of the occasions on which a committee such as the Committee of Public Accounts should have the right, in relation to a State-sponsored body, to apply to petition under section 165 as shareholders of a company would normally have.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, section 166 gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to appoint an inspector even when there has not been a petition by the members of the company. Unfortunately, again, that section does not appear to give the opportunity to the Members of this House to demand in the public interest an investigation in relation to the failure to provide a proper system of accounting.  One of the things which the Minister has to take account of, has to have regard to in that section, is that the members, that is to say, the shareholders, have not been given all the information that they might reasonably expect.  The members, again, are the Minister for Finance, and of course there cannot be a suggestion that the Minister for Finance was not aware of the facts. However, the Companies Act lays down certain standards in relation to accounts of public companies.</P>
    <P>First of all, section 149 sets out that every balance sheet of a company shall give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company at the <Col N="432" /> end of its financial year.  It goes on to provide that the Sixth Schedule are the rules which shall provide for the manner in which and the basis upon which a company must set out its accounts.</P>
    <P>The Sixth Schedule sets out very clearly certain things that must be included in the balance sheet of a company, arrears of fixed cumulative dividends, the position in relation to debentures and the position in relation to contingent liabilities.  Contingent liabilities&mdash;may I stress their nature?  I mention particularly contingent liabilities, because when I originally put down the question relating to Nítrigin Éireann, I thought this was a contingent liability but in fact, as it will appear, it is quite clear from the answer given to me earlier that it is not a contingent liability.  It is a firm and fixed liability.  There is little doubt that if the directors of a publicly-held shareholders company, if I may so use the phrase, had submitted a balance sheet in this form the Minister would have been bound under the two sections I have mentioned, on application, to have caused an inquiry to be made into the company's accounts.  Possibly any directors who did submit, in an ordinary public shareholders company, such a balance sheet would or should be prosecuted for a breach of the Act.</P>
    <P>So much about the general position. The first account that was submitted by this company was in respect of the year to the 30th June, 1962.  At that time, according to the Minister's reply at column 1900 of the Dáil Debates for 23rd February, 1967, £571 interest had accrued.  It is not referred to even by way of a general note.  According to another reply, £189 had been paid on account of that interest, leaving £382 outstanding.  In the accounts to the 30th June, 1962, there is no note, no reference whatever, to that actual liability, even though the Act says that contingent liabilities must be set forth. How much stronger then is it that actual liabilities should be set forth? The next account, that dated the 12th November, 1962, shows that at that date £30,381 interest had accrued by virtue of the determination by the <Col N="433" /> Minister for Finance that was made between 5th January, 1962, and the 8th June, 1962.  There is a note in the balance sheet of that date about commitments for capital expenditure but there is no word of any sort, kind or description in the balance sheet to show that there was then a liability for £30,381 interest.  In fact if ever there was a case of non-disclosure in breach of the terms of the Companies Act, that is one.</P>
    <P>I admit freely and frankly that at that time, in 1963, we were working under the old Act of 1908 and not under the 1963 Act.  The next account is that dated for the period ending 30th June, 1964.  The Companies Act, 1963, was in force at that time.  The directors' report is, curiously enough, as far as I can see, not dated.  The income and expenditure account is signed by two directors and dated the 30th September, 1964.  I presume that is the general date both for the income and expenditure account and for the balance sheet, but the balance sheet, although signed by two directors, is not dated and the certificate of the auditor was dated 4th November, 1964. At that time the new Companies Act was in force.  In that balance sheet to the 30th June, 1964, there is no provision of any sort for interest that had then accrued to the total amount of £190,856.  There is not even a note to suggest on the face of that balance sheet, in the directors' report, or anywhere in the accounts that are filed in relation to Nítrigin Éireann, that that sum was then due.</P>
    <P>I will be most interested to hear how the Minister for Industry and Commerce will defend today not his own action&mdash;I accept that it was not his own action&mdash;but the action of his predecessor. In fact, all these patterns were set not by the Minister, not by his immediate predecessor, Deputy Dr. Hillery, but by the Taoiseach, all these patterns of totally dishonest accounts, using the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; in the sense not of fraud but for the purpose of presenting an entirely wrong picture to the general public. In the accounts of 30th June, 1964, there is not one shred of writing of any sort, kind or description to suggest <Col N="434" /> that the £190,000 was then due for interest, that it had not been paid, that it had been agreed but was not included in the accounts.</P>
    <P>In the following year, somebody apparently got a qualm of conscience. When it came to producing the accounts in the following year, they did not produce any figure although the sum of £396,023 had accrued by the following year.  The profit and loss account, the directors' report and the balance sheet have all been signed on behalf of the board by two directors of the company but in respect of these documents, tabled for the year ended 30th June, 1965, I have failed to find any date on which they were signed or purported to be signed.  There is a note by the auditor which is dated 8th November, 1965:</P>
    <P>As the conditions of repayment of advances from the Central Fund have not yet been determined, interest has not been provided for in these accounts.</P>
    <P>Nobody who read that would think it means that the rates of interest had not been determined.  Nobody who read it could possibly imagine that there was £396,000 due by the company to the taxpayers and that the amount so due was being deliberately withheld from the public.</P>
    <P>I would not have objected to the form of that note if the note itself had referred to the total of £396,000 that had been accrued.  Then, albeit in a somewhat complicated way, it would have been possible for a person to ascertain the position and see where the company stood.  It was not included then and is not included either for the next year.  In the next year, the same form is used and it is stated that:</P>
    <P>As the conditions of repayment of advances from the Central Fund have not yet been determined, interest has not been provided for in these accounts.</P>
    <P>At the time that note was placed there, the directors of the company knew, the secretary knew, doubtless the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance knew, and the auditor knew that there was £757,000 due by this company to the general <Col N="435" /> public.  Yet, in a most dishonest way, that fact was concealed from the general public by being omitted from the accounts.  When one considers the effects the writing of other notes with regard to bank advances and bills, capital commitments and other such, have on the figure for the accrued interest, one can see the appallingly low standard in public accounting to which this company has sunk.</P>
    <P>There is more involved in it.  I have little doubt, as I said before, that the company would be made to keep its obligations and promises as regards the price at which its wares would be sold but I also said that I thought it highly unlikely that the taxpayers would get anything back in respect of the money they had invested in this concern.  They have in fact got back £189 out of £757,000.  I suggest that the Minister who settled the form of these accounts must bear the responsibility for filling out and approving a form of accounts which has dishonestly concealed from the public the fact that £757,000 has not been repaid and has not been shown to be due in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>These sums were known by the directors before 20th August, 1965. The date of the last advance was 3rd August, 1965.  There might be some sense in it if there were a suggestion that these directors wanted to tot up the total and see what it was before they announced the interest due, but from August to 30th June, 1966, there can be no such suggestion.  In these accounts this has been done for the purpose of trying to present to the public a false figure in relation to this concern, for the purpose of preventing the public from realising that they were not receiving interest due to them on the money advanced by them.</P>
    <P>Apart from the ordinary simple interest calculation I have mentioned, there would also be, in any proper system of accounting in a company such as this, a figure for compound interest due to the long delay in dealing with the matter.  It might be wiser for the Minister not to insist on that but there should be such a figure.  I <Col N="436" /> have considerable diffidence in raising this matter with the present Minister. It was not of his doing and I am certain he knows the impropriety, the disgusting impropriety, of what has taken place in relation to these accounts.  However, the Minister must accept responsibility not only for his own errors but for the errors of those who go before him.  The form of these accounts was deliberately sent up by the company for the purpose of hiding this and they were approved by the former Minister, perhaps not deliberately to hide, but certainly negligently, in not showing to the general public financial transactions of such a nature which in any other company would warrant and deserve prosecution and conviction under the Companies Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to commence by paying a tribute, even though it is a left-handed one, to Deputy Sweetman. He must have few equals in building such a political mountain from such a political molehill.  He has managed by some strange process to suggest that the Fianna Fáil Government and the present Taoiseach have all been guilty of, at the very least negligence, and there was also the suggestion that they were guilty of dishonest attempts to conceal the facts from the public.  Of course, I hope to be able to demonstrate that this is simply a figment of Deputy Sweetman's imagination.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps state briefly how this situation has arisen.  The State's investment in this undertaking is a sum of £6 million, and all of this sum has been issued from the Exchequer in the form of repayable advances.  Information about the dates on which advances were made, and the rate of interest payable by the company in respect of each advance, has already been given by me to the Dáil.  I have also given the amounts of interest arising in each year of the company's existence on the Exchequer advances made to the company up to the end of each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Only in reply to questions by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to say this. In addition, as each advance was made <Col N="437" /> notice was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> I also want to point out that the company is operating as a commercial undertaking and that if any private company were in the same boat&mdash; and indeed, similar companies have received very substantial grants from the State&mdash;they would receive grants. In such circumstances, a private company having received such grants, would have a considerably smaller liability for interest than this company.</P>
      <P>The fact is that at the close of the company's financial year, 30th June, 1966, the company was in production of nitrogenous fertilisers, sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate, which were the company's basic programme.  The company was also involved in the construction of plants to produce complete concentrated fertilisers which was a natural development of their work.  In such circumstances of expansion, where the cash flow must necessarily be used in further capital investment, the purchase of capital equipment, it was, in my view, eminently reasonable that repayment of the Exchequer advances and the interest on them should not involve cash withdrawals from the company in that financial year.  I am not suggesting that there is or has been any waiver of interest due.  I am saying that it was reasonable that cash repayment of the capital advanced and the interest arising on it from the dates on which it was advanced should not take place in the circumstances in which the company was using its income for capital investment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has referred to the form of the accounts.  A draft form of account was submitted by the company to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and approved by him in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The final accounts for the year ending 30th June, 1965, the first few months trading period of the company, as certified by the auditor, were precisely in accordance with the draft accounts submitted, with the addition of the following note:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the conditions of repayment of advances from the Central Fund have not yet been determined, interest <Col N="438" /> has not been provided for in these accounts.</P>
    <P>In effect, the form of accounts approved has been laid before the Dáil in the company's accounts for the years ended 30th June, 1965, and 30th June, 1966.</P>
    <P>There has been no attempt and no effort to hide anything about this situation. The manner of repayment of the capital and interest has been the subject of discussion between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At the date of the last accounts, that had not been settled and the certificate of the auditor, who is the Comptroller and Auditor-General, included a statement to that effect.  I assume that the Comptroller and Auditor-General exercised his own judgment in deciding whether in these circumstances he should give a figure of interest due, and that he decided on his own judgment that this was not necessary.  I may also say that the Comptroller and Auditor-General certified that these accounts comply with the requirements of the Companies Act.  In those circumstances, I think it should be clear that Deputy Sweetman's version of what is involved, his suggestion of deliberate and dishonest concealment, can be seen perhaps in truer perspective when one realises that these accounts, according to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, comply with the requirements of the Companies Act.  According to Deputy Sweetman, they do not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that is not what I said.  I said they comply because the Minister for Finance holds all the shares, and if he did not, they would not.  I expect a greater standard of honour where the Minister for Finance holds shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correct even in that contention. The fact of the matter is that these accounts have been certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as conforming with the requirements of the Companies Act.  Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, in his discretion, apparently decided it was not necessary to insert the figure <Col N="439" /> of interest.  I am saying this because I want to make it quite clear that whatever view Deputy Sweetman may take of the matter, there is at least room for another view if the Comptroller and Auditor-General took another view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clear from what I have said that Deputy Sweetman's language in describing this matter is somewhat exaggerated, to put it mildly.  I also want to make it absolutely clear, in case there are any lingering doubts&mdash;I do not think there should be&mdash;both that the company is under an obligation to repay to the Exchequer every £ that <Col N="440" /> is due, and that a full and true picture of its financial position is being given in its accounts submitted for the information of the Dáil.  That is not merely my opinion but the opinion of the auditor of the company who is the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were a public company, it would have been prosecuted by the Minister, and correctly so.</P>
