      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last night, I was referring to employees of health authorities, namely, hospital employees, those referred to as non-nursing personnel. That is not a very apt term because it covers everybody in the hospital, such as ambulance drivers, porters, wardsmen, wardsmaids, cooks and so on, and those people, in the main, are servants of the health authorities as distinct from the officers but there are quite a number of the older people who were, and still are, officers.  The status was changed some years ago; perhaps it was more appropriate to have them described as servants coming under Part III of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act but the unfortunate part of it is that the local authorities, the county managers and the Department of Health seem to take that description, &ldquo;servants,&rdquo; very literally and refer to them as non-nursing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether other Deputies spend as much time in hospital or going to hospitals as I and some of my colleagues do but we find that in the hospitals people who are described as non-nursing personnel in many cases have to do very important nursing work.  They are in direct contact all day with the patients.  They <Col N="2285" /> are the people who feed them, take food to them and attend to them if they require anything in the wards during the day.  In some cases, they are asked to do things which I think they should not be asked to do, particularly in wards.  It is not unknown that those people have been required to give bed-baths to old people.  To describe those who have to do that work as non-nursing personnel is a bit ridiculous.</P>
    <P>My main reason for referring to it here is that some years ago when hours were being reduced, the non-nursing personnel did not have their hours reduced to the same extent as the nursing personnel and it took a long fight and numerous applications to the Labour Court before the hours were brought into line.  We now have the same thing happening.  The Department of Health has given its blessing to an 85-hour fortnight for nursing personnel and we, through the trade unions, have been attempting to get a similar 85-hour fortnight for non-nursing personnel and are finding extreme difficulty in getting county managers to fall into line.  Yesterday, Deputy Kitt made an inquiry about having the wages of road workers put on the same level all round.  I am quite sure he felt, as I did, that they should all be put up to the Dublin level but the Minister for Local Government might have a little difficulty in swallowing that.</P>
    <P>In the case of hospital authorities, the same difficulty does not arise.  I see no reason why the Minister for Health should not tell the County Managers' Association that the working week for non-nursing personnel, as for nursing personnel, shall be 42½ hours or an 85-hour fortnight, taking the long week and the short week together.  This would avoid much trouble and annoyance.  It is amazing how local authority employees are sometimes singled out for particularly bad treatment on the pretext that replacements are not available.  If there is a replacement available for a nurse, I am sure there will be a replacement available for a wardsmaid. Such an argument should not be used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2286" /> There is another aspect of this matter which I want to bring particularly to the Minister's notice.  In quite a number of hospitals, we have matrons who have been there for a long number of years.  Many of them are religious; most of them are dedicated to their jobs; and practically all of them believe they have the right of hiring and firing at will.  This is something which, unless direct action is taken by the Department, will blow up in everybody's face some day soon. Last week I had a case of a porterambulance driver who had been ill for some time.  He had been replaced by a man who is doing the job very well.  From last May until Friday last there was no complaint about him but then, probably because somebody else had his eye on the job, that man was sacked at a moment's notice.  He was told that he was unsuitable for the job and on Monday morning another man took out the ambulance. I protested to the county manager about the matter and I have not yet received his decision.  There has been a request by the fellow workers of this man to take strike action but that is not the way to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>There must be ordinary justice given to these people and I am sure the Minister or his Department would not stand over such action.  I am sure they would not agree that even the lowest paid worker should be fired at a moment's notice to make room for somebody else just because somebody did not like the colour of his eyes or the colour of his hair.  That is one instance and I could give many others. Most matrons of hospitals are dedicated people who do their work well but some of them still seem to have the idea that they have the right to decide who should or should not work in a hospital.  I suggest that this has nothing to do with them.  These people are employed by the county manager through his executive officer and he is the person who should make the decision, not somebody who has a thing about somebody else.  I do not like to have to raise matters like this in the House but this seems such a blatant attempt to usurp the right of a man to work that it is only right <Col N="2287" /> to have it brought up here.</P>
    <P>Last year an effort was made by a group of unions to have a joint body set up to deal with wages and conditions in hospitals.  That proposal was resisted by the County Managers' Association&mdash;why I do not know.  We have had appeals from various Ministers for rationalisation in these matters and surely this effort at rationalisation was deserving of support? It is true that when a group of unions come together to negotiate for a group of workers, they speak with one voice.  It may be that some of the people who employ these workers feel that they would be in a stronger position if they could operate the old policy of divide and conquer, if they could play off one group against the other.  This was an attempt to make arrangements to negotiate for all these workers at the one time.  No effort has been made by the managers to meet us and this is a matter of national importance which should have the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>When other types of nursing personnel did this, the Minister and his predecessors had no doubt about the manner in which it should be dealt.  I suggest that a hint from the Minister for Health would go a long way towards solving the problem.  There are other matters.  Some people who have not had experience and who are not in touch with hospital staffs might find it difficult to understand these matters. In hospitals certain people have to do night duty.  Nurses do night duty and they get days off in lieu.  This is understandable because night duty for younger people is a very tough assignment but the wardsmaids, who also have to do night duty, will not get the same number of days off in lieu as the nurses.</P>
    <P>I am not attacking the nurses or their conditions.  They are an excellent group of people doing excellent work and they deserve everything they get but it is time the idea that there are two different classes employed in hospitals was dropped.  One of the things that will sooner or later be discovered by <Col N="2288" /> the people in authority is that after serving for a few years as a wardsmaid in a hospital here, many of these girls go to England and after a few years become qualified nurses, a chance that they would never get in a hundred years in this country.  There should be some regard for these people.</P>
    <P>On the question of uniforms, many types of uniforms have been adopted. We occasionally find the matron of a hospital producing a prototype of uniforms which she wants the staff to wear.  When the girls try it on, they discover it is something that might be given to them to demonstrate what was worn in the dim and distant days and when they refuse to wear it, something better can be produced.  A general uniform should be issued to all the girls and also to the men.  A practice is growing up whereby people employed in hospitals are given money in lieu of a uniform issue, in some cases £5.  That is supposed to buy an overcoat, a cap and a suit.  In some cases the amount has gone up to £12.  I know an ambulance driver who got £12.  From that he had to pay £3 for a cap which would not have to be replaced every year.  But how was he supposed to buy a suit which he could wear on other occasions, and also an overcoat?</P>
    <P>Good uniforms should be issued to all hospital staffs.  It would give them pride in their appearance and it is a well-known fact that when people are ill, they like to have people who are neat and tidy nursing them and dealing with them.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that a great many of our ambulances are nothing more than glorified delivery vans, with a different type of body fitted.  I wonder if this matter has received as much attention as it should.  A few hospitals have experimented with different types of ambulances and some of them have spent considerable sums in getting a good type, properly sprung, but a number of hospitals still use the old Bedford truck with an ambulance body. While these might be suitable for bringing to a hospital a patient requiring medical treatment, they are most unsuitable for those requiring surgical attention.  One doctor told me that he had a patient who had to be brought <Col N="2289" /> to hospital for an injury to his back and that the journey in the ambulance did not do him any good.  He would not go much further than that but he said it did not do the patient any good. The type of ambulance used should be examined.  There should be a standard type of ambulance provided which is suitable so that the local authority just cannot go out and buy any old thing at all.</P>
    <P>The stretchers used in the ambulance require immediate attention.  Very often, the stretchers in the ambulance are so heavy that it would require two strong men to carry them.  What happens? The stretcher is up in the ambulance and must be taken down. It would require two strong men to ensure that it is brought down safely to the level of the ground.  There is usually an ambulance driver and, if he is lucky, a nurse with him.  How does he get the patient out of and into the ambulance?  A number of local authorities have experimented with this kind of thing.  They have produced lightweight stretchers which can be moved fairly easily and they have produced stretchers which can be wheeled on to the ground from a type of ramp.  To suggest that it is all right to use an ambulance, the floor of which is about three feet from the ground and to send out one man and to tell him that he must bring in a patient who is maybe up to 16 stone in weight, and get him out of the ambulance again, is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Last night, I referred to the training which it is proposed to give to ambulance drivers.  I am all with the Minister there.  However, I would point out that about 80 per cent of them have already got most of that training. There is no point in giving them training unless they also get equipment.  It is on record that ambulance drivers, arriving on the scene of an accident, have no equipment except a stretcher and a few blankets.  They cannot take the place of doctors but they could possibly save a life if the proper type of equipment, which they know how to use, were supplied.  One could continue talking on this for a very long time.  I have made these points because <Col N="2290" /> I believe they are factors of which the Minister may not be aware and, even if he is aware of them, there is no harm in reminding him of them.</P>
    <P>Another problem about ambulance drivers is this system of &ldquo;on call&rdquo;. Those who may not be aware of how the system works may not know that in most hospitals there are a number of ambulance drivers, some of whom are on duty and some of whom are &ldquo;on call&rdquo;.  A man who works during the day and goes home at night but must stay there in case he is needed&mdash;&ldquo;on call&rdquo;&mdash;does not get any payment for that.  I have been amused again and again to hear county managers arguing with me that because the man is not actually working, he is not entitled to any payment for being &ldquo;on call&rdquo;.  I do not think there is anybody in this country, anybody else I know of, who would be prepared to agree to stay in his home for the period while he was not working in case he would be needed, and agree that he should do it at night, at weekends, on holidays, or whatever it is, without any extra remuneration.  It is stupid to suggest it should be done. I would not do it; the Minister would not do it.  I am sure the county managers, who are so definite that people should not be paid for it, would not do it either.  If they were asked to stay at home, lest they might be needed for something or other over the weekend, well, we should have a song and dance about it.  This matter must be attended to.  I leave it to the Minister's good sense to see that it is dealt with in the proper way.</P>
    <P>There is a reference here to the hearing-aid service.  The Minister says that the service operated by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation on behalf of health authorities continues to function satisfactorily. This is so.  However, I think it should be known that very many people who are using hearing aids for many years and who simply replace the batteries in them are entitled to look for replacements.  I meet an awful lot of these people.  A lot of them tell me that the hearing aid is not as good as it was, that they cannot hear, that their <Col N="2291" /> hearing is failing.  In fact, what is happening is that the type of device they are using is becoming worn out. I think there is no reason why an effort should not be made, in the national interest, to ensure that people are supplied with the best type of appliance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dental services, I think there is something desperately wrong here.  Most health authorities have a free dental service for children. Our own local authority operate it, as far as they can, for adults.  I understand that very few local authorities do this.  However, the operation of the dental service applies only as far as extractions are concerned.  I am informed that there is a two-year waiting list for people who want dentures. I can see no reason why this should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I am told it is difficult to get dentists. I am told that the local authorities have difficulty in getting dentists, and that there is some difficulty about the arrangement for the supply of dentures.  Would the Minister ask the local authorities to make some arrangement with dentists in the local towns, who do not seem to be overworked, to have extractions done and dentures supplied?  I live 24 miles from Navan and six miles from Drogheda.  It is quite well known that it would be much easier for somebody who lives in my area to go into Drogheda on the bus, to have the extractions done, to make arrangements for the dentures and to go home again rather than have either an ambulance or a taxi collect him or her at home and bring them there, not once, but maybe half a dozen times at about at least £2 a run before the dentures are supplied.  That is an example of something that is happening. I am quite sure the Minister is aware of this and even of worse cases happening all over the country.  Would he have this question actively considered&mdash;I know he referred to it here&mdash; because I believe he can get the service if he wants to do it, and he can get it for at least as low a cost as under the present system?</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of <Col N="2292" /> people who are insured.  This is a different category.  It is reasonably well dealt with except for the fact that the cost of dentures is going up as a result of which many people are thinking twice about taking the dental treatment they require.  If they have to pay the difference between what the State will pay and what they themselves can afford, there is still a gap.  While some local authorities, including my own, do meet fairly the person who requires something extra, at the same time it is not the whole story and perhaps there might be a way out of this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the school dental service, I do not know whether it is the same in every county or not but I believe that it is nearly impossible to get more than about one visit of the school dental service to each primary school in the school-life of a child.  This is an extraordinary situation and is, in my opinion, a rather stupid arrangement. If we claim to be so interested in the dental care of children, surely they should get at least one or two inspections per year?  We have the problem that if they are found to be suffering from dental trouble while the school dental inspection unit is there, they can have treatment free, but if they have not been discovered because the unit did not call, then their parents have to pay for the treatment which the children get and which they are eligible to get free.  These are some of the things which are tied up by red tape and green tape which I think should be cut.  It would cost very little extra and would make a great difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to fluoridation of water supplies.  I do not know how far it is intended to go.  The Minister said the water supplies of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and seven other towns are fluoridated.  I am sorry he did not think it necessary to include the names of the towns since there were only seven.  He says arrangements have been made to do a further 40 areas within the next 12 months. We may have different views about whether or not fluoridation is a good idea but, the decision having been taken to do it, it should be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2293" /> We come now to the whole kernel of this debate, that is, the White Paper on the Health Services.  One of the things I find fault with in this Government or any Government is that they tend, when the occasion seems to be suitable for them, to make statements about certain things and give the impression that the things they are talking about are about to happen within a matter of months.  We had such a situation with the Minister's predecessor when he talked about the improvements in the health services.  He promised us particularly the remedy to one of the nagging things in the present health services, free choice of doctor. He also promised to arrange to make an improvement in the supply of drugs and medicines and a number of things like this which so many of us have been finding fault with.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, when the Health Act was introduced the Labour Party supported its introduction on the basis that it was at least an improvement on the old poor law system.  We heard a lot about doing away with the red ticket.  The Minister must be aware that replacing a red ticket with a blue card or a green card or a white card was not the best thing to do because a person who must go looking for the card must go through an even more searching examination before being issued with the card.  Right through the country, no matter what county we go into, we can find the fellow who will tell us he has not got a medical card because his county council have decided he is not entitled to it.  He is a married man, with £10 a week and four or five children.  He feels aggrieved because he knows his neighbour who may be working with him or working close to him and who has a wife and maybe one child or no children, with £15 a week and maybe some property, has a card.  This is one of the things which we hear again and again. Whether or not it is as widespread as we are led to believe I do not know. I have never had it investigated because I feel that we might succeed in having the card taken from the man who had it and we almost certainly would not get a card for the man who had not got one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> We find that the man who has a medical card is entitled to certain treatment and we then find that members of his family are not entitled to it and, in fact, that the members of his family who are working and who may not be giving one penny into the family purse ultimately deprive the parents of the use of a medical card.  This is something which should be looked into.  This was mentioned in the White Paper and it was stated that in future the incomes of the members of the family would not affect the issue of the medical card.  Lots of people immediately reapplied to their local authority to be told: &ldquo;This is what the Minister has suggested he is going to do.  He has not done it yet and it does not appear as if he is going to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to medicines and drugs, I know that most local authorities are generous if a case is made to them that people need drugs or expensive medicine over a long period and they are asked if they will supply those medicines free of charge.  This is a great help, but there are so many people who do not know that and, I suppose, at least twice a week I get complaints from people who tell me that they have gone to their dispensary doctor and the dispensary doctor has either sent them to the chemist to buy drugs which he says he has not got or, alternatively, they go to the doctor not having got a medical card, and they have to pay up to £1 or £1 10s a week for medicine out of a very low wage.  When the matter is brought to the notice of the local authority, they help that person if the case is good by giving free drugs, for a period anyway.  The whole approach to this is wrong and the Minister must set his mind down to having at least those parts of the White Paper put into operation.  The person who has a medical card or who applies for a medical card is, in my opinion, in the very same position as if he had the red ticket.</P>
    <P>It was the practice before the medical cards were introduced for doctors who knew their districts to give free medical attention to what they called <Col N="2295" /> the poorer classes, even if they had not got a ticket.  That no longer happens except on very rare occasions.  In most cases a doctor will ask for a medical card and if the patient has not got one, he will ask for his money.  When a wage-earner falls ill and sends for a doctor, I do not think the question of the money to pay the doctor should be a question he must worry about first but this is true.  These things happen.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion of the Minister's to be discussed, that is, the question of choice of doctor.  The Minister says that there are areas where this will not be possible, and I agree with him.  There must be areas where the amount of remuneration a dispensary doctor would get if he were left on his own would be pretty small.  There must be subsidisation from the State in one way or another.  There are other areas where it should not be at all difficult to operate the panel system.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles that occasionally arise is when a person comes to the doctor who, for one reason or another, has stayed completely outside the Health Act.  We have an example of this.  This man is a very good doctor and as a result many people go to him.  Many maternity cases go to him. They are cases that would normally be paid for by the local authority. They are referred into a hospital.  Full expenses are paid and when they return home, they get a bill from this gentleman who has been attending them in the hospital for his services. Further than that he has now adopted the system of having a debt collecting agency attempting to collect his bills.  I passed the information about this on to the Minister and I am hoping that the matter will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As I say, he is an excellent doctor but if we have reached the stage where professional etiquette allows a debt collecting agency not alone to collect by way of letter but to pull up a van outside a patient's home with the name of the debt collecting agency in large letters on the van, for the purpose <Col N="2296" /> of blackmailing into paying people who were under the impression that they did not owe anything and, in my opinion, did not owe anything, it has gone too far.  It is something that 99.9 per cent of doctors would abhor but if one of them does it, he should be stopped.  He should not be allowed to do it.  As I say, I am waiting with interest to hear what the Minister decides to do about this matter.</P>
    <P>We had the question of choice of doctor.  When this review was being considered, the whole question of replacement of doctors came up.  If somebody applies for a vacancy in a dispensary district&mdash;and there are plums, of course&mdash;up to now anybody who was qualified could apply.  The Minister has included a new qualification, that the applicant must be in an existing dispensary district.  This, of course, means one thing.  It means that the districts where the dispensary doctor finds he is not doing well, the ones where a dispensary doctor will have to be kept, according to the Minister's suggestion, will be milked dry of those people because they will all go for the plum jobs.</P>
    <P>The other day, when the Minister was making a statement here, I referred to the fact that this had been going on for some time but that when I asked questions about it, the Minister denied that it was so.  I should like to refer to the Dáil Debates of 17th November, Volume 225.  At column 1375, Deputy Treacy asked</P>
    <P>the Minister for Health if he is aware of the urgent need which exists for at least two dispensary doctors in Clonmel ....</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to that question and I then asked:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say if it is true that the filling of vacancies for dispensary doctors is becoming more complicated and more difficult because of the fact that his Department are insisting that only those at present employed as dispensary doctors are entitled to apply for such vacancies?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2297" /> The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I do not think it is relevant to this question.</P>
    <P>I said:</P>
    <P>But is it true?</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I will not answer that.</P>
    <P>I said:</P>
    <P>I will put down a question next week and the Minister can answer that one.</P>
    <P>The Minister then said:</P>
    <P>Yes, I will be glad to.  As a matter of practice, I am not particularly enamoured of answering questions which, by implication, suggest that a situation exists which does not in fact exist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, indeed, and I do not propose to detain the House <Col N="2301" /> any further with it.  I wanted to clear the matter up and I have done it as far as that is concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the whole question of dispensary doctors and replacements, I want to suggest to the Minister what will happen as a result of this change in policy, before the major decision on whether there is to be choice of doctor or not, has been put into operation.  An arrangement whereby only existing dispensary doctors are entitled to apply for vacancies simply means, as I said a few minutes ago, that the areas that are not very valuable as far as the doctors are concerned will be milked dry.  I suggest that that is not a desirable situation.  I suggest that the Minister might take another look at that before he goes any further.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that he proposes to have regional services as against the existing system of, usually, county boundaries and he says that despite the fact that he found a certain amount of opposition to it during his tours around local authorities, he still proposes to put it into operation.  I know the Minister will not change his mind because I am saying it but I still think, and I told him, that it is an awfully stupid arrangement.  If the Minister insists, he will seriously interfere with the health services.  At the present time we have a situation where it is possible to keep in some kind of contact with the local authority that is running the health services.  If the centre is going to be many miles away, that may be difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not made this clear and perhaps he will make it clear when he is replying.  He has not said whether the number of people who will be put on by the Department will exceed those elected on to it.  If that is the situation, it would be a lot worse than the present situation. It is not going to be in anybody's interest.  It is simply a gimmick.  You will not improve the health services by simply changing the system under which they are given, nor will there be any improvement because half a dozen counties are dumped into the one place and directed from there. At present the poorest member of <Col N="2302" /> the community if he is in urgent need of an ambulance service, of a medical card, or of medical treatment, can either himself or through his local representative make representations to the health authority, but if this is put into operation, there will be no contact at all.  It is a step which should not be taken without careful consideration.  I have already dealt with the Estimate figures and today the Minister will be answering a question which I have tabled in regard to his statement about the three per cent difference between the additional amount plus the 50 per cent which some local authorities are getting and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. I have the figures here.  The average was 55 per cent and there was not a fluctuation upwards or downwards of more than 3.3 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me what amount of money is involved in the 3.3 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>£100,360.  It is all relative to the size of the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but it does show a very substantial difference in the amount and it bears out what the Minister said in Navan, that he proposed to make the richer counties pay for the poorer ones.  I hope this system will not be adopted in regard to local government generally and that they will not be asked to pay for roads or houses.  When something like this starts, it is amazing how it gathers impetus and goes wrong.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>In the areas more favourably placed as regards capacity to bear the costs, the rate increase for health purposes should in all but a few cases, be not more than 1/3d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We happen to be one of the unfortunate cases as we want 1/6d.  Would the Minister consider that this is likely to stay?  Would the Minister say whether <Col N="2303" /> this reference is to this year only?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is so. The principle will probably remain but the arrangement is only for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want now to refer to another matter about which I have written the Minister and have received an acknowledgment.  In my area there has been in operation for some time St. Clare's Convent, Stamullen. It is a home for abandoned babies.  Many people felt that this place was making a lot of money and did not require any assistance from the State.  There is a payment from the local authority where the babies can be listed against the local authority.  Quite a number of the children cannot be listed against a local authority and therefore there is no payment for them.</P>
      <P>Recently I visited the convent and I was amazed to see that the accommodation for the staff consisted of a converted horse stable.  The harness room is the sitting room of the unfortunate girls who do the nursing there and the horse boxes are the cubicles in which they sleep.  The state of repair is such that the old chap who previously owned the place would not allow the horses to stay in the building in its present condition.  The fire hazard must be enormous because as far as I can see there is only one narrow exit.  I am referring now to where the nurses or student nurses sleep.  They get a certain amount of training in looking after the children but apparently there is no standard of pay or conditions.  I am told that the girls get a couple of pounds a month for pocket money because those who run the home cannot afford to pay them any more.  I am quite sure they are fed well.  They are dreadfully overworked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the convent authorities started to build a new wing and they have two stories erected and they would like to build much further but they have not got the money.  The bank has been after them because of their overdraft which has risen to an astronomical size.  The Poor Clares who <Col N="2304" /> run it do a wonderful job.  The nun who was in at the start of the home has died and a younger nun is now running the convent and she is sick from worry.  It is all right for the Department of Health or anybody else to ask why did they start it, why did they become involved, but I am putting the case that there was an urgent need for such a home.  The building which they are just completing is very modern and will be a great help to them, but despite the fact that they are able to have quite a number of the children adopted, they are still in a bad position because not all the children are suitable or available for adoption.  The children there include some spastics and some mentally defectives, apart from the normal children.  Some of the parents do not want to have the children adopted and therefore the nuns cannot allow them to be adopted, even though the parents are in no position to contribute towards their upkeep.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that this has nothing to do with his Department, that they are not interested, but I do not think he will.  I should be glad if he would have the matter investigated. There should be some way in which money can be provided for the running of this home.  If the Department want to, they can change the standards and I think they must do that as far as the training is concerned.  They have been making appeals over the radio and to certain well-known people and they have raised some money but the amount is very small compared with the amount required even to run the home.  There is no point in saying that it can continue and if it has to close, and I hope it will not, it will mean that within a short time the Department must replace it.  I would be glad if the Minister would let me have a report on the position but even if he does not do that, my only interest in the matter is in having something done.  Because the matter is so serious, I am sure the Minister will be prepared to do this.</P>
    <P>The health of the people is of such vital importance that any money spent on it must be money well spent.  A number of voluntary organisations <Col N="2305" /> are helping.  The State and the local authorities have people who, while they are being paid for doing their jobs, must be dedicated people or they would not be engaged in the job.  I refer particularly to people who are looking after mental defectives, the aged, or children.  They must have a vocation for this work or they would not be involved in it.  I suggest that we should not be tight fisted in regard to the remuneration or the conditions we give to those people.  If we make an effort to do this we will be very well repaid.  Those of us who work a five-day week, finish on Friday night and have Saturday and Sunday off, and have office hours of 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock, or 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock, find it very hard to appreciate the conditions in which other people are employed.  We find it hard to understand that there are people who have to work all hours of the night, and on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  We find it hard to appreciate that those people they are attending are very poor, very ill, and perhaps very unhappy.  If we approach it from that angle, I am sure no one in this House or outside it will grudge what is being given for the purpose of running our health services.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient just to issue a White Paper and say: &ldquo;This is what we propose to do.&rdquo;  It must be followed through, and it must be followed through within a reasonable time. The White Paper sets out many desirable things, although there are some things in it with which I do not agree. The Minister should attempt within the next 12 months to get something concrete done, because if he does, there is some hope for those who are expecting an improvement.  If he does not, if he leaves it until he moves on to some other office, or until he moves out and someone else replaces him, this matter will become of less and less importance to the Department of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what has been said or written about medicine and medical schemes, it is becoming more and more obvious that basically from the point of view of payment there are but a few schemes which can be evolved: first, a medical scheme based on taxation, whether it be at local or central level; secondly, a medical scheme paid for by insurance or subvention; and thirdly, a medical scheme in which the patient pays his doctor directly. It appears that the Labour Party would accept a combination of Nos. 1 and 2, and that the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil Parties wish to combine the three.  So far as I can see there is but little difference between them except as to the proportion of people who might be in each group.</P>
      <P>However, the Fine Gael Party still maintain that they would have no means test and this I cannot understand. I cannot understand how they would decide to exclude 15 per cent at the upper end, and have a lower income group at the bottom.  This could only be done without a means test if the definition of &ldquo;means test&rdquo; were changed or given a different name.  The Minister in proposing to enlarge the services has a very difficult task.  It must be accepted that the best scheme is one in which the patient pays his doctor, but unfortunately economic circumstances in most countries do not permit this, and so the Government must provide State aid and make it available to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2307" /> The medical profession are most anxious that a scheme should be evolved which would be acceptable to them and to the patients.  Recently the medical profession have restated some of the points which they think a good medical scheme should contain.  First, the State should offer to the patient a high standard of medicine which the patient could get simply and conveniently. Secondly, the patient should have a free choice of doctor.  It should be such that the relationship of the patient to the doctor is a good one, maintaining the patient's self-respect. Thirdly, it should be designed in such a manner that at all times the patient will not have to bear an unbearable financial burden.</P>
    <P>For the doctors they ask that the service should enable them to give the patient a high standard of care, in proper surroundings, and with proper ancillary services.  They also ask that it should be designed in such a way that the doctor would have sufficient time to examine each patient, that he would have sufficient time to keep up-to-date with his work by daily or weekly reading, or by postgraduate work.  They also ask that they too would have free choice of patient and that they would be protected at all times from unnecessary calls or demands by unreasonable patients.  I think it is possible to evolve a medical scheme which would be acceptable to patients and doctors.</P>
    <P>The point of biggest difficulty no doubt will be how the State will pay the doctor.  There are many ways available and the capitation system as used across the water is certainly the worst. It may be easier, but I hope that when the day comes for discussions between the Minister, the Department and the doctors, something different will be evolved.  It is not so much the question of money that is concerning the doctors. It is the way of life which this system imposes on them.  It assumes that the doctor has unlimited time, especially if he is single-handed.  It assumes that he has endless patience. It assumes that he has an unbreakable back.  It assumes that he has a mind <Col N="2308" /> which is impervious to any stress.  I hope as much thinking as possible will be done on this question.</P>
    <P>After all, finance is not the most important thing in people's lives.  So far as I can see, most doctors have not the time to spend the money they make anyway.  They have families, and they have a certain standard to keep up. They would like this to continue. Doctors would also like to have clinical freedom.  They would like to be paid in proportion to their skills, their responsibilities, and the time they spend at their work.</P>
    <P>They are also entitled to promotion. I want to refer to this in more detail than I had intended in view of Deputy Tully's remarks about the recent decision of the Minister to fill some dispensary posts.  In the past a permanent dispensary doctor could avail of a section of the Act&mdash;I think it was section 3 or section 5&mdash;if the county manager facilitated him.  This meant that when a dispensary became vacant, if the manager wished, he could fill that vacancy within three months by promoting a dispensary doctor or district medical officer.  For some reason down through the years, this right of the district medical officers was eroded, not through any action of the Department but because the county managers refused to avail of the section.  Instead, they put all these posts before an appointments commission.</P>
    <P>In many cases this means that doctors who decided to go into backward places or less remunerative places in the beginning found that they had to remain there.  They were good enough to carry on the work where they were, but in many cases they were unable to get past the Local Appointments Commission and had to remain there.  It is no good talking about the system we have at the moment if we are going to have a White Paper and new medical legislation.  However, this right of promotion is something that should be built into medical administration in this country.  Not alone in medicine but in other walks of life, it should mean that people start at <Col N="2309" /> the bottom and reach the top if they have the qualifications to do so and have given the service.  This is one thing doctors will expect under new legislation.</P>
    <P>To return to further points at random in the Minister's statement, the first thing that strikes me is this question of TB.  Of late we have been told that tuberculosis is recurring in herds that were tubercular-free, and, if it is so, this is a disturbing problem. Some time ago I read that in some of the Scandinavian countries when a tubercular-free herd was found to have a recurrence of tuberculosis, the first thing that was done on that farm was that every person coming in contact with those animals was X-rayed and investigated to see if tuberculosis arose from attendance on the animals.  I am sure the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Health are aware of the situation and no doubt there is some liaison between them.  It is something that should be looked into in more detail if it has not been done already.</P>
    <P>Some remarks were made about death certificates, about the increased number of deaths from cancer and heart diseases.  Some death statistics must go up because eventually we all have to die and it will be recorded in some column or other.  I often wonder how reliable are these death certificates. Those of us who are familiar with them know there is a primary, secondary and tertiary and in fact a further cause of death given.  When I am filling them in I often feel they do not really give the information that statistics require.  It was changed some years ago but there is still a difference of opinion among doctors as to how it should be filled.  I have no doubt whatsoever that at times in filling them in, through no fault of our own, we do conceal the real cause of death.  I have given some thought to this matter and it is not easy to design a certificate which will cover all the different things we would like to cover without making it cumbersome.  However, if we are going to rely on statistics in these matters, some further thinking should be done on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2310" /> Another matter to which I should like to refer is the schools medical scheme.  How this scheme originally evolved I can never understand.  I often feel it really evolved because it was a convenient method of assembling children to have them examined.  Going back to the thinking of 20 or 30 years ago, it was probably an acceptable method, but having regard to the advances in medicine now, this should be changed completely.  We should abolish the school medical scheme and establish a pre-school medical scheme. There reasons I give for this: first, by having a free medical scheme, defects and diseases would be detected earlier; secondly, they would be detected at a time when the child is not going to school and, therefore, in sending a child for further treatment, his schoolgoing days are not imposed on; and, thirdly, it would have the effect of reducing the demands on the medical services later on.</P>
    <P>It would not be a big administrative problem to do this.  There are two or three questions which would arise.  If I were asked would I make what is now known as the free school medical service available to those children, I would answer yes.  Is it the people who do it at the moment, the assistant medical officers of the various counties, who should do it?  I think this should be handed back to the family doctor.  The family doctor should examine each child once a year under this scheme. Much as doctors hate filling forms they would have to fill forms and perhaps send them to the county medical officer.  Arising out of that examination, free treatment would be available for that child just as it is under the present school medical system.</P>
    <P>There is another small point, that parents are not anxious to go to school when their children are being examined, and they tell you afterwards the doctor did not look at something the parent thinks should have been looked at.  It may not be that important but the parent considers it important.  On the other hand, when a child of pre-school age is to be examined by a family doctor, the parent who takes the child there can discuss its problems.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2311" /> Better use could be made of the assistant medical officers in an advisory capacity, in dealing with psychological problems of the children, and in various other ways.  Some of them might need specialist training for this over a period of six or 12 months.  This would help to fill the gaps in certain specialities in medicine in this country, particularly in the rural areas. Furthermore, those assistant medical officers would be given outlets to reach the top and this would provide an incentive for them.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reasonable objection to this proposal of mine.  The only one that might come would be from some of my colleagues who would be dealing with big numbers.  It would be well worth while trying.  It is the sensible way, it would be the least expensive way of looking after children's health, and in the long run it would repay us well.</P>
    <P>Another thing that strikes me about the school medical service is that it is available free at a time when parents might not often have the money to provide for such services themselves, but now with free education in secondary schools coming along, parents will probably be in a better position to look after their children in the schoolgoing years, and there should be less of these diseases arising in schoolgoing years when we look after this aspect earlier. That is one point I would ask the Minister and his Department to look into very seriously.</P>
    <P>The dental services have been referred to, and here again there is a big gap particularly in regard to the people in the middle income group.  The Minister says he intends to introduce legislation for the provision of assistance to the middle income group is respect of drugs and medicines.  I am disappointed in that.  I think he has covered hearing aids, but he does not include dental services.  I also have the feeling that he does not need new legislation to provide dental services for the middle income group, that provision was made in the 1953 Act which was suspended. <Col N="2312" /> I would ask him to consider providing hearing aids, spectacles and particularly dentures, for people in the middle income group, not necessarily to provide dentures free of cost but that he should give some subvention to enable these people to buy them. Dentures are very dear and when people have their teeth extracted, in many cases they find they cannot rise to the cost of replacing them.  They do without them and no doubt this affects their health.  The amount involved would be very small.  Such a scheme would have the added advantage of taking the pressure off the general medical services.</P>
    <P>Many people seek general medical services merely to get false teeth, glasses or hearing aids.  My suggestion would enable the Minister and his Department to get certain work done by the private dentist, thereby leaving the health authority dentist free for other work.  The Minister says he proposes to have some talk with the dentists with a view to enlisting the aid of private dentists in order to help in the difficulties that exist. This is one way, in my opinion, in which the Department, the local health authority and the people could be helped.  If it does not require legislation to do this, then I think the Minister should do it even sooner than the end of the year under whatever powers he has under the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes to do away with the dispensary system in many areas and to give a free choice of doctor.  Those of us who are district medical officers and who are moving on beyond the fifties will find the situation somewhat difficult because we have patterned our lives in a certain way.  We have laid out a certain life for ourselves.  Some of us have remained in the rural areas instead of migrating into urban areas and many district medical officers are perturbed with regard to the future.  There is a certain uneasiness amongst them.  Some wonder if they should pull out now.  I know one man who has gone back to England.  He felt he was going to be liquidated <Col N="2313" /> and he decided to liquidate himself instead of facing difficulties in adjustment later on.  This is a problem, and I believe a statement should be made in the near future as to what will happen these district medical officers to enable younger men than I am to decide what they should do and when to do it.  It is an unpleasant situation to be hanging on from one year to another wondering what is going to happen and hearing nothing very definite.</P>
    <P>With regard to regionalisation, that is something that has been accepted by the medical profession, though it has been resisted by some, mostly local representatives.  A previous speaker also disagrees with it, although he pointed out earlier that it would be much better if the services were designed in such a way that a person could go to Drogheda rather than Navan to get dental services. To my mind, that is the essence of regionalisation.  There may be reasons for opposing regionalisation but there are also many reasons for it.  What I should like to have definitely stated is, if it is proposed to give the patient a free choice of doctor, will the patient also have a free choice of both specialist and hospital?  Does regionalisation mean that patients must avail of the services within the region?  If they decide to go outside the region, will they be debarred from State aid?</P>
    <P>I was interested in the reference to the statistics which indicate that Irish people in Britain suffer more than any other race from mental disorders.  This is rather like the death statistics again. I think the figure is unreliable and these figures should not be quoted without making comment on them. First of all, I think our emigrants must be in far greater numbers than those from other countries.  The bulk of the others are, I suppose, Pakistanis and West Indians.  The situation for them is different from our situation. We are convenient to Britain and any psychopath who takes the notion can cross to Britain at very little cost if he is discontented here.  That situation does not exist so far as the West Indians and Pakistanis are concerned.  If figures <Col N="2314" /> mean anything, I believe the real answer will be found in that comparison. Those of the other races mentioned who suffer from these defects have not got the finances to get to Britain.  If they had, they would probably be there.  It is not wise for people to make statements like this.  They damage us as a nation.  They should be examined out and explained fully so that we may have the real reasons why the situation is as it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he is making an effort to equalise costs on public health authorities throughout the country.  Not everybody who has spoken here agrees with him in that.  I think it is a move in the right direction because it will help in some measure to compensate the people in the constituency I represent and the constituency the Minister represents for the help these constituents are giving to people in the east and south.  I am thinking now of cereals and corn crops. The areas we represent cannot grow these crops but our people have to subsidise those in the areas in which they are grown.  That constitutes an economic burden and some feel they cannot enter into certain agricultural activities because feeding stuffs are too dear.  We have to subsidise the farmer producing cereals and I think it is only fair that they should make a contribution to us in our health services, or something else.  I congratulate the Minister on this move and I hope costs will be equalised throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The only other comment I have to make is to offer a bit of advice.  It is this: no matter what we say and no matter what we do about the health services, if one is to have and maintain good health, one must be very careful in choosing one's parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the White Paper was laid before the House in January, 1966, there was an indication that the proposals adumbrated would take time to reach fruition.  Most of us listening to the debate last year and to the Minister's predecessor felt that we would possibly have got a bit further by this time than we have got.  One could not say, reading the <Col N="2315" /> Ministers' speeches, that this was even implied, but there was a sort of bounce and zest and enthusiasm, real or simulated, in the Minister's predecessor which gave the impression to this side of the House and, indeed, to the country, that we would have got much further now than we have got.</P>
      <P>I was interested to note that so far as the main medical associations&mdash; the IMA and the Medical Union&mdash;are concerned, discussions have not yet even started, as far as I can gather, between the Department and these organisations.  A stage has been reached at which a memorandum is being prepared.  I think the House and the country could lawfully look forward to a more vigorous approach to the implementation of the terms of the White Paper within the coming 12 months.  Deputy Gibbons indicated that he hoped as much thinking as possible would be done on certain aspects of the matter.  I think as much thinking as possible has been done already.  I think sufficient time has elapsed between the publication of the White Paper and today to allow the Department to proceed at a greater pace between now and the next time the Minister's Estimate comes before us.  It was implicit in what the Minister's predecessor said last year that something would be done pretty soon in regard to the vexatious charges to out-patients for X-rays and consultations.  I do not know if it is possible at some stage to introduce piecemeal some of the proposals in the White Paper.  The Minister might consider it.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of matters have been referred to in the course of this debate, over which I need not range again, which are crying out for a rather peremptory change.  I would suggest the Minister might investigate some of these with a view to dealing with them even in a stopgap way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must feel like screaming when anyone refers to the increased charges on local health authority rates by reason of the situation which has arisen in regard to <Col N="2316" /> supplementary grants.  I do not intend to enlarge on it except to tell the Minister that we in Cork Health Authority are in similar difficulties to those which have been referred to by other Deputies.  The difference between what we have been allocated and what we have estimated is £71,000.  I understand the Minister is already in receipt of some correspondence on the matter crystallising the Cork Health Authority view of it.  I trust he will give the Authority's representations every consideration. While again it is true to say that no definite undertaking was given by the Minister's predecessor in regard to the continuation of last year's scheme, certain expressions he used in the Seanad certainly gave the impression that the local burden could not continue to grow as it had been doing. From that I think most of us in health authorities and our officials took it that this year a similar approach would be made.  It was most unfortunate that that was not so.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's disquiet and the obvious fears of other Deputies about the number of temporary dispensary doctors.  I hope some understanding will be reached.  I was glad to note from the Minister's opening speech that he seemed to realise the importance of dealing with this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister and his advisers look into the possibility of implementing the old saying that prevention is better than cure?  The Minister referred to immunisation against polio and diphtheria.  A great deal of money, time and skill is spent on it, and an excellent thing it is.  But I often wonder how many people are being treated in our hospitals and institutions at the moment whom it would not be necessary to treat if the Department took a stronger view on smoking by juveniles and smoking generally.  It amazes me, when it is realised by nearly all the medical profession that smoking is a danger to health and gives rise to some of the deaths about which Deputy Gibbons spoke, deaths from cancer and cardiac causes, that the Department seems to have closed its eyes to it over the years. <Col N="2317" /> Any boy or girl sitting in the family sittingroom after tea can see, time and again, invitations to smoke this cigarette and that cigarette because it is a good cigarette, a cool cigarette, a better cigarette or a longer cigarette. But never once do the Department think fit to intervene and say: &ldquo;Do not smoke.  Whether the cigarettes are good, bad or indifferent, it is a dangerous thing and you will rue it in time to come.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Department's thinking is on this.  I often wonder is the Department's mind affected by the attitude which the Department for Finance would take to the loss of revenue which would arise if an effective anti-smoking campaign were mounted in this country, as it should be and as it has been in many other countries.  I have never yet received a satisfactory explanation from any Minister as to why we have not approached this problem as we should. It is a grave danger.  I speak as one who might be considered to be a tobacco addict.  While thinking men like the Taoiseach and his predecessor may smoke a pipe, you have only to go out in the street to see every little nipper puffing away at some butt or other, purchasing for himself in the future grave ill-health and purchasing for us great expense in dealing with him in our medical service.  I think the Department might co-operate with the Department of Education in dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>There is another preventive move-the Department should take.  I am quite satisfied of this from my own experience in my constituency.  Many of the children suffering now from bronchial complaints, and who will suffer from them for ever more, many of the children suffering from rheumatic pains at an early age, would never be afflicted in this fashion if local authorities provided proper housing for them.  There is a widespread complaint that, not alone are there not enough houses, but that many of the houses provided by local authorities are damp and unfit for occupation by children.  Any Deputy who is a member of a local authority <Col N="2318" /> or who represents a city constituency could richly document my allegations that, week after week, mothers and fathers are complaining about the state of health of their children simply because they are living in damp houses, where the roofs are leaking and where draughts abound.  We owe it as a social duty to those families that at an early stage steps should be taken to ensure that the health of their children would not be impaired.  We owe it to future generations that we should not occasion to them the extra expense of dealing with maladies which are born in houses built at public expense by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister might well use the interdepartmental committee of the Department of Health, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Social Welfare to investigate that matter.  I am sure such an investigation would pay large dividends, not alone in terms of money but, above all, in terms of the standard of national health.  It is all very well to talk about drug control and the setting up of a national drug advisory board, but we should look on tobacco as being, for all practical purposes, the No. 1 drug difficulty in this country.  We should spend some money on investigating the tobacco problem and also on publicity calculated to discourage people from smoking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke last night about the many voluntary bodies who do great work in relieving the Department of many problems and burdens, financial and otherwise.  It is true that there are many such bodies but people who are in charge of bodies of that kind are gravely disquieted by a rumour appearing in the public press to the effect that Hospitals Sweepstakes propose to run weekly lotteries in future to supplement the amount they get from their occasional sweeps.  If that happens, the Department will have to look forward to the day when it will have to subsidise these voluntary bodies to whom Deputy Burke paid tribute and I now pay tribute.  It would be impossible for them to exist without the moneys they collect from their <Col N="2319" /> weekly football pools and various other operations of that kind.  These obviously would be completely wiped out by the superior and more national organisation available to the Hospital Sweepstakes if they run the suggested lotteries.</P>
    <P>It has often struck me, and I am sure others, that the Minister might discuss with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board the possibility of extending cover to insured persons who do not go into hospital.  It would free many hospital beds for more urgent cases.  I know personally of a number of cases of people who were either sent in or went to hospital so that they would qualify for benefits under the Voluntary Health Scheme. If these benefits could be given on a domiciliary scale, many people would remain at home for treatment and make available beds now being occupied in hospitals.</P>
    <P>My final point is in one way local and, in another way, underlines a trend which is becoming, among ordinary people, quite a matter of scandal.  I refer to Cork Regional Hospital This project has not only been drenched but douched by democracy. It must be 35 years since the project was first mooted and since then we have been so busy ascertaining the views of all parties concerned before the hospital is built that nothing has yet been done.  A great deal of money has been spent and nothing has been built.  There is a national aspect of this matter to which, in conclusion, I want to refer.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor who is now in the House will recall that he did come to Cork and did announce that there would be an international architectural competition to select a design for the hospital.  That was a fair length ago.  This time last year, I think, the Minister's predecessor referred to it when speaking in the House on the Estimate.  Nothing has been heard of it since, and while I was glad to learn from a Parliamentary Question which I addressed to the Minister on 23rd February, that the Cork Hospitals Board which was set <Col N="2320" /> up has held nine meetings since it was established in June, 1966, there was no reference to the future of the international competition.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that it is unlikely in fact that there will be any such competition and I put it to the Minister as a matter of common talk in the city of Cork.  I should be glad to get the Minister's assurance one way or another in the matter.  The feeling is growing in Cork, arising largely, I think, out of references made in this House by the Minister's predecessor quite recently in regard to the building of regional technical colleges, that Cork Regional Hospital will have to await the day when Building Design Associates, the Minister's consortium, will have time to deal with the Cork Regional Hospital or alternatively, that possibly the Minister might be able to have recourse to the recruiting field for up-and-coming young professional men known as Taca, an organisation which I understand exists in Dublin for the type of people to whom the Minister referred here last week, that is, people who support him and the present Government Party.</P>
    <P>I am told&mdash;and my constituents in Cork are gravely disturbed by this&mdash; that at a meeting of this body in Dublin not so long ago a number of Ministers of the Government attended and that it was indicated to those present that it would be a wonderful thing if they were to subscribe as generously as possible to the Fianna Fáil Party. Annually, in my constituency there is held an ideal homes exhibition&mdash;it is held in Dublin also&mdash;where there is a competition and prizes are given out.  If you carry the local paper around with you and if the representative of the local paper sees you carrying it, you are given a prize.  It also happens at Brighton and various other places where somebody goes up to you and says: &ldquo;You have won a prize.&rdquo;  The realisation is growing in my mind and the minds of others that possibly we can look on the membership card of Taca in the same way.  If young architects, quantity surveyors, mechanical engineers and others carry their membership cards with them, they never <Col N="2321" /> know when a representative of the Government may come along and say: &ldquo;You have won the prize&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the danger that has arisen in the minds of Cork people regarding the evident postponement of the international competition for architectural design for Cork Regional Hospital.  I have put it as plainly as I can and I shall be glad if the Minister refers to my allegations when replying, because it is a matter which, in my opinion, is becoming one of national scandal which is indicating to the people that Tammany Hall methods are meeting with more and more success at Government level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his speech introducing the Health Estimate.  In a relatively short space of time, he has obtained a most comprehensive knowledge of the entire field of health services and has given a very heartening signpost to the future development of those services as outlined in the White Paper.  I should like to refer in particular to the Minister's observations on the care of the aged.  He is aware that there is in Waterford a very energetic voluntary committee providing a community service for old people.  This committee is working in close collaboration with the medical and public assistance staffs of Waterford Health Authority and is, indeed, receiving every co-operation from the health authority.  I feel, however, that it should be possible for health authorities to work even more closely with voluntary bodies, if need be by assigning to appropriate groups the service of trained social workers, welfare personnel or secretarial assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of grants under section 65 of the Health Act is another matter to which I would like to refer. I believe that health authorities in different parts of the country are fully aware of the particular problems of the voluntary bodies operating in their areas and that, subject to a ceiling of £1,000 in any year, local health authorities should be empowered to make grants under section 65 without the necessity of applying for sanction to <Col N="2322" /> the Department of Health.  My purpose in making this recommendation is to enable health authorities to come quickly to the aid of voluntary bodies who may, from time to time, require urgent help for a particular project.</P>
    <P>I would like also to ask the Minister to examine the possibility of enabling persons over the age of 70 years who are disabled, to receive allowances under the Disabled Persons Maintenance Regulations.  At the present time the payment of these allowances ceases at the age of 70 when the applicant would qualify for an old age pension. However, in the case of disabled old persons living alone, many of them have to apply for home assistance to supplement the old age pension.  I know that home assistance is being given in a large number of cases to assist old people in the category I have mentioned, but I think the Minister will agree that it would be desirable that the stigma of receiving home assistance, which is still there, should not be forced on old people if at all possible.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of disabled persons allowances is the fact that at present no allowance whatever is paid to a recipient when he or she is admitted to hospital.  I would recommend to the Minister that the health authority be permitted to adopt a flexible approach in such cases so that persons with no other means can continue to receive some little allowance while in hospital to enable them to provide themselves with minor comforts.</P>
    <P>I note from the statement circulated with the Minister's speech the major construction works in progress on the many voluntary hospitals throughout the country and I notice that no hospital in my constituency is included in the list.  I would request the Minister to bear in mind the points put forward by a recent deputation from the Holy Ghost Hospital, Waterford, for a grant of £85,000 to carry out improvements to this establishment which is caring for the aged of Waterford and the surrounding areas.  The Minister's reply will probably be that this is not a hospital in the strict sense of the word but nevertheless it is playing <Col N="2323" /> a major role in the care of the aged and, with the improvements which I hope will be carried out it will be possible for it to play a bigger part in relieving the long list of applicants waiting for admission to our county hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are many old people living alone in Waterford who would gladly vacate their houses if the facilities which I hope will be available at the Holy Ghost Hospital become a reality. This in turn will relieve the housing authority of the long list of young couples who are awaiting re-housing. It would be the wish of all of us that suitable houses could be provided for old people in our housing plans but the housing problem is so desperate that it will be many years before dreams such as this can be realised.  In the interim, institutions such as the Holy Ghost Hospital should receive every help and encouragement to carry on the noble work which they have been doing for so long.  When you meet these old people in Waterford, they will tell you with pride that they are living in the Holy Ghost Hospital but people who are living in the county home are not anxious to let you know that they are living there.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the plea of my colleague, Deputy Kyne, to the Minister on behalf of St. Martin's Hospital in Waterford.  The committee have expended £9,000 on this institution to make it suitable for the treatment of moderately mentally handicapped children and we are still at our wit's end to know whether that money can be recovered from the Department of Education or the Department of Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to express the deep disappointment many of us felt in reading the Minister's speech which showed a complete absence of any proposals for the implementation of the White Paper on Health Services issued some time ago.  The House will agree that the White Paper on Health Services issued in January, 1966, contained what many of us believed to be radical and very welcome changes in our health services.  These were announced with a blare of publicity. All the mass media of the newspapers, radio and television were utilised by the Minister of the time to convey to the Irish people that this was the kind of thing that was coming about, that the old out-dated health services which our people had tolerated and suffered under for so long were about to go and that they would be replaced by a comprehensive programme which would ensure that all in need would be provided with health services without regard to their ability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important aspect of the White Paper which was lauded at that time was that the odious means test for medical cards was to be replaced by a better system.  The old dispensary system was to be abolished and our people were assured of a choice of doctor.  It is to be greatly deplored that in the present Minister's announcement of his plans for this year, none of these things is being provided for. There is no indication of any worthwhile improvement in the health services for the coming year, despite the grandiose promises made by the previous Minister, Deputy O'Malley, when he launched the White Paper.  It is not good enough for the Government to say that this is a long term plan of gradual improvement.  The fact is that they conveyed clearly to all the people that these changes were to come about <Col N="2325" /> and that they were to come about very quickly.  Certainly, it was conveyed to our people in the many elections which have taken place&mdash;the Presidential election, the general election and the by-elections which have intervened &mdash;which was the best platform for Fianna Fáil spokesmen to say what a vast improvement they were going to bring about in the health services.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, entitled to challenge the Minister as to why he has not honoured his promise to the Irish people in respect of the improvements so anxiously awaited and why he has evaded altogether, in his speech, mention of these very important proposals of the extension of a choice of doctor or of those people on the Medical Register, the holders of medical cards, who are confined to one medical practitioner. We are entitled to challenge why the Minister is not now going to proceed with the abolition of the old dispensary system and why, even in the interim period, he has not admonished the managers of health authorities that it was their duty to bring about an easement of the rigid means test which they apply in determining entitlement for medical cards.  There has been no liberalisation of this rigid means test despite what is contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that we should quote what is contained in the White Paper. In it, the Minister expressed the concern of all of us with regard to the disparity which exists from one health authority to another in determining income limits in the provision of medical cards.  There was no national formula of any kind in determining who was entitled to these cards and each county manager decided for himself the kind of formula he would apply. Invariably, it meant that quite a large section of our working-class people were precluded from getting medical cards because of the test applied that not only the income of the breadwinner would be taken into account but, in fact, that of the whole family.  The income of the breadwinner and his sons and daughters or relatives that might be employed in that household would be taken into account.  Despite an urgent need for medical attention in <Col N="2326" /> that home, it invariably transpires that, by reason of the total family income involved, this working-class family is precluded from securing a medical card.  Paragraph 51 of the White Paper states categorically:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce legislation under which the Minister for Health would make regulations specifying the classes of persons entitled to participate in this service.</P>
    <P>That is, the service for those people who are eligible for general medical cards.</P>
    <P>Such a specification would fix different income limits for single persons, for married couples without dependants and for married couples with dependants, provision being made for a quite substantial increment in the limit for each child, having regard to the fact that hardship in meeting doctors' and chemists' bills is most likely to be met in large families.  Certain outgoings, such as rent, would be deducted in applying the limits. Corresponding limits&mdash;probably by reference to rateable valuations&mdash; could be fixed for farmers.  The &ldquo;family income&rdquo; concept which now governs the determination of eligibility would be modified so that only the means of the person concerned and his or her spouse would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>That is a very important paragraph of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>Recipients of non-contributory Old Age Pensions, Blind Pensions and Widows' Pensions would be included among the classes specified as eligible.</P>
    <P>When the Minister and his Department of some two years ago recognised this need for a change in the application of the means test for medical cards, they must have been convinced that the present system is unfair and unjust and precludes quite a vast number of necessitous working-class families.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that, since the <Col N="2327" /> time the White Paper was issued in January, 1966, no instruction whatsoever, apart from the necessity of legislation, has been issued to managers of health authorities to liberalise the odious means test for medical cards.  This is a promise which the Government have failed to fulfil for the Irish people.  For how long more will the Government fail to honour this obligation which is so clearly defined here in this White Paper? There is great hardship as a result of there being no change in this means test system.  I could perhaps hold the House for a long time outlining the hardship and the sufferings and the anxieties of families who are scourged by ill-health and unable to pay the cost of doctors' fees &mdash; which, mark you, have gone up considerably&mdash;and the cost of drugs and medicines&mdash; which are soaring rapidly&mdash;and who fear the need for hospitalisation or specialist services which they know they could not afford.  It is true to say of many of these sick persons that the borderline cases have medical cards and the ordinary working-classes are obliged, of necessity, to defer availing of medical treatment because of the fear of inability to pay.</P>
    <P>I must ask the Minister to indicate clearly when it is intended to bring about a liberalisation of this means test for medical cards which is an absolute scandal in this country today.  Those of us close to the needs of the people and those of us who are members of our respective health authorities know that it is said openly that many who are in dire need of medical cards will not get them and that many more who have medical cards are evidently not entitled to them.</P>
    <P>Instead of implementing the most important features of this White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development, the Minister for Health&mdash;who, happily, is with us now, Deputy Seán Flanagan&mdash;would seem to have gone back on many of these important proposals agreed upon by his predecessor in office.  It would seem from his public statements that he has very largely compromised on many of <Col N="2328" /> the most important pieces of amending legislation involved, and has certainly gone back on some of the important proposals, especially in respect of the abolition of the dispensary system which from his public statements it would seem he is not now proceeding with.  I appreciate that the Minister has gone to great pains to ascertain the views of all interested parties in respect of the development of the health services in the future, that he has gone to the trouble of visiting the various health authorities and their members and ascertaining their views, but I am afraid that the Minister used these opportunities to listen, in the main, to the most conservative voices on those authorities.  He seems to have shown more interest in the conservative voices speaking out on the health services and seems to have shown more interest in the vested classes involved than in the mass voice of the Irish people crying out for change and the views of those of us who regard ourselves as progressive. I sincerely hope he will not go back on those important proposals and that he will not acquiesce in the wishes or the dictates of the vested interests in our health services.  I hope he will do what the people are crying out for&mdash;bring about these much-needed changes as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Whether the intentions of the Government were sincere or not, many of the proposals in the White Paper have had most serious repercussions for the people.  Many county managers have accepted this White Paper as an indication of Government policy to come quickly in the near future and have planned their health programmes accordingly.  This is particularly true in respect of the future of our dispensary system.  It is clearly set out in this White Paper that the dispensary system is to be abolished and that our people are to be granted a choice of doctor.  Resulting from that statement in the White Paper, very many managers of health authorities abandoned forthwith all their proposals for the improvement of dispensaries in various areas and the plans for the erection of new dispensaries which were very badly needed.</P>
    <P>That has been going on for the past <Col N="2329" /> two years.  We have a situation now where people are obliged to queue up and enter dispensaries which, by their very appearance, are wholly unfit and should be condemned.  I could take the Minister to many dispensaries in my constituency which are derelict buildings, old, dilapidated buildings, with no proper heating, lighting or sanitary facilities.  These buildings are utilised for many purposes in the rural areas, not merely for the lower income classes who queue up there to meet their medical doctor but also by the most under-privileged of our people, the people who are obliged to draw home assistance.  There the home assistance officers also meet to dole out the few shillings to those unfortunate people each week.  There is no privacy for doctor or patient; there is no privacy whatsoever for the unfortunate man or woman who must bare his heart to a home assistance officer.  The conversation of all is heard by all.  This is an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>We have been pressing our county manager to carry out improvements and to proceed with new dispensaries and he has refused to do so because of what is contained in this White Paper.  Only recently I was obliged to invoke section 4 of the County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, to direct our county manager to proceed with the erection of a new dispensary at Ardfinnan, Clonmel.  This dispensary is frightful in the extreme, wholly objectionable and a place where no one should be expected to call or remain for more than a minute.  It is a ruinous, dilapidated old building. Despite the fact that the motion was carried by a large majority, the county manager has declined to implement the council's decision directing him to erect a new dispensary because of what is contained in this White Paper and because he alleges he communicated with the Department of Health and they told him there was no change in respect of the dispensary system and what was contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>While the Minister vacillates in this manner, our people are condemned to this humiliating posture and degraded by having to go into places <Col N="2330" /> of this kind.  I would appeal to the Minister to make up his mind quickly on the issue of the abolition of the dispensary system and if it is his confirmed opinion that while we may be able to abolish the system in the major towns and cities, there is a need for the continuation of the system in the rural areas, let him say so quickly.  Let him give a clear indication to the managers and the officers of our health authorities and to us members, and let us at least do something to ease the hardship and the suffering which our people have to endure in attending those old dispensaries at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that nothing has been done to repair or renew these old dispensaries since the White Paper was issued.  People are suffering great hardship as a result. I would ask the Minister to interest himself particularly in the dispensaries I have referred to&mdash;the Ardfinnan dispensary at Clonmel, which is a disgrace, and the Ballingarry dispensary in my constituency, which is another disgrace.</P>
      <P>Prior to the publication of the White Paper on the Health Services, South Tipperary Health Authority had made final plans to advertise for a new dispensary and doctor's residence at Kilsheelan, Clonmel, but as a result of the Minister's statement at the time the White Paper was issued, the manager withdrew the invitation for tenders for the execution of the work and the project was not proceeded with.  In the meantime, the people of Kilsheelan have had a temporary doctor, who, admittedly, is doing a good job of work, but the dispensary service there is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is slow in making up his mind about these matters, he <Col N="2332" /> should indicate to health authorities that they have an obligation to renovate these places or should give them the green light to proceed with the erection of these much-needed dispensaries.</P>
    <P>The same applies in regard to a dispensary at Ahenny near Carrick-on-Suir. One is appalled at the appearance of this dilapidated old building. The health authority, waiting for the Minister to make up his mind, has not felt disposed to improve the building in anticipation of, perhaps, the abolition of the dispensary services and the provision of choice of doctor.</P>
    <P>There are many features in the White Paper which make it attractive to those of us who seek radical changes in our health services.  Not the least of these are the provisions with regard to the care of the aged.  I could quote at length some of the sentiments expressed in the White Paper of which we all approve.  The care of the aged is one of the most important aspects of our health services and is not receiving the attention it deserves from the Department. I was very pleased to note that the Government's general aim is to encourage old persons to stay at home and to endeavour to ensure that assistance will be available where needed to enable them to do so without causing hardship to the aged or imposing too heavy a burden on their relatives. It is gratifying that the opinion should be expressed in the White Paper that the sending of aged persons to the county home is not the right approach.</P>
    <P>The various subventions which the health authorities are now empowered to make for the maintenance of aged persons and the chronically ill in private institutions are a tremendous help.  The subvention of 22/6 per day for the maintenance of a person in a private home is being availed of widely and has contributed a great deal towards ensuring that persons will not be sent to the county home at the end of their days.  The only regrettable feature is the fact that the subvention does not continue for a prolonged period.  It is granted for a period of six weeks and then reviewed and a very compelling case has to be made to <Col N="2333" /> secure an extension of the subvention for another six weeks.  It is particularly difficult to have it continued for 12 weeks.  The short term value is clear.  I would appeal to the Minister to be more liberal in the manner in which the subvention is applied because it is proving most beneficial and is greatly appreciated by persons who have the care of the aged or the chronically ill or persons suffering from an incurable disease such as cancer.</P>
    <P>Anything that I have said should not be taken as disparaging in any way of our county homes which in recent years have been modernised to a very large extent and can now be regarded as hospitals in every sense of the word.  Yet, there is an innate reluctance to enter these homes.  The old stigma remains and it will be a long time before it is eradicated.  We would much prefer to see aged persons being cared for at home, where possible, and a decent allowance being provided for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The means test applicable for the purposes of the disabled persons maintenance allowance is very rigid and excludes a large number of disabled persons.  A person has to be virtually destitute to get a disabled persons maintenance allowance.  There seems to be a reluctance on the part of officers of health authorities to grant a DPMA, particularly in the case of young persons, however disabled they may be, lest it might prove a disincentive to engage in active work or occupation. There is a disinclination to grant a DPMA in anticipation of provision being made for the training of a disabled person.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that training is the ideal solution and I want to pay tribute to all those engaged in the rehabilitation of the mentally and physically retarded. They are doing an excellent job and are to be commended.  They deserve the utmost State aid.  Pending the provision of accommodation for disabled persons in suitable institutions where they can be adequately trained, there is an obligation on the health authority to provide an allowance and I would hope that more generosity would be displayed <Col N="2334" /> in the allocation of these maintenance allowances.  The Minister might also consider an assessment of this means test which takes into account the entire family income in regard to this allowance.  This has precluded many deserving people from getting the allowance.  The same applies to the infectious diseases allowances.</P>
    <P>One cannot complain very much about a curtailment of such an allowance when the patient is being provided with treatment in a sanatorium but the infectious diseases allowance is totally inadequate to provide for the person's dependants at home.  We know of many cases where a TB sufferer, probably the breadwinner, has been in a sanatorium for a long time and who has been prevented from making a speedy recovery due to his anxiety over his wife and family because of the small amount of money going into the home.  This allowance should be at least sufficient to ensure adequate comfort for the wife and family while the breadwinner receives treatment. The same should apply to any other member of the family and the allowance should be comparable with the wage enjoyed prior to the illness striking.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Tully this morning speaking about the treatment of hospital staffs.  I want to pay tribute to the doctors, matrons and nursing staff and all those concerned in the provision of health services.  By and large, these services are good but they can be improved on if the contents of the White Paper are implemented. However, I am concerned about the plight of other workers in the hospitals, such as wardsmaids, ambulance drivers and so forth.  Their work is not fully appreciated and we are aware of cases in which scandalous wages were paid to such people.  Some of them are not organised in trade unions and therefore do not have the voice of these bodies to speak for them.  There is, however, an obligation on the health authority to provide decent conditions of employment for staff and to end the long working hours, the overwork, and to pay decent wages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2335" /> I agree with Deputy Tully about the attitude of some people who control our hospitals, in that they think that they have the right to hire and fire at will.  We had hoped the day of this outlook had passed but it has not.  I appreciate that running a hospital is a very important matter.  One could say that it is a matter of life and death, a matter affecting the lives of people, and therefore one has to maintain a high degree of discipline, but at the same time, there should be greater appreciation of the intrinsic worth of these lower grades of workers and the part they are playing.  They are indispensable, and it is wrong if they are treated in an offhand fashion or discriminated against.  I am sure the Minister would not condone any unfair practices of that kind.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the feeling health authorities had that the Department was going to come to their rescue in respect of all moneys expended over and above last year's figure.  It was hoped that the burden on the local authorities in regard to health charges would be met from central funds and that the rate-payers would not be called on to provide any more through local taxation to meet the extra charges.  All of us associated with local authorities and health authorities formed the definite opinion that, arising from the Minister's promise of some two years ago, he would continue to meet any additional charges over and above the previous year and that he would not permit a situation in which local authorities would be obliged to provide these moneys out of rates.  We have had a departure on this occasion.  The Minister says that the increase in health charges for this year should mean about 9d or perhaps 1/3d at the most in the health charges of local authorities. Even 9d or 1/3d is a serious imposition in respect of a rates increase at present, especially when all of us in the local authorities have been doing our best to maintain the rates at their present figure.  We have gone out of our way to ensure that the rates would not increase to any appreciable extent.  In my own local authority, we were able <Col N="2336" /> to hold down everything, so to speak, for the coming year, with the exception of health.  For the coming year, the rate for South Tipperary County Council will be 62/11.71d, an increase of 2/2.92d over the current year, 1966-67.</P>
    <P>Of this increase, the health services are responsible for 2/2.49d so that the increase in the main is attributable to the increase in the health services.  We expected that the Minister and his Department would come to our rescue in the matter of raising that extra odd 2/-.  Had we known in advance that there was any doubt that the Minister might not meet this extra charge, perhaps some economies could have been effected.  I do not know.  Perhaps the situation could have been looked into more deeply.  I feel that the Minister was somewhat dishonest on this occasion with the health authorities in that he did not give them sufficient notice that he would not meet these extra charges this year.</P>
    <P>This has involved many of us in a serious predicament which we cannot get out of.  Having gone through the estimate for the health services in my own health authority, I consider it is very unlikely that we will be able to reduce that 2/2 very considerably.  We may be able to knock off a few pence, but that is as much as we will be able to do.  I would ask the Minister again to reconsider the allocation of money to our county, and other counties as well, and where he is satisfied that this is proving a hardship on the local authority, to see what he can do by way of coming to their rescue.</P>
    <P>This is another broken promise in regard to what is contained in the White Paper on the Health Services. It was suggested that local taxation would not be called upon to meet the extra charges in relation to the health services, and that they would be met by the central authority.  This is another promise which the Minister's predecessor made and which has not been honoured.  We very much wish to see the implementation of the things contained in the White Paper, but that is not all that we in the Labour Party would like.  At least it is a step in the right direction.  It is an advance <Col N="2337" /> towards further development of the health services along the right lines.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat what they are, and I know them to be the true needs of the mass of our people.  They may not be the things with which vested interests are concerned.  They are the abandonment of the hideous means test for medical cards, the liberalisation of that test, the granting of health services, the provision of choice of doctor, the knowledge that drugs and medicines will be available, and hospitalisation and specialist services for the mass of our people who are prepared to pay for those services.  What we in the Labour Party claim for them is not charity, but what we consider to be a fundamental right for which our people are prepared to pay by way of an increase in their social welfare stamps, perhaps.  For too long they have been denied this privilege.</P>
    <P>We want to see the abolition of the old dispensary system.  We know of no reason why the Minister should listen to the voice of conservatism in this regard.  We want to see better care of the aged and an acceleration in the provision of bed accommodation for the mentally and physically retarded. I would have failed in my duty if I sat down without referring to this matter. I have had correspondence with him about the undue delay involved in the provision of bed accommodation in institutions for mentally retarded in my own county, and I am sure this is the case in other counties as well. Whatever can be done in this regard would be a great act of charity, and the fulfilment of a great social duty by the Minister.</P>
    <P>He has been good enough to pay tribute in his speech to many of the voluntary bodies and religious Orders, and in this we can concur with him.  It is with feelings of pride and gratitude that we see an extension of this voluntary effort by our religious Orders and by local groups in our own towns and cities who are coming to the aid of the aged, the sick, the infirm and the mentally and physically retarded.  This is a joyful thing.  It is a truly Christian thing and a great example.  It is not good enough for the Minister to devote <Col N="2338" /> a large part of his speech to trying to take credit for a lot of the work of these voluntary and religious bodies whereas his own Department are showing a sad lack of initiative in this matter.  The fact that so many voluntary bodies have sprung up in our society in recent years, and have come to the rescue of many of these unfortunate people is a sorry reflection on the Department of Health who have had the primary responsibility of dealing with these cases in the years gone by since the inception of the State.</P>
    <P>There is still a lot of leeway to be made up.  I appeal to the Minister to do what he can to provide more and more institutions for the care and rehabilitation of the mentally and physically retarded.  I appreciate that this is not an easy task.  I am well aware of the difficulty in securing adequate staff, people with the knowledge and know-how to deal with these categories of persons, but the Minister has an obligation to lead the way.  If he does, he will win the respect and admiration of our people for dealing with this great social problem.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I should wish the Minister every success in his new office.  I am aware of his qualifications as a Deputy and as a Parliamentary Secretary.  I feel sure that if he continues along the progressive lines marked out for him by his predecessor, Deputy O'Malley, he will win for himself a high place in the hearts of our people.  I wish him every success in the furtherance of our health services.  I feel I can assure him of the support of my colleagues and myself at all times in this regard.  Whatever he does to improve the lot of our sick, our aged, and our infirm, will have our commendation.  He can be assured that not only will we support him vocally, but when it comes to the provision of the essential money for this purpose, this Party will never hesitate to walk into the right lobby to bring about these much needed advances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to protest against the rate which has been struck in our town under the heading of &ldquo;Health&rdquo;, based as it is on the false promises of the previous Minister for <Col N="2339" /> Health.  We have a demand on our people most of which was caused by these false promises.  On that note I wish to protest here.  These false promises were made.  They went as far as a joke by the previous Minister about mini-skirts for nurses.  The sky was the limit.  We all know what the previous Minister promised in the past. He has been described as a very promising young man, and we all know the implication of that.  When he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, he promised to drain the Shannon.  During a by-election there were headlines in the paper: &ldquo;£20 million to drain the Shannon&rdquo;. Now he has gone to another portfolio. He shifted out when he found his promises could not be implemented.</P>

      <P>The people are being educated to the fact that these promises hold no water, in the Shannon or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about free choice of doctor.  On many other occasions I have asked what choice of doctor have the people on the islands off the west coast.  At times these islands are isolated and, but for the fact that we on this side of the House forced the Government into getting helicopters, we would have had many tragedies on those islands.  On the islands in the West, we have great difficulty in holding a doctor.  There is no incentive because of the small number of medical cards.  The Minister may say there is a case made for these doctors, but I say a very special case must be made for these doctors: give them a salary that will encourage them to remain there.  Where is the choice of doctor for these people who may not have the same doctor for one month to another or who may have no doctor at all at times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must express my disappointment with the progress made in catering for the mentally handicapped child.  There <Col N="2340" /> is hardly a Deputy, especially a rural Deputy, who does not know the pathetic cases that are around the country.  People try to hide this but these children are growing up, getting stronger and are becoming practically a menace in some homes.  It means maybe that the breadwinner has to stay at home and mind that child.  It is unfortunate that any home should be visited by such hardship.</P>
    <P>Let us get our priorities right.  Ministers cannot talk in this House in thousands now; they have to talk in millions.  The spending of money in the city is colossal.  We see these glass houses rising up.  We have no sense of proportion.  We have little or no regard for the great suffering endured in homes throughout the country where people cannot look after these unfortunate children.  I wish to pay tribute to the great work of our religious.  I should like the Minister to hold out some hope for the cases I have mentioned. I could fill his desk with dozens of such cases, and I cannot tell these people there is any hope.  Some of these people are on the list for years; some of them are no longer children and are becoming more than a handful for their parents.</P>
    <P>I am glad to notice that Merlin Park Hospital in Galway is beginning to cater for geriatric patients to a greater degree.  It is very important for that hospital to cater as far as possible for the people from the West instead of their having to be sent to St. Brigid's Home, which is the cause of great hardship to poor people who cannot afford to hire a car to get there.  We cannot expect old people to thumb a lift along the road to go to see a relative in hospital.  Something should be done to cater for people in the West in the centre which they can most easily visit. Because of the expense and hardship involved, some people cannot visit a relative until they go to collect the remains.  When they go to collect the remains, the remains come out in a type of coffin to which one might not like to draw attention.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I should pay tribute to St. Joseph's Nursing Society <Col N="2341" /> in Galway.  They are helping to keep old people at home by nursing them there.  They are doing great work and are not shouting it from the house tops.  It is only fitting that we in this House should pay that tribute.  They are keeping these people out of hospitals and avoiding expense to the rate-payer and the taxpayer alike.</P>
    <P>In regard to dispensaries, we cater for the west side of Galway city, but it is important to expedite the provision of a dispensary service in the Mervue area so that people will not have to go from one end of the city to the other with their children.  It is about time we had another look at the hours of dispensaries.  When a mother has to bring her children across the city to the dispensary, she is held up there possibly for hours, and when they return, there is no time to prepare a lunch for the breadwinner when he comes home.  I hope the Minister will meet the needs of these people in the Mervue area.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in regard to the provision for dentures and spectacles. There is a waiting list of years.  People are going around manntach, as we describe it in the west.  Eventually when they get dentures, they have been made 120 miles away.  They are ill-fitting and in many cases they end up behind the jug on the dresser.  It should be possible for the local dental mechanic to adjust ill-fitting dentures.  I do not believe anybody has ever had dentures that did not need some adjustment. The personal touch could cater for that.  I know of many cases of people who have been waiting for spectacles and it is about time the squeeze was put on many of these promises.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of the House, I should like to pay tribute to the great work that is being done by the nursing staff at the Regional Hospital, Galway.  It is only when one is a patient there that one can appreciate the excellent service rendered.  The staff are cheerful, most attentive, and good to the extreme.  I would not like the occasion to pass without paying tribute, both to the medical and the nursing staffs.  We are very well <Col N="2342" /> catered for in this respect and we are proud of the services we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of all the criticism one hears up and down the country, there is no doubt in the mind of everybody that our health services have made tremendous strides in the past ten years, particularly. Of course this is a Department whose services have a great impact on the life of every member of the community from the cradle to the grave. There will always be criticism because it would be impossible to evolve a perfect system which would satisfy everyone.  There are, of course, vast ramifications in the health services and very few understand&mdash;in fact, some deliberately misunderstand&mdash;all the facets of the services and the tremendous responsibility of the Minister. At this time of the year, in particular, we hear a great deal about the cost of the health services.  For 11 months of the year, we get demands and requests for better services, better facilities, more expert specialists.  For one month, when it comes towards March, everyone cries out about the cost of the services.</P>
      <P>I am not one of those who advocate that the State should pay the entire cost.  If the State did that, then the State would want the complete say-so in how the money is spent.  It is a good thing that local representatives should be consulted and should advise as to where they think the money should go and what services are most urgently needed.  However, I also see a danger in allowing too great a percentage because local authorities are inclined to think, if someone else is footing the bill, they should meet all the requests and demands made upon them.  With a 50-50 arrangement there was some control.  Our own health authority in Cork is asking that it should be 75-25.  In that I see danger of costs going up immediately and, whether it is the taxpayer or the rate-payer, the money will come out of the same pocket and, in the long run, the cost will be greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Department will pay £5½ million more for health services <Col N="2343" /> than it paid last year.  That is a considerable amount of money and, even at that, it will not be possible to meet all the demands.  There is the care of the aged, of physically and mentally handicapped adults and children, spastics and so on.  There are demands for specialist services which up to now were catered for outside the county.  As the last speaker said, there is a demand for more services, such as dental services, ophthalmological services and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the care of the aged, this problem has arisen because people are living longer as a result of better conditions, an improved standard of living, drugs, medicines and so on.  It is rather pathetic to visualise people living longer and spending the last years of their lives in misery.  They have come to the end of their service to the community and they are dependent upon the community to look after them.  I pay tribute here to the voluntary organisations. I appreciate that they can never be replaced by officialdom. The voluntary worker has a tremendous advantage because he is a dedicated worker.  At the same time, it is only fair to say that, in my experience, voluntary organisations could never have been as successful as they undoubtedly are, were it not for the help they receive from the Department.  The officials in the Department have been most helpful both in advising and in giving practical assistance to these voluntary organisations which are doing such wonderful work.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Kilkenny Social Service Council which will open this month.  That is an example that should be followed everywhere. In Cork, we are very well off from the point of view of voluntary organisations.  There are many excellent bodies looking after the aged, the mentally and physically handicapped, spastics, polios and so on. To avoid the danger of overlapping and the danger of incurring unnecessary expense there should be a co-ordinating committee on which all these <Col N="2344" /> organisations would be represented, keeping their own individuality and identity.  Such a co-ordinating committee would enable them to know what the other organisation was doing.</P>
    <P>It is a pity, indeed, that the hospitals do not co-ordinate and collaborate more than they do.  Some of the institutions in Cork are comparatively small and it would be a very good thing if there were a co-ordinating committee to enable them to help one another.  Specialists, doctors and nurses are all very necessary but I am not at all satisfied that they work to full capacity.  Some, too, are inclined to forget that the patient is the most important consideration in the service.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine on the other side of the House mentioned the proposed regional hospital for Cork.  He wanted the Minister to make a statement about its progress.  So do I.  The Minister's predecessor came to Cork and spoke to us about an international competition for this hospital.  He was very sincere and we agreed with him. However, taking everything into consideration, and remembering that money is freer now than it was 12 or 18 months ago, I suggest to the Minister that hospitals have been built in the interval not very far from Cork which could be examined to see if a similar structure would not do in Cork.  That would avoid the necessity of waiting three or four years until this international competition is completed. I do not know whether my idea would save any expense: it might or it might not.  It would certainly save time and saving time would mean a saving in expense because the cost of building is going up all the time. I suggest the Minister should examine the idea.  I have no authority for this proposal from Cork Health Authority, or anybody else, but for some months past it has looked to me like a welcome solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of regional health boards.  A region is much better able to look after the interests of the community than is a local board.  I have had experience of this in another <Col N="2345" /> department.  It is working exceedingly well.  The idea was received with a certain amount of suspicion at first, but that suspicion was not well founded.</P>
    <P>With regard to dental services, there are two problems involved: there is the problem of preserving the natural teeth of the children and there is the provision of dentures for adults.  The first is much more important because it concerns the preservation of the natural teeth so that the adult can look forward to having his own teeth for many years of his life.  The Minister said that he was short 25 public health dentists out of a total of 117.  If you had unlimited money, you could attract people to fill all the necessary posts but, if you have not, my suggestion to the Minister is that he do what has been done in some counties, that is, employ the private dentists in rural Ireland on a sessional basis.  They could use their own surgeries if they were convenient to the schools; if not, provision could be made so that the dentists could attend the schools and look after the children's teeth.  In that way you could control the amount of money you spend, because it would be on a sessional basis.  Many dentists in rural Ireland would be glad to undertake that work and do one, two or even three sessions a week.</P>
    <P>The problem of dentures is a different one.  The endeavour of the Department to get them made by public health dentists is not very constructive. The public health dentist should be engaged in the preservation of the children's teeth.  At present they are not doing ten per cent of what is necessary in that regard.  Any time they spend making dentures is time taken from this more important work.  I am not as young as I was.  I know the children have no votes and that the adults who get the dentures have. Therefore, there is great pressure brought to bear on health authorities to look after the denture work.</P>
    <P>In that regard I would hope that the negotiations which have been going on for years between the Irish Dental Association and the Department on the fees charged for dentures would <Col N="2346" /> be brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.  Undoubtedly, the ideal solution would be that the person entitled could go to the dentist of his own choice and get his dentures made.  That would obviate the complaint by Deputy Coogan that the dentures are ill-fitting, because the person could go back to his own dentist to see they were properly fitting.  If it was the fault of the laboratory, the dentist could go to the laboratory, as he does with his private patients, and get it rectified.</P>
    <P>If that solution is impossible, if the Association cannot come to an agreement with the Department, there is another alternative, but I am slow to advocate it.  It is not done in this part of the world but it is done in other countries, that is, to get the denture work done by the laboratories.  There was a time when I was a laboratory owner and could not speak like this, but now I have no connection with dentistry and can say it.  In other countries this is done very successfully. A person gets his teeth taken out by a dentist.  The laboratory technician or craftsman cannot draw blood, operate or do anything like that, but he can take impressions and make a set of dentures.  That would mean a revision of the present situation inasmuch as the laboratories would have to be reconstructed to receive patients and so on.  But it is, as I say, another solution to the problem of supplying dentures.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary.  I think the Association and the Department should come to terms about the prices paid for dentures.  They know very well the prices at which dentures are supplied to the health authorities by the laboratories.  Again, I can say now the Department should not go for the cheapest, because the cheapest is not in the long run a good job at all.  It can be half-cooked.  Even a dentist could not tell the difference.  Only when it is worn in the mouth for a month or less and it warps and bleaches do you see that the job is not properly done.  Any reputable laboratory&mdash;and the Department knows many&mdash;will tell them what dentures cost.  They should be able to <Col N="2347" /> come to some agreement with the Association and give denture work to the dentists in rural Ireland, who would welcome it and who need it to maintain their practices.  Even though it is hard to get dentists to fill public health posts, I have no doubt that there are several dentists in rural Ireland who have not got enough to do and who would be very glad to engage in this work if a settlement could be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I feel that with every year that has passed since I came into this House some advance has been made in the health service.  We criticise but, by and large, our criticism is becoming more and more constructive.  The Minister is taking on a very onerous task. He was wished well by those on the opposite side and I certainly join in that wish.  I am glad he has the money now to finish some jobs in Cork that were delayed for nearly 20 years, including the Cork North Charitable Infirmary, where we are trying to build a home for the nursing staff.  The Sisters, who are there for 100 years this year, are in the same accommodation they found when they came&mdash; attics and little cubicles.  We were trying to get an adjoining space, which would certainly have been of no use to anybody else.</P>
    <P>Then, as many Deputies know, the question came up of an old charitable home, called Skiddy's Home, probably the oldest building in Cork.  Some degree of friction was caused because it should be taken over, demolished and turned into a nurses' home. Nothing could be done to renovate this building.  The only part of it of any value as an antique would be the arcade outside it, which is built in limestone.  I hope there will be sufficient public-spirited citizens in Cork and outside it to secure the modest sum that would be required to mark the stones when that arcade is taken down and have it re-erected in some suitable place in Cork.  But it would be a great injustice to the living that they should be deprived of a suitable home in order to preserve this crumbling, decaying edifice.</P>
    <P>It is supposed to be a tourist attraction. <Col N="2348" /> I passed it as a schoolboy and many Cork people born in close proximity have passed it without having seen it because of the high wall around it.  The only way of seeing it is to go up on top of Shandon steeple.  If you look down, you will see this arcade which looks quite attractive.  I am glad to see the Minister has made a decision that the nurses' home will be built and, as I said, I only hope the people of Cork can secure the modest sum necessary to preserve this arcade.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me hope the Minister will be able to find the necessary finance to fulfil the schemes outlined in his White Paper and that when he deals with this Estimate again in 12 months' time, there will again be constructive criticism of a Department so involved in the life of every member of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the previous speaker reminded me of the importance of not counting votes, as he said, in relation to young and old people.  Our approach to health problems must be divorced from the importance of obtaining votes.  The health of the nation is fundamentally important, irrespective of what political thought operates.  We must not be unmindful, however, of what Deputy Healy said because no doubt it does influence certain situations.  What I have said is not to be taken as criticism of Deputy Healy's statement.  I think he has put his finger on a very important matter, that is, the importance of taking health out of the political sphere.  In that connection I believe we must ensure that the archaic attitude that exists in the Department of Health will also be put right.  If one has regard to recent events and what preceded them, if one looked in from the outside, one would not realise that one was observing the same scene so far as the Department of Health was concerned. Prior to the coming of the Minister for Health in the person of Deputy O'Malley and as the Department was operated by Fianna Fáil, one was left with no option but to conclude that it was archaic and that no progress was being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has only to consider the many <Col N="2349" /> sessions of the Select Committee set up by the House to produce proposals in connection with the important matter of health.  This was all done and administered at the instigation of the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee.  If we consider this and compare it with Deputy O'Malley's pronouncements and actions and the initiative being taken by the present Minister, there appears to be no relationship.  One would imagine in considering all this that Fianna Fáil have not been in power as a Government for over 30 years.  This conveys to me as regards the Department of Health&mdash;and one can say the same about some other Departments&mdash;that there is an archaic influence prevailing which is not in touch with present-day matters or desires.  The sooner people who set themselves up as guides and informants, who purport to be know-alls regarding administration of health matters, realise that we are now living at a time when the people may desire proper health services the better.  This could possibly result in a weeding out and putting into retirement of certain people who have wielded the big stick in that Department.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister rightly stressed, and produced figures to show, that 50 per cent of the deaths in this country in the last year were due to heart disease and cancer.  Everybody will acknowledge this stark reality and possibly its impetus for some positive action in the matter.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not attempting to cast any reflection on the Minister's intentions, desires or activity in this matter but I believe much more must be done.  We must get out of the lethargy in which this Department has been for many years, ever since Dr. Browne who was a member of the House, left it.  It appears to me that the Department of Health is becoming a rank conservative and that the situation has been reached where you have certain people indicating what the State should and should not do without really knowing what is happening about them, living in an imaginary world, people who have not had to face realities and have not had to look for the health services such as they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> In this important matter of health and drawing the people's attention to the incidence of heart disease and cancer, I have often wondered why we do not avail of the services of television, for example.  Very often a television programme is a great medium. It has a captive audience and the more people we can get to go along and prescribe antidotes such as they are, the better for all of us.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Minister's speech. I was glad to see his reference to the difficulties experienced by old people. He acknowledged the service given by voluntary organisations but I do not believe it is sufficient for us to leave this problem entirely to the voluntary bodies that are trying to do something for old people.  One must have regard to the leader.  In workingclass circles we refer to him as the &ldquo;boss.&rdquo;  In that connection it is incumbent on the Department to take the initiative. Much more needs to be done.  The absence of finance is undoubtedly preventing more from being done but we should spell out our real problems.  We cannot just rely on the display of initiative found in the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made a point about the district nursing service and mentioned a figure in relation to it.  If we are to get a real picture of this situation, the Minister obviously should indicate what, according to his way of thinking having regard to the views he finds to be obtaining, he estimates to be the required strength of the district nursing service.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister did indicate in the matter of the Commission of Inquiry into Mental Health that he expects to make an announcement in regard to its report shortly. This word &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; has been used in a very coy way by the members of the Government but when one tries to find out what &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; means, one discovers that it can mean years.  The report of this Commission, which is long overdue, should be published as soon as possible.  In this connection it would be wrong of me, now that I have the opportunity not to comment on how the mental hospital system has developed in recent years.  There is no <Col N="2351" /> doubt that from the RMS down to every five-eighth in each of our hospitals, they have done a great job and continue to do a great job.</P>
    <P>One of the things which has brought this about has been the persistent demands by the psychiatric nurses for recognition of status which was so long denied to them by the Department. At last psychiatric nurses are now being described as nurses, not as jailers or warders, and are being afforded an opportunity of doing what is expected of them.  This positive link up has now been brought about, despite the armchair opposition of people in the Custom House who never endeavoured to find out what the job of the psychiatric nurse or the RMS was or how they went about doing it.</P>
    <P>There is one particular situation developing in this field of which I would ask the Minister to take serious notice.  I am now stressing the importance of the principle that people who have the responsibility of making decisions should have practical knowledge of the subject with which they are dealing.  People from the RMS to the ordinary five-eighth may band themselves together and they will still be inhibited by the lack of practical knowledge on the part of people who make the regulations.  I am not now referring to the Civil Service but to members of the County and City Managers Association which is charged with the responsibility of administering the mental hospital system.</P>
    <P>Every member of that association has enough on his plate without having to regulate the wages and conditions of the operatives in mental hospitals or, indeed, in any hospital.  In this connection I am compelled to advert to one of the promises made by the Minister's predecessor, the promise to take out of the hands of local authorities the administration of hospitals and to put it into the hands of regional bodies. This would be a good thing because I am satisfied that these bodies would be composed of knowing people who would concern themselves with the administration of the health services <Col N="2352" /> throughout the State without reference to politics.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we still have the situation where the county managers are responsible for the administration of the hospitals and when the trade unions concerned set about improving the wages and conditions of the staffs, the answer they get is frequently &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  That answer is given by people who have no experience of what is happening.  This is wrong because the operation of the health services should be an non-contentious matter.  A person on the sideline cannot possibly indicate how, where and why other people should do their jobs.  I hope a time will come when this set-up will be changed.</P>
    <P>We had a promise of change from the Minister's predecessor and it has not come about.  We still have the situation in which plans are being made for the improvement of these services but when the people involved in these plans seek to improve their own wages and conditions, they come up against people who are aloof, not of their own decision, from the realities of the situation.  Any trade union which sets about improving the conditions of nursing or non-nursing personnel finds itself being sent from one manager to another to find out what is being done in other places. At the same time, the admonition is stressed that they should keep working and that there should be no disputes.</P>
    <P>This is a problem that comes for solution within the ambit of the Department of Health.  We know that the Minister has a difficult task before him but we will not have a satisfactory health service until the Minister is in a position to have direct contact with all his employees.  However, the Minister is responsible for the health services.  There is frustration among people who are supposed to be looking after the sick because of wages and conditions of employment. They are faced with the question, for example: &ldquo;Will I have to make up my mind or must I wait until the manager in the next county makes up his mind about somebody <Col N="2353" /> else?&rdquo;  I think that matter is crying out for attention.</P>
    <P>I feel I should make a point here and now in connection with health services that the previous Minister for Health gave certain undertakings to the Irish people.  Any one of us who had the opportunity to listen to Deputy O'Malley, when he was Minister for Health, will remember what he had to say in relation to his White Paper on Health.  Certainly, we on these benches felt very happy about what he said.  We recognised that he was going a good part of the way towards conforming with the Labour Party's Programme.</P>
    <P>Countless people came to me and said they saw Deputy O'Malley, the then Minister for Health, on television and that it was announced that a booklet would be furnished to them from which they would know their entitlements and when they would be available.  The present Minister for Health, Deputy Seán Flanagan, should indicate clearly and distinctly what is preventing him from putting into operation the proposals promised in that White Paper.  If factors are preventing their implementation then they should be spelled out.  If it is a matter of who will pay for it, then let us find out how it can be paid for.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party have indicated our preparedness to go along with a contributory scheme in order to bring about a proper health service. I can well see that this will necessitate that the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health will have to correlate their ideas and, to a certain extent, the Department of Labour will have to be in on it.  There is no denying that the people are crying out for an improved health service.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind what the Minister had to say about cancer, I wonder if he would, as a first move, say that the treatment of cancer patients will be free?  I have a reason for saying that. Quite recently, I spoke to a woman whose husband is in St. Luke's Hospital. He is a businessman but certainly the fee he is charged as a private patient is phenomenal.  Immediately, I thought of the person who is barred from the blue card for a technical <Col N="2354" /> reason and wondered about the charge that is made in such a case. This lady tells me that the charge made to such people is £17 a week. From whom do we expect such money?  This is a matter to which the Minister will have to give special attention.  Any unfortunate person who is suffering from cancer has quite enough on his mind besides worry about the payment of the bill.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has a lot to do in the very many aspects of the Department of Health but I would remind the House that cancer and heart disease seem to be stamping out most of our people.  In that connection, I believe some priority should be given by way of providing payment for the treatment of cancer.  This could be a start to an eventual free health service.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by the Minister of the dental service.  Lots of people outside Dublin are fairly jealous of what is thought to be available in Dublin city by way of dental services. My constituency embraces Cabra and Finglas but children there who have dental trouble must travel miles to the Cornmarket for treatment.  I would hope the Minister would set about putting this particular matter right as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the long-promised choice of doctor and free health services, many people believe this promise to be true.  It was made by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy O'Malley, but it has not come about.  We must all be aware that many of our constituents are in need of proper health services.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of people in the city of Dublin who had to buy their homes under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, In order to get a loan and grants under that system, they had to qualify in respect of remuneration. It is ironical that that same remuneration factor has debarred the majority of these people from our present health services.  They have to pay extraordinarily heavy bills not only when in hospital but they must also pay these bills for their wives and dependants out of hospital.  Although the charges are heavy, to say the least of it, <Col N="2355" /> nothing appears to be done about the matter.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that a person spoke to me about the booklet which was to be issued so that people would know what they were entitled to under the health services.  There has been no move at all in this connection.  It is time we faced reality and stopped this: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; mentality.  It is time we stopped saying that people are happy when, in fact, they are not happy.  It is a form of mesmerism or hypnotism but it will not last and it is time we changed that situation.</P>
    <P>I would entreat the Minister to do something about dispensary buildings. I do not know much about dispensary buildings down the country, but having regard to what they are like in Dublin, God help us.  The buildings themselves turn people away.  If they go inside, they have not got the privacy to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the system that operates in the accident services in our hospitals.  People line up for treatment. If one is sent there by a surgeon attached to a particular hospital, a Mr. so-and-so, he presents his note and he can pass the queue but the unfortunate person who is not in a position to present his note waits to get his treatment. He may have to come again the next day and he must queue up again simply to give his name and get a card.</P>
    <P>This is not to be regarded as a reflection on the hospital administrators. This is a reflection on the system that operates.  It indicates clearly and distinctly that the people&mdash;again I say not the Minister but the people in the Custom House who purport to know all that is going on have not got next nor near the place.</P>
    <P>We have the same situation in so far as Dublin hospitals are concerned. Dublin has grown.  This is acknowledged. The population of Dublin has increased but the number of hospital beds in Dublin has not increased to the same extent.  Again, I hope that the same people who purport to work in the back room&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He is also responsible for the officials of his Department.  The sooner something is done about this the better because I have had my own personal experience of such officials.</P>
      <P>One of the things which prompted me to talk about the dispensary service was what the Minister said in his statement.  He said: &ldquo;For the moment the dispensary system must be retained&rdquo;. I would invite the Minister, irrespective of his advisers, to make contact with his own people and he will find that there is nothing but opposition among the people to the dispensary system.  There is no doubt that the dispensary system is an absolute disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Healy talked about what was being done in the North Infirmary in Cork.  That was very useful because there is something being done there but I would ask the Minister to have a good look at Sarsfield Court and what pertains there, not only for the patients but for the people who work there.  This goes for every <Col N="2357" /> hospital.  I raised several questions about this matter and I would ask the Minister to have a look at the wherewithal, such as it is, that is in operation in Monaghan Mental Hospital. Staff quarters, conditions and things like that are all fundamental matters. It is all very well to talk about something that is going to be done in an after period.  I am satisfied that we must look at all our hospitals and bring them up to date.</P>
      <P>I think it is only right for me to say that great progress has been made in mental health by many of the RMSs operating throughout the State.  In particular great progress has been made by Dr. Ivor Browne who is responsible for St. Brendan's and St. Ita's Hospital. His work is undoubtedly commendable and he is very ably assisted by Dr. Noel Browne, a former Minister for Health.  Dr. Noel Browne's intentions have an undoubted influence on the work that has been brought about in those two psychiatric hospitals.  We should not forget this work.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to refer to a further point made by the Minister.  It is the question of the financing of health.  What is the most important of our nation's needs?  I submit health and education.  If the Minister decides to forget about what his predecessor did, by way of promising, and becomes a realist in this particular matter and submits a positive programme towards contributing to a health scheme workers will contribute to a positive health scheme.  I am sure he will obtain support from these benches because already these benches have submitted a programme some of which was lifted by the Minister's predecessor but only lip service has been paid to it.  In so far as we are concerned the Minister need have no fears.  We are quite prepared to support every move he makes in finding finances towards improving the health of the State.</P>

      <P>It was remarkable in all his careless and gay contribution while crying profusely for the Minister's difficulties in finding the necessary money to meet his portion of the cost of the health services, Deputy Burke had not a tear left for the ratepayers, at least in that portion of his speech that I was present for and listened to.  That was the first portion of his speech.  He did not seem to be able to get around to spelling out what it meant for the ratepayers in the Dublin region for the Minister to come along and announce, not at the eleventh hour but, I think, at the twelfth hour, that there would be a deficit, as a result of his decision, in the Dublin Health Authority area of no less than £432,000 for the present year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Electricity Supply Board's General Conditions Relating to Supply provide that the passing of an installation by the Board simply means that it has complied with the required insulation tests and by no means implies that the work has been done in the best possible manner.  The Board takes no responsibility in respect of testing a consumer's installation or for any loss or damage which may be occasioned by fire or by an accident arising from the state of the installation and the responsibility for all wiring on the consumer's side of the Board's main fuse rests solely between him and the electrical contractor who installs the wiring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not an amazing revelation, that the responsibility of the ESB stops at the fuse-box and with the payment of the money?  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary does he consider this is good enough from a semi-State body and does he not consider that in adopting this attitude he is condoning the action of the semi-State body in aiding and abetting in shoddy and inadequate installations, which is part of the general pattern of building gangsterism now proceeding in the suburbs of this city in which the homeless are being robbed?  Would he not agree that there rests upon the ESB, as an alleged responsible semi-State body, an obligation to see that electrical installations in all parts of the house or of any building should be of such a nature as will at least avoid danger to life?  Is that not a fundamental duty of a semi-State body such as the ESB?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to a report which emphasises the big difference in the price of Irish export fat cattle and beef compared to that paid in Scotland, Great Britain, and the Six Counties; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a press report in this matter.  The differences between the prices paid for fat cattle here in the second half of 1966 and those paid in Scotland, England and the Six Counties are attributable to a number of factors, mainly the following:</P>
      <P>(1) The transport and marketing costs which have to be incurred by Irish exporters;</P>
      <P>(2) Fat cattle marketed in Scotland and England comprise a higher proportion of special quality animals, including some intensively fed young beef cattle, than the fat cattle marketed here.  Many of our top quality animals are, of course, exported as stores and these would be included in the price returns for fat cattle marketed in Britain.</P>
      <P>(3)  The average prices computed here cover all fat cattle but those computed in the UK cover only cattle up to the standard prescribed for the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme.</P>
      <P>(4) In the periods of heavy supplies the bulk of the Irish beef has to be sold at large wholesale markets in Britain such as Smithfield where prices tend to be under greatest pressure, whereas a good proportion of British fat cattle is sold locally or in smaller centres where prices tend to be firmer.</P>
      <P>(5) There is a British trade preference for home-killed beef and this has more effect on prices when supplies all round are plentiful.</P>
      <P>(6) When markets are depressed, prices in a surplus exporting area tend to fall more than those in a deficit importing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between prices here and prices in the Six Counties was very <Col N="2367" /> much less than the difference between our prices and those in England and Scotland.  A higher proportion of the Six County output of fat cattle is, however, slaughtered in Britain and, therefore, benefits from the preference for home-killed beef.  Also, it has been suggested that price factors played a part in some financial problems encountered in the Six County meat trade during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the difference in price was as much as 40/-a cwt. for quite a long period?  Furthermore, is it a fact that part four of the Minister's reply is the important part, the fact that our beef was being dumped in Smithfield and not really being marketed simply because there is no meat marketing board, or meat marketing organisation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Allowing for cattle exported as carcase beef, the exports of cattle to Britain in 1966 were not less than in 1956; they were in fact, 130,000 head higher, and their value per head was, of course, very much higher.</P>
      <P>The total number of cattle in the country on 1st June, 1966, the latest date for which figures are available, was 5,590,000.</P>
      <P>As regards markets for cattle, the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain provides assured access to that market and the prices guaranteed for Irish stores fattened for two months in Britain are the same as the prices guaranteed for British home-bred cattle. Also, by virtue of the Agreement, the British Government are extending the support payments under their Fatstock Guarantee Scheme to 25,000 tons of Irish beef exports and the Irish Government have, of course, undertaken to make similar support payments on beef exports to Britain in excess of that quantity.</P>
      <P>There has been a welcome revival of the trade in boneless manufacturing beef with the United States and it is expected that exports to that market in 1967 will amount to about 30,000 tons, representing over 200,000 cattle, as compared with 18,000 tons in 1966 and 4,000 tons in 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 9th February, it would be rather optimistic to assume that any really satisfactory and lasting arrangements for this country's agricultural exports <Col N="2370" /> to Continental Europe can be established unless and until Ireland becomes a member of the EEC.  At present, efforts to secure improved access to EEC markets are being made in the context of the Kennedy Round negotiations in the GATT but it is not yet possible to indicate the likely outcome. Exports of young feeder cattle to Italy which are at present exempt from import levy and duty have, however, been developing and will, I hope, be enabled to continue.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of outlets for cattle and beef in markets other than those I have mentioned are also continually being reviewed and explored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture stated that the Free Trade Area Agreement gave us assured markets for cattle in Britain and can he inform us why, if cattle prices were to rise from £5 to £7 as his predecessor said, they have dropped by £10 to £20?  Is the Minister aware of the catastrophe which is overtaking small farmers, due to the glut of heifers following on the heifer scheme, and that small farmers cannot sell their cattle in Ireland? Has the Minister any plans or are there any prospects for these small farmers?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the total acreage of tillage (a) in 1954 and <Col N="2376" /> (b) in 1966; and what plans the Government have to grow at home in greater quantities those foodstuffs which are imported.</P>

      <P>The total area under tillage in 1954 was 1,808,190 acres and in 1966 was 1,261,900.</P>
      <P>The decline in the tillage area in recent years was due to a number of factors including a series of poor harvests and relatively more attractive prices for milk and livestock.  Grain prices were increased last year and this should serve as an inducement to higher production given suitable weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The price for sugar beet of the 1967 crop has also been increased and a substantial increase in the area under that crop as compared with last year is forecast.</P>
      <P>Import controls which are being maintained provide very valuable encouragement for vegetable production. Vegetables required by processing firms are grown under contract and increased prices will be paid this year for peas which is the main vegetable so grown.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Central Statistics Office that, as no Census of Population was taken in <Col N="2378" /> 1931, statistics relating to the number of persons at work in agriculture are not available for that year.  The relevant figure for 1936 according to the Census of Population of that year was 609,000 and the estimated figure for 1966 is 323,000.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the Government's policy is to ensure the more intensive use of land within the limits set by market possibilities so that the maximum number of people can be retained in agriculture consistent with social and economic progress.  In pursuit of this policy the Government have already taken a comprehensive series of measures calculated to improve agricultural production, prices, marketing and trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 of the Housing Act, 1966, requires that a person who derives his livelihood solely or mainly from a source other than the pursuit of agriculture, must be ordinarily resident in a rural area in order to qualify for the higher rate of grant.  The definition of &ldquo;rural area&rdquo; in section 2 of the Act excludes non-municipal towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This higher rate of grant was introduced because it was felt there was justification for a differential in favour of people erecting houses in rural areas.  This involved defining &ldquo;rural areas.&rdquo;  In any case where a definition like that has to be made, there are bound to be borderline cases, but the whole purpose of the exercise is lost if the definition is gradually extended to cover these types of cases.</P>

Medical evidence has been submitted week after week by the local authority's medical officer.  If this is not ample evidence that the man is incapacitated, I cannot say what is.

The items which constitute means are set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>The increase of 5/- a week effective from 1st November, 1966, was granted to pensioners whose means, as assessed in the manner described, were Nil.  No special assessment was carried out; the pensioners entitled to the increase were determined following an examination of the files relating to all current cases. Where an application was subsequently received from a pensioner claiming to be entitled to the increase the file was re-examined and unless it was clear that the pensioner was not so entitled, the case was referred to the social welfare officer for re-investigation and reference to the local pension committee in accordance with standard procedure.</P>

Is it not manifestly wrong? The Minister himself comes from Donegal and does he not himself know it is causing bitter resentment?  It actually suggests that we are encouraging the daughter-in-law and the son to put their parents out, which we certainly are.  None of us wants that.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 5/- a week increase in pensions provided for in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1966, applies to pensioners with no means.  As the widow referred to in the question is the owner of the house in which she resides, she cannot be regarded as having no means and, accordingly, she does not qualify for the increase, and I have no power to give it to her.  She is in receipt of a pension of 46/- a week which is the rate appropriate to a widow who has not a qualified child and who has means which do not exceed £26 5s a year.</P>
      <P>The pensioner was advised on 30th January, 1967, of a right of appeal against the decision of the deciding officer that she was not entitled to the increase of 5/- per week as she was not entirely without means.  She has not so far appealed against the decision. There is a limit of 21 days within which such an appeal should be lodged but in all the circumstances, I am prepared to authorise an acceptance of an appeal even at this stage.</P>

I will not offend the woman's feelings by describing her home as I have seen it but this is anything but a house and she does not own it.  The rates on it are 19/8d per year.  It is a disgrace and a scandal that people in this age <Col N="2397" /> should be allowed to live in such conditions, let alone be deprived of the 5/- a week.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In October, 1965, three months before this claimant reached 70 years of age, arrangements were made to have a claim to old age pension accepted from her and a social welfare officer visited her address for the purpose.  He was informed that the claimant had gone to reside in England.  Nothing was heard from her until July, 1966 when she submitted a claim to old age (non-contributory) pension.  The local pension committee allowed the claim with effect from 26th January, 1966, but as there was no power under the law to allow the claim from any date prior to lodgement, the social welfare officer appealed against the decision of the committee.  The appeals officer has upheld the officer's appeal and allowed the claim only as from 5th July, 1966. A pension book has been issued accordingly.</P>
      <P>The claimant stated that she did not make a claim to old age pension earlier, because she had been informed that she would be transferred to old age pension without making a claim. She was not so informed by any officer of my Department but it has been decided, on consideration of all the facts, to make an extra-statutory payment to her equivalent to the amount she would have received had she qualified for pension on reaching the age of 70.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="2407" /> for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there are over 75,000 less people at work in Ireland in 1966 compared with 1956; and what action his Department intend to take to provide extra employment opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While there was a decline, of the order stated, between 1956 and 1965 (the latest full year for which figures are available), in the total number of people at work, employment in the Transportable Goods Industries increased from 186,000 in 1956 to 205,000 in 1965.</P>
      <P>The main objective of Government policy in the campaign for increased industrial development and employment is to create and maintain the conditions in which private enterprise will be stimulated and encouraged to embark on new activities.  With this end in view, generous incentives have been made available to stimulate industrial expansion.</P>
      <P>The campaign for the attraction of new industry and for the adaptation and extension of existing industry is being pursued with vigour.  A firm of consultants with world-wide experience has been engaged to assist in a major reappraisal being undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority of its campaign for the attraction of industry.</P>
      <P>As a further step in the industrial development programme, legislation has been enacted enabling An Foras Tionscal to undertake the construction of industrial estates with factory premises available at reduced rents.  The legislation also provides for the making of grants towards the reduction of factory rents on privately owned industrial estates.  The development of these industrial estates is expected to attract thereto industries which might not be located in Ireland at all but for the facilities offered at these estates.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister knows that it is the overall figure the people are concerned with?  The Minister admitted that there are 75,000 fewer people in employment here now than in 1956.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have created 35,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry since the First Programme for Economic Expansion was introduced.  If the situation had been as the Deputy's Party claimed it was before they left office, then, by now, we should have been able to create the 100,000 new jobs.  The Deputy, of course, knows that his Party ran out of office, leaving enormous debts and leaving the whole country shaken.  He knows that it has taken us ten years to make up for that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister will remember that the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was announced about four years later.  He cannot pretend that at that stage he did not know what the facts of the economy were.  Despite what he says, he knows that his Government promised in that Second Programme for Economic Expansion that they would create an extra 7,800 jobs per year. That has not happened.  On the contrary, the number in employment now is far less than it was in 1956.</P>

The figure for the period from 30th June, 1966 to 31st December, 1966 is not available to me at present.</P>

    <P>On 21st April, 1962 the company paid a sum of £189 being the interest due on advances to the 31st March, 1962.  The company deferred further interest payments pending completion of the development stage of the industry <Col N="2417" /> and the working out of the terms and conditions governing repayment of advances.

      <P>The accounts of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta for each of the years 1962-1966 inclusive were certified as being in order by the company's auditor and I have therefore not sought an explanation, nor do I consider that any explanation is required, from the board of directors of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta for the non-inclusion of the amount due to the Exchequer for interest in the accounts for these years. I would refer the Deputy to the note on the company's balance sheets of the 30th June, 1965 and 30th June, 1966 to the effect that as the conditions of repayment of Exchequer Advances had not been determined, interest had not been provided for in the accounts.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he appreciates, as the Minister in his private avocation would readily acknowledge, as I do and the Minister for Health does in ours, that if it were done in an ordinary private company, not a State company, the directors who signed the report and all concerned would properly be prosecuted for an offence under the Companies Act &mdash; properly prosecuted &mdash; and certainly, if I signed an account with the omission of a figure of £750,000 and only a reference to interest without any reference to that figure, I should be prosecuted. It is a public scandal of the worst sort that has been seen since the State started State-sponsored bodies.</P>

I would remind the House that, in effect, this company started trading only in 1965 and that the progress which has been made there has been very substantial, that there has been no misleading of shareholders or the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I put this to the Minister for Industry and Commerce: In a public company it is the shareholders who would be misled by the certificate or by the report of the directors and the accounts as signed by the directors.  In a State-sponsored body it is not the shareholders, because they are the Minister for Finance, but it is the people who have provided the money, the taxpayers, who are entitled to get the proper, truthful, full disclosure. That was not given in these accounts and it is, I suggest to the Minister &mdash; and may I say that it occurred before the Minister went into that particular office or I believe that he, with his legal knowledge, would not have allowed it &mdash; a disgraceful performance, and has besmirched the honour of State companies in the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that three houses in perfect condition, the property of Irish Steel Limited at Haulbowline, County Cork, have now been untenanted for over three years; and if in view of the grave shortage of housing accommodation in Cobh and the loss of revenue to the company he will ensure that these houses will be let to suitable tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the houses referred to by the Deputy are those within the works perimeter.  The letting of these houses presents a problem because the company may want the sites in connection with adaptation or expansion of the works at some future date.  I am informed, however, that the future use of vacant houses belonging to the company is under active consideration and that the company is in communication with the Department of Defence with a view to establishing whether temporary occupation by employees of that Department can be arranged on terms that could be reconciled with the company's own requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are examining the question of the necessity for compulsory safety standards for household electric plugs and sockets. I will consider what action I should take when I receive their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just safety standards I am concerned about.  It is the vast variety of plugs and sockets installed from house to house.  Each <Col N="2423" /> time the electrician comes there is, apparently, a new design.  This is causing expense and difficulty to many householders.  I understand that in England they have recently standardised the common household plug so that every manufacturer is making identical plugs.  Will the Minister examine the possibility of doing something similar here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I agree entirely with the Deputy as to the undesirability of varying standards and sizes in plugs and sockets but the matter is not quite as simple as it may appear.  It seems to me that, ultimately, any worthwhile standardisation in this field requires to be done on an international level, if it is to be effective.  I have urged our people who are concerned with this matter to see to what extent we can achieve some kind of agreement on a standardisation procedure in this and certain other fields.  I should tell the Deputy that there has been a standard laid down by the Institute, but not a compulsory one, prior to this and, frankly, it has not operated very effectively.  The one to which I was referring in the reply to the Deputy's question was a compulsory standard in regard to safety.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister in his own experience not been afflicted with the experience of buying an appliance, bringing it home, flourishing it before his wife and then trying to plug it in, only to find that it will not fit?  Then the electrician is called and he says he <Col N="2424" /> has not got a socket that fits the plug or he has not got a plug that fits the socket and finally the lamp is left standing there until a proper plug can be obtained.  Can we not do something about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a problem but our own home market is not large enough to justify the expense that would be involved for the manufacturers in adhering to one standard only and not to other standards. This is why I say that I think the practical approach is to get agreement on an international scheme, however wide we can get it, and to try to make it an economic proposition for the manufacturers.</P>

      <P>It is not easy to answer the question simply.  The question which was put was about how much we are allocating for 1967-68?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy was asking about this morning referred to the disparity in the proportion being paid by the State.  I replied that the national average contribution for 1967-68 is 55.3 per cent and the variations between the lowest and the highest, as far as memory serves me, were 3.3 per cent in respect of the lowest and 2.4 per cent in respect of the highest, so that you have a variation from the average of 55.3 of from 52 to 57 per cent approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the information the Minister gave me this morning.  This is the reason I am asking about it.  It appeared to me that there seemed to be something peculiar. The Minister quoted a figure which I did not think was correct.  I am sure he did not mean it but he gave me misleading information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how anybody can get things clearly into Deputy Tully's mind.  Entirely from memory, I said that I thought the variation was roughly three per cent.  I quoted the figure especially for Deputy Tully's benefit.  I told the Deputy that the average State contribution to the local authorities this year was 55.3 per cent but that in pursuance of my desire to give effect to the equalisation proposal in the White Paper, some counties had been given more relatively than others and that the least any county got was over 52 per cent and the most was about 57 per cent, and therefore the variation from the national average was approximately three per cent.</P>

      <P>I have already approved, in principle, of Galway County Council's proposal to provide a doctor's residence and new dispensary also a nurse's residence with emergency bed accommodation, on Inishmore, Aran Islands.  Some difficulty has been experienced by the council in obtaining a suitable site but I have now approved of a recent proposal to acquire a site at Kilronan on which to provide the new premises.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to state when building work will begin.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Donegal County Council accept liability for the treatment of a limited number of Donegal patients in Altnagelvin Hospital mainly arising out of accidents and other emergencies.  The initiative in regard to any extension of the present arrangements should appropriately come from Donegal County Council and I would suggest to the Deputy that as a first step he would have the matter considered by the county council of which he is a member.</P>

      <P>As a member of the local authority, I should like to ask the Minister is he not aware that resolutions to this effect have been passed <Col N="2435" /> by the local authority, and passed on to his Department?  Is he not further aware that on a recent visit to Donegal, he said categorically that this was a natural development&mdash;I am not quoting him&mdash;and that he would be in contact with his opposite number in Northern Ireland about this problem? In view of that fact, would the Minister now inform the House of the progress that has been made in relation to these negotiations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

The Deputy had better take it up again with his council before coming back to the Department.</P>

      <P>It is only natural that a relationship such as that which exists between the Northern Ireland Health Authority in charge of Altnagelvin Hospital and Donegal County Council should exist, in view of the exceptional circumstances that may arise out of accidents.  That is not the point. Would the Minister consider approaching the Northern Ireland authorities with a view to giving Altnagelvin some status as an extern hospital to be available to people in Donegal so that they would not have to travel long distances to Dublin?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the fact that he accepts that nurses in voluntary hospitals are to be paid the same salary scales as those payable to nurses in local authority hospitals, he will state why it is proposed to grant the former lesser pension benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of superannuation schemes for their staffs is a matter for the authorities of each voluntary hospital.  As Minister for Health, I am concerned only to the extent to which the cost of superannuation <Col N="2436" /> of the staffs of those hospitals may affect the revenue deficits towards which grants are payable from the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a question on this matter on 23rd of last month, the authorities of the hospitals concerned were informed in 1954 that the cost of such schemes would rank <i>pari passu</i> with the other revenue expenditure for the purpose of determination of grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the revenue deficits.  This undertaking was subject to the limitation that the benefits to be provided should not exceed those which would be available to similar staffs in the employment of local authorities.  The authorities of some hospitals availed themselves of this means of providing for retirement benefits for their staffs, and others had in fact already made such provision.  Others, however, made no superannuation arrangements.</P>
      <P>In order that benefits should be made available to persons retiring from employment in the last-mentioned hospitals it was agreed in 1963 that, in so far as the recoupment of revenue deficits is concerned, a lump sum and pension might be awarded to a person who, if they had been employed by a local authority, would have qualified for such payments.  As the terms of employment do not provide for the grant of superannuation benefits in such a case and as the persons concerned have not paid pension contributions during their employment the benefits, while calculated in accordance with the provisions of the local government superannuation code, are based on one-half of actual service.  Similarly where a pension scheme was introduced in the course of a person's service, the service before the operation of the scheme is reckonable as to one-half.</P>
      <P>I am advised, having regard to accepted standards of superannuation schemes, that this is a generous provision in respect of service for which no superannuation commitment exists and I would not feel justified in departing from it in approving arrangements for the superannuation of voluntary hospital nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact then that a number of retired nurses, or nurses <Col N="2437" /> who are about to retire from voluntary hospitals, are in a much worse position than their counterparts of similar age who were fortunate enough to be employed in public hospitals?  Having regard to the relatively small number of individuals involved, could we prevail upon the Minister to ensure that steps will be taken to give full recognition to the service of these nurses in the voluntary hospitals?  Most of these people will have worked much longer hours and in much more difficult conditions in the past than the people in the nursing service will be required to operate in future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether nurses in (a) voluntary and (b) public hospitals are paid at overtime rates in respect of hours worked by them in excess of 85 per fortnight; if so, if he will give details of the rate of pay; and if he will favourably consider approving payment of double rates of pay in respect of overtime.</P>

      <P>The conditions of service of nurses employed in voluntary hospitals are matters for the authorities of each such hospital.</P>
      <P>Nurses serving in health authority hospitals are not normally paid overtime in respect of extra hours of duty.  The usual practice is that nurses are granted time off in lieu of overtime, temporary staff being recruited where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2438" /> I understand, however, that the Irish Nurses Organisation has submitted a claim to health authorities and to the managements of voluntary hospitals for time and a half payment in respect of hours of duty in excess of 85 a fortnight, and that this claim is being considered by the employers.</P>

      <P>I understand that a number of voluntary hospitals have not yet taken steps to ensure that no nurses are required to work more than an 85 hour fortnight.  Having regard to that, would the Minister use his good offices to ensure that nurses who are required to work more than the maximum of an 85 hour fortnight will be paid at an enhanced rate for the additional work they are required to perform?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress, I was trying to spell out the serious defects of the Government decision to welsh on a previous undertaking to stabilise the cost of the health services so far as the rates were concerned, at the 1965 level.  Perhaps it is not fair to put it in that way. There was no exact undertaking given that this should be done for all time, but when this announcement was made about freezing the rate at the 1965 level, it was expected by all that this was the first step in an effort to stabilise rates.  It was so felt and so stated, particularly because we had been already told that the whole question of rates was under consideration for some considerable time.  The people felt this was a genuine step to keep rates from rising every year.  I think it fair to say that the explanation as to why this announcement was not made until, in the Dublin area, at any rate, it was impossible to have it included in the rate estimates for this year, has not been satisfactory.  The Minister expressed the view that it would be the same as last year, that there would be no increase and that any increase would be met by the Department, and I am quite sure he thought that to be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely suspected that this announcement was held back deliberately so that the rate in the present <Col N="2441" /> year, when there are local elections to be held, would not be affected.  That is a serious business.  I see no good reason why it could not have been anticipated.  The cost of the health services has been rising each year at a fairly high percentage.  I have the figures here: in 1962-63, there was an increase of 15 per cent in Dublin Health Authority area; in 1963-64, an increase of seven per cent; in 1964-65 an increase of 24 per cent; and in 1965-66, an increase of 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is easy to see a pattern there. Fairly steep increases could have been anticipated in present circumstances where improvements in staff salaries and conditions were being agreed and where expenses generally were moving up.  The announcement could and should have come in time for the health authorities to prepare their estimates so that the demand for the present year would reflect the full cost that the rates were expected to bear. In Dublin Health Authority the deficit for the present year is £432,000, but this must be carried forward, and the effect in the next year is that the demand will be £1,633,703.  That is the estimated cost and that is based on only a five per cent increase in health charges during that period. Based on the experience of previous years it could quite easily be much more than this.</P>
    <P>The effect that would have on the three rating authorities would be to increase the rate next year for health alone by 8/1d in the city, 5/4d in the country, and 3/6d in Dún Laoghaire. Excluding any increase this year in the health services, we have an increase of 3/6d in the county rate.  We anticipate an increase of about 7/6d in the corporation area which would mean that the increase in the corporation rate would be 11/- in the present year if the full rate was abstracted; and in the county it would probably be 5/- to 6/-, and in Dún Laoghaire about 5/-.</P>
    <P>That gives us some idea of where we are going, by keeping the cost of the health services or the partial cost of the health services on the rates, and some decision will have to be <Col N="2442" /> arrived at soon to change the whole basis of paying for health services. At the moment we have no regard whatever to the ability of the people to pay this extra rate year after year, with the ever-increasing cost of the health services.  The Minister said something about investigating the possibility of finding the money for health services on an insurance basis. I think he said he was getting out some information on that, and the sooner it arrives the better.  Certainly the present basis for the payment of the health services is anything but satisfactory and needs to be investigated thoroughly and very soon.  I know that the intention is to keep the cost of the rates in the poorer areas of the country as low as possible, and it is quite understandable that that should be done.  However, it certainly has come as a very great shock to the ratepayers in the Dublin region to have such an increase in rates, and they will get the full shock not this year but next year.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have commented on the White Paper and have expressed disappointment that more progress has not been made in relation to implementing the undertakings given in that White Paper.  While I have been quite impressed by some passages in the Minister's speech in relation to other services on which I hope to comment before I sit down, I, too, feel there is far too much uncertainty for far too long in relation to this White Paper and the undertakings given.  The Minister's references to them, to me at least, represent a retreat nearly from the undertakings given in January, 1966. It is like a lot of these announcements: when they are made people get the impression that they are going to get the benefit of it tomorrow.  They imagine that what has been announced as a long-term plan that has not been clearly spelled out is a benefit they are going to enjoy, if not tomorrow, certainly in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There were many things promised in the White Paper.  The only thing that seems to be taking shape&mdash; and that is taking shape very slowly&mdash;is the choice of doctor.  I was one of the people on the Select Committee on the <Col N="2443" /> Health Services&mdash;the ill-fated Select Committee, let me say&mdash;for a period of over three years.  There must have been much valuable information collected during that period.  There were many submissions made, but this is one that was made very frequently, choice of doctor.  One can easily see that there can be only a limited choice of doctor, that there are certain areas where there just cannot be that choice.  That seems to me to be quite an easy decision to make but so far it is still under consideration. There does not seem to be any good reason why it should take so long to make a decision on that aspect of the health services.</P>
    <P>The effect of this, as Deputy Gibbons put it so fairly this morning, is very upsetting.  The uncertainty is very upsetting especially for doctors who are in temporary appointments. The provision of health centres and a decision in relation to the building of health centres is being held up until this whole question is settled.  There may be more in it than I can see, but I am surprised that a decision has not been reached on these matters, particularly the state of the health services, before now.  The whole tenor of the Minister's references to the White Paper was that the White Paper provides a pattern for the future.  It is an uncertain pattern and statements should not be made and false impressions created if we have no clear conception as to how the proposals adumbrated can be implemented.  Statements are made and undertakings are given that certain developments will take place.  At the time at which these statements are made, there is obviously no clear route to the particular goal.  Then someone sits down to work out how we will arrive at that goal.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion about administration of the health services on a regional basis.  I have some doubts about this: I have expressed these doubts before.  The health services in the Dublin area are administered on a kind of regional basis.  On the whole, they have been satisfactory, but I have always thought that the population covered by this particular region is too big and too unwieldy.  In no other part of the world <Col N="2444" /> is there such a large population served by the one authority.  As far as institutional services are concerned, there is everything to be said for administration on a regional basis.  I fail to see why this cannot be satisfactorily worked by having institutions on a regional basis and the other services on the present county basis.  The services in the institutions can be paid for on a services rendered basis.  That sort of arrangement exists at the moment between the rating authorities in the Dublin region.  I do not see why it should not work satisfactorily throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why institutional services could not be provided by one authority and paid for by another.  My fear is that in setting up this new administration machine, there will inevitably be a divorce between the rating authority and the authority providing the health services.  Unless there is a complete change from the present system under which the rates contribute approximately half the cost, this would, I think, be a wrong development. The possibility is that we would end up with a number of additional administration blocks, costing money. At the moment the local authorities run the services.  Administration by these authorities will still cost the same and there will be little or no reduction in the cost of running the ordinary county services.</P>
    <P>Referring back again to the Select Committee on Health, the one thing that was harped on time and time again was the means test.  That was the serious objection raised by every group who came to discuss the health services.  Nothing has been said to indicate that there is any move towards abolishing this means test.  That is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the building programme.  An enormous expenditure is required if the necessary accommodation for the various services is to be provided.  In the region about which I know most there is quite a building problem.  Of course, the main problem is the financing of the building.  There was reference to St. Laurence's Hospital. I can never understand what has happened where that hospital is concerned. <Col N="2445" /> Up-to-date accommodation is urgently required.  It is disappointing that nothing has been done.  It is the one hospital in which the Minister appoints the board.  The mooted building has gone on for so long that it indicates to me, at any rate, that there must be something wrong.  I asked a question about this at one stage and I was told that something like £65,000 had been spent on consultants to draw up plans, which have never been used. That is an extraordinary situation.  As far as I know, there is more planning going on now but there seems to be no clear decision as to whether or not a hospital is needed.  Surely, if it is needed, it should be easy to decide. Either we have the money or we have not.  My advice is to give up talking about it, employ an architect and get on with the building.</P>
    <P>The situation is much the same in relation to the federated hospitals group.  It is obvious a large hospital is required to replace the five or six rather old hospitals providing certain services now.  If it is decided to provide one hospital to give the same services, then there is no point in spending money on the old hospitals.  But there is need to do something in these old hospitals immediately if the proposed hospital is not going to be provided. I know a decision has been <Col N="2446" /> taken to employ an outside group of experts to examine the situation and make recommendations in relation to providing the existing services under one roof, the cost and so forth.  Even though I am a member of the particular authority, this is, in my view, a waste of time.</P>
    <P>It is obvious a hospital is needed. It is obvious a hospital will have to be built and the money that will be spent on this investigation is utter waste. These are delaying tactics simply because the money required is not available. It would be far better to say: &ldquo;Look, we know a hospital is required and, as soon as we can see our way, we will allocate the money, employ an architect and get on with the job&rdquo;. We have architects who are quite capable of planning hospitals and quite capable of giving good value for money.  Hospital beds can cost anything from £2,000 to £10,000, depending on the extravagant outlook of those concerned.  We have shown in certain buildings in Dublin that we can do a first-class job of building hospitals at quite a moderate fee per bed.  We do not really need outside assistance at all to guide us in this work.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
