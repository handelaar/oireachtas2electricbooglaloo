      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he has agreed to the proposal of Dublin Corporation to close a section of the Grand Canal; and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the effect of this decision on the development of the country's inland water facilities, on tourism and on the enjoyment of Dublin citizens of the amenities afforded by the Canal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government how long the Grand Canal may be temporarily closed; the approximate dates of closing and reopening; if there are any circumstances under which the period of temporary closing could be included with any other period of closure for any other reason so as to total a period of over three years closure; and if there are any circumstances under which this closure for over three years could be taken as the statutory period of three years during which the canal has not been used and so permit it to be closed permanently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he gave sanction to the Dublin Corporation to close the Grand Canal for the purpose of laying sewerage pipelines; if he gave such sanction subject to conditions; if so, what they were; if the sanction was sufficient to ensure that the laying of the sewerage pipelines would not be utilised subsequently to make a case for the permanent <Col N="2051" /> closing of the section of the canal involved for technical or other reasons; and whether he will take steps to ensure that the canal will not, under any pretext, be permanently closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state in relation to the Grand Canal the cost of the temporary closing and the laying of sewers; the cost of restoring the canal; the cost, including acquisition, of laying the sewers on the north bank of the canal while in no way interfering with the waterway; and the total cost involved in this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The Corporation have been advised by their technical advisers that there is no practical alternative to the use of the Grand Canal for the laying of sewers necessary to provide adequate serviced lands for new housing and industrial development.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the formulation of this advice regard was had to the sizes of the pipes involved and the depth at which they will have to be laid; the difficulties involved in the acquisition of property and wayleaves and the relocation of essential services and to the dislocation of traffic over a very prolonged period that would otherwise be caused.  Precise estimates of cost of the project are not available.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to give approximate dates for the closing and reopening of the canal.  This and other information must await the submission of further reports by the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that he has not, certainly specifically, answered the question I put to him which was, did he give his sanction to the scheme proposed by the Corporation? I assume from what he said that he did.  I then asked him if he gave it, did he give it subject to any conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> He has not answered that question.  I would be obliged if he would do so. The third thing I want a definite reply to is: are these conditions, if any, subject to which his sanction has been given such as to make it certain that the laying of these pipes will not be used subsequently as a device to ensure the permanent closing of the canal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he has any definition as to what the three year statutory period is? Can it be extended in any particular way as asked in my question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, dealt with this matter very comprehensively yesterday and explained the situation.  The important factor is that before anything is done, there will have to be legislation and all Deputies will have a full opportunity to make their views known and ask all relevant questions at that time.  At this stage no more than a decision in principle has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having noted that the Minister has not satisfactorily replied to Deputy Costello, may I ask him is it possible, when such economies have been exercised by the Minister in his Department, that no estimate of the total cost of this project was asked for, sought or received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government and the Government had before them a number of different alternative proposals and suggestions, all of which contained reliable estimates of what was involved in the different alternatives.  As my colleague explained yesterday, the precise details of the scheme decided upon by the Corporation have yet to be submitted to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of his unsatisfactory reply can the Minister give any indication to the House and the public whether either in the course of the consent that he will have given to the Corporation or in the course of the legislation that will be prepared, adequate safeguards will be <Col N="2053" /> provided to ensure that the canal will not be closed and the trees lining the banks will not be destroyed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we need have no worries about that.  All the Government have decided at the moment is that the Corporation may take it that provided a satisfactory scheme is put forward, permission to close the canal temporarily will be given, but the Government's firm intention is that the closing will be nothing other than temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that yesterday at Question Time a Government Deputy announced that he would do all in his power to have the canal closed permanently.  Can we now have a solemn guarantee from the Minister that there is no question of a permanent closure of the canal under consideration now or in the future in so far as the Government are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decision is quite clear.  They are prepared to accede to a request from the Corporation for a temporary closing of the canal only.  Any Deputy of course is entitled, as is Deputy Lemass, to give expression to his own personal point of view.  I am giving the view and the decision of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether the Government have received any technical advice as to whether it is technically possible to re-open the canal once it is closed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that certain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes; the Government have been assured of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>And that it will continue to be possible to retain water in it?  I understand that if the canal is once closed, there is a technical difficulty in retaining water in it except at very considerable expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The closing will be part of a scheme which Dublin Corporation will submit and unless the Government are fully satisfied that it will give effect to their decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Minister's difficulty in that he is answering for the Minister of Local Government but I want to ask him have the Government considered in regard to this proposal alternative methods of sewage disposal or have we allowed our minds to become dominated by the illusion that the only effective method of disposing of city sewage is to pour it in the river in view of the fact that cities like Birmingham and Coventry or other cities in Britain have no such resources for disposal and yet have effective sewage disposal systems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies, from my own personal knowledge, that both the Minister for Local Government and I have given a great deal of attention to this matter and every aspect of the sewerage situation in Dublin has been thoroughly explored because there is an overwhelming necessity to make more serviced land available in Dublin.  This, as every Deputy knows, is necessary in order to ease the housing situation in Dublin.  Dublin Corporation have under consideration a comprehensive scheme for providing additional sewerage and additional serviced land in Dublin, of which this is only part.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the supplementary which Deputy Dillon has put, is the Minister aware that in 1946 I, as Minister for Local Government, established a committee to consider the question of an alternative means of disposing of sewage and one of the first things the Coalition did was to dissolve that committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I am not in a position to forecast at present the number <Col N="2055" /> and location of swimming pools to be provided in the Dublin city area in the next two years.  Last June, I informed Dublin Corporation that I would be prepared to allocate capital to enable them to commence the building of one or two pools, depending on the price, in the current year.  Subsequently the Corporation decided to proceed with pools at Townsend Street and Crumlin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that Dublin Corporation's scheme for the making of contributions to bodies providing swimming pools contains conditions designed to ensure that where the contribution exceeds one-third of the cost, the pool will be available to the public or to clubs and organisations at appropriate times, subject to the payment of reasonable fees.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Corporation that in a case where such a contribution has been made they are satisfied that the conditions are being observed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the replies to Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 of 25th October, 1967, on the subject of loans for pre-vesting repairs to council cottages.  I may add that the question of making funds available to Donegal County Council for this purpose does not arise.  In accordance with normal practice, the council bear the cost of this work from current revenue rather than by borrowing.  They have not had a loan application for the purpose before my Department for at least seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister for Local Government is aware that there have been repeated requests from Laois County Council for permission to raise a loan to put the council's property in repair?  Is the Minister prepared to reconsider that so that the many applicants for vesting may be able to have their cottages repaired by the council?  Further, is the Minister aware that the extent of the repairs would be a severe burden on the ratepayers and the council thought it was much wiser and more economic to have a loan raised for the purpose of putting all the houses in repair, and vesting could take place with the least possible delay and the question of repairs would be finished for all time?  Would the Minister reconsider this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will convey the Deputy's views to the Minister but I should point out that the cost of repairs to local authority houses is properly <Col N="2057" /> one which should come out of current revenue.  It is up to Laois County Council, like any other council, to keep their property in a state of repair out of current revenue.  It is wrong to spend capital which should be used for the building of new houses on such repairs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Central Redevelopment Area consists of an area of approximately 47 acres bounded by Parnell Street/O'Connell Street/Capel Street and the North Quays, for which the <Col N="2063" /> Corporation's Planning Consultant reported in 1964 on a possible approach to comprehensive redevelopment.  Following a decision by the Corporation to proceed initially with consideration of an area of some 7 acres bounded by Moore Street, Parnell Street, Chapel Lane, and Sampsons Lane, negotiations were opened with an Irish registered company holding properties in the area.  I understand that the city council, at their meeting on 2nd October, 1967, adopted a Report setting out proposed Heads of Agreement with the company for the redevelopment of the area on a partnership basis, as previously approved by the Council.  The basic financial agreement provides for payment to the Corporation of a guaranteed annual ground rent; remuneration of capital invested by the company at an agreed rate and the sharing between the Corporation and the Company of the further proceeds of the scheme.  It is expected that detailed plans for the area will be submitted to the Corporation in about six weeks.</P>
    <P>I have not received any intimation in regard to capital availability for the work and I understand the source will depend on the terms available.</P>
    <P>In regard to consultation, I understand that the Corporation have indicated readiness to have discussions with individual firms, groups, or parties who wished to make their own representations, that numerous meetings and consultations have taken place with interests concerned and that this process is continuing.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for determining and promoting development objectives within their area rests with the Corporation as the planning authority.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to compare directly these results with the results from other European countries as different systems of education, syllabuses and examinations exist in these countries. Some European countries have one syllabus for the non-scientific stream and another syllabus for the scientific stream.  In Sweden, the authorities expect that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of all students in the same age group would follow the new scientific line syllabus in the upper cycle, which would be equivalent to the group taking honours mathematics in this country.</P>
      <P>The number passing with honours in mathematics is low in relation to other subjects as there are many pupils not normally competent to follow the honours course.  These would include the 37 per cent who elect to take elementary mathematics at the intermediate certificate examination.  The profitable study of mathematics calls for an aptitude and an ability that does not apply to the study of some of the other subjects.</P>

      <P>I am well satisfied with the national response to the &ldquo;Buntús Cainte&rdquo; lessons.  All the reports which I have received, and they are very many indeed, indicate that this series of lessons and the television programme related to them have been received with the greatest enthusiasm.  The fact that the lessons are scientifically based and provide adults in a pleasant way with the minimum amount of spoken Irish necessary for everyday conversation are two major reasons for their success. The third is the high degree of goodwill for the language which exists among our people.</P>

The material prescribed in this programme was selected by a committee representative of all the secondary and vocational school associations and of my Department, and its judgment has been widely praised.  As regards the three expressions supplied with the Deputy's question, I am satisfied that only people of very delicate sensibility indeed would object to the third of these expressions and I rely on the good sense of teachers to point out to their pupils that, while the other two expressions form an integral part of the text of what is one of the great short stories of the world, they should not include these expressions in their own vocabulary.</P>

May I ask the Minister if he is serious in saying that the language used in this book is desirable language for children from 12 to 14 years of age and whether he has read the quotations to which I have referred?  Is he aware of one of these quotations on page 194:</P>
      <P>The capitalists pay the priests to tell us about the next world so that you won't notice what the bastards are up to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that this is a proper phrase for children who have not been accustomed to such language in the homes in which they were properly brought up?  Further, has the Minister any comment to make on the sentence: &ldquo;Just as a man makes a home of a bleeding place, some bastard at headquarters thinks you are too cushy&rdquo;? Has the Minister any comment to make on the expression which I consider most objectionable, at page 198: <Col N="2085" />&ldquo;Ah, for Christ's sake&rdquo;?  Then let us turn to page 200 where we see the words &ldquo;poor bugger&rdquo;.  We find on page 200 also and I quote: &ldquo;I don't mind.  Poor bugger, we don't know what is happening to him now&rdquo;. Surely the Minister, as Minister for Education, must have some regard to the language used in text books in our schools?  Is he further aware that many parents object very much to this type of language being used in their own homes?  It might possibly be described as language which is suitable for a low-class toss-school but most certainly it is not suitable language for children brought up in good homes to hear the Holy Name used disrespectfully or the word &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; used from time to time.  I would ask the Minister to have this withdrawn, particularly this story, until the language has been modified to meet the wishes of good parents who do not wish this type of language to be used by their children in school or after school.  I doubt if the Minister has read this.</P>

As I said in my reply, this material was selected by a committee representative of all the secondary and vocational school associations and of my Department and its judgment in other respects has been widely praised.  On that committee, for the information of the Deputy and the House, and for people who might be of the same frame of mind as himself, and I am not being sarcastic, there was Rev.  Father Veale of Gonzaga and Mother Enda of Eccles Street, two very highly respected educationists.  The second of the expressions referred to by the Deputy <Col N="2086" />&ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; and &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; occur separately in this book and are not found in the combination which the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>Last night I paid a well-deserved tribute to the industrial estate at Shannon, an estate which very greatly impressed me.  I expressed my complete approval of the proposals to establish further such estates at Waterford and Galway.  I gave the reasons why I felt the establishment of the estate in the Waterford area was so necessary because of the busy port available there.  When the House rose, I was dealing with the question of the midlands.  If it is the intention of the Government to establish industrial estates in the south at Waterford and in the west at Galway, in addition to the very successful estate at Shannon, the Minister should at the earliest opportunity indicate what proposals he has and what plans are available in his Department for the establishment of an industrial estate in the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are large numbers of unemployed persons in Westmeath, Offaly and Laois.  Due to Government policy, the trend is for people to leave the land.  People have already left it in large numbers and, if by 1970, so many thousands more have deserted the land, naturally this will mean they will have to go into the towns and cities.  I would prefer to see these people encouraged to remain on the land and given a decent standard of living there.  But apparently it is not the Government's policy to settle people on the land with a decent standard <Col N="2090" /> of living.  Therefore, they are obliged to leave the land in search of employment.</P>
    <P>In the midlands we have had an extraordinarily high volume of emigration as well as a large influx of people from the midlands to the cities. The Department of Industry and Commerce should have definite plans to cope with the situation in the midlands. As announcements have been made in regard to the proposed industrial estates to which I have referred, what does the future hold, as far as employment is concerned, for people who cannot remain on the land and cannot seek alternative employment? The only hope of employment is industrial employment.  What type of industrial employment?  Is the Minister taking this serious matter all too lightly?  Is he absolutely satisfied that in the event of Ireland entering the EEC, our industrialists are geared to meet competition from abroad?</P>
    <P>We have seen the results in the case of many industries.  Due to a reduction in tariffs, certain commodities are being dumped into this country, with a serious effect on certain industries and consequential unemployment.  In many instances, competitive articles have been dumped in here, seemingly without any regard for the livelihood of the workers engaged in those industries. What is going to happen in the event of this country becoming a member of the EEC?</P>

      <P>What is going to happen when we have free trade? Are our own industries keyed up?  Will they be able to stand up to that?  I am convinced our industrialists can manufacture an article as good as any manufactured in any part of the world today; but we cannot hope to compete with the vast industrial output of Great Britain and other European countries. I dread to think of what is likely to happen here if our people are not assisted, warned, guided and helped financially and otherwise to prepare for our entry into the EEC.</P>
      <P>It is my opinion that we shall not be admitted to that Community in a hurry.  Nevertheless, if and when Britain is admitted, we are most likely to be admitted at the same time or afterwards.  Is the Minister satisfied that our industrialists are as well prepared and as well equipped as the industrialists of Great Britain are for entry into the EEC?  I do not think so. Can the Minister give us an indication as to what discussions he has had with our leading industrialists, whether he has sought their advice, whether he has asked them: &ldquo;What exactly do you want from the Government to help you to hold your own in the event of our entry into the EEC and in the event of free trade?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Free trade may come gradually over a period of years, but I believe that very few industries will be able to stand up to free trade.  Our textile industry, woollen and worsted goods, can face this competition because those who are engaged in it are putting an article on the market in the United States, Canada and elsewhere which <Col N="2092" /> is, in my opinion and in the opinion of the ordinary purchasers of what we export in the line of textiles, of superior quality to that which can be obtained elsewhere.  Apart from the bacon factories, the woollen and worsted industry and a few other industries, what Irish industries will be able to cope with free trade and with dumping, if we may use the expression, by EEC countries when they have free access to our markets?</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the Minister will say that dumping will be regulated. Naturally enough dumping must be regulated or these businesses will close down overnight.  If dumping is not regulated, it is certain that in practically all our industries, with the exception of those I have mentioned and one or two other industries in which we have established a good market in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, there will be wholesale unemployment.  There will be a catastrophe of unemployment if we expect our industrialists to compete favourably with Great Britain and other countries that can produce articles at a much lesser cost.</P>
    <P>I am afraid to think of what will happen in industry.  Is the Minister satisfied that he and the Government have done their part in equipping our industrialists and our industries for free trade and what we can describe as the unfairness of competition, dumping and the free entry of goods which can come in at lower prices than that at which we can produce them here?  It is all right for the Minister to say that in the event of redundancy, there will be redundancy payments.  What our people want is security and employment, not charity, not benefits.  It is no encouragement for many thousands of industrial workers to know that on the Statute Book there will be a law to enable redundancy payments to be made, while at the same time, their security, their employment and their future may be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is charged with the responsibility of safeguarding our interests, promoting Irish industry, and equipping Irish industry to meet any difficulties that may arise.  He is also <Col N="2093" /> charged with the responsibility of so regulating dumping that it will not interfere with employment.  Where does the worker stand in all this? Where do those people stand who have their money invested in Irish industry and who expect to be paid dividends in return for their investment in Irish industry?  These are difficult questions for the Minister.  We all share his anxiety and realise that any Minister for Industry and Commerce preparing for such an extraordinary change has a very difficult job.  However, that is the job given to him by the Taoiseach, and that is the job in relation to which he must answer the questions of the Opposition, questions of great concern to many thousands engaged in industrial employment here who do not know where they stand.</P>
    <P>Is it not true to say that we have already felt the breeze of free trade, and that the breeze of free trade has resulted in emigration, in short time, in unemployment, and in a certain amount of gloom and desperation in the homes of the workers?  I am not happy in regard to the future of many Irish industries.  I wish them well and I believe in Irish industry, but I wonder have the Government, around the table, considered the serious consequences of our admission to the EEC.  That is the responsibility of the Minister and of the Government in office.  It is the duty of the Opposition to be on the alert, not for the purpose of telling him what to do&mdash;it is his job to know what to do&mdash;but to see that he does it and to see that the livelihoods of thousands of industrial workers are protected.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that should be aired in this House today.  I hope the Minister will not defer his reply until next week.  The matter was raised here by a Deputy last night.  It is rumoured with very great authority that there is a proposal on the Minister's desk awaiting his approval for an increase in the price of bread by 2d per loaf and for an increase in the price of flour.</P>

      <P>Members of the Opposition, particularly older members, are very wary and cagey about undertakings given by Ministers in regard to increases in the price of foodstuffs.  I am old enough to remember that during the lifetime of a Fianna Fáil Government, a solemn undertaking was given prior to a by-election and during a by-election that there would be no increase in the price of foodstuffs with particular reference to bread and flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately after the by-election, the undertaking and promise given by the then Minister were not worth the breath used in giving them.  We hope that we can judge rightly and properly the present Minister for Industry and Commerce as being completely outside the category who would say one thing before a by-election and do something else immediately afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has now assured this <Col N="2096" /> House that there is no proposal before him for an increase in the price of bread and flour, but he cannot tell us what he will do in the event of such application coming before him.  I do not know how these rumours are spread, but I trust the Minister will put the public at ease.  I refer in particular to the poorer sections of the community, widows and orphans, old age pensioners, persons on fixed incomes, pensioners who have little hope of an increase in their incomes, and the vast majority of the middle class who find existence very difficult in view of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister is charged with the responsibility of rejecting or authorising price increases.  He knows that as a result of his actions and the actions of his Government the cost of living has gone completely beyond the reach of our people.  In view of the price of foodstuffs, fuel, clothing and necessary transport, people are finding it impossible to make ends meet on their present incomes.  By putting into effect the policy of his Government, the Minister is recklessly allowing the cost of living to rise without halt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ah, now, please.  Do not overdo your case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to say that prior to the last general election, one of the responsibilities undertaken by Fianna Fáil if elected to office was to keep down the cost of living. We now find that the cost of living has risen to unprecedented heights, with the result that the price of bread and flour and other essential foodstuffs has gone completely beyond the capacity of the poorer sections of the community. The Minister, living in a Fianna Fáil Utopia, has probably come to the conclusion that in this country there are no poor people.  The Minister should realise that there is a vast amount of concealed poverty, that there are people who find it very difficult to procure the necessaries of life. One would expect of a Government who gave undertakings in relation to the cost of living that there would be some form of control of prices of essential foodstuffs.  The prices of flour and bread, and of clothing, have put <Col N="2097" /> them out of the reach of many thousands of our people.</P>
      <P>We must consider the fact that 163,000 fewer people are employed in this country than there were in 1961. So far as those employed in nonagricultural activities are concerned, there is an increase of 12,000 only. That figure is very far from the undertaking given by the then Taoiseach that it was the aim of the young, energetic Government he had to provide 100,000 new jobs.  Is it any harm to ask the Minister what has happened to the proposals in the offices of the Department of Industry and Commerce for the provision of 100,000 new jobs?  The question of the provision of employment certainly has not been given the priority we were led to believe it would get.  Solemn undertakings were given before the last general election and other general elections, when the Government obtained the support of the people, that they were about to embark upon the provision of all these thousands of jobs.</P>
      <P>There is one question I should like to ask the Minister in relation to our exports.  Is he absolutely satisfied that we have provided marketing organisations for the marketing of the goods we have for export?  I am told there is a vast untapped market in Canada and the United States for certain quality Irish goods.  Has the Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, taken steps to see that in every country in which we have an office or an embassy, we use that office or embassy first and foremost as a means of finding new markets for what we have to export? Is the Minister absolutely satisfied that Córas Tráchtála have been and are doing everything they can to find new openings and new markets for certain manufactured goods we have for export?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From certain figures published by Córas Tráchtála, I feel that this body is very costly to the taxpayers, and I wonder is it really yielding sufficient return for the amount of money it costs.  Salaries and allowances amount to £170,710; rent, rates, taxes and office expenses amount to £166,395; market research and design development <Col N="2098" /> amount to £46,397 only.  If we charge a body with finding new markets for what we can produce here, we must be prepared to spend money on finding those markets and getting them, and when we have got them, on guaranteeing that there is a complete continuation of supplies.</P>
    <P>It is not too long since I met a merchant who carries on a very successful business in Jackson Heights in New York.  When he came to this country, he was very impressed by the neat packets of frozen fish manufactured at Killybegs.  He was equally pleased with the products of Clover Meats.  He asked for a consignment of frozen fish and got it.  It was hardly displayed in his store in Jackson Heights until there was a queue of purchasers, and in no time his supplies were exhausted.  He again endeavoured to get supplies but the delay in supplying him was unsatisfactory, and when he was supplied with his second consignment, there was no guarantee that he could be given a third or fourth.</P>
    <P>If we are going to put an article in a store in New York, in Ottawa, Toronto or Montreal, and if there is a general demand in those cities for what we can display there, interest will be completely lost unless the housewife or the purchaser can have continuous and frequent supplies of what she or he wants.  There must be some serious slip-up somewhere in the despatch of what we export.  I was told in New York that the offices of Córas Tráchtála are not as alert as they might be in trying to help the people in the United States who want supplies of one thing or another from this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether that office in New York has received complaints and, if complaints were received in the New York office, were they despatched to him for his observations?  If there are merchants in the United States or Canada who want to get supplies of Irish products, they will write to the head office in New York or Montreal.  They will not write to the Minister in Ireland to make complaints.  I am told that numerous complaints have been made to the office in New York.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> If we were anxious about our exports, and to put good Irish articles on the market either in the United States or Canada, had we not a golden opportunity to participate in Expo 67 in Montreal?  Last year I paid a well-deserved tribute to our display, and to the efficiency which I saw at the Irish Pavilion at the World Fair in New York.  There was a fine display of Irish whiskey.  There was a fine display of all goods exported from this country to the United States.  It was very well done.  There was a very attractive film shown, almost continuously, at the pavilion in an effort to attract tourists here from the United States.  One would have thought, seeing that every other country was having its pavilion on the island in Montreal, in order to boast of and boost their goods throughout the length and breadth of Canada, that we, too, would have availed of the opportunity that offered.  What happened?  We were told it would be too expensive and the Irish Government, at the last moment, having secured a site for a pavilion in Montreal, decided not to go ahead with the project.</P>
    <P>There are various opinions as to whether or not these exhibitions are worth while.  The opportunity of displaying our produce on an occasion like Expo 67 was an opportunity that should not have been missed, in the light of the long-term results likely to flow from the display of our produce, to say nothing of proving to the whole world that Ireland has something to offer for export.  I venture to suggest that anything we put on the export market is as good as can be found anywhere. It was a shortsighted policy not to go ahead with the pavilion at Expo 67 because that would have been a genuine effort on our part to find new markets for the goods we produce.  We should have taken the opportunity of showing the world what we can produce. A golden opportunity was lost. Any money that might have been spent on this display at Montreal would have been money well spent.  It might not have yielded an immediate return but it would most certainly have yielded a financial return in the long term to <Col N="2100" /> our industrialists, manufacturers and workers.  However, the Government, in their wisdom, decided we would not participate.  That was a shortsighted decision.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that there is not a really serious, energetic move on foot to push our goods in countries like the United States, Canada and on the Continent of Europe.  I would like to pay tribute here to Irish distillers who have made an all-out effort to find markets abroad for Irish whiskey. Their efforts have been crowned with a great measure of success.  Undoubtedly the Minister has seen the fine display of Irish whiskey in places in Paris.  I am sure the Taoiseach last week availed himself of the opportunity of seeing the very fine display of Irish whiskey in Copenhagen.  Those engaged in the distilling industry here are obviously up and doing.  I do not know if they succeeded in getting these markets through any Government agency, but the fact is that, no matter what part of the world one visits, there is clear evidence that the promoters of Irish whiskey are doing their part in obtaining markets abroad for their product. I pay tribute to their energy in securing these markets.  If there are new markets available, I trust the Department of Industry and Commerce will lend its hand to ensure that these markets are obtained.  There is, in my opinion, a great future for Irish whiskey in the export market.  I do not know what the demand abroad is like but there is evidence that Irish whiskey is available and evidence to show that the distilling industry is a thriving industry.</P>
    <P>We have been told that a large quantity of imported goods is purchased by Irish consumers.  From the recent figures, we find confectionery, sweets and sugar preparations have been imported to the extent of £161,000; fish, including tinned fish, amounted to £767,000; biscuits, £346,000; frozen vegetables, £140,000; dried and preserved vegetables, £901,000; soups and broths, £866,000; cheese, £80,000.  These are vast amounts of money paid for commodities which could be produced by ourselves, commodities with which we <Col N="2101" /> could supply ourselves.  I cannot understand why we should have to import such a vast amount of fish when we are surrounded by waters containing a bountiful fish harvest.  I cannot understand why a serious effort is not made to organise the fishing industry in such manner as to present the fish-consuming public of this country with as good quality fish as can be imported, thereby cutting down on imports considerably. I do not know if the Minister has gone into these matters seriously.  I hope and trust he has.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce are actively engaged at the present time on providing some type of alternative employment for the people in the Castlecomer area who have lost their employment, due to falling off in the coalmining industry there.  I hope that an effort will be made and that the Department, the Industrial Development Authority and everyone concerned will see that some form of suitable employment is provided for those who have been engaged in coalmining in that area.  It has a great coalmining tradition and the district of Castlecomer, together with the district of Mayo, and Doonane in County Laois where mining has taken place for generations and which most of the miners have now left, others being in receipt of unemployment benefit and others seeking alternative work of a very casual character because they are highly skilled as miners, offers no alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I suggested some time ago on a debate on Industry and Commerce that a board should be charged with the responsibility of looking after the development of our anthracite and coal mines.  I even suggested at the time that Bord na Móna, who have made great strides and have had outstanding successes in the development of our peat resources should be charged with the development of our anthracite and coal mines.  If they were, I wonder whether we would have over a period of, say, five years mining restored.  It is not possible to get private enterprise to invest vast sums of money in mining. The cost of opening a coal seam is very great and when the seams are opened, the investor who has put his money <Col N="2102" /> into such an enterprise may find that the seam is of good quality or otherwise and most of our people are very slow to invest money in the development of our coal and anthracite resources.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the State and the State has a responsibility to develop to the fullest possible extent our mineral resources and it is a great pity that long ago there was not a board set up charged with the responsibility of developing our coal and anthracite resources because in South Laois and North Kilkenny, there is a vast amount of anthracite and coal still there in the seams and not mined for want of capital.  Many times the people of North Kilkenny and South Laois have made requests for Government investment in the development of the Leinster coalfield and no action was taken.  It was considered to be unproductive. At the same time, vast amounts of coal and anthracite are imported while no serious or genuine effort has been made to develop to the fullest extent the anthracite and coal which is available in those areas and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It would be a move in the right direction if the Government saw fit to take the necessary steps to see that some board was given responsibility for the task and voted money by this House for the provision of employment in the Leinster coalfield.  I do not know what the position in Arigna is but we may hear from some of the Deputies representing that area.  I am satisfied that there has been a great failure on the part of the Government to invest, as they have invested in Bord na Móna, in the ESB and in other spheres of activity.  I could never understand why they were not prepared to invest generously in the development of our coal and anthracite sources which I believe are very great in these areas.  Our duty is to provide employment and as a means of providing employment, one must be prepared to spend on development. I hope that the question of spending on these coalmines will be given favourable consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>May I say how disappointed I am by the numbers in employment and the numbers of unemployed in the country <Col N="2103" /> today?  The Government have failed in their task of providing employment. They have shown no lead, displayed no courage, displayed no energy, displayed no commonsense or intelligence in the methods of providing employment for our people.  They just continue, as probably they are doing now as is customary prior to elections, to fill our people with empty hopes and empty promises and always seem to forget that the responsibility of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is the provision of work for our people.  We cannot say that has been achieved.  I am sure most of us, if not all of us, on this side of the House can say that the Government have failed miserably in so far as the provision of fulltime employment for all sections of our people is concerned.  They have not produced plans for the provision of employment for the many hundreds of school-leaving citizens who are faced with emigration and a depressed future because of the Government's failure to plan for the future, to secure jobs and to put people in these jobs so that they may be guaranteed in their own country a decent and a proper standard of living.</P>

      <P>The debate on Industry and Commerce this year is taking place in an unreal atmosphere, I suggest, for a number of reasons.  The first one is the fact that the EEC negotiations have been under discussion inside and outside this House for the past few months and have been highlighted and the effect of any agreement which may be made on the Department of Industry and Commerce would be very great.  The second reason is the document which is before the House now on the proposed accession of the Government of Ireland to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and, the third, that this is the eve of two by-elections.  I do not know which has the greatest effect on the debate but I would suggest that the last one is the one that will affect not alone the tone but the content of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industry and Commerce has been blamed for the failure of the country to make progress in many fields.  While <Col N="2104" /> I am quite sure the Minister and his officials are doing everything they can in their own way to try to improve the position, nobody except a fool would try to deny that we are not alone not making progress but appear to be slipping and slipping pretty badly.  Perhaps one of the greatest causes of our trouble is that when the Free Trade Agreement between this country and Britain was made, the fact that reduced tarffs would vitally affect industry in this country was pointed out by the Labour Party Members to the Government but they did not seem to think it very important.  I ask the Minister or anybody who disagrees with me to go into any shop, particularly a drapery shop or indeed a grocery shop, or any type of shop in this country, and find out whether or not it is true that the display of British-made goods has increased enormously.  I did a slight check myself a few months ago and I was amazed to find in a drapery shop that I was offered four British-made articles and it was only when I specifically pointed out I wanted Irish-made goods that away back on the shelves the Irish-made goods were found.  They were, in my opinion, better than the British produced articles, although they did cost a little more.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of thing we predicted would happen and it appears it did happen.  I do not know whether anything can be done about it at this stage.  I know that if we go into the EEC eventually or even into GATT, it is almost a certainty that there will be a further flow of goods not only from Britain but from other countries into this country.  I do not know what we can do about this.  There was a bit of flurry here during Question Time about whether it was the right time to talk about Rawson's and about whether the right time was not when the Bill was going through the House during the last couple of weeks.  The example of what has happened in Rawson's is one which should be taken notice of by the Government because what has happened there can happen in other places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very old game the Minister is playing.  He would like to say that, of course, it is not free trade that is the cause of the collapse in Rawson's and that it was able to stand up to competition.  Does the Minister know that a group of factories manufacturing shoes in this country attempted to get a toehold in the British market recently?  They will freely admit that they suffered badly since the Free Trade Agreement was introduced.  They approached the Department for the purpose of getting some assistance in order to get a toehold in the British market.  They were told that the law did not allow any assistance to be given to them.  The result was that very little progress seems to have been made, except what they were able to do under their own steam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker referred to the export trade.  This is a typical area where the Department could give very essential assistance for exports but, in fact, they do not appear to have done anything about it.  We have been told by the people employed in the shoe industry&mdash;the Minister can obtain those facts from some of the people on those benches who are more vitally concerned with this than I am&mdash;that because of the Agreement made a few years ago, those people are badly <Col N="2106" /> affected.  The fact is that employment is dropping in this industry.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, quite a number of industries which seem to be standing up pretty well.  They are not doing too badly in the furniture industry: they have found an export market and are making a very good job of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister probably knows, the home of that industry is Navan.  Their factories have been expanding over the past few years, but I am sure the Minister will agree with me that they are not too happy about what the situation is likely to be.  A number of smaller firms are beginning to feel the pinch.  While the big firms are able to pour money into their firms and stand losses until they obtain further markets, the smaller ones are not able to do so.  There is grave doubt about the possibility of some of those factories surviving if conditions get any worse for them.  This is something we would all regret and nobody more than I.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Deputy Flanagan to the Irish whiskey distillers and to the fact that they were getting a toehold in world markets.  My information is not similar to that of Deputy Flanagan. My information is that not only are they not getting a toehold&mdash; perhaps they are selling Irish whiskey in areas in which they were selling it a few years ago&mdash;but very little effort is being made to expand the sale of Irish whiskey.  I would ask the Minister to say whether it is true that most of the whiskey distilled here is sent to Scottish firms who subsequently sell it as Scotch whisky.  Apparently, for various reasons&mdash;tax may be the main one&mdash;the Irish whiskey distillers do not want to expand.  They have a nice cushy income and they are not interested in expanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be interested to know if it is correct&mdash;I was told it is&mdash;that by far the biggest demand for Irish whiskey before it is finally distilled is from the Scottish firms who complete the distillation and sell it as Scotch whisky.  If there is a sale for it under a Scotch brand, surely there should be a sale for it under an Irish brand?  Why <Col N="2107" /> should Irish people not enter into this market?  If there is a market there, it should be obtained.</P>
    <P>An example of what can be done in regard to export markets for industrial goods is Waterford Glass. Waterford Glass have reached the stage where they are a long way behind filling orders.  Encouragement should be given to firms like that who can, in fact, sell a specialised product.  I regret that an effort has not been made to try to build up an export trade for other types of specialised products. Switzerland have done this in a big way.  They are a very small country but they have been able to build up the strongest economy in Europe because of the fact that they are producing something in which they are specialising and are able to get an export market for it.  We do not seem to be terribly interested in this.  It seems to be a case of come-day, go-day, God-send-Sunday.</P>
    <P>A complaint was made by Deputy Flanagan which has been made on a number of occasions already that in relation to Irish products particularly cheese, while a market can be obtained for them in which they would sell well, it is very hard to get a guaranteed continuity of supply.  I do not know whether a board would be the ideal way to deal with this, but when the market is obtained for this type of goods, the supply should be maintained in order to hold on to that market.  It would be too bad if the market were lost because it was found that supplies could not be obtained.</P>
    <P>The import of sugar and flour is one of the natural things we may expect by reason of the position in the EEC countries where both beet and wheat are cheaper than here.  That is one of the things the Irish farmer will have to face up to in the foreseeable future. If we go into the EEC, we will be in the position where it will be difficult to justify the continuance of either wheat or beet growing because we will not be able to compete with farmers in the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there should be necessity to import fruit or vegetables which can be produced <Col N="2108" /> here.  I have perhaps a peculiar view on this because I believe that if our Government went about the question of exports properly, there should be a world market for vegetables which can be grown better here than anywhere else in the world.  The growing and processing of these would give muchneeded employment and the value of that to the Irish economy, and to people who would buy them and who have not the necessary food at the present time, would be immeasurable. We do not seem to worry about that. According to the Minister's figures, we are importing vegetables.  The Minister may say that that is because there is demand for a type of vegetable that cannot be grown here, or for vegetables than can be produced earlier elsewhere. I know that at the present time it is extremely difficult in many of our small towns to get adequate supplies of vegetables.  It is extraordinary that even processed vegetables and fruit cannot be obtained.  It is something the Minister should look into.</P>
    <P>On the question of processed fruit, it is far easier to get it from South Africa, America or Canada, tinned or in jars, than it is to get Irish fruit or vegetables, either fresh or tinned.  This is a situation which should not exist in a country such as ours.  We seem to be throwing away everything that is valuable in this country.  We have the ability to provide food of this kind, but it seems as if we are not interested in doing that and we are prepared to go along, doing nothing at all.  If we can import all those things, what matter about balance of payments or anything else?  That is wrong and the Government should take a definite stand on it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to cheese which we import.  We should not do that.  There are, of course, special brands which some people seem to prefer and an explanation can be given for the importation of a small quantity of those.  We should be able to produce enough cheese here to supply our needs.  An extraordinary thing is that one of the best exports we have is milk powder, which is made in the main from skim milk, after the milk has been used for making butter, and <Col N="2109" /> there seems to be a growing market for that, in the Middle East particularly.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested recently to find that in the Common Market countries, there is an over-production of butter by two per cent and they are turning the milk into milk powder and selling it somewhere else.  It is extraordinary that they are making it from milk and we are making it from the milk gone through the full process. There seems to be something wrong in that and if we have the situation where the only export for our butter will be by turning it into milk powder, we will not bless the day when the EEC is on the horizon.</P>
    <P>We have had queries again and again about what happened to the Potez factory on the Naas road.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know what the situation is.  I am not trying to embarrass the Minister but I want to know what is happening to the industry. We should know.  There should be a Government director on the board, somebody to protect the interests of the taxpayer, of any of those factories for which money is being provided.  In that way we would not have to try to squeeze out of somebody who is not a national of this country information which should be freely available.  There are, in fact, many cases where money has been expended in factories and they have just simply folded up when the spirit moved the person concerned. It has been known on a number of occasions here also that when there is a contraction of trade factories set up by some European countries, or indeed by America, in every case it is the Irish employee who is knocked off and we are in the awful position that we have been subjected to that sort of thing as recently as a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about something which has been very badly misrepresented, and I hope some other members of my Party will deal with it later on.  But for the action of our trade unions we would have more abuse of the workers concerned by those who wanted to get out of business and did not want to meet their commitments.  I am not sure whether the present Minister or his colleague, <Col N="2110" /> the Minister for Labour, is responsible for industries which are being set up here.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions which should be laid down before industrial grants are given is that workers should be entitled, as they are under the Constitution, to be members of a trade union without danger to their employment. This is something which has gone too far.  Employers are coming in and getting State grants out of tax paid by the country, including employees who also pay tax.  When these people look for a decent wage, they will not be employed if they are members of a trade union.  The Minister might look into this because if we continue to have this situation, things will become worse and worse.  The biggest offenders who come in here are Americans.</P>
    <P>The Minister perhaps will be able to give some idea as to what the present situation is in the Shannon Industrial Area.  How many of the original factories are still in operation there? Will the factories which were set up remain or will they remain only for so long as the tax concession applies to them?  Are those who are leaving being replaced and is the potential employment promised, when the factories were being started, in existence?  Have we, in fact, the employment which was promised when the factories were started or have we the same situation as exists in the Potez factory, where hundreds were to be employed and only a few dozen ever saw the inside of the factory.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would give this information, if he has it.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing this Estimate last year.  I referred to the fact that one of the bright things in the industrial future of this country was mining.  I am proud of the fact that I was, in the main, responsible for encouraging certain people to start mining here and that those people have been successful beyond most of our wildest dreams, a fact of which we all should be proud.  The amount of ore being exported at the present time is great, and the volume is growing from month to month.  The only regret is that it has not yet reached a volume <Col N="2111" /> sufficient to set up a smelter here and I understand the big profits in the ore business are in the smelting.  If we could smelt our own ore, we should be getting the vast bulk of the profits instead of having to export the ore to another country which, because it has smelting facilities, reaps great profits.</P>
    <P>We are grateful that this ore is being bought.  Ore is something which can be sold without difficulty, but the sooner the day comes when we can have it smelted in this country the better.  A prediction was made a few years ago, which I mentioned last year, and it is interesting to note that it is coming nearer and nearer to fulfilment. It is that in four or five years, the volume of minerals exported, if we are able to smelt it here, will be as great in value as our present cattle exports. I wonder what will be the position if that happens.  The balance of payments will take a swing in the opposite direction and will that mean we shall get all the things we have been denied?  We have been told the balance of payments is on the wrong side.  It will be interesting to know what will happen in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>One of the other success stories of the country is Bord na Móna, in the employment content.  The volume is difficult to estimate in an industry such as Bord na Móna.  I have heard people complain about the high cost of fuel, particularly of solid fuel versus oil, for generating purposes.  Such people seem to forget that the social element, the element of people obtaining decent livelihoods producing the fuel, has to be considered as has the value of this to the nation.  We are exporting peat briquettes but I understand the volume is not as great as it was some time ago. We have stopped piling the briquettes around the factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might suggest to his colleague in the Department of Transport and Power that more peat briquettes should be produced.  I understand there is quite a stockpile but that exports are not as big as last year.  I should like to know why.  The same applies to moss peat. We had a tremendous market for it a few years ago and I do not know whether it is growing or falling.  I understand the production is still there but that the export volume is not as great as it was.</P>
      <P>I hope you will bear with me for a minute while I refer to something which is proposed in my area, very close to my own doorstep.  I propose to speak about an application for a grant made in respect of a small factory processing mussels.  The Minister and the House are aware that in the Boyne we have quite a substantial mussel industry but because sewerage from Drogheda flows into the Boyne, it is impossible to use the mussels for human consumption without processing. A small factory was set up for the purpose of having them processed locally, and if I tell you that the value of the mussels picked on the spot is only 10/- a cwt.  but exported to Britain or elsewhere where they are processed they are sold at 3/6d for fewer than a dozen in a jar, you will agree it would be a good idea if there was some system of processing them at home.  An effort is being made to do that.  An application is before the Department for a grant and perhaps the Minister might, at his leisure, find out the cause of the delay in dealing with it.  If it is not dealt with quickly, another mussel season will have gone by.</P>
      <P>In the area beside it, it is proposed to erect a fishmeal factory.  I hope it will give the employment so badly needed there.  It will be an industrial product from an agricultural base and I am sure you will agree it is quite in order to deal with it here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to refer to that.  Work seems to have stopped on the site and the Minister might say if it is because there is a delay in dealing with the matter at his level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Work has stopped on the site and the local people are anxious that it should proceed as soon as possible.  If the Minister says it has been cleared by him, I shall have to go after another Minister to discover the cause of the hold up.</P>
      <P>One other matter I should like to refer to was spoken of vaguely by the previous speaker, the general question of employment.  Employment in industry during the past 16 years has shown a very slight increase.  According to figures given in answer to a question yesterday, the increase was of 11,000 and that number was balanced against 162,000 people who had left agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that far more employment must be found in industry if we are to try to keep our population here.  It might not be a bad idea if some efforts were made to try to co-ordinate the work of the various Departments to this end.  It is rather extraordinary to find, in areas where large numbers of people are unemployed, no apparent effort being made to have industries started for the purpose of employing the people.  The Minister is aware that when the EEC started, they had the idea that instead of bringing industry to the people they should bring workers to industry.  There was the comment that there need not be any unemployment in the Common Market because workers could be taken <Col N="2114" /> from one country where there was little employment to another, and it was thought that was the solution to all employment problems.  Now, after a period of trial and error, they see that does not work, that the only solution is to bring industry to where the workers are.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there are so many centres in this country with substantial numbers of workers but with no effort being made by any central organisation to ensure that industries are brought to those areas.  The situation has been bedevilled because certain areas were scheduled as under-developed areas.  In County Meath we are in the position that we are bordering Cavan and Monaghan which are scheduled as underdeveloped areas.  If an industrialist comes along, it might suit him better to start a factory in Meath but because he will get a higher grant across the border in Cavan or Monaghan, he goes the extra 20 miles to those areas.  The production costs might be the same but, in many cases, the cost of transport must be very much greater.  It is unfair that such an advantage should be given to places in central Ireland.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason why we in County Meath should not receive the same treatment as our neighbours. There is an area in North Meath, from a few miles north of Kells, bordering the Cavan-Monaghan border, and, as far as under-development is concerned, I am quite sure it would qualify with any area in Ireland.  If you cross the Border into Cavan or Monaghan, you are in an under-developed area, while, in a worse area in County Meath, you are in what people call a &ldquo;developed area&rdquo;.  It is wrong that county boundaries should be used like that because we are losing out pretty badly.  The Minister might consider this matter. We should like to get some of the few industries that are moving across in there.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude with one comment which Deputy Booth, the Acting Chairman, may say might be expressed more appropriately on another occasion. We have heard many comments about our entry into EEC and its effect on industry.  A group from this Party <Col N="2115" /> went to Brussels last week.  I was in the position that I had already done the Grand Tour and knew most of the answers from the previous time.  They changed possibly a bit, over the years, but I am still convinced that the EEC countries have absolutely no intention of considering this country until after they have decided on Britain.  If we are serious in looking for membership of EEC&mdash;I think the Government are wrong to do so&mdash;we should be well advised to take advantage of whatever kind of offer seemed to have been made by General de Gaulle for an interim arrangement which would allow the entry of at least some of our surplus into EEC countries, pending a final decision.</P>
    <P>It is rather peculiar that the statements of General de Gaulle and the statements made by some of the junior, and some of the fairly senior, officials of EEC with whom we discussed the matter were almost identical.  One thing that struck me as very peculiar was the fact that some of the information which has since been disclosed by the Taoiseach and the Government about our application for entry into EEC was made available to us, but, over the number of years we have been discussing this matter, it was not disclosed until the fact emerged that it had already been disclosed by officials of EEC.  It was then disclosed by the Taoiseach as if it were fresh news that he had just got over the weekend.  I am quite sure he must have known most of it over the number of years he was carrying out negotiations, such as they were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief on this Estimate.  I just want to refer to the utterances of certain Opposition Deputies, particularly in these by-election campaigns at present in progress, who, when any industry in which the Government have invested money, fails, they rub their hands with glee and take great delight in being able to say: &ldquo;There you are: another Fianna Fáil failure&rdquo;.  It seems to me that if we have no starts, we shall certainly have no failures.  Listening to some of the contributions to the by-election campaign, it appears to me that some <Col N="2116" /> members, particularly of the Labour Party, but also of the Fine Gael Party, would be much happier if no starts were made to industries as they might fail eventually.</P>
      <P>We still hear a phrase from the Opposition about 100,000 new jobs.  It is meant to cover all sorts of sins of promises not kept.  What was calculated by Fianna Fáil was that, in order to stop emigration and to bring about a situation of growing population, it would be necessary to create 10,000 new jobs every year for ten years&mdash; 100,000 new jobs.  Since we got the economy back on a firm footing, after the condition in which it was when we inherited it in 1957, and presented our programme and proceeded to try to implement it, some 60,000 new industrial jobs have been found.  Admittedly, this has not absorbed the reduction of employment on the land but every country in Europe is having the very same difficulty that the land is able to support fewer and fewer people.</P>
      <P>I think that what this House needs more than anything else is a good constructive Opposition.  The Labour Party probably present a better basis for such an Opposition than do the present principal Opposition Party.  But any Opposition Party, if it aspires ever to form a Government, must state clearly whether or not they will continue or cut out altogether investment in new industries, new experiments in industry, re-adaptation grants to prepare for greater competition.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>More than likely, these new industrial jobs would not have been created at all, but for Government investment. It is regrettable that some industries were not successful but, as I have said, if we did not make the effort, if we did not take the occasional risk, no new enterprise whatsoever would start. The attitude adopted by certain Members of the Opposition will, to my mind, shake the confidence of potential investors in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, whereas the attempt to decentralise industry is admirable, it cannot possibly be as successful as the present policy of growth areas.  It is a pity we did not realise a little sooner that an industrialist wants a few things <Col N="2117" /> when he is setting up.  He wants availability of labour and he wants easy access to the ports.  When you set up a single industry in a small town, then, if the industry expands, the availability of labour becomes a difficult problem. The industry may find itself employing small farmers who, at certain periods of the year, do not wish to turn up to work because they have crops to save. All sorts of difficulties can present themselves in this situation, whereas, if the industries are based adjacent to a large town, not only is labour available but labour can move from one industry to another during peak and valley periods.</P>
    <P>If certain Members of the Opposition hear of an industry, in which the Government have invested money, running into difficulties, I appeal to them not to run around the lobbies here chuckling with glee in the hope that the industry will collapse.  I have seen that attitude here before and it does nothing but sicken me.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Lemass will remain for a moment because it is useful that young Members of the Dáil should have their memories refreshed. He spoke with feeling of the situation obtaining in 1957; he spoke with apprehension lest Members of the Opposition should fail in their sympathy for industrial development.  The Deputy ought really make his own quiet inquiry as to who passed through this House the Industrial Grants Act under which all industrial grants have since been made. He will find that it was the late Deputy Bill Norton, the Lord have mercy on him, as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Who provided the exemption from income tax and corporation tax on increased exports by new industries or existing industries?  I think he will find it was Deputy Gerard Sweetman in the Finance Act of 1956. Who established the Industrial Development Authority?  I think he will find that it was the inter-Party Government and his own father, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce committed himself in my presence from these benches to abolish the Industrial Development Authority the first chance he got.  But he learned since; he never did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> The Minister will agree with me that the Industrial Development Authority has done great work in the promotion of industrial development.  People, particularly the up and coming generation of public men, are liable to forget. I heard Deputy Seán Lemass pledging himself solemnly on these benches to abolish the Industrial Development Authority and he warned anyone who contemplated accepting employment as a member of the Board not to do so because he would be out of a job as soon as he got back into power.  Actually, one man who accepted the position of member of the Industrial Development Authority withdrew under that threat.  Lastly, I think it is important to remember that it is a great pity to deceive succeeding generations of men in public life.  It is important to remember that after the remedial measures we took in the autumn of 1956, we were able to put this country in the position that it had a credit on its balance of payments of £12 million in the year 1957 which provided the firmest position any country in Europe had for an expansion guaranteed against the possibility of balance of payments problems bringing its progress to a stop.</P>
    <P>I put those facts on record because there is a lesson to be learned from them.  If we make comparisons between one period and another for the purpose of learning lessons, we are not wasting our time.  I put these facts on record also because I can remember quite distinctly the great work done by the late Deputy Bill Norton in an effort to mould industry in this country.  I remember his travels abroad and the derision with which those travels abroad were spoken of by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, that he went to New York and the Continent of Europe trying to persuade industrialists to come in and set up new industries.  It is important to remember that if there is any apprehension in the minds of potential industrialists coming to Ireland, they should all know that far from there being any cleavage of opinion here as to the desirability of such entrance, we are all of one mind that if their purpose is to come in and establish new industries, to provide <Col N="2119" /> employment at decent rates of wages, and generally export, whether they come from Britain, the United States of America, Germany, France or elsewhere, they are heartily welcome and there are valuable inducements to make it worth their while to establish their plants in one part of Ireland or another.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking yesterday on the Redundancy Bill, I made a suggestion to the Minister for Labour.  There was a Division on the question of strikes and the number of days on which a man might be on strike being deducted from his total employment period for the purpose of estimating his redundancy payments in the event of his subsequent redundancy in the industry in which he works.  I suggested to the Minister for Labour that we should accept the principle, provided we made the distinction between a strike sponsored by a responsible trade union and an unofficial strike.  I do not think it matters very much in the context in which I was speaking last night.  We were all agreed about that in terms of consequences for the working man because we were talking of days or weeks on strike in a context where redundancy compensation was estimated in terms of a six-months period.</P>
    <P>I suggest both to the Trade Union Congress and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the more we in this House and the more employers' organisations and the trade unions combine to say: &ldquo;We stand firm on the principle of the right of men to organise in trade unions.  We believe the trade unions are a useful element in a democratic society and we do not question the right of a responsible trade union to call their men out on strike if they deem that to be their last resort and in the best interest of the men they represent, but we distinguish between that and the unofficial strike which we believe strikes at the basis of a sound trade union movement which we regard as an indispensable part of a satisfactory industrial organisation,&rdquo; the more often we could distinguish between official and unofficial <Col N="2120" /> strikes.  By recognising the fundamental distinction between them, the more it will strengthen the hands of responsible trade union leaders to see that the unofficial strike, which can pose very great problems for the whole policy of industrial development in this country or any other country, could be brought under control or at least brought under pressure so that it would ultimately disappear, leaving available to the trade union movement their fundamental, constitutional right to strike, if and when in the judgment of the trade union it was in the best interests of their men to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, and I do not think I am being at all unreasonable, what is happening to the Potez factory?  That matter has been raised in this House repeatedly over the past two years and on several occasions the Minister and his predecessor said: &ldquo;Do not press me; we are trying to work the thing out and something may yet transpire,&rdquo; and on every occasion the House has shown very commendable forebearance.  It is now nearly 12 months since the Minister's predecessor said in this House that he hoped at a very early date to be in a position to make a comprehensive statement and to give us full information as to what the prospects of the Potez factory were. Since then, this monument remains standing on the side of the road leading out of the city of Dublin.  It has become a kind of mystery establishment, and no one knows what is going to happen.  I do not at all subscribe to the view that if you are trying to promote industry, you must expect there will be no failures.  You are bound to have failures.  If you have no failures, you can have no starts and no successes. But it is bad from every point of view to leave a large question mark in the minds of the public in regard to so significant an investment as the Potez enterprise represents.  I do not believe it can be in the interest of the industry itself to leave the question of its continued existence and its future development as ambiguous as undoubtedly it at present is.</P>
    <P>There are certain other things I should like to ask the Minister.  I read the booklet he or the Minister for Finance <Col N="2121" /> circulated about GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  I have consulted a number of reasonably well-informed persons about GATT.  I am obliged to confess to the House that, the more I have studied the question of GATT, the more it has borne in on me that it means nothing at all.  What does it involve this country in?  The booklet assures us that, so far as the imposition on us of the obligation to give most favoured nation treatment to other countries is concerned, it practically does not impinge on us at all, that our Trade Agreement with Great Britain lifts us out of a large part of that obligation. Why are we going to join GATT?  I am usually in a position to make up my mind pro or con and to say whether we ought or ought not do something, but I am in the extraordinary position in regard to GATT that I simply do not know what effect it is going to have at all.  I cannot find anybody who will tell me.</P>
    <P>A very large number of countries belong to GATT.  As far as I can find out, most of them spend their time assiduously avoiding the alleged obligations of membership.  The most remarkable feature of GATT is the success with which practically all the members ignore the obligations.  I think it is one of these United Nations monsters created ten or 15 years ago. It is now simply rolling along by its own momentum, doing nothing, getting nowhere.  But, having managed to establish a large bureaucracy of its own it will never be suffered to die.  We have got along very well for the past 20 years without ever joining it.  Could the Minister tell us when he is concluding what benefits will we derive from joining and what evil will we avoid by ceasing to be outside GATT?</P>
    <P>There has grown out of the United Nations in particular, and some other international bodies, too, a series of organisations whose usefulness has long ceased to exist&mdash;if they ever had any &mdash;but who under Parkinson's Law have acquired a larger and larger bureaucracy operating to make these institutions work until you ultimately reach a stage at which the institution <Col N="2122" /> is doing nothing at all except providing masses of paper which the bureaucracy fill up, distribute and duplicate <i>ad infinitum</i>.  I suspect that GATT is one of these.  I should like to know from the Minister how far I am wrong&mdash;if I am wrong&mdash;and, if I am right, why the Minister has chosen this moment to recommend the House to approve our adherence to this body.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word on unemployment. It is true that Deputy Lemass, then Taoiseach, said in 1957 when his Government took office, that they wished their failure or success to be judged by the criterion of the number of people employed in this country.  It is true that ten years after that test was prescribed by the then head of the Fianna Fáil Government, there are 163,000 fewer people are employed in the country than there were when he made that statement.  They have an infinity of alibis for that.  But remember, there is such a thing as the crisis of credibility.  If a gap begins to open between the ordinary people and the Government of the country&mdash;no matter what Party constitutes it&mdash;in the sphere of credibility, it is bad for democracy, bad for ordered government and bad for settled institutions.  If the people begin to doubt the good faith of their governors, it is a very serious menace to free institutions and their firm foundations.</P>
    <P>There is another feature of the unemployment figures I am at a loss to understand.  There has been a change in the way in which they are estimated as a result of a change in the way in which the register was maintained since 7th January, 1966.  But that change in the system of maintaining the register does not apply in so far as the number of persons entitled to unemployment benefit claims is concerned.  It does not affect the figure in so far as the entitlement of persons entitled to unemployment assistance is concerned.  But 12 months ago, on the last figures I have available to me, on 28th October, 1966, there were 27,547 persons with unemployment benefit claims current; on 27th October, 1967, there were 28,693 persons with unemployment benefit claims current.  When you consider the immense outlay in Government expenditure <Col N="2123" /> and all the other considerations that have to be borne in mind, it is hard to understand why there should be more persons who are normally engaged in industrial employment out of work today and looking for work than there were 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce an explanation of those figures relating to unemployment benefit claims.  I know the alibi about the decrease in the total number of persons employed, with more people leaving agriculture than had been anticipated and no alternative employment for them. I am not talking about that; I am talking about the actual increase in the claims for unemployment benefit, and I have yet to hear any satisfactory explanation from the Government about it.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance today for certain statistics.  I want the House to listen to these because they are perhaps the most menacing statistics that exist for those who understand them, and the tragic thing is that very few people do understand them.  I asked the Minister to tell me the amount of Government annual expenditure as a percentage of gross national product in each financial year from 1956-57 to 1966-67, inclusive.  I do not know, but there must be some Deputies who follow these matters with interest.  If they do, they will have read the lectures given under the endowment to commemorate Per Jacobson.  The lectures I refer to were given by Mr. Roosa. He also read a statement by Mr. O'Brien, the chairman of the Bank of England at the Guildhall dinner recently in which he said, in effect: Bear this in mind: no matter what you do or what <i>ad hoc</i> remedies you provide, if taxation and government expenditure continue to increase at a pace greater than the gross national product expands, you are going to have inflation; you are going to have recurring balance of payments problems, and you are ultimately (in substance) going to go bust.</P>
    <P>I ask you to consider these figures. <Col N="2124" /> It is quite true we were having a stormy time in 1956-57.  We spent money on a heroic scale building sanatoria and houses.  I do not deny that in order to achieve the position of having more houses than we had tenants to put into them, we did run outrageously into the red, and we took remedial measures.  At that time Government expenditure as a percentage of gross national product was at 22.1 per cent, and we felt that constituted a serious danger of balance of payments problems, with consequent unemployment and all the kinds of dislocation we have experienced during the past couple of years.  Therefore we proceeded to put on restraints and by 1958-59 Government expenditure as a percentage of gross national product had fallen to 21 per cent and by 1959-60 had fallen to 20 per cent. In 1960-61, it remained at 20 per cent; in 1961-62, it went to 21 per cent; and in 1962-63, it went up to 21.6 per cent. Then in 1963-64, it really began to move: it went up to 23.3 per cent; in 1964-65, it went up to 23.4 per cent. The Government then proceeded to impose far harsher restrictions than we had employed in 1956, but the same pattern did not emerge, because contemporaneously with virtually strangling private credit, when it is true to say that in one year, 1964-65, all the available newly-created credit was taken over by the Government and none became available to private enterprise at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes: I said new credit.  The whole thing was scooped up by the Government.  Severe restrictions were imposed, but the Government expenditure as a percentage of gross national product increased from 23.4 to 24.4 per cent, and in the following year, 1956-57, the last year for which figures are available, the Government expenditure as a percentage of gross national product is 25.5 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not mind that, and I would not mind capital coming into the country for the establishment of new industry, but the Minister knows as well as I do that a great deal of the foreign capital coming into the country is coming in to buy out Irish-operated industry, and a very large section of the entire distributive trade in this country is in the process of being sold out now to foreign combines.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is exaggerated. However, to the extent that any money of that nature is coming in, it must only be of very marginal significance in our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that between £20 million and £30 million has been coming in here in the past 12 months in foreign investment.  It is being invested partly in erecting huge office blocks and new buildings and absorbing the potential of the building industry which I think ought to be directed more to providing houses for people who need them.  But it is utterly tragic if the Minister is himself deceived and says that even though the amount of Government aggregate expenditure represents 25.5 of the gross national product, we have no balance of payments problem and therefore we need not worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No; what I am saying is that the theory that was being advanced by the Deputy does not stand up to examination in practice because the increase in the percentages which the Deputy was quoting is now shown to coincide with the situation where we do not have a balance of payments problem, whereas his thesis was that if this figure went too high, it created a balance of payments problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided you did not allow a situation to develop that a country like ours which for seven centuries <Col N="2126" /> spent blood, sweat and tears fighting to make itself free was going to submit in three years to conquest by a cheque book that fire and sword had never succeeded in achieving in the past.  What is the difference between being governed from abroad or being owned from abroad?  What was all the hullabaloo about for the past seven centuries?  Was it not for the right to run our own country?  If we are simply becoming agents to run the country for foreign finance, what has all the fuss been about?</P>
      <P>As far as I can find out, if poor old Strongbow had known the technique of the cheque book, he need not have built castles here at all.  If James I or Queen Elizabeth had come in with a long enough sock, they could have bought us instead of ineffectually trying to burn us out, to slaughter us out, to wipe us out.  We had to wait for 1967 for the enterprising conqueror of the modern age to arrive with protestations of love and affection and an abundant cheque book and to say: &ldquo;All this business of fire and sword for the last seven centuries was a complete mistake and let us forget all about it. Now how much?  We want to take over one-quarter of you.  Name your figure and we will give you your cheque&rdquo;, and our own Minister for Industry and Commerce says: &ldquo;Glory alleluia.  The whole operation of the inflexible laws of economics are suspended. We are spending money like water and there is no balance of payments problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, there is no balance of payments problem.  It is just like a drunken tramp whose house has fallen down around him and who gathers up the last few sticks of furniture and the last few rags that he has and goes down to the pawnshop and pops them and then turns up at the pub and says: &ldquo;Who says I am down and out?  The drinks are on me&rdquo;, and someone comes up and says to him: &ldquo;What is going to happen tomorrow?  You will have to go to the workhouse.  You have no clothes, no furniture; the roof has fallen in on the house&rdquo;, and he says: &ldquo;To hell with that.  The fact is, I have the dough.  The drinks are on me. Come on, boys.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> I am not going to see the ultimate end of this, thanks be to God.  I would not like to be in a country that was owned lock, stock and barrel by any foreigners.  The ordinary evolution of time is going to deliver me from that experience.  But it is time that those who are in the process of presiding over this general sell-out should ask themselves: is it in the best interests of stable institutions in this country and of keeping this country free?</P>
    <P>Mind you, it did not work in Cuba. Cuba was a free country&mdash;and let us not forget that.  Batista sold his country out to the least desirable elements in the United States of America and Castro came down from the hills with a very few men who said: &ldquo;Anything is preferable to this.  We are going to have the whole country turned into a brothel, with flashing lights, loads of money, a most favourable balance of payments and soaring standards of living.  We would sooner be poor,&rdquo; and Cuba, the rich, are the serfs of another society.  The end of that has been the establishment in Cuba of a particulaly horrible form of dictatorship.  There is no need for me to go into the evolution of that tragedy.  That is not the only country that has had the experience of being deceived into the belief that if the ordinary laws of economics do not appear to be operating, there is probably some good explanation for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, indeed, the Minister for Labour, who is here now, are men for whom I have a considerable measure of respect.  They do not come of the kind of background where I could imagine that they would be indifferent to such a development and I suspect that in the back of their own minds, they often ask themselves: are we travelling this road?  I think they are persuading themselves or suffering themselves to be persuaded that there is no real evil in prospect, that it is just all working out according to plan.  I think they are wrong but I admit freely that it depends on what standard of values you have.  If we have made up our minds that we would like to be a sort of Batista's Cuba, then I <Col N="2128" /> think probably we are travelling the right road, that is, to sell out the whole country for cash and glory in the fact that we have a favourable balance of payments, no matter how much we spend.</P>
    <P>I think it is also true to say, and appropriate and necessary to say, that if we value independence, freedom and sovereignty, we have to make up our minds that we are not going to enjoy in Ireland the standard of living measured in terms of money available to industrial workers in Cleveland, New York, San Francisco, Texas or, indeed, possibly London or Birmingham.  We have got to make that choice, and if we determine now that without that kind of standard of living we are not prepared to go on, then the sensible thing to do would be to re-enact the Act of Union, if we could persuade the British to do likewise, and to re-enter the Union and live on the charity of the British people.  I do not want to do that. I would far sooner accept whatever standard of living our own country will give us and remain free, sovereign and independent.  I do not think the people who fought to make this country just that were wrong; I think they were right but I doubt very much if some people appreciate the road we are travelling and its inevitable end.</P>
    <P>I want to differentiate most explicitly between the kind of investment coming in here for the purpose of taking over virtually all sources of production and distribution, all means of earning profits, and an entirely different form of investment like the Tynagh mines, where foreign capital was brought in and what was a relatively low-producing soil turned into a profitable exporting mine.</P>
    <P>I want to distinguish most emphatically between the kind of foreign capital coming into the country which purchases our existing sources of profit and capital that comes in to establish a new factory manufacturing something we have manufactured here before and giving us the marketing techniques of the parent factory in the United States or Britain with the employment and exports that generates.  That kind of investment is very welcome and we have all been trying to promote it for <Col N="2129" /> years.  That kind of investment should not be confounded with the other.  That is a danger I see existing at the present time.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has gone up approximately three per cent per annum, or a little more, over the past ten years.  Many people marvel at the economic miracle of the United States of America and many people ask themselves what is the explanation.  You are deemed to be a poor man, to be living below poverty level in the United States today, if you have less than £1,000 a year&mdash;not 1,000 dollars a year, but if you have less than £1,000 a year, you are deemed to be living below poverty level.  When we read about Senator Robert Kennedy or someone like that talking about the 30 million poor in the United States today, he is including everyone who has less than £1,000 a year.  That gives one the key to the fantastic tornado of prosperity that swirls around this astonishing nation.  What is the key to this extraordinary economic miracle? It is that while people's incomes have expanded in this fantastic way&mdash; and it is mostly the incomes of the working men&mdash;the cost of living has gone up by less than one per cent per annum over the past ten years.  The whole foundation of their successful expansion and the raising of the standard of living of every one in the whole country has been the fact that the cost of living has been maintained virtually stable.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance recently came back from South America and that trip did him good.  He saw for himself what inflation run wild means to the standard of living of the masses of the people.  That is a lesson he will probably never forget, and at his time of life, it is peculiarly appropriate that he should learn it.  So long as we allow the cost of living to escalate steadily and inevitably year after year, we may as well face the fact that we will drift from economic crisis to economic crisis, as evidenced by this column of the OECD survey of Ireland recently published in which the following pregnant phrase occurs: &ldquo;Prices and costs have continued <Col N="2130" /> rising even although pressure of demand has been low.&rdquo;  If that does not spell out a warning to the Government of the day nothing else will.</P>
    <P>The next step is the impact, of which Deputy Tully was speaking, of the increased competition consequent on the reduction of tariffs and the abolition of quotas on our approach to the EEC, however long delayed that may be.  As our costs rise, our ability to live in that new world becomes less and less, and by the time that problem confronts us, we will discover that we have sold all the furniture and all the clothes, and there will be nothing more to sell to create the illusion, the euphoric illusion, under which the Minister lives, that although our annual Government expenditure now represents 25.5 of our gross national product, we have no remarkable deficit in our balance of payments.  When there is nothing left to sell, we will meet the full impact and as an inevitable consequence of that trend, this country will find itself with a very harsh choice to make between enduring freedom or economic subjugation of a kind more detestable than ever envisaged by Queen Elizabeth or King James.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Labour would he be kind enough to communicate this specific inquiry to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It gets a bit confusing when the Minister for Education starts talking about industry and commerce, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce starts talking about education, and when a Minister of one Department begins talking about an entirely different Department, particularly when the pronouncement is followed by a Delphic silence on the part of the head of the Government, the Taoiseach and the responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>I read a speech made by Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Education, within the past fortnight in which he announced a magnificent new departure. The Government were going to establish a free trade area, extending from the Shannon free trading estate to include Ennis and Limerick.  That created a sensation and we all waited with bated breath for the Minister for <Col N="2131" /> Industry and Commerce or the Taoiseach to take the wheel and tell us the details of this glorious plan.  I said to myself: &ldquo;Well, I suppose the Minister for Industry and Commerce is awaiting the introduction of his Estimate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Malley was a little offhand in announcing a Cabinet secret before he was authorised to do so, but being a mercurial type of man, his enthusiasm got the best of him. The Taoiseach is being prudently silent and the Minister for Industry and Commerce can speak with authority&rdquo;.  Not a whisper from that day to this.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister what did Deputy O'Malley mean when he announced the establishment of a new free trade area extending from Ennis through Limerick to the Shannon trading estate.  Was he being dotty? Was he being premature in announcing a Government decision or was he superseding the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Are we to understand hereafter that in matters relating to trade, we are to listen to Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Education, and regard the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a mild inoffensive puppet, the strings of which are controlled by the whizz kids in Government, who are hereafter to be known as Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Education, Deputy Haughey, Minister for Finance, and&mdash;I do not quite know who the third whizz kid ought to be. I have got mixed up.</P>
    <P>But what is the position?  I do not know.  The country does not know. Remember, the more often that situation arises, the situation in which Ministers make statements in public which the public do not understand, the more frequently the credibility gap will widen.  I was speaking last night&mdash;a thing I do not often do now, and intend to do less hereafter&mdash;to a group of university students and the thing that shocked me most was finding that the current theme is: &ldquo;We do not believe politicians any more.&rdquo; That is a horrible manifestation of the credibility gap, the accepted belief amongst some of these young people <Col N="2132" /> that to be in public life, you have to be dishonest.  Some of the best amongst them say that nobody takes any interest in politics between elections because &ldquo;You could not believe the Gospel out of their mouths&rdquo;.  That was the burden of their complaint: you could not believe the Gospel out of their mouths.</P>
    <P>That is not a problem unique to this country.  In the United States of America, owing largely to skilful communist propaganda, the credibility gap grows ever wider.  President Johnson is represented as saying things to the people which are not true.  I believe that is a vicious communist conspiracy to strike at the very foundations of free government.  I believe the American people are being told the truth by their rulers, in so far as it is possible to tell them the truth; but they have been persuaded that they ought to expect their governors to be not only truthful men but prophets to boot.  Nobody can ask a public man to be a prophet but one can demand that he speaks the truth.  I want to know was Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Education, speaking the truth when he announced the free trade area to include Limerick, and Ennis and the Shannon Estate.  Was Deputy Colley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking the truth when, by his silence in introducing this Vote, he has substantially repudiated the statement made by the Minister for Education?</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to two other matters.  Whether we like it or not, cybernetics are going to dominate the world in the foreseeable future.  It is no use pretending that the word &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo; is incomprehensible to anyone in this day and age.  It should be a word present to the mind of every Labour representative because it profoundly affects the first people whom the trade unionist should be concerned to protect.  I refer to the unskilled workers.  Unskilled workers will be unemployed ten years hence.  But it will not only affect unskilled workers.  I venture to suggest to this House that 80 per cent of what young accountants are being taught at the moment will cease to have any relevance to their employment in ten years time; 80 per <Col N="2133" /> cent of what our young accountants are being taught to do now will be done by machines and computers.  It is the control of automation that will count.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one feels like the voice of one crying in the wilderness.  People say: &ldquo;Here you are, addressing one, two, three, four, five, six, seven Deputies.  What the hell is the use of talking?&rdquo; The answer is that I have been doing it all my life and the things one says produce some effect after some time.  This is the third time I have spoken of cybernetics in this House, and now people are beginning to think about them, in relation to their impact upon us and upon our people.</P>
    <P>Cybernetics in the industrial sphere will be indissolubly associated with large units and large markets&mdash;I repeat, large units and large markets.  We have got to face the fact that whether we become part of the European Economic Community or whether the future requires us to become part of a great Atlantic community, looking west rather than in the direction of Europe, irrespective of whichever unit to which we ultimately belong, we will be on its fringe.</P>
    <P>It is of the very essence of a mass production industry that it should be in the centre or close to the point of maximum consumption.  If cybernetics are going to dominate industry in the future, it means large units of industry and the future of this country in that context is virtually nil.  The transport problems from this island to the points of maximum consumption make the possibility of the establishment of a mass industry here virtually nonexistent. Deputy Oliver Flanagan said an interesting thing.  He referred to Waterford Glass.  I remember well when Waterford Glass was established.  It was while we were in office.  I remember the concern about the establishment of Waterford Glass.  It seemed almost too good to be true that an ancient craft of this kind could be successfully established. But there was this phenomenal man, Joe McGrath, Lord have mercy on him, this strange man of genius for development and fantastic courage.  One had the feeling that if Joe McGrath <Col N="2134" /> believed in Waterford Glass, then he ought to get all the help and support he could.  That was the view we took.  He was right and we were right.  I watched last night the Memorial Service in Westminster Abbey for the late Clement Atlee.  I wonder did those who watched with me contemplate the great chandeliers hanging from the roof of Westminster and remember that all these were manufactured of Waterford glass and realise that here was something that could be manufactured in Waterford that could not, in my belief, be manufactured anywhere else on earth&mdash;not in Venice, not in Sweden, not even in Great Britain.  Here, in one of the great cathedrals of the world, were these massive chandeliers, acting as a decoration in one of the most venerable structures on the known earth.  I am told that, because of the excellence and unique quality of the product, the order book for Waterford glass is full for some years ahead and now you wait to get your requirements, not through any lack of enterprise in the proprietors but because the training of the skilled operatives who produce the end product took such time that there is a certain limit to the rate at which expansion can be achieved while maintaining the standards of quality for which they have acquired their unique reputation.  Here is the future of Irish industry.  Unless we get involved in this country in industry based on excellence and technical skill, we have no industrial future at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said that the Swiss have achieved their unique, their extraordinary position of a fantastically high standard of living as a result of the development of a certain industry. I imagine he was referring to watchmaking and work associated with it.  I do not think that is altogether true.  I think the Swiss have the reputation of being bankers of every hog, dog and devil in the world and they are not too choosy where the money comes from.</P>

      <P>In this corrupt world, money dealing seems to be the most profitable occupation in which anyone <Col N="2135" /> can engage.  Honest work as compared with money-changing is drudgery but I think one of the probable excrescences on a free society is the fact that the money-changer skims off a good deal of the cream, but so long as we have enough cream to provide ourselves with a better standard of living, I am prepared to tolerate money-changing.  I think, however, the Swiss go in for it a bit too much and are a bit too free with the kind of money they handle. However, it is true, as Deputy Tully said, that an immense contribution is made to the prosperity of the Swiss people, not by mass production but by skilled industry and the very quintessence of highly-skilled industry in relatively small units.  It is quite astonishing the number of old established watchmaking families that exist in Switzerland, all in relatively small units and scattered over practically the whole country.  You have the parallel of an equally prosperous phenomenon if you go into the Rhineland and into Bavaria.  There is the Schwartwald and the Vosges district of France, you find these small units of industry based on the raw material of the forest country where the villages exist.</P>
      <P>If there is one thing in this country that we need, it is a multiplication of small industries associated with country towns.  I think one of the great tragedies of modern life has been the mobility of labour in the EEC.  Deputy Tully said that they found it did not work.  To my mind, it worked too well.  I think one of the awful tragedies, when travelling through the industrial complex of Germany was to find multitudes of unfortunate southern Italians&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of Turks, of Greeks, of Spaniards, torn from their ordinary surroundings where they came from poverty in the sun, toppled into affluence in the detestable urban barracks which were erected to accommodate the vast industrial expansion of the Ruhr and southern Germany.  It was that mobility that shocked me and <Col N="2136" /> I remember thinking: &ldquo;Wait till there is an economic check here in Germany. What will become of these unfortunate people.&rdquo;  They have all been shovelled back like cattle to the countries whence they came.</P>
      <P>However, do not let us confound that problem with mobility of labour in our own country.  I make no apology at all for asking a fellow who was born in Ballinasloe to go and work in Ballina. We must not stabilise the whole population and say: &ldquo;You cannot move out of your own area without being guilty of some treason to the nation.&rdquo;  There is no parallel between that and free mobility of labour in our own country. However, do we want to urbanise the whole population?  I think one of the great dangers that confronts us is the urbanisation of the population and not us only but every country in the world.</P>
      <P>When I went to work in America 40 years ago, 40 per cent of the population lived in the cities and 60 per cent on the land.  Today 88 per cent of the population live in the cities and 12 per cent live on the land.  In the United States, they are reaching a stage at which they cannot get even water to drink, never mind to wash their many cars in some of the larger conurbations. I was in New York during the past 15 years and there was a water shortage, and if you go out to the west coast, California, you will find a number of places which would have to be abandoned if there were not an early prospect, as there is, of being able to desalinise the Pacific Ocean and pour it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we want to see that kind of development here, in which the whole population will be concentrated in Dublin, Cork and a few urban centres? I think it would be a catastrophe and I think I am being farsighted.  I can well understand some of the young fellows saying: &ldquo;He is only an old fogey; he wants everything to be the way it always was.&rdquo;  I visited and lived in the conditions resulting from urbanisation of a great population such as the population of the United States of America.  I saw the States of North and South Dakota emptied of population and that population poured into <Col N="2137" /> Chicago, Detroit, San Francisco and Los Angeles and the megalopolis that stretches now from Boston to Washington. I saw the problems that resulted and I ask myself: do we want to reproduce that situation here?  I think we do not and I think it has not reached a stage yet that we cannot control the situation.  The situation has acquired a kind of momentum both in America and in Britain where it is extremely difficult to control but here it has not reached that stage.  However, we ought to ask ourselves whether, while we still have time, we ought not to make a very urgent effort to prevent its happening here.</P>
    <P>The way to prevent its happening here is, it seems to me, to see whether we could not stimulate still more the establishment of relatively small units of industry located round existing country towns.  I would far sooner see in any country town about which I was concerned four or five factories each employing 20 to 30 men than to see one factory employing 200.  I would feel a far greater sense of security and a far greater sense of probable endurance of industrial employment in that area than I could associate with one large factory which might go Rawson's way any moment the board of directors made up their minds that it was economically expedient to cut their losses and clear out.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this: I understand there is a proposal now to permit Ceimicí Teoranta to export spirits manufactured from potatoes under the generic description of Irish spirits.  I want to warn the Minister for Industry and Commerce most solemnly against the danger of this development. If we permit the export of industrial spirits, spirits produced from corn starch as Irish distilled spirits, it will find its way into the market supplied by Irish whiskey or Irish gin manufactured under the conditions obtaining in our Irish distilleries and it will be confused with the reputation of those commodities which stand high in the international markets of the world in so far as they are trading in those markets.</P>
    <P>I know this from experience and it <Col N="2138" /> is well I should tell the House my experience in regard to this matter.  I remember coming in for savage criticism when I was Minister for Agriculture because there was a firm in Clonmel who were slaughtering horses and they came to me and asked me to authorise the export of tinned horse.  I said: &ldquo;What do you want to export tinned horse for.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;It is for animal food.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;That is quite all right.  I understand now, but how are we going to be sure that when we export it for animal food the people who buy it abroad will not perpetrate some fraud on their customers and simply describe it as canned Irish meat, because it would come within that description?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;That could not happen.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I am sorry but I could not risk that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that time we exported a great deal of corned beef, both to America and the continent of Europe.  In fact, I think it was true to say that a large percentage of the refugee camps in Europe were being supplied with Irish beef.  I said to them that I could not allow them to export this tinned horse, in case it should be supplied by unscrupulous continental contractors to the United Nations or some other relief organisation for human consumption. They said: &ldquo;We will label it dog-food&rdquo;. I said: &ldquo;That is a very good suggestion but how do you intend to label it?&rdquo;.  They said: &ldquo;We will put a label on the tin&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;They can cut a label off&rdquo;.  They said: &ldquo;They would not do that.  That is a terrible thing to do&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;That is the very thing I am trying to take precautions against, unscrupulous people doing such a terrible thing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I then said: &ldquo;I will tell you what I will do.  You get the tins embossed `Dogfood'.  Get it punched on the tins and I will let it go&rdquo;.  They said: &ldquo;We will have to think about that&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I have to go to Washington in the morning.  I am going to a meeting and if you cannot undertake to do that today, you will have to wait until I come back&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;We would sooner wait&rdquo;.  So, when I came back, there was a proposal on my table that those people were very happy to concur in the proposal <Col N="2139" /> that the tins should be embossed, but they knew of my well-known liking for the Irish language and they would not wish, could not expect or could not imagine that I would ask them to emboss tinned Irish products in anything but the Irish language. Therefore, they had taken the best possible advice and they had asked for a translation into Irish of the word &ldquo;Dogfood&rdquo; and having consulted authorities on old Irish, middle Irish and modern Irish, they had come up with &ldquo;Con Biadh&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I went home and I was standing in a yard talking to an old national teacher of my acquaintance.  I said to him: &ldquo;How do you pronounce B-i-a-d-h?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;We would say bee-ach in our part of the country&rdquo;. The product was to be described as &ldquo;Con Biadh&rdquo;.  You can imagine some poor German refugee confusing &ldquo;Con Biadh&rdquo; with corned beef.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was proud to see the demonstration and I was proud afterwards <Col N="2140" /> to provide twice as much employment in the same factory for legitimate business.  The moral of the story is this.  If you allow a commodity to be exported from this country which is legitimately described as Irish spirits, it is liable to fall into unscrupulous hands and to be traded in a disreputable way in the markets where it is ultimately disposed of.  The people who are engaged in this kind of trade are people who would do anything to achieve their ends.  Therefore, I would advise the Minister that some proviso such as the one I made, to emboss the tins in the case of &ldquo;Con Biadh&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;Dogfood&rdquo;, should be put in. They dropped the whole thing like a brick when I asked them to do that.</P>
      <P>There are some people who would put methylated spirits with Irish spirits but that should be stated.  If it is let go out as domestic spirits, it could be converted to a purpose for which it was never intended by the Department of Industry and Commerce or by any other division of the Government, under the generic description of Irish spirits.  Do not forget the quotation: &ldquo;It is fundamental to the future of this country, when the amount of Government annual expenditure as a percentage of gross national product rises from 20 per cent to 25 per cent, whatever the momentary balance of payments may indicate, wherever it primarily arises, it leads ultimately to economic disaster.&rdquo;  That is a comment that will serve the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance and whatever Minister of whatever Government happens to be in office in this country.  You can make your choice to be free and accept the standard of living that goes with it, or to live in uncertain circumstances corresponding to the Cuban sociey of pre-Castro days.  It is better to make that choice before the revolution is necessary to correct it than never, than to make the wrong choice now and hope there will be people found in this country to make the right kind of revolution to put right the wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised by the contribution made by <Col N="2141" /> Deputy Lemass this evening, and in particular his reference to the behaviour of the Opposition in the matter of factories closing down.  He stated that some Members of the Opposition rubbed their hands in glee when this occurred.  I do not know whether he said this deliberately, but such a situation should certainly not be described as people rubbing their hands in glee and the Deputy should be the last person to say that, having regard to his contacts.  I am aware that the Deputy is a delegate to the Dublin Council of Trade Unions and by reason of that and the meetings he attends regularly, I am surprised by his using the expression he used about the closing down of industries and the effect on employees.</P>
      <P>I do not want to talk about the 60,000 jobs and explain how this idea came about, or 100,000 jobs, an average of 10,000 each year spread over ten years, and indicate how he came to arrive at his estimation.  I do not know.  His description cannot be applied to the city of Dublin.  That being so, I think it right and proper that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should avail of this opportunity to give an explanation of why there has been this drop in employment in the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I contend that nobody gets enjoyment out of an industry closing down, particularly the people who work in it. It would seem to me that those people, and those who represent them, are expected to say nothing, to let these things happen and leave the situation as it is.  I hope that is not correct.  We are perfectly entitled to raise questions about this matter which is one of public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has already been made in this debate of the threat of dumping. It is a well-known fact that this is a matter of great concern to people employed in various types of industry. I know of the concern it is causing to people in the clothing industry.  I know of the possibility of clothes being brought into this country which can result in people being put out of employment.  We are at the stage where the employers' organisations, the clothes and cap, industry, and the workers should get together, with a <Col N="2142" /> view to having the Minister do something about this matter.</P>
    <P>This whole position has highlighted one thing.  The manner in which we are dealing with the problem is absolutely antiquated.  It would appear from the experience of the people who found it necessary to protest that it is a matter of locking the stable door when the horse was gone.  It would appear that something must happen before we do anything about it.  But what can you do about it then?</P>
    <P>The clothing industry as a whole has been repeatedly advocating that the way out of this morass is that it be a condition that the total cost of the article be stated, that is, the total cost of the article from the country of origin.  Furthermore, customs officials should be sufficiently acquainted with a list that would enable them to make comparisons.  It has happened that there have been threats of dumping of clothing from European nations. This has caused a great deal of concern among employers and workers. I do not want to cast reflections on our customs officials but it appears that if they were as diligent with regard to dumping as they are with the ordinary tourists who come and go, we would not have this problem. Why should there be any doubt about this threat of dumping, this threat to employers who can say that articles of clothing are dumped, or about to be dumped?  If it comes about, it will cause unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that the dumping with which he is concerned did not, in fact, take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw a sports coat among items that were dumped.  It was shown off in a hotel at a price for everybody to see.  It got in.  The knowing ones in the trade, the employers and workers, verified that they could not possibly afford to sell the article at the price.  The article came from an eastern European country.  It was a well finished article and it highlighted the problem that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like some information from the Minister in the matter of new <Col N="2143" /> factories and their future, particularly the proposed new rubber factory in Ballyfermot.  It is my understanding that an Irish consortium have failed to obtain a contract for the supply of steel for this type of factory and rumour has it that a small factory outside Dublin has got the contract.  It has been contended that the reason is they are acting as a front for a foreign firm and that it is intended to use a prefabricated form of steel, to import it and have a very simple job completed here in the small factory, resulting in a lot of employment being lost to Irish workers.  This has been said, and I am not raising it deliberately for the purpose of causing a scare but so that if there is any truth in it, some explanation may be given.  Of course, speculation has been caused by the failure to accept the tender submitted by a set of reputable Irish firms and the acceptance of a tender from a small firm which is not geared for such a contract.  I should like to know particularly if a grant has been given, or is about to be given, to this firm and if so, if there are any stipulations.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy James Tully in asking for more accountability for grants.  There is insufficient accountability at the moment.  Far too many people have come into the country, set up, received grants and left.  It should not be too difficult to arrange to have taxpayers' representatives on boards of industries which obtain substantial grants from the Government.  The people's money, the taxpayers' money must be watched and steps taken to ensure that it is used in the proper fashion.  It is also imperative that we be more discerning about the people we encourage, by way of grants and other facilities, to come in here.  It is interesting to find that many of the people who have come in, particularly to Shannon, had reputations in their own countries as being anti-union. There are quite a few at Shannon.  An understanding will have to be reached in this matter.</P>
    <P>We should learn from the case of Electra and take steps to ensure that if a similar situation arises, the workers will not be left high and dry, that at <Col N="2144" /> least they will have first call on whatever the liquidator is able to rescue from the ruins.  We must ensure that workers are not denied their entitlement, that they are not given short shift or put off on short notice. Formerly they were encouraged to come into new industries, to work hard and build them up.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a particular point in connection with Buy Irish Campaign.  Everyone is more than anxious to ensure that the campaign will be a success but I cannot understand how some of the firms who purport to be behind the campaign&mdash;I am not referring only to factories but to hotels and other firms who have received grants from the Government&mdash; can neglect to give preference to Irish-produced goods.  I speak of establishments which, even in the case of box matches, display the foreign products. Such hotels get grants; yet they pay only lip service to the idea of buying Irish goods.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of industries and indeed of some semi-State concerns. Apparently a number of them are not alive to the real importance of buying Irish.  For example, is it right for a firm which has a representative on the Buy Irish Committee to continue to have advertising for radio, television and the cinemas in the main produced outside this country?  The actors may be Irish but the craftsmen used to make up the sets are in many cases employed in England and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look into this and to take steps to ensure that at least the semi-State concerns will have all material in relation to advertising made up in this country by Irish workers. That is not so at the moment.  Even the music played as a background is music supplied by London and elsewhere. The whole thing is completely ironical and it is about time a stop was put to it.  People, particularly semi-State concerns, have no business to do this.  They are responsible to the nation for their activities and it is not enough for them to give lip service only to the theme &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.  They must also use every means in their power to <Col N="2145" /> put the theme across from the beginning to the end of their activities.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of cheese and I think somebody said some of our cheeses are good.  We all know that the quality of our cheeses is great: we have reached the stage now when we have a variety of cheeses which compare favourably with those of other cheese-making countries.  However, we have a situation that if you ask for Irish Blue instead of Danish Blue&mdash;there is a little more blue in the Danish product but it is only a matter of colour&mdash;you will be told they do not stock Irish Blue.</P>
    <P>I go along with the suggestion that we should concentrate more on food processing but we must make a greater study of the techniques of food processing, being particularly careful to ensure that people who set up manufacturing units for food processing know what they are doing so that we shall not have a spate of food poisoning, as has happened.</P>
    <P>There is a factory in Dublin about which I am concerned because it happens to be in my constituency.  It is the Philips factory which folded up.  I do not think it was anybody's fault in this country, either on the part of those who controlled it or of the workers.  I am satisfied it was because of the Philips organisation and because of the set-up in regard to employment content. I should like to hear from the Minister if he has had any indication whether that industry in Finglas will be started up again by somebody.  The factory is well situated, quite close to a pool of labour in both Finglas and Cabra.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I shall refer to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The community have not taken sufficient notice of this organisation who have done an essential job of work very well.  I should like the Minister to explore the possibility of bringing home the usefulness of this institute to the people.  The more we work in conjunction with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the more we shall develop discernment and ensure that we get value for money. Our people will become more conscious of the importance of particularisation <Col N="2146" /> of work.  They will appreciate the need to produce competently and economically, with a view to being able to compete with other nations.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that insufficient consideration is given to the question of the training of people for jobs in the various factories that open up from time to time and, furthermore, to helping them to appreciate the importance of what they are doing and why they are doing it.  There is a tendency for some employers to train workers as if they were machines.  A considerable number of people working in factories know only that they have to do a certain job at a bench.  They do not know what happens when their work passes on from them to somebody else.  They are not let into the secret.  We wonder, then, at our inability to produce a suitably-finished product.  We may even wonder how it came about that, in the production of an article, a component was omitted.  People who are supposed to be able to train workers come to this country to teach the Irish worker how to do a certain job, but do not in fact always do so.  The attitude to the worker may be: &ldquo;Get in there and swim.&rdquo;  That is not good enough.  There will have to be a greater understanding of the problem confronting the worker, particularly in a new industry.</P>
    <P>The training of workers is a matter proper to the Minister for Labour.  We cannot, however, avoid the connection that exists between the Department of Labour and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Minister is responsible for industry to the extent not only of inducing it to commence here but to continue to operate here. Manufacturers will have to be encouraged to train the workers properly.</P>
    <P>It was wrong of Deputy Lemass to say that people display glee when a factory closes down.  That is not correct. Nobody gets a kick out of it when a factory closes down.  Far too many have closed down: let us hope there will not be any more.  The fewer factories that close down, the better for everybody.  It is only natural for people to ask: &ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; when a place is started and is going for only a short while and then folds up.  The workers are just left there.  Nobody <Col N="2147" /> knows who is responsible.  Very often, the wrong persons are blamed.  Somebody is left holding the baby and the fly-by-nights have left the country.  I do not blame this particularly on the Minister.  I know full well that he will not give money to any person in the knowledge that he will behave in such a manner.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to ask that a little more control be taken of the grants afforded to people coming in here to establish industry.  We realise that we must induce them to come but, at the same time, in a situation in which we are giving away money, we must have some control.  God knows, we need money for many purposes.  Some thousands of pounds can be frittered away when, at the same time, we could use that money not only for another factory, but to build a number of houses which are badly needed.</P>
    <P>I believe a solution to this problem of State grants will be found when the people are represented on the board. They are entitled to see where it goes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we were all heartened by the picture given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the preparations made by his Department and by the Government relative to the emergence of free trade. Every possible step has been taken to gear this country to face the fierce challenge of competition which lies ahead of us.  I think we are satisfied, too, with the steps the Department has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1960 or 1961, we have had a flood of reports and surveys by adaptation councils, trade union advisory bodies, and so on, advising the different manufacturers on what must be done if they are to gear themselves properly and make suitable preparation for what lies ahead.  Generous financial assistance, too, has been provided.  In the long run, it all boils down to the hard fact that industry itself must very seriously be alerted to the dangers.  No matter what a Government in a democracy can do by way of financial assistance, advice, and so on, these aids and grants will prove useless unless <Col N="2148" /> industry itself plays a very important part.  I trust the different industries in this country are alive to the problem and are not taking it too lightly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen referred to closures and threatened closures of factories, industries, and so on, and to the fact that we all bemoan the closing of an industry when such an event takes place.  In my part of the country, there is a very big undertaking in operation, the Tynagh mines, which contributed nearly £4 million last year in exports of ore and ore concentrates.  The employment of so many people in that area of East Galway has meant a great improvement in the economy of the whole district.  Upwards of 300 people are employed in a rural district and the spending power of the people has been greatly increased.  That affects every walk of life, particularly the shopkeepers in the area.  Recently rumours have perturbed me in regard to threatened closures and strikes which, as far as I know, have not so far taken place.  Any ill-advised, ill-conceived, or unrealistic action by anybody should be guarded against at this stage.  I feel sure that all reputable trade unions should advise their members not to take hasty action that would precipitate strikes, lock-outs or what have you.  This is something that is the talk of my area at present.  This industry has been more or less a bonus to the area in so far as no State grants were made available to establish it and this should make people think twice before they take any ill-conceived action.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Deputy Mullen referred to the fact that our workers have skills and aptitudes which compare well with those of workers in other countries.  Recently I had this illustrated to me in a very practical way.  A camera which I owned went out of action when I was in a country which is supposed to be highly industrialised and I was told by a dealer that it would take six weeks to repair. On returning to Dublin I left it in a shop and it was repaired in two hours. That is only an example of something which happened to me.  I hold that our workers are as good as if not better than, any of the workers in so called <Col N="2149" /> industrial nations which have had a long start on us.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a plea to the Minister in regard to many of our small towns in which people have been striving over the years to get somebody interested in setting up an industry. Well-intentioned people get together, prepare brochures and try to set out the advantages of their area, the labour pool available, the potential advantages, the local capital, et cetera, and if the Minister's Department had in each county an official who would go to the chambers of commerce, local development companies, or whatever they are, and instruct them in how to prepare brochures of that type, setting forth the data an industrialist would require to enable him to assess the possibilities of setting up there, it would be a great help.</P>
    <P>I am referring particularly to my own constituency in which there are many small towns in which the people are anxious and willing to co-operate in every possible way in having an industry established there.  However, they lack guidance in these matters. The Department of Industry and Commerce must surely have officials who could visit these people when invited to do so and tell them the headings to use for the preparation of brochures of this type.  I am sure the Minister will listen to this suggestion and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to hark back again to the Tynagh mines because it is a matter of great concern to all concerned in East Galway.  Rumours have been rife over the past few months and if the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Labour, could investigate conditions and see what has given rise to this situation&mdash;are the demands made by the workers unreasonable; is management unreasonable?&mdash;and try to fix this up in some way before a serious situation emerges, it would be worthwhile.  We are very happy to have this bonus industry in our area and we do not want to see it go.  We trust that the authorities in Government will take steps to prevent the economy suffering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the debate on this Estimate <Col N="2150" /> and I was forcibly struck by the references to industry and the awarding of grants to industries on the east and south coast, but the west and north-west, with the exception of Galway, were scarcely mentioned.  Perhaps this is typical of the attitude which is being adopted towards the West.  It is forgotten that we are there at all.  I should like to impress on the Minister, as a Deputy from the West, the urgent necessity of establishing industries there.  We are seriously perturbed, and justifiably so, about what our position is going to be and what part we will have to play in the economic structure, if and when we enter the European Economic Community, either as an associate member or as a full member. We know, as Deputy Carty said, that in the West we have to face a serious challenge from outside competition but what is worrying us most is whether, if the Government do not come to our assistance with the establishment of industries, we will face a challenge to exist as a Province or will we be facing the extermination of most of our Province?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister or his Government reflected on what is going to happen to the West, if and when we enter the Common Market?  If they have, it is not apparent at the moment.  I should like to point out to the Minister what is happening in Sligo-Leitrim.  The reduction of protection, following the Free Trade Area Agreement, left its mark very quickly in my constituency. Tyresoles of Collooney folded up almost immediately, with the import of Michelin car and bicycle tyres, and left 18 families with the loss of a breadwinner and of a weekly pay packet.  In Sligo also since the Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced.  We had the closing down of the lead mines at Ballisodare. They employed 120 males.  We do not blame the Government for the closing of the mines.  It was due to the fact that there was not sufficient lead to warrant keeping them open as an economic proposition.  But we expected that the Government would take cognisance of the fact that that industry had closed and that they would direct the attention of industrialists to that area in order to offset the loss in employment. We also had the closing <Col N="2151" /> down of the barytes mine at Benbulben. I do not think that was the fault of the Government either, but again unemployment was created as a result.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the biggest tragedy for us in Sligo was the burning down of the factory of the Sligo Spinning Company, which employed about 300 people, mostly male labour.  I understand that a grant of £120,000 was given towards the establishment of that industry.  I think I am correct in stating that to qualify for that grant, the company had to stay in operation in Sligo for a period of five years.  They stayed 5½ years.  Again, we expected that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would impress upon the Government the necessity of giving us an industry comparable with the one we lost.  I do not say we did not get industries. Some were directed to Sligo, but they were on a small scale and were not sufficient to absorb the labour content of the factories that had closed.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress upon the Minister that 44,000 people have left Connacht in the past ten years.  Most of them left because of the lack of employment opportunities.  Those figures are correct&mdash;they are taken from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>.  It is frightening to see so many people leaving the Province, and this going practically unheeded.  The population of the West is still withering.  We think, right or wrong, it is due to official neglect and represents a total failure of the Government's policy to do something for the West.  It has been stated on various occasions&mdash;and there appear to be some grounds for it&mdash;that, if the present trend continues, vast tracts of the West will become national parks in which foreigners can disport themselves.  We have a feeling that, if the economists had their way, they would probably advise the Government to wipe out the West altogether since they would regard it as being of no use to the economic structure of the country. This is borne out by the NIEC, who gave it as their view that the establishment of industrial estates would not be equally effective in promoting economic growth in the north-west <Col N="2152" /> as it would be in the rest of the Republic.  That is the opinion of a body of people who sit down and think theoretically but do not appear to have any practical idea of what the West can offer in respect of the requirements of an industrial estate.  However, I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why there is encouragement for industries to go to the south and to the east coast and very little encouragement for them to come to the north-west.  We in the West are taxpayers, the same as those in the rest of the country.  Perhaps we are not such heavy taxpayers.  But we think we are entitled to an equality of opportunity in the allocation of industries.  We want to retain our people.  At election times we get promises, but when the elections are over, we hear no more of those promises.  We want to play our part in the progress of the nation.  All we get is pious platitudes.  If my prediction is right, in the not too distant future, we may find ourselves presented with a referendum on the distribution of Dáil seats.  If the present trend of depopulation in the West continues, we will be signing our own death warrant.</P>
    <P>If we want to arrest the cancer of emigration and economic decay in the West, industrialisation is the main answer.  The paying out of doles, unemployment assistance and so on, is no solution at all.  What we want is productive employment and industrialisation. There has been much expression of public opinion on this matter.  Three bishops have come out in the open on it and Father McDyer has helped a lot, but it all appears to have fallen on deaf ears.  I dealt before with the matter of the cynicism and frustration that have crept in.  One of our greatest battles in the West will be to kill that cynicism and frustration. The main solution to our problems is to provide the maximum of sound employment opportunities by intensive investment in industry.  We cannot forget that some millions of pounds of Irish taxpayers' money were poured into projects such as the Avoca mines.  If those millions of <Col N="2153" /> pounds had been even tried in industralisation in the west of Ireland, perhaps our 44,000 people would not have left Connacht in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the final fact which I should like to impress upon the Minister and his Government, that is, the establishment of an industrial estate at Sligo.  Looking at the map of Ireland, we see industries dotted along the south and east coast and, with the exception of Galway, there is no heavy industry in the west of Ireland.  Again, there is the industrial estate at Shannon of which we are all proud, and there are the projected industrial estates at Waterford and Galway.  It does not take much imagination to see a wide gap on that map, and the focal point of that wide gap is Sligo.</P>
    <P>Sligo measures up to the criteria required for the establishment of an industrial estate.  The many factors required are all there.  In the near future, we shall have a regional technical college and by 1970, it should be in operation.  We shall then have skilled labour which is vital to the establishment of an industrial estate.  We have no water supply problems, as we are situated on the shores of Lough Gill. There are no difficulties in regard to electricity or communications.  We have a railway that serves both the south and east of Ireland, and we have some of the finest highways in the country leading out of Sligo both to the north and east.  The main point is that we have an excellent port at hand for importing raw materials and exporting the finished product.  There are good harbour facilities, and this port is one which requires more trade.  In Sligo, there is another essential for the establishment of an industrial estate, that is security and stability.  There is an excellent industrial development company and a chamber of commerce. There are also excellent educational facilities, another essential requirement in the establishment of such an estate. There is the Ursuline Convent, the Mercy Convent, the Marist College, and the Christian Brothers school, all providing post-primary education. There are also excellent sporting <Col N="2154" /> facilities: one of the finest golf links in Ireland at Rosses Point, and swimming facilities convenient to Rosses Point and Strandhill.</P>
    <P>I should like to read a statement by the Sligo Industrial Development Company Ltd. on the report which was published by the Committee on Development Centres and Industrial Estates.  It starts off by saying, and, believe it or not, I am in accord with them:</P>
    <P>We congratulate the Government on their action in assessing the most modern methods of stimulating economic growth here in the Republic.  We refer, of course, to the growth centre concept whereby industries are located in certain centres instead of dispersing them over a wide area so as to bring greater economic rewards to the whole country.  It is stimulating to read the report of the Committee on Development Centres and Industrial Estates.  We are pleased to note that Sligo appears to meet the criteria by reference to which cities or towns should be selected as development centres.</P>
    <P>We do not agree with the National Industrial Economic Council's views that the establishment of industrial estates would not be equally effective in promoting economic growth in the north-west as it would be in the rest of the Republic.  A depressed area needs a dynamic, expanding focal point to act as a stimulus to it. Furthermore, we feel that more action in the form of public investment and the encouragement of private investment is needed in the north-west to bring the area into line with the economic development of the rest of the country.  Action by the Government is needed now in order to contain the huge losses of population we are sustaining and, if left unchecked, will continue to sustain for many years to come.</P>
    <P>We are pleased to note the Government's non-acceptance of the suggestion by the National Industrial Economic Council.  We now look forward to the Government adding the name of Sligo to that of Waterford <Col N="2155" /> and Galway at which an industrial estate will be established.</P>
    <P>We do look forward to it and we hope the Minister will realise the position and ensure that Sligo will be added to the list in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In no sphere of activity has the failure of the Second Programme been more obvious than in respect of industry.  Deputies will be familiar with the targets which were laid down when the Second Programme was published.  It has been said on a number of occasions that with, I think, two notable exceptions, none of the targets laid down in that programme has so far been achieved.  The only two that have been achieved apply to the amount of money raised in taxation and the amount of money spent by the State.  In respect of both of these items, the level which it was anticipated would be reached at this stage in the Second Programme has already been passed. In respect of employment, production, construction and output generally, the targets laid down have not been achieved.  In fact, in so far as employment is concerned, the actual number in employment shows a very serious drop.  It is because of that that I want to direct the attention of the Minister and of the House to the situation which has developed and to the gravity of the circumstances which now exist in respect of employment and to the complete failure of the Second Programme, culminating in the recent decision of the Government not to publish at this stage but to postpone and, if possible, confuse with the annual review of the economy next year, the normally anticipated survey and assessment of what has been achieved to date under the Second Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in respect of manufacturing industry alone, there was an increase of something short of 2,000 new jobs last year as compared with the previous year but that figure, of course, does not cater for the large numbers coming on to the employment market for the first time, nor does it absorb <Col N="2156" /> those who have left the land and those who have left rural employment.</P>
    <P>When the Second Programme was introduced, it laid down a figure of between 70,000 and 80,000 new jobs by the end of the period of that programme. Now, after the First Programme and whatever period of the Second has elapsed, there are, in fact, 90,000 fewer persons employed in this country than were employed when the Programmes were first commenced.  So that, applying the acid test laid down by the previous Taoiseach as the test that must be applied to the success of Government economic policy, the First and Second Programmes have failed to achieve the target.  In fact, as I have said, there are 90,000 fewer persons employed than were employed ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Second Programme has been obvious for a considerable time.  Deputies on this side of the House have urged consistently that the time had arrived when the Programme should be reviewed and revised.  Now the Programme is in a shambles and the Government are forced to avoid publishing the results of the period that has elapsed since the Programme started and are endeavouring to postpone doing so until the next annual review of statistics and economic data published either prior to or simultaneously with the Budget.</P>
    <P>The Government should be frank with the people and with the Dáil in this matter.  They should explain what targets have not been achieved and publish the facts as to the aims that have not been fulfilled, clearly spell out the areas in which the Programme has been a failure and endeavour to ascertain the causes and assign the circumstances which contributed to this situation.</P>
    <P>So far as any examination by anyone is concerned, it is not possible to discover, except in respect of taxation and State expenditure, any area in which the Programme has been fulfilled or the targets attained.  The position in respect of employment is particularly serious.  As the OECD report for last year, published some months ago, shows, for the period in <Col N="2157" /> question the fact that there had been an increase in the numbers leaving rural employment, and the fact that the numbers expected to be placed in new jobs was not attained was minimised by an increase in the numbers emigrating.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the changes from one year to another, it is essential to consider these Programmes in a broad way and to take the period in which they were operating.  For that period there is a notable drop in the numbers in employment, leaving aside the fact that emigration continued at the same time.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of talk during this debate and elsewhere as to the steps taken to prepare this country for free trade.  One aspect of this matter that has caused a great deal of concern and that is responsible for a sizable volume of opinion against free trade is the failure of the Government to take the necessary measures to safeguard the interests of workers and to deal with the problems arising from the possibility, apparently fairly remote, of EEC membership, and the effects of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.</P>
    <P>This is hardly the occasion, in advance of the discussions which are to take place in Brussels later this month, to re-assess or reconsider the whole question of this country's application for membership of the EEC. However, it is essential to say&mdash;and this fact seems not to be adequately understood or fully appreciated by many people in the country who would say to leave things as they are or let well enough alone&mdash;if Britain entered &mdash;and Britain's entry has always been clearly understood as the <i>sine qua non</i> of membership for this country&mdash;our economic and commercial interests are so interlinked with those of Britain that if we were outside, there would be a common external tariff in operation against Irish products.  In those circumstances, to suggest that this country should continue to operate in some form of isolation would inevitably mean what has often been described as a hairshirt economy.</P>
    <P>That situation has not yet arisen, but where there is a great feeling of uneasiness, <Col N="2158" /> and where criticism has already been directed against the operation of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain, is the failure of the Government to take steps to deal with redundancy and to deal with the disemployment of workers because of imports from Britain&mdash;excessive imports in respect of certain commodities. To that extent&mdash;admittedly, up to the present not on as wide a scale as might well happen&mdash;the incidents that have already happened have generated fear and anxiety and uneasiness amongst workers that what is happening in respect of one industry or certain categories of workers, might happen on a much wider and more extensive scale.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the CIO reports have recommended adaptation and other preventive and forestalling measures, and certain action has been taken to put into effect the recommendations made, the plain truth is that there has been an extraordinary delay, an unreasonable delay, an unwarranted delay, in introducing legislation to deal with redundancy.  This is not a political point made by an Opposition Deputy or by critics of the Government.  It has been reinforced on at least two occasions by strenuous references by the NIEC, which in one recommendation advocated that legislation was essential, and in another, referred to the fact &mdash;and I think these were the words used&mdash;that constant vigilance on the part of the Government was the only way to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>It is true that a Bill has been introduced or that the heads have been put on the Order Paper.  This House has dealt at length with far less urgent legislation.  It has spent hours and days and weeks debating far less urgent legislation.  Even the most impartial observer of the political or economic scene must agree that the House has spent valuable parliamentary time on less essential legislation than it would if the Government had the determination and the realisation impressed upon them of the urgency of this problem. If there is in this country&mdash;and I think there is&mdash;some volume of opinion concerned about the prospects of free trade, a great share of the responsibility <Col N="2159" /> for that situation developing lies at the door of the Government because they did not introduce and enact the necessary provisions.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that legislation of this sort might be complicated and that there would be problems of operation and problems of implementation. Even if that arises, it ought to be possible in the future to introduce amending legislation.  There is no excuse and no justification for the failure by the Government to take the necessary steps to introduce and enact legislation to deal with redundancy.</P>
    <P>When the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain was being discussed here, on behalf of this Party, I spoke at length on the gravity of the problem that would affect Irish industry because of dumping, because of the small size of the Irish market and because of the fact that we were in close proximity to a highly industrialised country.  I said that, in the main, with isolated exceptions, our units were small and our capacity to compete with a highly industrialised economy was limited by our size, limited by our markets, and limited by the whole fabric of our economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilhawley spoke a few moments ago about the circumstances in Sligo.  We are all familiar with what happened in Cork and other places because of increased imports and their effect on Irish industry.  I believe that if there is an element of fear amongst the workers, it is a fear of the conditions which will eventuate in the likely extension of free trade because of the effects of the present Free Trade Agreement with Britain or our ultimate membership of the EEC.  A great deal of this could have been minimised and allayed if speedy action had been taken in respect of legislation.</P>
    <P>The time may well be fast approaching when this country will have to undertake in respect of our economy, and particularly in respect of the industrial sector, what was described in other circumstances and in an entirely different situation as an agonising re-appraisal.  It may well be that at this <Col N="2160" /> stage, until some further elucidation of the position is possible as a result of the discussions later this month, it would be premature for the House to consider it further, but certainly unless the situation is clarified to a far greater extent than the Taoiseach's reply yesterday would indicate, or the statements that have been made, it will be necessary for this country and for this House to consider the situation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to certain other matters, some of which have already been discussed in the course of this debate.  I want to refer to a company over which the Minister exercises responsibility, Ceimicí Teo., and the decision to market industrial alcohol. This is a matter which was considered before by the House and it was the subject of discussions between Ceimicí Teo. and the Department, and also between the distillers and the Department.</P>
    <P>From time to time, there has been criticism of the failure of the Irish distillers who manufacture whiskey and so on to get into the export market to a greater extent, but on the whole they have done a very good job.  It is not sufficiently realised by those who criticise the efforts made that all those firms are privately-owned and the people responsible for operating them have a responsibility to their own shareholders. In the main they are relatively small concerns and, in recent years, I think amalgamation or joiningup has been undertaken.  In fact, that decision was taken in face of the competition from large companies, such as distillers and others.</P>
    <P>I remember the first time I went to the United States one of the very first functions I was asked to attend was a promotion effort by representatives of the distilling companies here to get a foothold on the American market. They displayed initiative and energy in securing a market in America for Irish whiskey.  That effort was in competition with not merely the giant American and Canadian firms but also in competition with Scotch distillers, and it indicated both the desire and the determination of the firms here to sell their products abroad, and their realisation <Col N="2161" /> that it was essential for them to develop an export trade.</P>
    <P>I believe there is now some anxiety in the trade and I think this is a matter that requires to be handled most carefully in the light of a recent announcement appearing to indicate a change again on the part of Ceimicí Teoranta in this field.  In this regard it is, I think, correct to say that where private enterprise is doing a satisfactory job&mdash;it is generally agreed, I think, that the quality of the product, the enterprising spirit of the firms concerned, the efforts made over a protracted period to secure markets, the standards of marketing, and so on, cannot be faulted&mdash;State companies ought not to enter into competition with private enterprise.  There seems to me to be no valid reason why State competition or State-aided companies of any sort should enter into competition with established firms which are doing a satisfactory job. That is one of the matters in the Minister's speech requiring clarification.</P>
    <P>These private firms have in the past made very considerable efforts.  I am talking now in particular of the earlier efforts made.  Since then there has been State assistance of one form or another. Export tax relief has been made available under legislation; but initially, when these firms first made an effort to get into the export market, the facilities that have since become available were not available.  It took initiative, therefore, and enterprise and drive and foresight to undertake the work involved.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to raise was raised earlier this year by way of Parliamentary Question.  It was recently the subject of a departmental inquiry. I refer to interest rates in respect of housing loans.  In a matter of this sort, a matter in which large numbers are affected, a matter in which the consequences of a rise in interest rates on housing loans.  In a matter of this sort, a matter in which large numbers are affected, a matter in which the consequences of a rise in interest rates on housing loans and mortgages have such widespread ramifications, there is justification for a public inquiry.  It may well be that certain facts and figures, particular aspects of individual companies' accounts, should not be disclosed publicly.  If that is so, then that case can be made to the tribunal concerned <Col N="2162" /> and it should, of course, be within the discretion of any such tribunal to withhold publication of information, the publication of which could be regarded in any sense as inimical to the interests of the undertaking concerned.  Nevertheless, in matters of this sort, it is never satisfactory to have a departmental inquiry conducted behind closed doors, with a report made in private to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is strong justification in a matter of this kind for a public inquiry. In fact, when the prices legislation was going through this House, it was argued that there would be specific cases in which a public inquiry would be warranted.  It is always possible to claim exemption.  It is always possible to claim privilege for particular sets of figures, particularly data or information, the publication of which might well be regarded as inimical to the interests of the firms or companies involved. With these exceptions, which can be provided against and in relation to which safeguards can be given, this is a matter in which it is appropriate that a public inquiry should be held.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the operation of the Department of Industry and Commerce, an aspect which also comes within the ambit of the Department of Transport and Power and certain other Government Departments, that is, the question of accounts and the accountability of State and semi-State companies.  The Public Accounts Committee was established for the purpose of ascertaining that moneys voted by this Parliament were disbursed properly and correctly in accordance with the Estimate. When that Committee first functioned, there were no State or semi-State companies. There was none for many years afterwards.  There was no State or semi-State trading.</P>
    <P>That particular form of investigation was satisfactory and has operated ever since with of course the drawback that the investigation takes place after the event and on occasion circumstances are disclosed which show that money has either been spent in a different way or attention is directed to the necessity to take steps to ensure that the express decision of the Dáil <Col N="2163" /> is carried out in the future.  By and large that system has worked satisfactorily. The Committee of Public Accounts procedure has operated effectively and has been recognised as a necessary part of the machinery of the Dáil to ensure that public money is spent in the manner for which it was originally voted.</P>
    <P>In recent years, with the growth in the number of State and semi-State companies, the question of having these companies accountable in some way to the Dáil or having accounts presented or examined has often been discussed and Deputies' concern has been expressed during the course of this debate regarding the fact that loans and grants of one form or another are made under the authority of An Foras Tionscal or whatever procedure is concerned.  When concern is expressed that the State has no direct representation on a company or is not being kept informed on how money is spent, I believe that this in effect is in another way an expression of the anxiety which was initially responsible in other days for the establishment of the Public Accounts Committee.  This is a matter that has been discussed here.  Earlier this year there was a motion down, and I think it is one that must be considered again by the House to see what form of Dáil Committee or what form of accountability should be operated in respect of State grants and State assistance.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the argument that before a grant is made, initial investigations and examinations are so exhaustive that unless it is warranted, it will not be made by the appropriate statutory authority and that that in itself is satisfactory enough <i>imprimatur</i> for it.  I believe, however, that there is a justification for some form of investigation. It might well be that it would not be possible to investigate all State companies each year, but a statutory Committee, analogous to or in some way similar to the present Public Accounts Committee, should be considered and have the right to get from State companies, or indeed in certain cases in respect of grants or assistance, be given details of how the money has <Col N="2164" /> been spent and the accounts and reports made available to them.</P>
    <P>There is ample experience and well established procedure in respect of the Public Accounts Committee that certain data are regarded as confidential and certain information may be withheld on the ground that it would be wrong in the circumstances to give it.  The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has the right to decide. Usually the Committee accepts but occasionally it has refused to accept exemptions or reservations.  However, the inherent right of public representatives to get a full report on public expenditure is safeguarded and assured.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes argued that because accounts are laid before the House and the Dáil has the right at any time to have these accounts examined or have a debate on them, that is sufficient.  If that right were exercised on anything like a general scale, it would clog up the operation and efficiency of Dáil discussions.  It is in many ways entirely unsatisfactory that accounts of a particular firm or a particular statutory company should be examined in detail by the whole Dáil.  For one thing, the time is not available and anyway a great deal of it would be information that would have no relevance to parliamentary discussions.  On the other hand, a Dáil Committee, similar to the Public Accounts Committee, could and should have available to it details of actual expenditure and be supplied with the necessary information in the same way as the Public Accounts Committee is supplied with details by the accounting officers of the different Departments.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which affects the Minister's Department but it also affects other Departments, such as Finance and Transport and Power.  It seems to me that where there is anxiety on the part of Deputies regarding the manner in which funds or loans or grants have been spent, this anxiety can be allayed by presentation to a Committee of the Dáil of the facts and the circumstances and the reasons which were responsible for particular decisions or particular actions being taken, on the basis that, if necessary, where certain facts or figures which <Col N="2165" /> might involve trading or other secrets of a particular firm or information which would militate against its trading capacity, these could be kept confidential to the Committee.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that with the growth in the amount of money now being spent not directly by Government Departments but indirectly by agencies, the time has come when the Dáil should consider this matter.  I understood from some remarks made here at the time of the debate earlier this year that the matter was being further considered.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why this matter was considered when we were in Government and a reason which Governments always advance against a decision is that no perfectly satisfactory system has evolved.  Merely to strive for a perfect system is no reason why we should not establish some system similar to the Public Accounts system and at least give it a trial in respect of a limited number of State or semi-State bodies.  Experience of how it will work must of course naturally suggest future modifications, but there is, I believe, an overwhelming case for establishing, in view of the extent of State expenditure in one form or another, some form of accountability, if not the same, certainly analogous to the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a fairly wide-ranging debate, I think, on this Estimate.  I shall endeavour to deal with the major points which have been raised.  I think I would find it impossible to deal with all of them.  It seems to me that perhaps the first thing that should be said is this.  It would appear from some remarks that have been made, including those we have just heard from Deputy Cosgrave, that there is a certain atmosphere of cold feet beginning to develop in regard to free trade and we ought now to take another look, it has been suggested, at the operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement because it is suggested that membership of the EEC is receding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept either of these propositions.  One thing that should be <Col N="2166" /> made perfectly clear to everybody in this country is that if we had no Free Trade Area Agreement and if we were not going into the EEC, whether under an interim arrangement or as full members, we would still have to live in a world of free trade and to survive, since we depend so much on external trade markets and on world markets to survive.  We must reduce our tariff barriers in order to compete in a free trade area.  The fact that we have a Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain is operating to introduce our industrialists gradually to free trade competition with Britain and perhaps for membership of the EEC, which I have no doubt we are going to attain.</P>
    <P>I have no more information than anybody else has as to when that will be, but it still appears to me to be a not-unreasonable target, membership by 1970.  I want to stress again, whether we achieve that or not, if this country is to survive, it must be able to survive in free trade conditions.  Let us have no misleading of the people into thinking we can suddenly draw back from this.  This is something that depends solely on what decisions we make.  We can make the decisions as to how we will deal with the situation that arises but we must realise that we have to survive in an area of free trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave, and indeed other members of his Party and members of the Labour Party, have been saying inside this House and outside it&mdash;in fact, they have been alleging&mdash;that there has been dumping of tyres in this country and that our footwear industry is suffering because of the advent of free trade under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Those things are wrong.  I do not say they have been made by Members of the Opposition out of any sense of malice but I say they have been made in ignorance because they have not done their homework. This would not be the first time in which they failed to do their homework.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the footwear industry is this.  The protection which operates in the footwear industry is such that there is a quota which allows in by way of imports less than four per cent of the output of our factories.  This includes even types of <Col N="2167" /> footwear that are not made in this country at all.  That level of protection has operated here for about four years and is still operating, so there is no question whatever as far as the footwear industry is concerned of free trade operating.  This is not free trade. This industry is highly protected at the moment, nor has there been, to my knowledge, any allegation of dumping of footwear in our home market.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that in the footwear industry in this country, we have over-capacity as far as the home market is concerned and as far as export markets are concerned, particularly in Britain and on the Continent, and more especially Western Germany, there has been a considerable economic recession.  This has reduced the market for footwear considerably and many factories in those countries have either closed down or are on short time, and if they are, the effect has been that their markets have become either difficult or impossible for exporters.  Of course, this has thrown back on our home market.  It is clear to anybody who knows the facts that the difficulties in the footwear industry, both in Britain and on the Continent, are due to economic recessions which have taken place in Britain and on the Continent, especially in Germany.  It might be of interest to know that the latest trade statistics show that our imports of footwear in 1966 were valued at £.45 million while our exports were worth £2.4 million.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of the alleged dumping of tyres is concerned, I think there ought to be a bit more care given to the use of words like &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; in this context.  Dumping has a meaning which is internationally accepted and when we hear about the introduction of anti-dumping legislation&mdash;I will deal with that in a moment&mdash;we are talking about a specific thing which is internationally accepted and is two-fold in its constitution: firstly, that goods are being sold&mdash;let us assume they are being dumped here&mdash;at a price below that which they sell on their home market and, secondly, that they are causing serious disruption of the industry or economy of the country <Col N="2168" /> receiving the goods.  As far as tyre imports are concerned, despite the fact that the duty operating to protect our tyre industry is 45 per cent flat, with a minimum duty of 11s 3d in the case of UK imports and 12s 6d in the case of others, the tyres which were coming in here and being sold were dearer than our home-produced tyres and were selling on the market here at a higher price than our tyres, made by Dunlops of Cork, were selling at.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, these excessive imports took place and it was in those circumstances that we, after consultation with the British Government, as we are entitled to do under the Free Trade Area Agreement, arranged to impose a quota which has been arranged in regard to imports from Britain.  We imposed a flat duty of £3 per tyre on tyres from third countries which&mdash;we make no bones about it&mdash; is designed to keep them out.  This, of course, is only a temporary arrangement. Let us be clear: there was no dumping of tyres in this country.  There were excessive imports but these were selling at prices higher than the home-produced article.  There is a lesson in this for all of us.  I want to make it clear that I had consultations, and my Department had consultation, with the management of the Dunlop company in Cork when the quota was imposed. They also, I understand, have for a considerable time been in consultation with the trade unions concerned in their factory in regard to re-organisation and they have assured me that they are confident that, by the implementation of these plans, they will be able to succeed against foreign competition because the special protection by quota, and so on, is only temporary and they know this.</P>
    <P>They have to streamline their production and make themselves very competitive and, of course, make their products capable of selling, at least when they are selling at the same price as others.  I believe they can do this and will succeed in doing so.  Let us not talk about this as if it were something like tyres being dumped on this market.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been raised by some Deputies relates to the <Col N="2169" /> car assembly industry.  I have informed the House on a few occasions in response to Parliamentary Questions that negotiations were taking place designed to ensure the continued existence of the car assembly industry in this country, at least at the level at which it has been operating, and I would hope, an increased level.  These negotiations, which were involved, required negotiations with a number of parties, with the assemblers in this country, the British manufacturers in particular, the assemblers of cars originating in places other than Britain, and the trade unions.  It required a lengthy amount of negotiation and, indeed, not just lengthy but some difficult negotiations were involved.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position at this moment to say that the matter has been finally completed, but I hope to be in a position to say that, if not within a matter of days, at the outside, within a matter of weeks.  I am quite satisfied that the arrangements that have been made will be very much to the benefit of our car assembly industry, and, in particular and especially, to the many thousands of workers engaged in that industry.  Indeed, it was only to protect the employees that this effort was made.</P>
    <P>There has also been some criticism of the fact that we have not yet introduced anti-dumping legislation.  There are a few things I should like to make clear about that.  Firstly, under the protection regulations which we have at the moment, the devices against dumping are, in fact, more effective than those we could have under any anti-dumping legislation.  Reference has been made to fears that have been expressed from time to time, sometimes with a great deal of shrillness and publicity, about dumping but you will find, if you investigate any of these cases which received so much publicity, that the dumping has not, in fact, taken place and that our industry has not suffered as a result of dumping.</P>
    <P>I want to make this quite clear.  It is sometimes represented that we are wide open to dumping at the moment, in the absence of this legislation.  That is not true.  In regard to the legislation, the white print of the Bill had in <Col N="2170" /> fact been prepared, as far as I can recall.  The terms of the Bill had not been approved by the Government when further negotiations took place within the GATT relating to anti-dumping regulations.  The effects of the negotiations which took place and changes made in those regulations were to strengthen the anti-dumping measures we should introduce.  We, therefore, were obliged to re-draft the Bill but it was well worth while because it will be a stronger measure than we would otherwise have been able to have.  I hope to have this Bill before the House shortly, certainly in this session.</P>
    <P>There has also been reference to the increase in the interest rates of building societies.  I have made it clear before, and I should like to make it clear again, that I am very well aware of the hardships involved for a number of individuals as a result of the increases in those interest rates.  It was with the greatest reluctance that I came to the conclusion that it was necessary for me to agree to these increases.  The House will recall that the building societies postponed the operation of the increases at my request for a period of three months to enable me to have the matter examined in the greatest detail. I had that examination made.  Incidentally, this examination was not carried out by officers of my Department but, in fact, by an investment counsellor and accountant from another State body who have a good deal more expertise in this matter than is otherwise available anywhere else in the State service.  The conclusions to which they came and on which they advised me were that I would not be justified in refusing to agree to these increases.</P>
    <P>One of the things one must remember in regard to the rates of interest charged by building societies is that if one were to artificially depress or keep down their interest rates, the result would almost certainly be that the funds available to them would diminish substantially, with the result that the financing of their building would come to a stop as far as their operations are concerned, and my recollection is that building societies <Col N="2171" /> provide for the greatest proportion of housebuilding in this country as between local authorities on the one hand, insurance companies, and so on, on the other.  If interest rates were to be kept down, you would have a very serious stoppage in the building of houses and the very serious unemployment which would result from this.  To have such a stoppage could not benefit the country in general, the building trade in particular, nor would it benefit the people who are getting loans from now on.  Indeed the only way the building societies could have dealt with it was to step up very considerably the rates of interest charged to new borrowers, so that in effect they would get them to subsidies borrowers who had loans at lower rates of interest for some years past.</P>
    <P>I do not know what happened overnight to Deputy O.J. Flanagan.  I think somebody must have spoken to him or he must have spoken to himself because last night he made what I told him across the floor of the House was the most constructive speech I have ever heard him make.  I do not say his speech today was unconstructive but there was a very different note in it. One of the things he said today was that in the operation of price controls, I as Minister for Industry and Commerce had caused the cost of living&mdash;I do not remember his exact words&mdash;to soar completely out of hand.</P>
    <P>The facts of the matter are that the consumer price index shows that between mid-May, 1967 and mid-August, 1967 there was no increase in the index; and that of the 3.24 per cent increase recorded in the mid-February-mid-May period of 1967, 1.99 per cent was attributable to the Prices Advisory Body's recommendation on flour and the Budget taxation on cigarettes and beer, the balance for all other items being only 1.25 per cent.  Whatever else may be said, this clearly indicates that to suggest that the operation of price control as administered by me and the Department has contributed to a substantial increase in the cost of living is a statement not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2172" /> A matter that has been raised by Deputy Sweetman, by, I think, Deputy Dillon and later by Deputy Cosgrave, is the question of the proposed operations of Ceimicí Teoranta&mdash;the proposal to produce potable alcohol and to sell it.  There are a few things that must be made clear about this matter. First of all, it is clear from the legislation that Ceimicí Teoranta are legally entitled to make this product.  It is also true to say that they have in fact done this and did it for some years; and when they did it, there was no evidence whatever to show they interfered with the reputation or the good name of the spirits produced by the Irish distillers.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Sweetman suggested that if Ceimicí Teoranta knew of a market for this product, it was their duty to reveal it, presumably to the whiskey distillers.  I do not accept that. First of all, the market available to them for the production of alcohol from potatoes would almost certainly not be available to the distillers for the production of spirits from grain. Secondly, I do not accept that it is the duty of Ceimicí Teoranta to produce information to the whiskey distillers about markets of this nature which they may discover and I want to explain to the House the background of this kind of operation on the part of Ceimicí Teoranta and to make it clear that this also applies to certain other State companies.</P>
    <P>The context in which this debate has taken place has been devoted largely to the question of the provision of employment throughout the country. There are various aspects of this and methods by which we can increase employment; but one of the ways in which it can be done and should be done, in my opinion, is to utilise the expertise and the knowledge, and indeed the capital, which is now available in State companies which is not being used to the full at the moment.  In pursuance of that idea.  I instructed Ceimicí Teoranta to examine the possibilities which exist for the expansion of their activities into activities which would be viable in a free trade context and which would provide further employment in this country.  This is the obligation of every State company <Col N="2173" /> of that order who are capable, by their nature, of doing this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not say State companies should rush around wildly into activities of this nature which would have the effect of wiping out private enterprise.  There is no net gain to the economy in that.  However, I believe firmly that every State company which can do so should expand and diversify its activities and provide further employment, always providing that doing so will not have the effect of wiping out private enterprise.  I have no information available to me to suggest that if Ceimicí Teoranta carry out this policy in respect of potable alcohol, they will damage the reputation of Irish spirits abroad, but I want to say this much: if I had such information, I should certainly look again at this programme.  I do not wish in any way to have the activities of Ceimicí Teoranta result in damage to the distillers of this country but I am not satisfied at all on any information I have that the proposed activities will have this effect.  If the reverse can be shown to me, I am prepared to talk again to Ceimicí Teoranta about the proposal.</P>
    <P>Talking about the distillers brings me to the contradictory views expressed during the debate.  On one hand, we had Deputy O.J. Flanagan who seemed to think that the whiskey distillers have been doing a great job. Deputy Cosgrave also, to some extent, seemed to be of the same opinion.  On the other hand, Deputy James Tully said he was not at all convinced they were doing a good job.  Let me say quite frankly that in this argument I agree with Deputy Tully.  I wish to make it clear that I am speaking of past performance, not the present, which I shall speak about in a moment.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the figures for Irish whiskey exports in the past, one can only conclude that the results have been piteous.  It is a strange thing that almost any Irishman in any part of the world will mention Irish whiskey first.  Yet if we look at the figures, we find Irish whiskey far down in our export lists.  Almost everyone gets on to the subject of Irish whiskey and <Col N="2174" /> some of the most vehement arguers are non-drinkers.  Having said that, I believe our distillers in recent times, having got together, have embarked on a sensible, aggressive policy of expansion. I wish them every success in that and I am willing to give every help I can in achieving the objectives they are trying to achieve.  However, in all fairness, it should be said that this operation probably would have been very much easier if it had been embarked on some years ago when everybody else in the country was advocating it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Sweetman was suggesting that I or some other people were decrying the value of profits.  I do not decry the value of profits at all: in fact, I am quite convinced that within the obvious limits all of us would lay down, the more the businessmen of this country make money, the better it will be for all of us because as they make money, they build up their businesses, build up employment, and that is what we are all interested in.  I do not wish unduly to restrict the profits businessmen can make, but in this whole context of free trade, there has been a suggestion from some Deputies that the Government are doing nothing to prepare industry for free trade, that they are providing no leadership in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to give the House a litany of all the things the Government have done during the years to prepare industry for free trade.  The House is well aware of the grants which have been given&mdash;half the cost, the consultative reports which is the first step we have to take and a grant of 25 per cent for implementing those, as recommended by the consultants. These are only the basic ones.  There are all sorts of supports available for exporters.</P>
    <P>If anybody can have any complaint not only against me but against my predecessors in this connection, it is probably that we seldom seem to talk about anything else except the necessity for adaptation for free trade and urge and spur on industry to prepare for this.  I think we should face up to the fact that we have a difficulty there. On the one hand, we have certain <Col N="2175" /> sectors of our industry which have not done their jobs so far in preparing for free trade.  We do not want those sectors of industry to have any sense of complacency.  Undoubtedly, if they do not take steps, they will be wiped out in free trade.  On the other hand, to harp all the time on this creates a sense of pessimism and gives the impression that Irish industry as a whole has not a hope in free trade.</P>
    <P>I believe that very large segments of our industry will not only survive but will do very well in free trade.  The evidence I would give of that is that if you look at the performance of our industry in recent years, you will see that it has been spectacularly successful on the export market, and this is the real test of ability to survive in free trade.  Very many of the new industries which have been set up in this country in recent years have been geared specifically to the export market and are already operating in markets all over the world and making good profits.  Many of our older firms have adapted and are already being phenomenally successful in export markets all over the world.  A number of them are selling their goods in EEC.  The amounts involved, relative to our whole trade, are not very large but some of them are operating in that market.  If you take the common external tariff and freight charges, some of them have to face up to 40 per cent on their goods before they can get into EEC but they are still selling.  Industry which can perform in that way will obviously, with free trade, do extremely well.  It will expand and also expand its employment.  Even if we are not in EEC, as a result of the Kennedy Round over the next three or four years, the level of tariffs in EEC will be reduced, on average 35 per cent. I feel that, on performance, a great segment of our industry will compete, and compete very successfully, in these conditions.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should not create an undue sense of pessimism in our people in regard to industry and its ability to compete.  Having said that, let me say again that there are still sectors of our industry which have not adapted to free trade and which, if <Col N="2176" /> they do not, will not survive.  I gave a great deal of thought to this problem after I took up this Ministry.  I came to the conclusion that one of the problems was that we had a failure of communication, that numerous exhortations were being made by Ministers, by the Taoiseach, by business leaders and trade union leaders but that we were not getting through to the people to whom the message was vital and these were perhaps in some cases smaller firms.  Many of the ones that really were adapting to free trade might have adapted, anyway, without any exhortation because they were that kind of firm.</P>
    <P>The problem of communication is not easy to solve, but, in an effort to do so, I have arranged meetings, some of which I have already had with the chairmen of the adaptation councils for various sectors of industry.  I have asked them for reports on their respective industries in relation to the CIO reports, how far they have progressed with the recommendations of the CIO reports in implementing them and, if they have not done so, why: what have been the difficulties and, in so far as the situation has changed and requires different measures, what are these measures.  I have got reports from most of them by now.  I shall have a further meeting with them shortly to go into these items in great detail.  I have already had a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I hope to have a further meeting with them in the not too distant future.  I am having meetings with various sectors of industry.  I am hoping to get through this communication barrier which does exist.  In these circumstances, anybody who suggests that the Government are not alive to the dangers of free trade or are doing nothing about them is really not himself aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Mullen and, I think, others to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  Deputy Mullen gave what I consider some very well-earned praise to that Institute.  It is doing a great job. Deputy Sweetman said the Government are not doing enough to encourage research  industry.  While I <Col N="2177" /> myself should like some more progress in this field, nevertheless I should like to remind him that most of our firms are medium or small and could not, of themselves, afford to carry out research. In the circumstances of this country, most of them are forced to rely on the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The Institute has been making a considerable amount of progress in contacting industries. They have been holding open days at which, this year, a number of industries were represented.  They have had various sectors of industry in.  They have gone out to meet them in the factories and on the workshop floor. The Industrial Reorganisation Branch of my Department is, all the time, where appropriate, drawing the attention of industry to the services available from the Institute and these services have been availed of to an increasing extent.  We should like to see more of that.  I think it is quite clear that we are on the right lines.  To the extent that the Institute needs strengthening, I shall try to assist it in that regard but the lines along which we have been moving have been the right ones and have been shown to be the right ones, having regard to the circumstances of this country.</P>
    <P>There have been a few references to the Potez factory in Baldonnel and I want to say a word about that.  I did promise the House that I would, when I was in a position to do so, make a full statement about the whole history of this project.  Unfortunately I am not in a position at this stage to make that statement, but I can say this much, that not so very long ago the number employed at Potez in Baldonnel was 40, and today it is 140.  That employment figure is going up and it is going to go up fairly steadily.  The work involved is largely the production of components for aircraft.  A great deal of progress has been made in establishing the suitability of the premises, of the equipment, and of the workers in relation to the aircraft companies which would be giving orders to an operation such as this.  The action that is taking place now, which has led to this increase in employment, is on the right lines in regard to what is required <Col N="2178" /> to get this factory operating at full pitch and with very considerable employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the firm abandoned the idea of building planes? Have they decided to manufacture components?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for the firm fully but I can tell the Deputy that there is no prospect in the short term future of building planes in that factory.</P>
      <P>I might perhaps mention that in the course of the debate references were made to the failure of some industrial projects.  The suggestion was either made or implied that not enough careful examination was done of projects when they were put forward originally. I do not know&mdash;I cannot speak for anything that happened in the past&mdash; but I can say that a good deal of care is taken by the IDA at present to get the right kind of technical advice in regard to a project which is technically involved.  If necessary, they will get a report from internationally accepted consultants in the particular field before proceeding any great distance with a project involving either any considerable amount of money or any degree of technical expertise.  One has to remember all the time that ideally you could build up a system of checks which would ensure that no project which was not an absolute sure-fire winner would get through but you would probably end up with no projects. While we must have regard to the taxpayers' money, nevertheless a certain amount of risk has got to be taken in these things.  While each of us subscribes to this in theory, in practice we tend to treat each individual case that goes wrong separately and to say: &ldquo;We subscribe to the theory but not in this case.&rdquo;  I am afraid it applies in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach suggested that we might give assistance in helping small towns around the country where they are trying to get industrial associations going, help them in preparing brochures giving the right kind of details and so on.  This is done to a very great degree <Col N="2179" /> by the IDA.  Indeed, they held a seminar in Athlone some months ago, which I opened, which was attended by people from all parts of the country and from the reports I have got from the people participating, it was extremely useful.  Not alone did they advise people in regard to how to go about getting industries but they had foreign industrialists who had set up here explaining how they reacted when they came here, the kind of things they looked for and so on.  It seemed to me to be a very worthwhile idea and I think they will repeat it.  Any town looking for that kind of assistance will get it from the IDA.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that many of our industries are competing very successfully in export markets but I should also say, in relation to the fears that have been expressed about what might happen if we go into the EEC, that all the information available to me is to the effect that the EEC, both the Member Countries and the Commission, would be very anxious to ensure that no country would suffer grievously by reason of joining the Common Market and they would be prepared to go to considerable lengths to ensure that that would not happen, if in fact there were grave danger of its happening.  I do not believe that if we do our job now, we would ever have to depend on that but it should be known that this is in fact the position.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of providing employment, various references have been made to the problem that arises because of the number of people coming off the land.  It is probably true to say, as some do, that a more intensive use of the land, a different form of farming in many ways, would maintain many more on the land, but even with that, clearly there are going to be more people than the land can maintain.  In dealing with that, we have of course industry, tourism, forestry and fishing, all of which have to be developed to meet this problem. As far as industry is concerned, the House is familiar with the programme we have been operating with regard to the attraction of foreign industry.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned, too, in the past to <Col N="2180" /> the House that we had a firm of industrial consultants engaged to review the incentives and the method of operation of the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal.  The report has now come to hand and it is a complete review of the whole industrialisation programme which is going on.  I hope to submit very shortly to the Government proposals for changes in that programme.  We must remember that we must not just depend on attracting foreign industry&mdash;and I think all of us on every side are in favour of that.  We have, as I mentioned earlier, the possibility of developing the use of the State companies, the activities of the State companies, the diversification of them into fields, particularly fields not covered at the moment by private enterprise.  There is scope for this, but we have to have a positive approach to it.  We have to want to see the State companies doing this, rather than look askance at anything they may do in this respect and say this was not what they were set up for.  If they are there, if they have expertise and capital and know-how&mdash; as many of them have&mdash;we must use all of this in our efforts to overcome unemployment. We must use this to build up our economy and provide employment for our people at home.</P>
    <P>But there is another aspect of the industrialisation programme of which the House has heard something before and on which I might say a word or two now.  This is the small industries programme which, as the House knows, has been operating since April on a trial basis in a pilot scheme in the areas of Carlow-Kilkenny, Limerick-Clare, Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon. So far, the indications which have come to us are that this is going to be a very worthwhile programme.  Already we have discovered that a number of existing small industries have considerable prospects of expansion, provided they get various kinds of help.  Naturally, in most cases the first priority for help is money; but this is not the only thing.  We are providing them with money, but we are also providing them with know-how in marketing, design and management.</P>
    <P>In the main, we have been dealing <Col N="2181" /> almost exclusively with existing small industries.  We have had a few cases of new small industries starting up.  We would, I hope, have a good many more.  At the moment I can give only a very brief interim report to the House.  While we have not finalised the scheme&mdash;it is a pilot scheme&mdash;we will probably have to make some changes when we extend it to the whole country, as I hope we will do in 12 months or so.  However, it would seem from our experience so far that this is a worthwhile programme and one that could be of considerable importance in maintaining employment in villages and towns throughout Ireland, especially in the context of our setting up poles of development.  To towns not chosen and deprived of any prospect of an industry, I would point out that the small industries programme has considerable potential so far as they are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to answer that offhand.  I am just guessing if I say hundreds.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked that some comment be made on the suggestion that an industrial zone be set up covering Limerick, Shannon and Ennis. I would remind the House that this was suggested in the Lichfield Report.  In the general review of our industrialisation programme to which I have referred, it is, of course, one of the things being very seriously considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon seems to feel concerned about what he felt was the wholesale takeover of sections of our distributive trades by foreign firms. Statistics are not available on this, but there is no evidence that this practice is widespread, or indeed that there is any net increase in foreign ownership. Recently, a foreign-owned chain of shops has been offered for sale and a large department store owned by big foreign interests has closed down.  In the circumstances, I feel it is an exaggeration for him to <Col N="2182" /> suggest that this country is the happy hunting ground for foreign interests looking for new developments.  This is not quite so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also asked why are we joining the GATT and what were the advantages and disadvantages.  I would remind him that this is the organ, the instrument, of the vast majority of the trading countries of the world.  It has 74 members.  We are a country dependent on foreign trade to a tremendous extent.  For us not to be members of GATT, particularly when we are proposing to join the EEC, would, on the face of it, be peculiar.  As members of the GATT, we would be entitled to all the tariff concessions which were negotiated in the GATT over the years past, including those in the recent Kennedy Round.  The GATT is increasingly getting itself involved in agricultural matters and this is, of course, of particular interest to us.  It is clearly the major international organisation dealing with trade.  As I have said, we as a trading nation would be at a considerable disadvantage if we were not members of it.  As far as the disadvantages of joining it are concerned, I suppose one might say the general limitation on our freedom in regard to protection.  But, since we are already committed under the Free Trade Area Agreement and, we would hope, the EEC in this regard, there is really not any sacrifice on our part in joining the GATT.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan made some remarks about Córas Tráchtála, which I must say surprised me a little.  It is the first time I have heard anybody in the House having anything other than praise for Córas Tráchtála.  He is going on the basis of information he received from somebody in America. I think I know what the explanation is, although I am not too sure of this. All the information I have from our exporters is that they are extremely pleased with the help they get from Córas Tráchtála.  Some of them may say they would prefer some services not provided or some of them may say services are provided they do not need, but this is to be expected when covering a whole range of exporters.  By <Col N="2183" /> and large, all of them have nothing but the highest praise for Córas Tráchtála and its officers.</P>
    <P>I think what may have happened in the case in America to which the Deputy referred was this.  Someone was concerned to sell Irish goods in New York and could not get continuity of supply from the people supplying him. He tended to blame Córas Tráchtála for this.  Córas Tráchtála make tremendous efforts to ensure that exporters live up to their promises, deliver on the due date and ensure continuity of supply.  Indeed, after every promotion they do abroad, there is a general follow-up with exporters to try to keep them on their toes.  Ultimately, there is not a lot Córas Tráchtála can do to firms who do not toe the line, other than to tell them that, if they do not, they will not receive any further assistance from Córas Tráchtála because they are damaging our whole record abroad as exporters.</P>
    <P>There is another misconception, particularly in the American market, and it is this.  You have a large number of people of Irish descent in the United States.  People seem to think it follows from this that you should be able to sell Irish goods very easily there.  The truth of the matter is that when you are selling in a retail store, there are very few retail stores in America where the customers are predominantly of Irish descent.  Therefore, those stores have to cater for the general customer one would get anywhere in the United States, and to concentrate specifically on people of Irish descent has been demonstrated, from an economic point of view, to be quite unsound.  Our goods have to compete in the United States, and indeed in other markets, on their own merits, on their quality and on their price, and it is on this basis that they do compete.  Córas Tráchtála have, in my opinion, very wisely concentrated on this aspect. They have concentrated their efforts either on stores or on general merchandise buyers, not on the general public, in these markets abroad.  I think this is one of the misconceptions under which some people labour and they blame Córas Tráchtála when <Col N="2184" /> they do not understand what Córas Tráchtála are, in fact, aiming at.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was raised by Deputy Donegan, in particular, was the question of flour millers and the losses sustained by them.  The situation which arose in regard to the flour millers is this: the flour millers proposed to increase their prices very substantially without my authority under the Prices Act.  When I pointed out to them that they were not entitled to do this, they decided to flout my authority as Minister for Industry and Commerce and to flout the Prices Act, and proceeded to increase prices to the levels they were proposing.</P>
    <P>I was obliged to deal with that situation which I could only regard as a threat to the authority of the Government. I did deal with that situation, I think, effectively.  However, I recognise the difficulty that is involved, and I do not know that there is any satisfactory solution to this difficulty in price control.  If there has to be a public inquiry set up, as there has to be on occasion, one is then, on the one hand, trying to achieve justice for the people who are selling the goods and who are looking for the increase in prices, to give them a fair hearing, and, on the other hand, to have regard to the interests of the consumer.  However, under the necessary procedure of a Prices Advisory Body, there has to be considerable delay before one gets any report.  This is inevitable, but, in the meantime, if the manufacturers concerned are waiting for price increases and not getting them, they could in certain circumstances, and indeed in some circumstances did, suffer serious loss.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me to be just that they should have to suffer this kind of loss, and the arrangements to which I came in regard to the flour millers were designed to ensure that there was a fair hearing, that justice was done both to the flour millers and to the consumer, that the flour millers would not be penalised by the length of time taken to investigate the matter.  I undertook with the flour millers that if the Prices Advisory Body recommended any increase, they would get that increase from the date they applied for the increase <Col N="2185" /> in the normal way.  This seemed to me to be the best way to ensure that justice was done.</P>
    <P>The amount which the Prices Advisory Body found to be due to them on this basis of recoupment was £297,500.  They had some savings on hands in respect of profits, if you like, made on imported wheat the previous year from which they had been obliged to pay a sum to An Bord Gráin to meet the balance of that body's losses on unmillable and potentially millable wheat.  This left them a net saving of £160,500.  The difference between that and the amount the Prices Advisory Body found to be due to them was £137,000.  This is the sum I am asking the Dáil to give.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan, in discussing this, suggested that it was not necessary to hold a Prices Advisory Body inquiry at all, that nothing was gained by this, and that I had simply lost money to the taxpayer.  He said this was as plain as two and two making four, and I said: &ldquo;But what if two and two make six?&rdquo;, and he said that they did not in this case, that the flour millers did not look for any more than they got.  I want to put it on record that the flour millers, by and large, looked for sums amounting to twice the amount of the increases they got.  In the case of bakers' flour, they sought an increase of 22/- per sack; they were awarded an increases of 11/3d. In the case of shop flour, they sought 18/10d and they got 8/8d.  In the case of bakers' wheaten meal, they sought 17/2d.; they got 9/10d.  In the case of shop wheaten meal, they sought 14/8d; they got 7/8d.  I want that on record because I want Deputy Donegan to realise that his statement that nothing at all was gained by the Prices Advisory Body is utterly without foundation.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other major items were raised in the debate to which I should reply.  I just want to conclude by making it crystal clear that the Government&mdash;and I, in particular, as Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;are well aware of the considerable difficulties that are facing Irish industry in free trade conditions, and that we <Col N="2186" /> are pursuing a vigorous policy designed to ensure that Irish industry will not alone survive but will prosper in these conditions.  I told the House earlier that I believe large sectors of industry are in that position already, but it is the other sectors of industry we have to worry about.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it is my conviction that if I had to pick out one particular requirement which is necessary if these sectors of industry are to survive, I would pick out one in relation to management, the adjustment of management to free trade and training in management.  We have still a fair number of firms&mdash;sometimes they are family firms&mdash;the management of which has not adjusted.  It does not matter what effort the workers make, unless management is adapting itself to free trade, the workers cannot.  They need leadership, and they cannot direct the operations of the firm.  Where management has adapted, they do not always get the full co-operation of the workers; in general they do, but there are some cases in which they do not.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear in regard to priorities. The first and most immediate priority is management.  We shall get nowhere unless management adapts itself to the prevailing conditions.  A great deal has been done in recent years to improve the standard of management in this country, but we have got to do a great deal more and we have got to do it as a matter of urgency and top priority.  I believe that with that approach, with the communication to all levels of industry, to all our people, of the importance of adaptation, of efficiency in industry, and above all, as has been mentioned in the debate, the importance of supporting our own industry, if we can get this across, and if we can convey to our people that the next few years represent perhaps one of the most testing times this country has ever faced, that we need to have the spirit of dedication, of devotion to our country's interests that was displayed by our fathers' generation&mdash;and we need that devotion; we need that spirit&mdash;if we can get that, we are not <Col N="2187" /> alone going to survive, but we are going to reach a level of standard of living and of employment which this country has never known.  We have the opportunity and whether we succeed or not depends entirely on us. Let us not fool ourselves that it depends on any other country or a leader of any other country.  It depends on nobody but ourselves, the Irish people, and what we do in dealing with it.  I believe that we have difficulties but that we are going to overcome them, that we are going to show what kind of spirit that is needed and in doing so, that we are going to ensure that our children will have a much better Ireland in which to live than we or our parents have had.</P>
