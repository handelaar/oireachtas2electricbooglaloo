    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he has received representations from Irish societies in the Glasgow area about the inadequacy of travel facilities available from Scotland to Donegal and to other western areas in Ireland; and what steps he proposes to take to improve the facilities available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a copy of a document circulated by the United Irish Societies, Glasgow, about travel facilities between Scotland and Ireland.</P>
      <P>The provision of shipping services is primarily a matter for the shipping companies concerned but, because of the tourist interest involved, Bord Fáilte keep the services under review and make representations to the companies for the improvement of facilities where this is considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Burns &amp; Laird Lines, Ltd., discontinued passenger services between Glasgow and Derry in September, 1966, for economic reasons. There are, however, daily sailings on the Glasgow-Belfast and Ardrossan-Belfast routes and capacity on the latter route is to be expanded by the introduction later this year of a new vessel with capacity for 1,200 passengers and 160 cars on each crossing. On the Larne-Stranraer route there are four round trip sailings each day during the Summer period providing a <Col N="1240" /> daily route capacity for 8,000 passengers and 900 cars.  There are connecting bus services between Belfast, Donegal and holiday centres in the West of Ireland.  A joint express bus service by Córas Iompair Éireann and Ulsterbus now operates between Belfast and Gaway.</P>
    <P>Travel facilities by air between Scotland and Ireland, including Belfast, are carrying increasing numbers of passengers. In addition, an independent airline operating between Glasgow and Derry has announced that six flights a day will operate in each direction from 14th July.</P>
    <P>I am arranging for Bord Fáilte to keep the position under review and to maintain liaison with the transport companies concerned with a view to ensuring adequate and satisfactory services for passengers between Scotland and Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact we have closed down altogether the service from Scotland to Derry, is it not a bit late in the day to be announcing that we propose to augment the steamer service later on this year, this being the 5th of July?  We do not expect tourists to arrive in November or December, I suppose?  Surely to goodness, if the Minister were acting effectively as Minister for Transport and Power, in view of all the excursions that go on between here and Belfast &mdash;up and down&mdash;and the virtual amalgamation with a great flourish of trumpets of the tourist boards in the two areas, one would imagine some better consideration would be provided for persons travelling from Glasgow area and western Scotland to Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal than what the Minister has announced?</P>

      <P>Through the work of my Department and Bord Fáilte, the services across the Irish Sea have been expanded, and also through the reorganisation of British Railways, constantly and continuously in the past five years.  But it is true, as the Deputy says, that I cannot guarantee that the propaganda and promotions of either Bord Fáilte or in this case Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, who have co-ordinated their work and who co-operate together, can necessarily be reflected in an improvement which is exactly equivalent to the demand for traffic in the year in question. All I can say is that I am quite content, looking back on our past record, that we have achieved improvements, even if they have not always been at the exact moment when they were required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has considered the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Liam O'Mahoney in the Garda Bridewell in Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1242" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this tragic death first came to my notice, my immediate response&mdash;and the response of the Garda Commissioner&mdash;was that the fullest inquiries should be made and that all relevant facts should be made available to the next-of-kin and presented at the inquest.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary for me to stress that I accept without question that, if a person dies while in Garda custody, the public interest requires that there should be the most thorough investigation of the facts and that the facts should be fully ventilated.  It is, however, equally in the public interest that what is ventilated should be the truth, as far as the truth can be ascertained from the facts available.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, where an inquest has been held, there could be no question of my making any comment on the matters at issue.  A jury's verdict speaks for itself.  I regret to say, however, that, in connection with this unfortunate tragedy, not only had the Garda Síochána been made the victims of all sorts of rumours before the inquest&mdash;this, perhaps, was understandable&mdash;but, since the inquest, attempts have been made to undermine public confidence in the Garda investigations and in the jury's verdict. In these circumstances, it is necessary for me to correct the misrepresentations that have been resorted to so that the significance of the jury's verdict may not become obscured.</P>
      <P>It has publicly been alleged that the jury did not deal at all with the question of how the deceased man received his injuries&mdash;that they said nothing about it.  That is incorrect.  It is on public record that the jury explicitly adverted to this and said that the available evidence was insufficient to show how he received the injuries.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged that the Garda withheld information from the next-of-kin. This, too, is incorrect.  Every scrap of information collected by the Garda Síochána, including a copy of every one of more than 60 statements taken by the Garda, was given to the solicitor for the next-of-kin six days before the opening of the inquest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> An attempt has been made to undermine public confidence in the jury by suggesting that they were hand-picked by the police.  The fact is of course that none of the Gardaí whose conduct might in any possible way come under scrutiny had anything to do with the empanelling of the jury.  In accordance with standard practice, it was the Garda who approached members of the public to serve on the jury but, because of the rumours that had been going about, senior officers of the Force in Cork took particular care to see that those approached would be people whose character, reputation and general standing were such that not even the most prejudiced observer could have any <i>bona fide</i> doubt about either their independence or their competence.</P>
    <P>Yet these jurors, identifiable people who freely gave their time and their talents to this duty, who live and work in the same city as the deceased man, now find their integrity publicly impugned by people who, I venture to say, can know nothing about them. This reflection on the integrity of the jury must seem all the more unfortunate when we realise that the group responsible were themselves legally represented at the inquest and that their legal representative went out of his way to tell the jury that he knew that they would exercise their functions as jurors fairly and fearlessly.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that has been made is that the State Solicitor was not impartial.  It is no part of my duty as Minister for Justice to defend or explain the manner in which the State Solicitor acted.  I simply record, as a fact, that it was not the State Solicitor but the Coroner who conducted the inquest.  The State Solicitor was present to represent the Garda just as another solicitor was present to represent the next-of-kin.</P>
    <P>I now come to the heart of the matter, which is this.  As I have already said, every scrap of evidence that the Garda Síochána could get was first of all handed over to the solicitor for the next-of-kin and given again at the inquest. Here I would like to give a personal assurance.  All the documents&mdash;<Col N="1244" /> the statements, the Garda reports and the medical evidence&mdash;have been re-examined in detail by me and I am satisfied, beyond all shadow of doubt, that every fact which the Garda were able to unearth in the course of exhaustive inquiries was made available for the jury to consider.  Moreover, every witness who could contribute any material information attended and gave evidence on oath and was open to cross-examination.  The Garda witnesses, in particular, were subjected to severe cross-examination.  Nobody suggested them, and nobody has since suggested, that there is any other relevant evidence that can be obtained.  The Coroner, whose impartiality is not open to question, stated in his summing-up that there was no evidence at all of ill-treatment by the Gardaí.  And the jury, after deliberating for about an hour, unanimously decided that they had insufficient evidence to show how the deceased received his injuries.</P>
    <P>In the course of this inquest, the finger was pointed especially at particular, identifiable members of the Garda Síochána and the jury were asked to bring in a verdict to the effect that the deceased received his fatal injuries while under their care and, by inference, at their hands.  The jury declined to do this.  By doing so, the jury let it be known that they had no evidence that would justify such a finding. Because of the situation in which these particular members of the Force have found themselves, through no fault of theirs but arising from their duties, I am glad to have this opportunity to say publicly that, as far as the Garda authorities are concerned, it is not just a question of there being no evidence&mdash; in the minds of their superior officers there is not even a shadow of suspicion against them.  On that point, I think it is also right, in the particular circumstances, to place on record that I have spoken personally not only to the Commissioner but to the Chief Superintendent, Cork city, who has an intimate knowledge of all the members concerned, and that every one of them has an exemplary record of service.</P>
    <P>In saying all this, I do not lose sight of the fact that the central question&mdash; how the deceased man received the <Col N="1245" /> fatal injuries&mdash;remains unanswered. This is an unfortunate fact, but it cannot be solved by ill-considered calls for an independent sworn inquiry. The Coroner's inquest was, in itself, an independent sworn inquiry and no attempts to undermine its findings can be allowed to obscure the fact that it was not, in practice at all events, in any way limited in its investigations. There can be no getting away from the fact that there is no source of evidence available to any further tribunal that might be established that has not already been available to the Coroner's inquest.  Naturally, if some new evidence were to come to light that would be likely to provide the answer, a new situation would be created but, as matters stand, there is nothing more that can usefully be done.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I would like to mention.  It is undoubtedly a fact that the deceased man asked for a doctor and that his request was not acceded to by the members concerned, who thought that his condition was due to over-indulgence in drink.  In the light of what subsequently transpired, I have arranged with the Commissioner that a provision should now be added to the Garda code to the effect that if a person who is being detained in Garda custody alleges that he needs a doctor, either because he has been injured or is ill, the Garda will take steps to secure the services of a doctor for him unless it is beyond doubt that the request is frivolous; and likewise they will call in a doctor if a person being detained in custody is in an unconscious or semi-conscious condition, unless from their previous knowledge of the person or from the circumstances they are quite sure that his condition is due simply to overindulgence in drink and that he is not in any danger.</P>
    <P>I should like, in conclusion, to offer my sympathy to the family of the deceased man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the very full newspaper reports which appeared in <Col N="1246" /> the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the three Dublin daily newspapers which covered the inquest very extensively on each day of the hearing and, in addition to that, I had all the documents, statements and reports on which the evidence at the inquest was based.  I have examined these documents in very minute detail since the inquest and I find that there is no fact that is in any way material in those documents that was not subsequently given in evidence at the inquest and reported in the daily press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House why he did not have a stenographer present at the inquest so that he would have had access to a complete verbatim report of everything that transpired?  Will he agree that that would have been the sensible thing to do instead of relying on newspaper reports which were necessarily truncated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspaper reports were certainly not materially truncated.  I do not think that any useful purpose is served by arguing this.  I have examined the reports and I am aware that there is not one fact of any material value excluded from these reports.  They contain every material fact, as I know from my own examination of all the documentation in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the Minister's examination of the reports.  I am asking him why he did not have available at the inquest for his own information and that of the House a shorthand record of every word that transpired at the inquest. Would the Minister not agree that this would be the sensible thing because it would help to clarify matters and dispel existing doubts in the minds of the people of Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the very thorough nature of the reporting of the inquest and subsequent examination of the files, I think this is very much a side issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister say that there was a thorough report of the inquest at which he was not <Col N="1247" /> present?  The inquest went on all day and there were seven or eight columns in the papers, so it could not have been a complete report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister this question.  Sharing his belief, as I do, that the Garda are blameless in this matter, does he not think that it is in the public interest, as there is no verbatim report of the Coroner's proceedings on record anywhere and in view of the fact that there was a similar though by no means identical incident in another part of the country 12 months ago, there should now be a sworn public inquiry into the whole matter, with a verbatim report, in order to reassure not only the people of Cork but all over Ireland that the reputation of the Garda is untarnished? Does he not think that there should be such a sworn inquiry into the whole matter so that the vindication of the Garda can be effective and so that, if any further material transpired, the persons responsible, if anyone was responsible for this man's death, would be brought to justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My immediate response to this and the Commissioner's response on hearing about this was to allay public suspicion by announcing, as we in fact did, a very thorough and exhaustive investigation and in furnishing the result of that investigation fully and openly to the solicitor acting for the deceased's next-of-kin. This took place.  There was a very full and exhaustive hearing at the inquest at which newspaper reporters were present representing several newspapers. There is very considerable documentation of the whole matter which I have examined since the inquest.  If, as a result of all that, I could see the slightest prospect that any further material fact might emerge, I might accord with what Deputy Dillon has suggested but I am satisfied from the assessment of all that I have indicated that any further inquiry would merely be a duplication of the very exhaustive sworn inquiry which has already taken place in the form of the inquest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister <Col N="1248" /> this question?  Deeply as we all sympathise with the next-of-kin of the deceased man, in the context in which we are now speaking, whatever sympathy suggests, that cannot be the primary consideration.  The primary consideration is that there should be established in the public mind the absolute confidence our people have traditionally had in the Garda Síochána and I want them vindicated before a sworn inquiry to which any interested citizen can come and offer any little of evidence that he alleges he has.  The time has come to stop rumour and, if there is anybody who knows the back streets of this city or of Cork and if there is anybody who knows something or thinks he knows something, set up a tribunal and tell him to come there and tell under privilege what he knows and that it will be examined and investigated.  Because, it is not the next-of-kin&mdash;who are probably satisfied with the coroner's court &mdash;it is the people who are anxious to see the reputation of the Garda Síochána vindicated.  I am certain that it will be but I want it done in public and I want the rumour-mongers brought into public and made to repeat their rumours openly where they can be cross-examined.  If you do not do that, I warn you that the rumour-mongers will have a field day. I do not want them to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the effort and the place where he tried to have this investigation have proved abortive, that a coroner's inquest was not the place for this type of inquiry and that, because of the limitations under the Coroners Act, everybody is dissatisfied with the nature of the investigation?  Is it not time, in fairness to everybody involved, that the Minister appointed somebody responsible to hold a public inquiry at which evidence can be presented, cross-examination take place and the investigation put on the normal basis, not on this kind of &ldquo;blow hot, blow cold&rdquo; limitations under the Coroners Act where the jury are very limited in what their investigation can be?  The nature of the investigation wanted now is a cold, searching investigation that will find the facts as they really are. <Col N="1249" /> As suggested by Deputy Dillon, if the situation is that the Gardaí are blameless in the matter&mdash;and that is a view that we should hope would ultimately emerge&mdash;the time has come for us to try to arrive at that happy result and to stop the seething mass of rumour, counter-rumour and suggestion going on in the city of Cork and its environs as a result of this abortive inquest.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> On the question of procedure, am I right in thinking that the Minister has at his disposal a verbatim account of the State case as presented to the coroner's court in the form of verbatim statements taken by the Garda and submitted to the Minister but that in so far as anything that was elicited by those representing the next-of-kin the Minister has relied on a press report which is necessarily sketchy and very much abbreviated and does the Minister not think that it would have been no more than prudent for him to have had there a stenographer who would have taken a verbatim note?  Further, has the Minister adverted to the fact that the State Solicitor who represented the authorities there seems, as far as one can gather from the press reports, to have behaved in a rather flippant manner and to have alleged that the solicitor appearing for the next-of-kin was electioneering rather than conducting the cross-examination of the State witnesses in the best interests of his clients?  In all the circumstances, and while agreeing with Deputy Dillon that there is probably no blame to be attached to anybody, would the Minister not think that he should have a full-scale inquiry?  Finally, am I correct in thinking that the jurors for a coroner's inquest are not selected at random as they are for other court trials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Over 60 statements, and the whole of the results of the Garda investigation, were made available to the solicitor acting for the deceased's next-of-kin six days before the hearing.  That in itself was a more valuable protection and greater assurance that truth would eventually emerge than any verbatim report of the actual hearing.  Every single fact that could be elicited or that might be elicited in order to illuminate every aspect of the matter was available to the solicitor acting for the deceased's next-of-kin six days before the actual hearing.  That in my own view is a major assurance that the public have had in this matter.  In addition to that, you have a sworn inquiry, which in effect is what an inquest is, into the cause of death.</P>

Finally, the point made by Deputy Barrett that the unfortunate deceased person was in a state of good health on arrival at the barracks is certainly at total variance with the facts.  If the Deputy reads any of the newspaper reports to which I have referred, the facts quite clearly show that the unfortunate deceased was in anything but a good state of health long before his arrival at the station.</P>

      <P>Secondly, I want to ask the Minister, is it proper for the senior officers of the Garda in summoning a coroner's jury carefully to select seven men of deemed probity?  I understood that the procedure under the Coroners Act was to invite seven men chosen by chance in order that there should be no possibility of the Garda officers choosing seven men whom they deem to be men of principle.  The whole jury system rests on the chance that you get 12 average citizens in a jury case, seven in a coroner's jury case, average citizens, not seven men of chosen probity. For the protection of the Garda, I am asking the Minister if he will not have a sworn inquiry so that those who are promulgating rumour not only in Cork but in every city and town in Ireland will be challenged to go to the inquiry to speak their rumours there; and if they do not, then those of us to whom they repeat them can tell them to shut their mouths and can say: &ldquo;Why the hell do you not go to the inquiry?&rdquo; I shall help any rumour-monger to get to the inquiry.</P>

There is not a scintilla of evidence available yet to me or to the Garda authorities which would indicate that another inquiry would not be other than a repetition <Col N="1253" /> of the coroner's inquiry.  However, I want to assure the House that if any further fact emerges which would induce me in the slightest degree to have any doubt about any aspect of the evidence given at the inquest, I shall certainly see if an inquiry as suggested by Deputy Dillon would help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I say that it is now known that he was then in a poor state of health.  I have had discussions with the Commissioner on that aspect, the question of the arrangements to get a doctor in such cases, and we are amending the Garda code to ensure that where a person requests a doctor in those circumstances a doctor will be sent for by the Garda concerned.  I should like to bring some air of reality into this matter as far as the Gardaí are concerned.  Every night in Dublin and Cork there are not just one or <Col N="1254" /> two but hundreds of people in a similar condition to this unfortunate man coming into Garda stations.  The Gardaí take the human view that the people concerned are drunk.  This human view was taken on this particular occasion by the Garda concerned, that the unfortunate man was merely drunk, and an error of judgment was made.</P>

This is a case which had agitated me, agitated the public and every Deputy here.  The jury had all the facts available before them. It was for them to decide if these facts enabled them to ascertain the cause of death.  They found themselves unable to ascertain the circumstances of death; nor at the moment, through the Garda and all the other resources available, have we been able to obtain any further evidence which would enable any other jury or any other sworn inquiry or any other tribunal to come to any conclusion other than that arrived at by the Coroner's jury.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the <Col N="1256" /> British National Insurance Acts title to sickness benefit normally ceases at age 65 for men and at age 60 for women and therefore the Reciprocal Agreement with Great Britain, in so far as it refers to sickness benefit, does not cover persons over those ages.  Such persons may be entitled to British retirement pensions, which are payable here.</P>
      <P>However, under the Agreement, persons resident here who have a provisional title to a British retirement pension but who have not retired may, if they fall ill, be paid benefit at the rates applicable under the Social Welfare Acts or at the British retirement pension rate, whichever is the lower.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree it is unfair that somebody who has been working here, is insured, goes to England, and is working there and is insured, and returns here and works for a period, becomes ill and draws sickness benefit until he is 65, should then be informed he can no longer be paid, even though he has a wife and family to support, because he is over 65, despite the fact that he has enough stamps, if the English stamps are included, and despite the fact that there is no retirement benefit at 65 in this country? Does the Minister not think he must be consistent about this?  These people should either be allowed to continue to count the British stamps and draw their sickness benefit or be given retirement benefit at 65 here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already explained to the Deputy, persons aggrieved in the circumstances outlined in the question would need to have a very poor contribution record, because, if they provisionally qualify for retirement benefit under the English record stamps, they are entitled to opt for retirement benefit or, if working here and they become ill, they can get sickness benefit at the lower rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that over 156 stamps are required to qualify for over 12 months' benefit and, if they are only qualified for British retirement benefit, <Col N="1257" /> they find themselves in the position, if they have wives and children in this country, of being entitled to only about £2 14s a week.  Does the Minister not agree that the proper thing would be to allow them to qualify for sickness benefit, small as it is, so that they will not have to look for home assistance to supplement the meagre amount they are getting?</P>

      <P>The historical position is that on Friday last the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries had a meeting with two groups representing the owners of livestock marts.  He had another meeting on Monday with the National Agricultural Council.  It was anticipated that, as a result of these two meetings, there might be amendments which he would like to introduce to the Livestock Marts Bill.  It was hoped that these amendments would have been communicated to the Opposition on that evening and arrangements were made accordingly. The amendments, of course, could not properly be drafted, but the content <Col N="1259" /> of the amendments, it was hoped, would be communicated.  Unfortunately, that did not prove possible.  The Order of Business included the Marts Bill for yesterday but, when I discovered that the sense of the amendments had not been communicated to the Opposition, I instructed that the Marts Bill in Committee should not proceed yesterday.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the typescript copies of the amendments were circulated. It was hoped that the green print, which would put these amendments in their proper order, would have been circulated this morning. That did not prove possible either. They have now been circulated.  I should like to record that the green print contains no more and no less than what was circulated in the typescript already in the hands of Deputies.  That is the sequence of events.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £278,600 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, including a Grant-in-Aid; and of the Public Records Office, and of the Keeper of State Papers and for the purchase of Historical Documents, etc.</P>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose, as in previous years, to treat the six Votes as one group so that there may be one general discussion, without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise a particular point on any individual Vote.  The period to be reviewed in connection with the present Estimates is much shorter than is normal; Deputies will recall that the debate on last year's Estimate did not conclude until December last and ranged over the principal events and developments up to then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £11,561,550.  The total provision for the year 1966-67 was £11,568,220.  The total provision for the present year is <Col N="1263" /> therefore lower by £6,670 than the corresponding figure for last year.  The position is that provision for the Garda Síochána shows a reduction of £146,000, but this reduction is offset almost exactly by increases totalling £140,000 on the other Votes.  The reason for the apparent reduction in the provision for the Garda Síochána is that the 1966-67 figures included provision for substantial back-money arising from salary increases awarded during the year under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice caters for the staff and services of the Department's headquarters, and shows an increase of £12,590.  This increase is due principally to the tenth round increase in remuneration and to normal incremental progression.</P>
    <P>I propose to refer only briefly to my Department's law reform activities, as I dealt with these in detail here last November.  Several very important pieces of legislation have come into operation within the past few months. These are the Registration of Title Act, 1964, and the Succession Act, 1965, which came into operation on 1st January last, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, which came into operation on 1st March, and the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, which became law on 9th May.</P>
    <P>New Land Registration Rules under the Registration of Title Act were made by the Registration of Title Rules Committee with my concurrence and these also came into force on 1st January.  New probate rules will be necessary under the Succession Act and these are at present being drafted by the Superior Courts Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>Eight new district probate registries were established as from 1st January in Clonmel, Donegal, Dundalk, Galway, Mullingar, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford.  There were already six district probate registries in Castlebar, Cavan, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford, so that there are now in all 14 district registries in operation. <Col N="1264" /> These provide a convenient local service throughout the country for persons wishing to take out grants of representation in respect of the estates of deceased persons.  The President of the High Court has already prescribed the new form of administration bond.</P>
    <P>I have at present under consideration the contents of six interim reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  Three of these reports deal with the jury system, one deals with the question of increased jurisdiction for the Circuit and District Courts and the other two deal with proposals for the reorganisation of the structure of the courts on the criminal side.  I shall in due course be introducing legislative proposals to deal with all these matters.  The Criminal Procedure Act, based on the first report of the Committee, has been enacted and will come into operation on 1st August The main object of this Act is to achieve the virtual abolition of the deposition-taking procedure.</P>
    <P>I am awaiting an interim report from the Landlord and Tenant Commission on the first specific matter which I referred to them, namely, the law relating to the renewal of business tenancies.  My legislative proposals on any recommendations they may make will follow without delay.  The Commission is also taking evidence on the second specific question they have been asked to investigate, namely, whether persons other than those already entitled should be given the right to purchase the fee simple or to obtain a reversionary lease.</P>
    <P>I hope to bring before the Oireachtas later this year proposals to amend the law governing the payment of compensation in respect of malicious injuries to property and persons.  A summary of the report of an Interdepartmental Committee which examined this question was published in 1965.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been commenced at official level on the question of having arrangements for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders and other court judgments between ourselves and Northern Ireland and Britain.  In any legislation to give effect <Col N="1265" /> to any such arrangements provision will also be made for the enforcement of court orders between the State and all other jurisdictions and for other aspects of mutual assistance between courts, such as the service of documents and the taking of evidence for foreign courts.  I expect to be in a position to report substantial progress in this field by the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>Other measures in contemplation include legislation to modernise procedure in the Registry of Deeds and to amend the law of trusts.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board made 1,178 orders in 1966.  This is the highest number ever and, in fact, there has been a steady increase in the number of orders being made in recent years. The proportion of children placed by adoption societies is the same as last year, 77 per cent, and I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work being done by those societies, of which there are now 21.  Six hundred and nineteen of the orders made in 1966 were in respect of boys and 559 in respect of girls.  The Board continues to facilitate adoption by holding sessions outside Dublin.  Twenty-nine out of a total of 82 meetings held during the year were held in various cities and towns other than Dublin.</P>
    <P>While there has been little change over the years in the number of aliens registered as being resident here for three months or more, the influx of visitors is increasing at a rapid rate. Apart altogether from those who came here from Britain or Northern Ireland, nearly 96,000 came here in 1966 as compared with 83,000 in 1965.  These figures do not, of course, include Irish citizens or British subjects.  The increase in the influx of alien visitors poses problems for the immigration service and, in common with other Government Departments that are also affected, my Department has been giving active consideration to these problems.</P>
    <P>Seventy-nine persons were naturalised in 1966 as compared with 83 in 1965, bringing the total of all persons naturalised since 1935, when provision for naturalisation was made, to 2,560.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> The Film Censor examined 1,016 films, with a total footage of 3,084,525, in 1966.  Both the number and the footage show an increase on the previous year's figures, which were 996 and 2,870,000 respectively.  Of the total of 1,016 films, 878 were passed <i>in toto</i>, 89 were passed with cuts and 49 were rejected.  The Censorship of Films Appeal Board examined 77 films.  In the case of 22 the appeals were against cuts.  Nine films were rejected by the Appeal Board, one was passed with cuts for general viewing and 41 were passed for limited viewing, 26 of them with cuts.  In the case of the 22 appeals against cuts, the cuts were varied in 15 cases and unaltered in seven.  In all 93 films were passed for viewing on &ldquo;limited&rdquo; certificates, that is, conditions were inserted prohibiting their exhibition to audiences under a given age.</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board examined 390 books and nine periodicals in 1966.  Twenty-one books were examined as the result of formal complaints from members of the public and 368 on reference by officers of customs and excise.  One book was examined on the Board's own initiative. The Board made 160 prohibition orders in respect of books and three in respect of periodicals.  Appeals were lodged with the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board in respect of one book and one periodical.  Neither appeal was successful.  The Censorship of Publications Bill, which is now in its final stages, provides for a time limit of 12 years for prohibition orders made in respect of books on the ground that they are indecent or obscene and revocation of the provision that requires the right of appeal against a prohibition order in respect of a book to be taken within 12 months.</P>
    <P>Transfers of testamentary documents from the Principal and District Probate Registries and from the courts continued until October, 1966, when the intake of records had temporarily to be suspended owing to building operations on the two-storey extension to the Public Records Office to provide additional accommodation for the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> The Irish Manuscripts Commission is continuing its work on the preparation for publication of the Calendar to the Council Book of 1581-86, the list of political prisoners in Kilmainham Jail during the period 1789 to 1910, the two 16th century Munster surveys and the Record Commissioners' calendars of inquisitions for the 16th and 17th centuries.</P>
    <P>More up to date copying equipment, to serve the Public Record Office, Four Courts and the Land Registry, has been installed.  It will provide both microfilm and full-size copies more expeditiously and is intended to meet a long-felt want in the facilities hitherto available.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to the Garda Síochána Vote.  This Vote shows a decrease of £146,000 on the provision in the previous year's Estimate.  The decrease is due mainly to a reduction of £223,000 in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances&mdash; Subhead A&mdash;which, however, is offset to some extent by increases in other subheads.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of over £46,000 in Subhead B&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses.  This is due mainly to a provision for the improvement and extension of the radio service, for which a sum of about £37,000 is included.  There is also an increase in the provision in this subhead for subsistence allowances.  This has resulted from increases granted following agreed recommendations by the Garda Síochána Conciliation Council under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost of Post Office services shows an increase of £17,000 which arises from increased postal charges and the adjustment of undercharges made in previous years.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision for station services&mdash;Subhead E&mdash;arises from an increase of 16 per cent which was granted in station cleaning allowances last year.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £54,000 in Subhead F&mdash;Transport.  This is due to <Col N="1268" /> the fact that during 1967-68 a considerably higher number of vehicles will fall to be replaced than were replaced during 1966-67&mdash;166 in 1967-68, as against 109 in 1966-67. Also, there is provision for the purchase of five extra vehicles, including two pick-up trucks that are required for the enforcement of the clearway traffic system in Dublin.  In addition, there is an increased provision for the maintenance and running expenses of the fleet, which arises from the expansion of the fleet.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial decrease in the provision for pay&mdash;Subhead A.  This is due to the fact that the Supplementary Estimate, which was introduced in 1966-67 to provide for pay increases, included a sum of £250,000 in respect of the previous year.</P>
    <P>As well, there is an increase of over £30,000 in the provision for appropriations-in-aid. A number of items have contributed to this increase, the biggest being the fees which are charged for reports and statements furnished by the Garda Síochána to interested parties in connection with road traffic accidents. These fees were increased in June, 1966, and the provision for receipts during the year has accordingly been increased by £14,000.  The provision for receipts from the Road Fund also shows an increase.</P>
    <P>Work on the provision of new stations and Garda houses, and on the improvement of existing premises, continued during the year.  In the period 1st April, 1966, to 1st February, 1967, seven new stations and 14 married quarters were provided by the Office of Public Works and 50 houses were provided by the National Building Agency. At present, work is in progress on two new stations and 56 houses and married quarters.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that the strength of the Force, as provided for in the Estimates, shows no increase.  In the light of increasing demands on the available manpower, and the worsening crime position to which I shall refer presently, it is not surprising that suggestions are made to me from time to time that some, at least, of the cuts in manpower, made some years ago in less <Col N="1269" /> exacting times, should now be restored. What is stressed particularly, and what impresses me most, is that the Force no longer contains any margin of manpower which could be allocated to special assignments without interfering with the minimum performance of normal police duty.  The need for special assignments is, regrettably, increasing; in recent months, in particular, considerable numbers of Gardaí have had to be deflected from their normal work and locations to preserve, so far as they could, law and order in the face of the NFA disturbances and related activities.  Demands such as these on Garda manpower can be met only at the expense of normal police duty, which is to prevent and detect crime and to protect the person and property of all sections of our community.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that there was a sharp reversal last year in the downward trend indicated in the previous year's crime figures.  A total of 19,029 indictable offences was recorded in the year ended 30th September, 1966, as against 16,736 in the previous year. The next highest figures were in 1964 (17,700) and in 1943 (17,305).  Of the total of 19,029, 11,166 were committed in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and 7,863 in the rest of the country.  A disturbing feature of the crime statistics is the fact that over a third of all persons convicted of indictable offences last year were under 17 and 59 per cent were under 21.</P>
    <P>While the upward trend in crime that has manifested itself does not allow us to be complacent, it should be pointed out that the incidence of serious crime in this country is far less than in other countries and that our detection rate is very high indeed. It is not strictly fair to compare the crime situation here with that in thickly-populated and highly-industrialised Britain but it may be of interest to Deputies that the number of indictable offences per 100,000 of population in England and Wales in 1965 was 2,465, as compared with 680 per 100,000 of population here in 1966.  The detection rate in England and Wales in 1965 was 39.2 per cent; the rate here in 1966 was 66 per cent. <Col N="1270" /> It may also be of interest, in this connection, to see how the figures for Dublin compare with those for some other cities.  The number of indictable crimes per 1,000 of population in Dublin in 1966 was 19.6.  This compares with 19 in Belfast, 46.4 in Manchester and 71.8 in Edinburgh, the two latter figures being for 1965.  The detection rates for these cities were 52 per cent, 47 per cent and 45 per cent respectively, as against 52 per cent for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda are doing a good job and I am pressing forward vigorously with the policy of providing the Force with the best modern equipment and aids to crime prevention and detection.  I expect that arrangements which have been made for some major developments will come to fruition in the next few months.  Further equipment is being provided to enable the radio system for Garda cars and motor cycles to be extended to a number of new centres. Car radios will be provided for the first time in Abbeyleix, Cahir, Mitchelstown, Trim, Loughrea, Athenry and Carlow.  Fourteen additional motor cycle sets will be provided for use throughout the country as required.</P>
    <P>The provision of personal radio sets of pocket size for the man on the beat will mark a new break-through in the matter of equipment for Dublin Gardaí within the next few months.  Experiments with these sets have been highly successful and I expect that 130 sets, which have been on order for some months, will be delivered in two months' time.</P>
    <P>In recent years, with the provision of extra Garda cars and motor cycles for patrol work, there has been a tendency, understandable if unjustified, among the public to regard the man on the beat as the cinderella of the Force.  These new pocket radios emphasise the key position which the man on the beat continues to occupy in the prevention and detection of crime and they will make a notable contribution to the efficiency of the Force and to the productive use of manpower.  In addition to the sets for Dublin, I expect to provide an allocation <Col N="1271" /> of pocket sets during the year for Gardaí at Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The old adage that prevention is better than cure applies with particular force to crime, and I am taking steps to expand the activities of the Crime Prevention Unit of the Garda Síochána.  The main aims of the Unit are: (a) to instruct owners of premises how best to safeguard their property, (b) to encourage the installation of burglar alarms, preferably connected to Garda stations, (c) to advise on protection of pay-rolls, bank lodgments, <i>et cetera</i>, (d) in general, to awaken the public to the importance of crime prevention measures.  The services of this Unit are freely available to members of the public in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  In each of these cities specially trained Gardaí are assigned to the task of helping people to protect their houses and their places of business from the attentions of thieves.  A person in these cities who would like to get in touch with the appropriate member has only to inquire at his local Garda station and he will be put in touch.  I might mention that last year about 500 free surveys of premises were carried out by the Crime Prevention Unit in Dublin and they also made nearly 600 surveys of cash-in-transit arrangements. In addition over 1,600 visits were paid to check up on advice already given on these matters.</P>
    <P>I am arranging that the Gardaí attached to the Unit will, in future, partake to a greater extent than heretofore in exhibitions and in lectures to various groups and organisations.  I would appeal to the public generally, and especially to those with responsibility for property, to seek the expert advice of the Crime Prevention Unit and, more important perhaps, to act on that advice.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the 1966-67 Estimate, I mentioned that a Criminal Justice Bill was being prepared.  The Bill has now been introduced and will be circulated during the Recess.  It will deal with a miscellany of items.  It will propose the abolition of the distinctions <Col N="1272" /> between felonies and misdemeanours, which have become unreal over the centuries but which affect, in a very real but arbitrary way, the powers of arrest which the police have.  By that I mean that, as matters stand, the powers of arrest do not always correspond with the seriousness of the crime.  I hope to introduce a more logical rule in the matter.  The Bill will also contain provisions for the control of offensive weapons, including flick-knives.  It is proposed to strengthen the hand of the Garda in dealing with serious crime by changes in the law relating to fingerprinting and search warrants.  Another reform proposed is the abolition of the nowadays purely nominal distinction between simple imprisonment and penal servitude.</P>
    <P>In the period immediately ahead, therefore, the difficult crime situation will be tackled on three fronts:</P>
    <P>1.  enforcement will be strengthened through a substantially-increased allocation of equipment with particular emphasis on the personal two-way radio contact for the man on the beat;</P>
    <P>2.  prevention will be encouraged through the extended operations of the Crime Prevention Unit and</P>
    <P>3.  legislation in the form of a new Criminal Justice Act will strengthen the hands of the Gardaí in the continuing war on crime.</P>
    <P>The number of persons being charged with summary offences continues to rise rapidly.  The 1966 figure was 150,213 as compared with 139,856 in 1965.  Road traffic offences constitute the vast bulk of these offences&mdash;over 126,000 persons were prosecuted for road traffic offences in 1966.  Over 85,000 fine-on-the-spot notices were issued for contraventions of the parking bye-laws and similar offences and in only about 11,700 of those cases were prosecutions necessary.  I might mention that the Road Traffic Bill has provision for a special corps of wardens to take over fine-on-the-spot duties from the Gardaí, which will allow the latter to be reallocated to their primary task of detecting and preventing crime.</P>
    <P>The statutory arrangements for the <Col N="1273" /> backing of Irish warrants of arrest in Britain and Northern Ireland and for the backing of British and Northern Ireland warrants here continued to operate smoothly.  During 1966, 137 warrants, 25 of them from Northern Ireland, were received for execution here, and 113 warrants were sent from here, 18 of them to Northern Ireland. No warrants have so far been received from any of the other countries who are parties to the European Convention on Extradition nor have any warrants gone from this country to any of them.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Prisons, the next item in the list of Estimates, is for a sum of £458,500.  This sum shows a net increase of £40,050 over the Vote for 1966-67.  While there is an increase under most of the Vote subheads, the main bulk&mdash;over £27,000&mdash;is to be found in the subhead for pay and allowances etc.  The increase is required to meet the cost of normal incremental progression, the tenth round pay increases, increased rates of allowances arising out of agreements under conciliation and arbitration machinery and for the additional staff required to implement a recent agreement, also under conciliation and arbitration machinery, to reduce the hours of duty worked by prison officers.  The present working hours are 90 per fortnight and these are to be reduced to 85 hours, the same as those approved for general and mental nursing staff employed by local authorities.  The reduced working schedule will be introduced as soon as the additional staff required is recruited.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for a daily average prisoner population of 570&mdash; the same as that estimated for the last two years, at a weekly cost of £15 per prisoner.  As it happened, the actual daily average figures for the years 1965 and 1966 coincided at 561.  As compared with 1965, the overall intake of persons, either on remand or under sentence, decreased slightly&mdash;from 3,649 to 3,580&mdash;but the actual number of these persons who received sentences of imprisonment or detention rose from 2,477 in 1965 to 2,514 in 1966. Of the total daily average last year of 561, the figure for St. Patrick's was 169 or five more than the previous <Col N="1274" /> year.  The number of persons committed to detention in the Institution in 1966 was also higher than in 1965, being 616 as compared with 552 for 1965.  These figures, I am sorry to say, show a reversal of the slightly downward trend which I so hopefully welcomed last year.</P>
    <P>The details which I gave the House last November when dealing with the 1966-67 Estimates gave a fairly up-to-date outline of the present year's activities in the field of prison welfare work and analogous services.  These services continue to operate satisfactorily. During 1966, as a result of the efforts of the prison staff, the prison welfare officers and the Prison After-Care Committee, employment during their sentences was secured for 37 prisoners who were granted daily temporary release to take up the employment obtained for them.  The total earnings of these prisoners, after deductions for tax, insurance, etc., were £2,200 approximately.  Over £900 was contributed to their dependants and the amount on hands on discharge was over £400.  Three hundred and fifty pounds were spent on travelling between prison and places of employment and personal expenses.  The expenses of the special hostel meals and amenities accounted for almost £525.</P>
    <P>In St. Patrick's Institution 42 inmates were granted daily temporary release for employment while serving their sentences of detention and, save with one exception, all the inmates fulfilled the conditions of their temporary release.  In addition to release for employment, temporary release was granted to 44 prisoners and to 48 inmates of St. Patrick's during the year for other purposes&mdash;Christmas holidays, harvesting problems, domestic difficulties, family illnesses, interviews for employment, etc.  Again, in only one case&mdash;a prisoner who failed to return after Christmas&mdash;the conditions of temporary release were honoured to the full.</P>
    <P>The development of the probation and after-care service on a State-wide voluntary basis is, thanks to the willing co-operation of the community at large and particularly the well-known charitable and religious organisations, <Col N="1275" /> also progressing in a most satisfactory manner.  Over 250 voluntary workers are now available in 100 or more centres outside Dublin to give assistance to the courts in the supervision of young offenders and to help in the after-care of those discharged from industrial and reformatory schools and penal institutions.</P>
    <P>Another project which is proving its worth is the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer scheme.  The scheme has been operating successfully for some time in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and arrangements have been completed to extend it to the following eight additional centres&mdash;Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford. Since the scheme started in September, 1963, and up to the end of last September, 2,225 juveniles had come under the care and supervision of the Gardaí participating in the work.  Of this number only 211, or less than ten per cent, have since become involved in further offences.</P>
    <P>Apart from the members of the Garda Force attached to the Juvenile Liaison Unit, a large number of Gardaí continue to participate in a most praiseworthy way in the organisation and running of over 200 boys' clubs throughout the country.  It would be remiss of me to let this occasion pass without recording my indebtedness to the voluntary bodies, the many private individuals and the employers whose generous efforts and ready co-operation proved so helpful a factor in the discharge of my responsibilities for the prisons and for St. Patrick's.</P>
    <P>The next Vote is that for the courts. At £616,000 it shows an increase of £33,000 over the year 1966-67.  The additional provision is required in the main to meet the tenth round increase in remuneration and some increase in the number of posts, mainly in Circuit Court and District Court Offices.</P>
    <P>The District Court, Circuit Court and Superior Courts Rules Committees have actively been engaged during the past year.  The District Court Rules Committee continued their work in connection with the general revision of <Col N="1276" /> the existing District Court Rules.  The Committee submitted for my concurrence Rules, made during the year, providing for the revision of the fees payable to summons servers.  The Circuit Court Rules Committee made the Circuit Court Rules 1966 relating to certain increases in solicitors costs and the Circuit Court Rules 1967 providing for the revision of fees payable to summons servers.  These Rules have received my concurrence.</P>
    <P>The Superior Courts Rules Committee submitted for my concurrence two sets of Rules made during the year providing for a number of miscellaneous amendments to existing Rules and a revision of the costs allowed in judgment by default cases.  I should like again to pay a special tribute to the judges of the several courts who are voluntarily assisting the work of the Department of Justice in what I might describe as personal, non-judicial capacities.  I refer to the justices and judges who are serving in the Bankruptcy Committee, the Censorship of Films Appeal Board, the Censorship of Publications Board and Appeal Board, the Committee enquiring into Court Practices and Procedures, the Commission enquiring into the law relating to Landlord and Tenant and Ground Rents and a Committee recently formed which is making enquiries relating to reform of substantive law.  The extent to which I am indebted to the judiciary in these respects is very great.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 24 is that for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  The figure of £311,800 for the year 1967-68 represents an increase of £53,870 over 1966-67.  Again the additional provision is necessary to meet the tenth round increase in remuneration and the cost of additional staff required to discharge the new duties arising for the Land Registry under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, which, as I have already mentioned, came into force on 1st January, 1967.</P>
    <P>The business received in the Land Registry, which had increased progressively during recent years, showed a decline in 1966.  Typical of this decline was a drop in the number of dealings received for registration from <Col N="1277" /> 37,052 in 1965 to 33,875 in 1966.  I am satisfied, however, that this falling-off in business is temporary and that the upward trend will be resumed again in 1967.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Registry of Deeds the number of registrations, which had risen from 24,689 in 1962 to 29,508 in 1964 and dropped to 27,879 in 1965, dropped further in 1966 to 25,411. Applications for searches which had increased from 6,249 to 6,709 over the period 1962 to 1964 and had dropped to 5,233 in 1965 increased slightly again in 1966 to 5,324.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of additional accommodation to meet the needs of the Land Registry in the years immediately ahead, the construction work on a two-storey extension over the Public Record Office which commenced last May is progressing favourably. As I mentioned in moving the 1966-67 Estimate, the contract calls for completion in January, 1968.</P>
    <P>I have now completed all the necessary arrangements for the provision of the additional legal, technical and administration staffs required to gear the Land Registry to cope with the additional work involved under the new Act.  The necessary legal staff which I have already reported as having been recruited on a temporary basis are now in the process of being replaced on a permanent basis by means of an open competition for established legal assistants which has already been held.  However, the difficulties that I have reported as being encountered in the last two years in recruiting the necessary technical and clerical staff to fill existing vacancies and to provide for the new Act have continued.  Additional mapping draughtsmen have been assigned from a competition that was held recently but it has been found necessary to hold a further competition to complete the requirements: this competition is at present proceeding.  With the co-operation and assistance of the Ordnance Survey Office, a special crash programme of training was organised for the newly-recruited draughtsmen and they are now employed in clearing the backlog of business, involving mapping, that has been giving cause for <Col N="1278" /> concern for some time.  Some of the clerical staff required have already been assigned from the 1966 competitions and further assignments are still being made.  The rate of assignment will receive a fresh impetus within the next few weeks when successful candidates from this year's competitions start to become available.  I expect that all the Land Registry's requirements of clerical and technical staff will have been met within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The final Vote makes provision for the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The Estimate for 1967-68 is £12,650, that is, £180 less than the total provided for this service in 1966-67. The decrease is accounted for principally by a net fall in the cost of salaries due to the replacement of senior by junior officers.</P>
    <P>The useful and valuable work of the Commissioners continued during the year.  Cash amounting to £7,097 and stocks to the value of £52,588 were transferred to the Commissioners during the year 1966, and on 31st December last the nominal value of investments standing in their name was £1,998,895.</P>
    <P>It remains for me to express my sincere thanks to the members of the various voluntary boards and commissions which are associated with my Department for their valuable services during the year.  As I have said before, I have, since my appointment as Minister for Justice, been deeply impressed by the extent of this unpaid public service and by the way in which the persons concerned have carried out their duties.</P>

      <P>I do not want to do this in any acrimonious way but I think that I and other Deputies interested in speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Justice are entitled to voice our protest against the very short notice given of the arrangements made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was short for me, too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed only a short time before noon today that this Estimate was to be taken.  There were several matters I <Col N="1279" /> would have proposed dealing with and I did not even get the opportunity of putting my material together, never mind preparing to speak on this Estimate, and I gather from the Minister's intervention that he was taken at short notice as well.  But, at least, he is in a position where he has his speech prepared and ready to deliver at any time.  Deputies such as myself and others who wish to speak on this are not in that position.  In future, the Government should make some effort to order their business so that reasonable notice is given to Deputies who wish to participate in the discussions.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it is quite clear&mdash;although I do not want to re-open the discussion which took place at Question Time today&mdash;that the Minister, too, must have been taken by surprise, because I should imagine normally he would have made the statement he made here at Question Time in conjunction with his Estimate speech if he had been aware of the fact that the Estimate was to be taken today.  However, I do not want to be acrimonious about it, but it is a protest I would like to make and I would ask the Minister to convey it to whoever is responsible for ordering these things on the Government side.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister covered a lot of ground.  He has demonstrated the importance of the Department of Justice in many respects. They are concerned not only with the Garda Síochána but with all the ancillary operations such as the courts, prisons, the administration of charitable donations and bequests, the Land Registry, the Registry of Deeds, the Probate Office and the various District Probate Offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People might have been surprised, had the Minister not explained it, to discover a drop in the Vote for the Garda Síochána.  I know that that is more apparent than real, for the reasons the Minister gave, namely, that a Supplementary Estimate had been introduced.  The Minister referred to the possibility of expanding the Garda Force.  I was not entirely sure as I followed his speech whether he has made up his mind about it.  He did not <Col N="1280" /> seem to me to pursue that particular suggestion to a conclusion.  Speaking for myself, I think there are sound reasons for expanding the Garda Force.  Certainly, if there is any suggestion at all, any suspicion in the mind of the Minister or the Department that we have too few Gardaí to do the job requiring to be done in relation to crime detection and law enforcement, I would not hesitate to say to the Minister that he should with all possible speed expand the numbers in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I have on many occasions from these benches referred to the role which the man on the beat plays in crime prevention.  That cannot be overemphasised. I am glad the Minister referred to it and to the fact that the man on the beat is at times regarded as the cinderella of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda on the beat is the particular unit in the police force which possibly plays a more important part in crime prevention and detection than any other.  Any of us will appreciate that, if a uniformed Garda is seen in any vicinity, the mere presence of the uniform will have a salutary effect as far as the committing of crimes or offences in that vicinity is concerned. I am glad to note from the Minister's remarks that he appears to be attributing what I would regard as their proper importance to the men on the beat.</P>
    <P>I am just raising this by way of query rather than by way of complaint. It seems to me that the Minister when he referred to the steps being taken to counter the growth of crime&mdash;and unfortunately, on the figures the Minister gave, it is a question of crime increasing &mdash; seemed to be in-indicating that reliance was going to be placed to a great extent on equipment rather than manpower.  I think the two must go hand in hand.  I do not want to underrate the importance of modern equipment such as walkietalkie sets and the manoeuverability of guards on wheels, whether in patrol cars or as motorcycle patrols, but I think the effective way of dealing with both the prevention and detection of crime is by relying on manpower.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another topic I mentioned in other years&mdash;the Minister <Col N="1281" /> has not referred to it this year, and I hope that is a good augury&mdash;the question of the closing-down of small Garda stations in rural areas.  I would be glad to have the Minister confirm that, by omitting reference in the course of his speech to the closing of any rural Garda stations, it means none was closed during the period now under review.  We have had the experience over past years of many small stations in rural areas being closed down.  The justification normally given was the absence, or the near absence, of crime in the areas.  I have expressed the belief before this that the absence of crime in these areas may very well have been due to the existence in them of the Garda stations.  I hope the fact that the Minister has not referred to any closures means that none has taken place.</P>
    <P>He did refer to a fairly startling increase in the number of indictable offences in the year ended 30th September, 1966, as against the previous year.  In the year ended 30th September, 1966, the figure was 19,029 as against 16,736 in the previous year.  Later on, he referred to an increase also in convictions on summary charges.  That is a fairly radical increase and possibly the most disturbing thing about it is the fact mentioned by the Minister, that approximately one-third of the persons convicted were under 17 years of age and nearly 60 per cent under 21 years of age.  In view of those figures and in face of the necessity to deal with the situation where that growth in the crime rate is being maintained, I am surprised and disappointed that the Minister should refer in the course of his remarks, as he did, to the difficulties which the Garda had experienced with the NFA.</P>
    <P>So far as the NFA difficulties are concerned, I want to state quite bluntly that I do not think the Government are entitled to any bonus marks for their dealing with that situation. I do not want in the course of remarks dealing with the Department of Justice to embark on a speech in connection with the NFA but I am entitled to make the point that many of the difficulties which were experienced should be laid firmly at the feet <Col N="1282" /> of the Government.  The difficulties which were created in recent months which led to the jailing of farmers, the difficulties which the Minister and the Taoiseach encountered in trying to find a way out, were, to a large extent, brought on their own heads by the Government and by the failure of the Government to recognise the situation which was developing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not embark on a discussion on the NFA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to relate my remarks directly to the Department of Justice.  The Minister will recall that, in the main, the farmers were jailed arising out of fines imposed on them as a result of the road blockade.  Notice of the intention to engage in that form of activity was given well in advance by the NFA.  To my mind, that was the time for the Minister and the Government to make their position clear, to make it clear that, if the law was broken, action would be taken by them against those who broke it.  They did not do that so far as I can recall.  Neither the Minister nor any other member of the Government uttered a single word of warning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing other members of the Government.  We are discussing the Minister in relation to the NFA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and I accept that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is entitled to say that. Neither the Minister nor any other spokesman of the Government, so far as I can recall, uttered a single word of warning at that stage when a word of warning would have had a desirable effect, when it would have enabled those who had given notice of that form of activity to realise that it was outside the law and would involve the consequences of activities outside the law.  It seems to me that the Minister having been silent on that occasion, could be said to have condoned what was done.  When the blockade took place, the Government acted after some time and the situation of which <Col N="1283" /> we are all aware arose.  The real cause of it was the failure of the Minister, and I would, if I am permitted by the Chair, relieve the Minister of some of the burden of this responsibility because I think it was open to the Minister's colleagues to voice the warning also on that occasion.  That was not done and these difficulties arose.  Consequently, I say that the Government are not entitled to any bonus marks for their handling of that situation.</P>
      <P>Now we find the Minister, in introducing this Estimate, saying that the need for special assignments is increasing. He says:</P>
      <P>In recent months, in particular, considerable numbers of Gardaí have had to be deflected from their normal work and locations to preserve, so far as they could, law and order in the face of the NFA disturbances and related activities.</P>
      <P>In this respect also there are no bonus marks going for the Minister.  To my mind there was no need for the show of force made on a number of occasions in relation to the NFA difficulties.  If that were the reason the Minister felt there was a necessity for an increase in the strength of the Garda, I would stand out against him. I believe there is a need for an increase because of the growth of real crime, because of the figures the Minister has given of an increase in indictable offences from slightly over 16,000 to slightly over 19,000 between 1965 and the end of September, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred from time to time in his statement to new legislation that is proposed.  I should like to ask him in that context whether or not he intends introducing legislation in connection with publicans' licences.  The Minister is aware, as I am, that the licensed trade has been agitating for legislation which would have the effect of reducing the number of licensed premises in this country.  I do not intend here to go into the various arguments that are made in support of that point of view.  All I want to say is that there does seem to be a number of strong arguments and the case as <Col N="1284" /> presented to me and, I am sure, presented to the Minister also, seems to be a fairly weighty case and well thought out.  I should like to know what examination the Minister has made in connection with the subject and what his proposals are.  Does he intend bringing proposals before the House in connection with it?</P>
    <P>The Ground Rents Bill has, of course, now become an Act and is in operation.  I do not suppose the Minister would from his records be in a position to say how it is functioning and to what extent people are taking advantage of it, but, if that kind of information is available to the Minister or his Department, I should be glad if he would give it to the House. I cannot see any very great evidence that the Act is being operated to any large extent by lesses at present. Probably that is a pity.  It may be that I am not aware of the situation but I do not see any great evidence of activity and I should like to know what the Minister thinks about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the fact that he was going to introduce legislation dealing with malicious injury, certainly to persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>And property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and property. In that connection I want to reiterate a plea I made here in other years, that is, to consider the position of a person who goes to the assistance of a Garda.  At the moment, except on a fairly <i>ex gratia</i> basis, if such person is injured in going to the assistance of a Garda there is no fund on which he has a claim for compensation.  All he has is his common law right of action against the person who caused his injury.  A person who discharges his civic duty in that way deserves to be put in a position where he can, as a matter of right, be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We include that in the Bill also, giving a statutory right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  There is another matter I want to ask the Minister to consider.  He has referred to the reports of the Commissions <Col N="1285" /> which deal with legal practice, and so on, and to the fact that interim reports have been presented dealing with such things as trial by jury.  I have a particular view in regard to trial by jury. I do not intend to open a discussion on it now.  It is worth while and it is worth while preserving, but I do think it is time that we in this country decided to do something which would enable jurors to receive some type of reasonable compensation for their services as jurymen.  I am not advocating that they should be paid to act as jurors or that they should be remunerated in that way, but we all know that there are those who are called upon to give jury service and who, by reason of giving that service, are at actual loss to themselves in their businesses or, possibly, to their families if a man is in a small way of business and may not be able to arrange for assistance except at a cost.  We should at least consider a code which would enable those serving on juries to be compensated to some extent, if it is not possible to do it fully, for losses which they incur as a result of their service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that new probate rules are under consideration. Again may I, just by way of reminder, refer to a matter I raised here before&mdash;the present Minister for Labour referred to the point on some previous discussion here&mdash;that is, the fact that some of the present probate forms seem to be quite anomalous. For example, in relation to some of the forms of affidavit where a will is being exhibited&mdash;I have not got one of the forms here with me; as I say, I did not get an opportunity of putting things together&mdash;my recollection is that the will is referred to in the affidavits which I have in mind as being &ldquo;hereunto annexed&rdquo; and, in fact, if the will is annexed to the affidavit by any physical means, a clip or a pin or anything of that sort, then a further affidavit will have to be filled to explain the marks which the clip has made in the will.  So that, for practical purposes, except by holding the two together at the time they are being sworn, as far as I can see, you cannot annex the will to the affidavit.  That is a kind of anomaly that should be cleared up <Col N="1286" /> whenever new forms are being drafted.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to measures which are in contemplation in connection with the Registry of Deeds.  Here again, from a practical point of view, there are some changes that could be made which would be very simple to bring about but which would be of very considerable benefit both to legal practitioners and to their clients.  I am thinking in particular of the necessity which exists at the moment, and has existed for a long time, of presenting memorials on parchment to the Registry of Deeds in order to have a deed registered.  I do not see the necessity for that at all. Parchments are expensive and at times it is not possible to procure them at all. They seem from time to time to be difficult to obtain.  They are merely a synopsis of the deeds.  That synopsis, which is required for record purposes in the Registry of Deeds, could be supplied in a variety of other ways.</P>
    <P>It would be quite a simple and certainly inexpensive matter for solicitors when they are registering deeds to make an additional full copy of the deed on ordinary deed paper and to lodge that in the Registry of Deeds.  In the event of the deed becoming lost or destroyed in the course of time, there would be a full record in the Registry of Deeds.  If it were considered that that would create filing difficulties in the Registry as against the comparative ease with which memorials could be filed, then I would suggest that arrangements should be made to permit memorials to be lodged on ordinary paper or possibly on deed paper.  These possibly are technical matters, but the Minister has practical experience of them, I am quite sure, as a lawyer and, while they seem to be matters of detail, he will appreciate they are matters which could be of considerable importance both to solicitors and to their clients.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred again this year to the Crime Prevention Unit of the Garda and listed the main aims of the Unit as being four in number:</P>
    <P>(a)  to instruct owners of premises how best to safeguard their property,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> (b)  to encourage the installation of burglar alarms, preferably connected to Garda stations.</P>
    <P>(c)  to advise on protection of pay-rolls, bank lodgments, etc.,</P>
    <P>(d)  in general, to awaken the public to the importance of crime prevention measures.</P>
    <P>I should like again, as I did on previous occasions, to pay tribute to this particular service of the Garda Síochána.  It is doing very useful work.  The lines on which it is working are excellent.  Certainly, from what I have seen, the type of people engaged in this advisory work are extremely competent and capable officers and the more this kind of work can be encouraged the better. In connection with this, I do not know whether it is the Crime Prevention Unit &mdash;I suppose it is&mdash;who participate in &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; on television.  The Minister might have referred to the part that programme on television can play, and I feel sure is playing, in this question of crime detection, if not crime prevention.  It is a good programme and it is not necessary to spell out the useful service that television can provide for the Garda in connection with both crime prevention and crime detection.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer scheme and I am glad to see that that still seems to be operating satisfactorily and to be achieving good results.  He referred to the fact that, out of a total of 2,200 juveniles who came under the care of the Garda in connection with this service, only about ten per cent subsequently were in trouble.  That is a good record.</P>
    <P>The Minister then dealt with what he seemed to regard as a kind of three-pronged attack on crime.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the period immediately ahead, therefore, the difficult crime situation will be tackled on three fronts:</P>
    <P>1.  enforcement will be strengthened through a substantially increased allocation of equipment with particular emphasis on the personal two-way radio contact for the man on the beat;</P>
    <P>2.  prevention will be encouraged <Col N="1288" /> through the extended operation of the Crime Prevention Unit.</P>
    <P>Of those two particular methods certainly I have no criticism to voice but he refers also to legislation in the form of a new Criminal Justice Act which will strengthen the hand of the Garda in continuing war on crime.  In an earlier reference to that, the Minister said it was intended to strengthen the hand of the Garda in dealing with serious crime by changes in the law relating to fingerprinting and search warrants.</P>
    <P>I suppose judgment on this must be suspended until the proposals are known and set out in the form of a Bill.  It seems to me that legislation on those lines is concerned more with the question of detection than with the question of prevention.  I would feel&mdash;I do not want to go into this in any detail&mdash;that many people would be perturbed if there is legislation in the offing which would involve any widespread expansion of powers in connection with search warrants and fingerprinting.  However, as I say, we can only suspend judgment on that until we see the terms of the Bill to which the Minister refers here only in a general way.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other points I have to make.  As I said at the beginning, but for the fact that we have all been taken at short notice in regard to this Estimate, it would have been possible for Deputies who wish to contribute to the debate to have prepared themselves for it.</P>

      <P>That makes it even worse because if we are going to have a full and complete discussion and the full views of the Members of the House on this Estimate or any other Estimate, it is necessary that a fair amount of notice be given to the House.  I found myself in the position of trying to put my views together while the Minister was reading his speech.</P>
      <P>While six Votes are covered by this Estimate, I think the main discussion will arise on the Vote for the Garda Síochána.  I am glad to see extra provision for extra cars, motorcycles and radios and other technical equipment that will help the Garda in crime prevention and detection.  The Garda should diversify the type and make of car used.  The cars seem to be practically all of one type, make and colour. Recently, I noticed for the first time since they became motorised that the Garda have changed car colours but they should go further and have a change of make also.</P>
      <P>It is very disturbing to note that again the crime rate has risen.  In the past few years, it has been indicated in the Minister's speech that the rate is rising each year, particularly in city areas.  It is no consolation to give comparisons between the detection rate here and elsewhere.  We must do everything possible, whether it is more manpower that is needed or more technical equipment, to prevent and detect crime, principally to prevent crime.  In spite of our high rate of detection, for which all credit to the Garda, the crime rate is still rising and the higher the rate of detection the better the deterrent to a criminal or potential criminal.  The more the likelihood of being caught, the less chance there is of a potential criminal attempting a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see that the advice of the Crime Prevention Unit is being availed of but the annual Estimate speech of the Minister should not be the only means of advertising this Unit, which is not sufficiently advertised. I know we have the television programme but in the country we feel there is some neglect in this respect and people may feel that this particular <Col N="1290" /> and very important unit of the Garda Síochána is not available to them.  Something more than reference to it in the Estimate is required in order to bring it home to the people in rural areas that this service is available to them just as it is to city shopkeepers, merchants and factory owners.  Could the Minister give any statistics of the number of places broken into that have had the advice of the Crime Prevention Unit and the relationship of those figures to the number of places broken into which have not had that advice?  That would be important in advertising the work of the unit.</P>
    <P>The time has come for a very careful scrutiny of the manpower arrangements in the Garda Síochána.  While it is not explicitly stated in the Minister's speech, I feel he is telling the House that we have not enough Gardaí. I am inclined to agree with that view when at the present time we have new legislation such as the recent Road Traffic Act imposing extra duties on the Gardaí that will take up countless man hours.  Some provisions of the Road Traffic Act may entail three or four members of the Garda being fully employed for perhaps four or five hours in one night.  Traffic itself is also increasing each year and we can see that in regard to the speed limit the enforcement of the law leaves much to be desired.  This is due to the lack of manpower.  I do not suggest it is due to any neglect on the part of any section or any members of the Garda but there are more important matters for them to attend to, particularly in regard to crime, so that we see, in certain parts of the country, that the speed limits are just a mockery.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in legislation not only in regard to roads and traffic. The Minister also made reference&mdash; which I welcome&mdash;to the proposal to ban offensive weapons.  Other measures will be proposed from time to time involving extra duties for the Garda.  It appears that the number in the Garda has not been rising for some years past.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear the Minister refer to the NFA and to the alleged problems which that campaign created <Col N="1291" /> for the Garda.  The Minister could have made his point without referring to the NFA because for a number of years we have had numerous festivals, race meetings, big hurling matches and so on for which a large number of Gardaí have to be drawn from other areas. That leaves these areas very much undermanned.  There is a case for increasing the number of Gardaí without trying to justify that increase on the ground of NFA activities.</P>
    <P>I should like to have a clear definition from the Minister as to the duties of the Garda in regard to the recovery of the bodies of drowned people.  There seems to be no one person or organisation responsible for the recovery of the bodies of such persons.  It is for local voluntary effort to recover the body. Direct responsibility should be placed on somebody in this regard.  A drowning tragedy makes it difficult enough for the family without adding the burden of trying to locate the body.</P>
    <P>In recent years wandering animals, particularly those belonging to the travelling people, have been giving serious trouble to residents in both urban and rural areas.  These animals wander into front and back gardens.  It would appear that the powers of the Garda Síochána in this connection are not all that they should be and it might help if the Minister would review the poundage fees.  These fees were fixed a long number of years back.  An increase in the fees might help to prevent the nuisance these animals constitute.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the Garda Síochána, I was rather surprised to find that the Minister did not make any reference, good, bad or indifferent, to the work of the ban-Ghardaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any intention of increasing the scope of their duties or placing some of them in other centres throughout the country? <Col N="1292" /> He might make some reference to that when he comes to reply.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined three headings under which it is proposed to tackle the crime situation.  In my opinion, he omitted two very important ways in which that situation can be tackled. First of all, the public image of the Garda Síochána must be preserved at all costs.  I do not want to enter into the implications of the discussion which took place here at Question Time today but one of the best friends, if not the best friend, the Garda Síochána have in the prevention and detection of crime is the public, the man in the street, and it is most important therefore that the public image of the Garda Síochána should be preserved. They have a high standing in the community.  They are respected.  They are honourable men.  They do their duty well.  It is up to the Minister and to all of us here to see that that public image is maintained.  From time to time an odd few may do something which results in adverse publicity but the whole Force should not be condemned because of the actions of the very odd few.  My appeal would be for the greatest possible co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the public.</P>
      <P>The second best weapon in the fight against crime is the press.  The time has come, in my opinion, for a clear and definite understanding of what is required on both sides.  During the recent seizures in Kilkenny, it was brought to my notice that a photographer and a reporter on one of our national newspapers were very badly treated.  Hostile language was used by one member, just one, of the Garda Síochána.  That kind of thing should not happen.  There should be the fullest co-operation between the press and the Garda Síochána.  Arrangements should be made to facilitate the Press in every way.  If the present liaison breaks down, a wrong image of the work of the Garda Síochána will be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the building of houses for members of the Garda and the provision of better accommodation for the single men will continue.  In some areas accommodation for single men leaves much to be desired.  Houses have been built for married men but many more <Col N="1293" /> are needed, especially now that the local authorities find it difficult enough to house their own applicants.  They could not possibly cope with applications from members of the Garda. Many more houses are needed and the present drive should be continued.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed to learn recently that certain Members of this House were refused permission to visit some of our prisons.  Every Deputy should have the right to visit and inspect these prisons at a reasonable time and to investigate any complaint he may receive on behalf of a constituent.  I did not want to visit any of the prisons at that particular time but I felt that any Deputy should have that right to investigate any complaint he receives in respect of a constituent.</P>
    <P>On one occasion, I had to make a visit to Mountjoy Prison and I was taken aback somewhat by the waiting-room facilities there for people visiting prisoners.  When I went there, it was packed tight and people were standing around the area outside it, leaning against the wall and trying to find as comfortable a position as possible.  It was a Saturday evening and things may not be as bad on other evenings. According as people left the waiting-room, others moved in and, in due time, I got a seat in the waiting-room but it was still packed tightly.  I was appalled at the way people had to pack into that small room.  I imagine it was hard enough on some of them to go to Mountjoy to visit their friends or relations there without having to put up with such conditions sometimes for 15 to 20 minutes, and to be put standing, before that, outside in the cold in the passageway was really adding insult to injury.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £54,000 in the provision for transport for the Garda Síochána, with which I fully agree.  Is transport for the Minister included in that £54,000?  If it is, then very little would be left for the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the provision <Col N="1294" /> of more motorcycles is the best thing possible.  I should think that mini-cars would be better.  Because of our climate, motorcycles are really safe in this country for only about four months of the year.  In the long run, for reasons of health and reasons of safety, mini-cars might be more suitable. They can carry more than one person and would give protection and a little extra comfort.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to transfer responsibility for the maintenance of courthouses from the local authorities which, in recent years, has been a heavy burden.  Many local authorities have fulfilled their obligations in this regard, much to the expense of the ratepayers in the respective local authority areas.  The time has come to transfer this responsibility to the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister every success in his efforts to keep the crime rate down. I trust that when he comes to present his Estimate to this House next year he will be able to report that the present upward trend in the crime rate has been halted and in fact that crime is on the decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it will be agreed that the Minister for Justice has one of the toughest tasks in the Government, as is the case with his counterpart in every other country. Some people have scant respect today for the law.  We are inclined to look to the Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána to take certain action when we ourselves do not play our full part. In recent years, there has been emphasis on crime prevention.  I think the television programme &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; is getting the message across. People are more co-operative with the Garda and are taking their advice on how to prevent crime.  Whoever thought of this programme is to be complimented. It is a very homely programme. One gets the impression that the Garda is speaking just to one person and one feels that there is scope for co-operation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with the increase in crime in the city or that we are doing enough to prevent it and, particularly, to show our youth that crime does not pay.  There is also the necessity to look <Col N="1295" /> after a young person after he has been sent to prison perhaps for some small crime.  I have in mind a case where some young boys stole from a motorcar. Motorists are to blame to some degree for leaving valuable and expensive toys lying in the car.  To a child or to a young boy, this is a grave temptation.  The expensive toy or the camera, and so on, is lying there just beyond his reach.  It is a challenge to him to take it.  The car may not be locked or perhaps only insecurely locked.  While the motorist may lose an article costing a few pounds, the boy or girl may lose his or her freedom for a while and will always bear that stain.  I do not approve of stealing but there is such a thing as temptation and motorists should not display anything in their cars which will tempt a young person to steal.  In the poorer parts of the city, one very often sees a big car parked with lots of articles lying around in it.  That constitutes a great temptation to some young people.</P>
    <P>Very often, Members of this House are asked to try to obtain the release, after a certain time, of a boy who was sent to prison if a job can be got for him.  This puts a great onus on a Deputy to obtain a job that will not be a blind alley but that will give the young person some hope for his future. There is the onus to ensure that it will not be a job that will just get the young person out of prison.  I want to pay tribute to the staffs in the prisons and to the Chaplains who do their utmost to ensure that, when persons leave prison, they will get jobs of the kind that will make them want to remain out of prison or out of the reformatory.  It would be well worth while to have a special section of the Garda and the prison authorities&mdash; who, already, are doing an excellent job&mdash;to go more deeply into this point of ensuring that, if a boy or girl is sentenced, then the corrective treatment will be such that they will have no desire to find themselves back again in prison or in the reformatory.</P>
    <P>I should like, again, to pay tribute to the prison staffs who have not a very nice job but who are doing excellent work.  I am glad to note that the <Col N="1296" /> amount for their salaries and wages has increased, presumably because of the increases given in the course of the year.  I have not been too happy about the position of the ban-Ghardaí in this city.  Many years ago Dublin City Council petitioned the Minister to establish this Force and we had in mind that they would do social work among women who needed help.  It makes me very annoyed at times to see ban-Ghardaí patrolling and doing ordinary police duty, for which they were not established, while at the same time we have a grave problem in regard to many young people who get into trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We must admit that we have a grave problem in regard to prostitution and the ban-Ghardaí could help in solving it.  Some years ago I mentioned the case of a young girl who was rescued by some men after attempting suicide.  The Garda were sent for and some fine big men came in the squad car.  One can imagine the terrified look on that girl's face when she found herself surrounded by these Gardaí.  No ban-Gharda was sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They were too busy putting stickers on cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Here was a case where a ban-Gharda should have been sent for, to deal with this young girl.  I went to the then Minister for Justice and he promised that in all cases where it was possible, ban-Ghardaí would be sent. I do think there is a great potential being wasted there.  The problem in regard to women in this city is a very grave one and we should not shut our eyes to it.  The Department and the Garda should pay more attention to it in order to prevent vice from becoming rampant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> There is a capitation grant to Our Lady's Home and St. Magdalen's Home of £350, which is an absolutely miserly sum.  I am a member of a body which works hard during the year to raise money for one of these homes.  It is tough going.  Most of them do not receive a State grant and I like to think that we will not receive a grant but, at the same time, the capitation grant for these homes which do receive grants, in which some of the occupants are women who are merely homeless and who have not committed any crime, is very small.  We could, indeed, be a little more generous.</P>
    <P>Members of the medical profession are often in the headlines because drugs have been stolen from their cars.  Everybody becomes anxious in case children find the drugs and are poisoned.  I wonder if the Minister would rap the medical profession and ask them to be more careful when carrying drugs in their cars?  These matters are greatly publicised but there are cases which do not reach the newspapers. The press will always play up anything which is sensational and in this regard I must refer to an event which occurred last week.  The two evening papers had nothing to be proud of in regard to a report that a person had been stabbed to death. This was on the placards and on the front pages of the newspapers and the point is that later it was shown that the man had died from natural causes. While I would be the last to suggest that there should be censorship imposed on the press, they will have to show a greater sense of responsibility or else the State will be forced to take some action in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison mentioned speed limits in the city and we do know that they are a joke.  I do not blame the Garda because they are doing their best to make people realise how senseless it is to speed through the bottom of Grafton Street at 70 or 80 miles an hour.  They cannot chase everyone who breaks the speed limits. The only thing they can do is to see that, when a person is convicted and sentenced, he will pay the full penalty. <Col N="1298" /> In this regard, I sympathise with the Minister.  It is good to see that a man has been caught breaking the law and has gone to prison, but then perhaps the wife of the man comes to me and says that she has five children, that her husband is in prison for a traffic offence, and asks me what will I do as she is living on social welfare payments and the children are going wild. I do what most other Deputies do : I write to the Minister hoping that he will make the decision I do not want to make, to get the man out of prison for the sake of the family.  I often wonder if there is not some way in which a man who breaks the law in this way can be penalised other than by sending him to prison.  No solution comes to mind but there must be a solution to make him pay some penalty and not penalise the innocent wife and children.</P>
    <P>There is still a number of unsolved murder cases and Deputies will agree with me that, when there are unsolved murder cases in the city, the rumourmongery starts and every public man is told about these unsolved cases.  I would urge the Minister to continue the investigations into every unsolved murder case until the responsible people have been brought to justice. In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister to reiterate his opposition to any extension of the drinking hours in the city to 2.30 a.m.  This was rumoured some time ago and it had a certain amount of backing from a semi-State body.  At the moment the drinking hours appear to be long enough and I would oppose any extension into the early hours of the morning.</P>

      <P>This year, many Deputies, if they were free to express their real feelings and the feelings of their constituents, would express concern with regard to the administration of justice.  In the year under review, there has been a violent conflict of opinion between different organisations and the Government.  In that context, we have seen the Garda Force being used in a variety of ways and the courts, particularly the District Courts, used also in relation to <Col N="1299" /> the imposition of penalties for a variety of offences.</P>
      <P>It is to be recalled that only a little over 12 months ago offences were alleged to have been committed by farmers who came to picket Leinster House.  Following their arrival, hour by hour the Black Maria was paraded in front of Leinster House and the farmers were escorted into it by members of the Garda Force and subsequently appeared and were charged in the District Court with breaches of the Offences against the State Act. That is one thing.  Consistency in the administration of justice, consistency in relation to a point of view, may often conceal inadequacies in thought but at least has a merit in it.  But we all recollect that, shortly after these farmers were fined for what it was alleged they had done and while many of them who had refused to pay their fines were expecting to be arrested, some mysterious fairy godmother appeared in the Department of Justice: coincidentally the Minister&mdash; apparently unasked for&mdash;decided to mitigate all the fines.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an entirely different organisation&mdash;one begins to wonder what actually is happening.  I want to suggest that the people throughout the country are fed up with all this coming and going. They are fed up with these ministerial pronouncements, with this cry of &ldquo;Wolf, wolf, wolf&rdquo; time after time and they no longer pay much attention to it.  It is to be borne in mind that it is the duty of the Minister for Justice, as the responsible member of the Government in this regard, not merely to see that justice is administered through the courts but also to see that breaches of the law are prevented. It is to be recalled in this year under review that not only was the Minister told and the Government informed that there would be obstruction of the public roads but a trial test day of obstruction was carried through.  We saw the situation in which large, heavy agricultural machinery was driven at less than an inch an hour along our public roads with members of the Garda Force, apparently under instructions, standing by and looking on.  The Government did not one thing about it.  Then we had an announcement that next time, hour given and date given, the roads would be obstructed and blocked.  I think it is fair to say that many of us had the experience when these roads were blocked that not only did the representatives of the justice arm in this country do nothing about it and the Government do nothing about it but they actually stood by with folded arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> What was the purpose of this? Surely in that context, in that situation, due notice having been given, if ever it was a situation in which the Minister had the responsibility to act to prevent a breach of the law then he had that duty there and then?  It is not surprising these unfortunate people felt that what they were doing was in no way wrong when they were almost given governmental approval for their plans.</P>

      <P>Again, following that series of road obstructions, the same thing took place once more. We had the situation in which farmers were charged and fined.  There were suggestions that a universal direction had gone out to all district justices that this matter was to be dealt with seriously, and so on.  I do not know whether that happened or not.  I sincerely hope it did not.  We had the Minister issuing statements to the press saying he had piles of evidence of such-and-such an offence available.  It seems to me a most extraordinary interference by the Minister for Justice in the administration of justice.  We had all this going on, farmers being jailed, and then what happens?  Just when the Spring Show had started, apparently there was a sudden unbending and some kind of deal is alleged to have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to suggest it does not look well for the administration of justice to have suggestions made about deals here and there to get over this and that.  Consistency is important. Then, after that, there was apparently a lack of communication or a misunderstanding as to what the Minister said or as to what was said to the Minister.  But then the situation hardens once more and we have the whole thing over again.  I am going to suggest that the result of all that is that there is general uneasiness with regard to the administration of justice.  I hope we will see the end of it.  I hope that this experience this year will be a help to all sides and all sections to realise that, in a democracy, if a point of view is to be expressed, if influence is to be got in relation to a particular policy <Col N="1302" /> and if the Government of the day are not amenable, the way to exercise that influence is in the ballot box, as was done recently.  That would be effective and would have a salutary effect.  There is no other legitimate, lawful or useful means in a democracy except that.</P>

      <P>I think we can all agree on that.  I hope that lesson will have been fully learned by both sides.</P>
      <P>May I raise one particular matter?  I am sorry to have to do so.  It is not in relation to the principles involved in the NFA dispute.  I would ask the Minister to examine what happened in Edenderry at the time it was alleged that cattle were being prevented from being taken from that mart.  The information given to me may not be accurate, although it is vouched for by a number of people whose word I respect.  I am told that something approaching a police State existed in Edenderry on the day of the mart.  I am told that a member of the Garda Force invaded property that was private property and, although requested to leave, refused to do so.  I am told that a particular officer behaved in an outrageous, uncivil and unnecessarily abusive manner to many members of the public and to people who were lawfully there.  The Government may be doing something in another sphere about cattle marts but we have the right here, for which many of our people fought, of private property and I cannot understand the basis on which members of the Garda went into these premises and refused to leave when asked to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. If it was a case that there was a particular person there who was asked to leave and refused to do so then the Garda could remove him.  Instead of that, there was a virtual take-over of the mart by the Garda officers concerned. There is always some room for an excess of zeal by particular officers <Col N="1303" /> and frequently they cannot be two meticulous as to what exactly they are entitled to do; but to bring from all over the midlands of Ireland some 200 or 250 Gardaí into the peaceful town of Edenderry caused absolute fright to the townspeople and made them feel that something approaching civil war had broken out.  That was an unnecessary abuse of the functions of the Civic Guards.  I do not wish unnecessarily to criticise any particular person but, on the evidence available to me, at least one particular Garda officer brought no credit to the uniform he was wearing. If that incident is now closed, I would suggest that, in a period of quiet, there should be an examination of what took place and that the Minister should review the reports available to him. That is all I want to say on that matter.</P>
      <P>I feel that the whole position in relation to the NFA dispute over the past 12 months has not been a good one and has led to public uneasiness.  One can understand anyone making a mistake. The Minister frequently had to face difficulties and the Government frequently had to face up to certain decisions.  They are all fallible persons. No other section of the community are more fallible than the present Government but I blame them for being consistent in one thing, in being inconsistent, and for allowing considerations of political expediency to enter into the administration of justice.  That is bad so far as respect for the law of the land is concerned.</P>
      <P>What were people to think when they saw a rival farming organisation the members of which were picked up outside this House in a Black Maria a few months previously and then released from prison shortly afterwards?</P>

      <P>In relation to what happened in May of 1966, an example was given which was acted upon later.  That example was the introduction by the Minister into the administration of justice of considerations of political expediency.

Such a situation should not have been allowed to develop and I hope we will never have a repetition of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with only one matter this evening but I would urge on the Minister that it is a matter the remedy for which is long <Col N="1305" /> overdue, that is, the position of juries. We have every lawyer, from the judge down, in the court-rooms of this country being well paid for doing very little work, while, on the other hand, you have the whole side of a country being denuded of manpower because men are dragged into court day after day for no remuneration whatever.  In the present state of manpower in the rural community, it has become practically impossible for some of these jurors to attend.  I have seen men get up at five o'clock in the morning to do their ordinary work, the milking of cows and the getting out of the milk, so as to get into court on time and then sit there for a judge or somebody else to say whether they are wanted or not. They have to do this at their own expense and then have to return home and do the rest of the day's work.  It is time the system were either paid for or ended.  It has gone on for too long and has gone too far.  I have seen up to 50 men outside Cork Courthouse waiting to know whether they would be required for jury service or not.  If an unfortunate man could not attend, the judge would impose a fine of £3&mdash;for nothing.  I suppose that, if he refused to pay, extenuating circumstances would not be taken into account and the man would have to go to jail.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said here in connection with the court-houses. When one has been a fairly long time in public life, one sees the law expanding year after year.  I saw the time when Cork Courthouse was occupied as to threequarters of the space by the local authority's various offices, their roads and rates departments, and so on.  Gradually, the local authority have been driven into one or, at most, two rooms of that courthouse. Why the ratepayers of the county should have to pay for that is more than I can understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where did they find the kinds of judges they have?  They must have been reared in hothouses.  There was one fellow complaining of a draught and would not sit any more because there <Col N="1306" /> was a draught of fresh air coming through the window.  Another was complaining because facilities were not provided for boiling the kettle to make tea.</P>

      <P>That was the dispute, the fight, between the two farmers' organisations.  The Minister was reprimanded also because he did not take steps to prevent, on the one hand, and because he took too many steps to prevent on the other.  I do not know what general instructions were issued but I do know that that blockade or slow-down was very effectively carried out in Cork.  Their orders were well observed by those carrying them out.  There were only two prosecutions in the county of Cork.  The job was done as per instructions and was not steamed-up by any of the ex-Blueshirt regiment who had been working previously in other counties, showing the road.  There were only two cases in which prosecutions could be brought for the whole of that day and, in one of those cases, the fine was paid before arrest and, in the other case, the person concerned spent one night in jail and paid the fine the next morning.  In my time any fellow who led the troops led them and took what was coming to him afterwards.  Those are the facts.  The Department of Justice probably thought that there would be some kind of reasonable blockade with farm machinery, and so on, such as was carried out in Cork city, where only two prosecutions could be brought on that day.  It was carried out but it was carried out properly and efficiently and well.  Every praise to those concerned.</P>

Why pick out lawyers and put them in a category by themselves?  It has almost come to the point now that, on the day they get their degrees, there is a little box on the table and each one walks past the box, puts in his hand and pulls out his slip: that tells his future course of action, whether it is to be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.

There is a great scarcity of houses in the town of Cobh, for example, and I suggest to the Minister that, instead of dodging the column like two other Departments and making the ratepayers pay for houses for their personnel, he should have some Garda houses built there.</P>
      <P>We have heard all this talk about the increase in crime but I would suggest to the Minister that the most serious crimes committed in this country at present are committed by people for whom other Departments claim credit. I am alluding to the tourists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister examines the papers over the past six months, he will find I am correct. Those people will get bank managers to give them a couple of thousand pounds, although they would not give you or me a pound.</P>

      <P>I can prove it any time. The last matter with which I want to deal is speed limits.  Whatever co-operation there is between the local authorities, the Department of Justice and the Superintendents of the Garda, it takes two years from the time the county council put forward the proposition, say, for a 30-mile limit to the time we can get authority to carry it out and in the meantime many lives are lost.  There are not sufficient precautions on what, in my opinion, are suicide roads.  Within three miles of my house, eight people have been killed in the past nine months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>A straight stretch where you have people going at 80 or 90 miles an hour.  The speed limit should not be more than 60 mph because no man can control or pretend to control <Col N="1312" /> a car at 80 mph.  My attention was brought to this particularly when in the end we had to get a county council employee to get the children across the road morning and evening when they were going to and coming from school because of the speed of passing traffic.  Warning notices were provided but proved ineffective.  One man was pulled up who had been going at 80 mph.  The sergeant said it took him 200 yards to stop and this man's statement was that the children should be able to look after themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister not to have me coming here in ten years' time complaining about the conditions of jurors. The present conditions should not <Col N="1313" /> exist.  No man should be asked to do public service by coming day after day to a courthouse to find out whether he will be picked for a jury or not.  No man should be put in the position of having to leave his work or business to serve on a jury while there are educated whippersnappers earning £20 to £50 a day doing the same thing, saying: &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; and losing the cases on many occasions.  I am making a comparison between the legal profession whose members between them may earn anything up to £1,000 in a day when, at the same time, 40 or 50 unfortunate country boys have to come to the court, or if they do not they will be fined £3, and may then be told &ldquo;We do not want you until tomorrow&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You may be needed this evening&rdquo;.  If there is anything repugnant to the Constitution, that is, in view of the provision for equal rights for all citizens.  Some of the legal profession might consider that.</P>
    <P>The only other proposition I put up is that the Minister should not put on the ratepayers of Cobh the expense of building houses for the Gardaí.  The Department should build them themselves. We have enough to do to provide houses for the Army and the Navy without having to provide houses for the Gardaí also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Corry will not have left the House before I have wished him another ten years here, the ten years which he hopes to be able to use in complaining on behalf of his constituents, on the one hand, and in blaming the lawyers for their misdemeanours, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an Estimate for £11.5 million. It covers a wide field of activity from car-parking to cinematograph footage down to staff and their equipment to the last degree.  This is an important Department and, because of that, it is essential that it be well run at all levels. I suppose it is better to put the complaints first.  I have great sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy Corry regarding court-houses and houses for Gardaí.  For far too long has the provision of court-houses been left to the local authorities.  It is not easy, in times of increasing costs, for a local authority <Col N="1314" /> to provide court-houses of the kind that should be provided over all the area administered by that local authority, particularly in large and rather poor counties such as Galway, Mayo and Donegal where there must be many court-houses, in view of the farflung nature of the territory and the difficulty of the terrain.</P>
    <P>I do not know what can be done about that but it might not be a bad thing if the Department did take over the provision of court-houses and, seeing that they are responsible for staffing them and to some extent for equipping them, there is no reason why they should not provide court-houses that will be fitting places for the administration and dispensation of justice.</P>
    <P>In speaking of court-houses, one thinks immediately of the court staffs. Although I belong to that profession much maligned by Deputy Corry, I want to say that in all our courts, from the District Court right up to the Supreme, the staff is constituted of men and women of very special qualifications and, over and above those qualifications, they are men and women devoted to their duty and dedicated to giving good service, and that service is given despite what Deputy Corry says.</P>
    <P>The appointment of people to the Bench at its various levels will always be a matter for discussion, but, until somebody thinks of some better way than the present way, I am satisfied to leave it as it is.  I cannot think of any way in which the members of the judiciary could be selected other than by the Government.  It has been suggested, quite vehemently in years gone by, that appointees of a particular Government&mdash;I am not now talking of any particular Government&mdash;could not be relied upon by non-supporters of that Government.  In my experience, nothing could be further from the truth.  I and my colleagues appear before men who were very much opposed to us in political life; we appear before them satisfied that we will get from them the same fair play as can be got from somebody appointed by a Government sympathetic to us.  It is high time the <Col N="1315" /> notion that somebody appointed by a Fianna Fáil Government will show favour to Fianna Fáil supporters were dissipated and banished entirely from the thoughts of any of our people. They are our own judges.  They are our own people.  They are the same as anybody else in any other walk of life. They have a job to do and, in my opinion, and in my experience, they are doing that job extremely well.</P>
    <P>I do not share Deputy Moore's view that the Ban-Ghardaí should be devoted entirely to social work.  The BanGhardaí were selected and trained to assist in the general administration of justice.  It may not be the thing for a Ban-Gharda to spend her time putting notices on windscreens, imposing on-the-spot fines, and so on.  Neither is it any part of a Ban-Gharda's activity&mdash;I should like an assurance from the Minister in this regard; I do not know whether or not the practice has ceased &mdash;to engage in trying to catch people who may be interested in seeking the company and enjoyment, remuneratively, of other kinds of ladies.  I hope that practice has stopped.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  Reference has been made to the Garda programme on television and the part it plays in the detection and prevention of crime.  It is an excellent programme.  If anything, it is probably a little too short but it gets the message over and does good work.  It establishes a link between the police and people in their own homes which is psychologically very important not alone from the point of view of helping in crime prevention and detection but also from the point of view of establishing a healthy <i>liaison</i> between the police and civic-minded citizens. Far too often, we see situations in which a Garda is set upon by people who are either drunk or criminally minded.  Far too often, we see citizens looking on and, on occasion, obviously enjoying the difficulties in which the police find themselves.  It is high time we got rid of the idea that the police are the enemies of the people.  The <Col N="1316" /> police are there to protect us, our property and our children.  They are concerned to administer the law of the land and prevent people from offending against it.</P>
      <P>I had a rather interesting experience recently in Green Street Court-house. I had appeared in three trials in a row and, at the end of a particular trial, I felt an obligation to pay a tribute to the Gardaí involved.  In all three cases, right from the Chief Superintendent down, there was no arrogance shown at any time towards the prisoner.  He was treated with the greatest kindness and deference: he was treated with courtesy and humanity.  Yet there was never&mdash;not once&mdash;the slightest deviation from the path of duty.  Now, had I made an attack on the Garda&mdash;if it were deserved.  I probably would&mdash;the newspapers of this country and of other countries would have seized upon it and sent it far and wide.  Not one word of the tribute I paid to the Gardaí on that particular occasion found its way into print.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have little spots of trouble with the Garda from time to time.  Very often we are not right.  It should be made clear, and should be fully understood by all our people, that the Garda are our brothers, our neighbours, specially selected to do a special job, to protect us, our families and our property.  If at times a member of the Garda appears to lack tact or go off the rails, that is not an indictment of the Force as a whole and I would never accept it as such. In every walk of life, there is always bound to be somebody who will err in such a way as to have the finger pointed at the whole of the community in which he lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation in relation to the identification of dogs does not appear to be observed as well as it might be and it is a matter to which the Garda should direct their attention.  Sheep killing has continued and is occurring even on a larger scale.  In many cases known to me, it has not been possible <Col N="1317" /> to identify the dogs, although they were seen, because they were not wearing the collar and identification mark required by law.</P>
    <P>I do not know what we shall do about car parking.  This city is a certain size and towns are a certain size.  There must be a limit to the amount of space available for parking A certain amount of tact, understanding and humanity must be employed by the Garda towards people.  Recently, some people made the case in the District Court that they had to attend at a certain place because their offices were there, and so on.  I was pleased to note that the district justices were extremely lenient when the defendants made that case to them.</P>
    <P>With regard to speed limits and road accidents, although I should not like to see it happen until I am a little older, at any rate, I am inclined to agree that a 60 miles per hour speed limit all over this country would be a good thing.  I should not like to see it started as an experiment because experiments tend to remain in operation. I am inclined to think, having regard to British figures published since the imposition of the overall speed limit, that speed, probably more than drink, has to do with road accidents.  With the increase in the number of cars and the threatened further increase, I do not know but that the time has come when we should have a central road accidents bureau where matters can be dealt with specially and directed in that regard to it.</P>
    <P>While there is an increase in crime, on figures, I think it is probably to be found in certain age groups of certain kinds of young people.  One cannot walk certain streets in this city without being jostled by people of indiscernible age and almost indiscernible sex.  Those are the chappies and lassies to whom the Garda could well give a jostle rather than have ablebodied men placing pink tickets on the windows of motor cars round about.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a new Criminal Justice Bill.  I do not know <Col N="1318" /> whether it will provide for an increase in the powers of the Garda in relation to crime.  I should not like to see any increase in powers creeping into an Act of Parliament, particularly in the kind of legislation that would enable the police to make an inroad on the liberty of the individual, and so on, but certainly, once crime is noticed and detected, I would give the Garda probably a little more power than they have at the moment to deal with the particular class of offender to which I refer.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a speeding-up and improvement in the Land Registry and it is about time that was done.  The turn-out of maps from the Land Registry, for example, is very bad.  Solicitors, acting for clients who need these maps in a hurry, are almost reaching the limit of their patience in this regard but there is nothing they can do but wait.  There has been a slight improvement in my experience recently but a great deal of leeway remains to be made up.</P>
    <P>We know very little about censorship. The Minister tells us that over 1,000 films were examined this year and that something under 1,000 were examined last year.  He tells us that nearly three million feet of film was examined last year while, for this year, the number of feet is over three million. He tells us that so many films were accepted in whole and so many films in part.  He tells us that so many films were rejected outright.  I do not know that we are entitled to any more information if we are to be kept on a high moral plane.  We do not know why these were rejected in part: I take it that it is on general standards of decency and morality and there might be some other reasons.  How does a man sit through three million feet of film?  This is a much-coveted job.  I hope he has assistance of some kind. Certainly, if 49 films were rejected over the year, it represents almost one a week.  I suppose he would be compensated somewhat by seeing something that is prohibited to the rest of us but there must be a powerful amount of titillation in three million feet of film.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> The Minister referred to law reform and Deputy Corry referred to the jury system.  I want to see jurors, whether in the city or in the country, adequately remunerated for the service they give. I do not want the service they give to be construed as the day they serve as distinct from the day they come and go home again.  When a man comes 30 or 40 miles at his own expense there should be some remuneration per day for that and, in addition, if he is called upon to serve on the jury, he should be paid extra for that.  It will not cost an awful lot.  I think the Minister is bringing in something about this.  I hope the remuneration to jurors will be adequate not like the miserable pittances in the legal aid system which I hope he will soon be reviewing as well and will make one fee for, say, a murder charge for people defending in a murder charge rather than half of that fee for attempted murder which, at the moment, could carry the same penalty.</P>
    <P>Apart from remunerating jurors, I want the jury system retained.  A citizen has no better guarantee of his life or his liberty than when it is entrusted into the hands and minds and consideration of 12 of his fellowmen. There are people I know who are anxious to get rid of the jury system, who feel sort of intellectually superior to it.  They think that jurors are people who do not and cannot understand.  If a juror, or a jury, does not understand, then it is not his fault.  Very often, it is the fault either of the people addressing them or the people charging them. In my experience, juries do understand and jury verdicts are, almost without exception, the proper ones in relevant cases.  Trying to get rid of jurors and the jury system is something that is springing from this new idea of humanitarianism, a new liberalism, which for the most part is pseudo, completely false, and which means you have to be, as it were, not fully out of step but half out of step and then pretending all the others are out of step because they are not doing it as you are doing it.  We are going too far in this country, and indeed in the whole world, with this idea of more liberalism, <Col N="1320" /> of being advanced and of being &ldquo;with it&rdquo;, and in all these almost teenage phrases being adopted in practice by the grown-ups.  I want to keep the jury system for that reason.</P>
    <P>On the question of law reform, I want to say we should not be erring in this regard with pseudo-liberalism and pseudo-humanitarian attitudes.  As time passes, I am proud to recall that I divided the Seanad of this Legislature twice to retain hanging for certain offences.  I want to say, having regard to my experience and having regard to knowledge gained elsewhere, that the day is not far distant when the Government must bring back hanging for more offences than it is provided for in legislation now.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the abolition of capital punishment as a deterrent has not worked, on the figures.  It is now clear that the abolition of capital punishment has made it easier for an innocent man to be convicted on a capital charge, now non-capital, when he would have been convicted probably of a lesser charge under the older penal code.  I am expressing this as a personal view and I am not commiting my Party to it&mdash;I should love to be able to commit them to it and to commit the whole House to it&mdash;that hanging should be restored as a deterrent, not necessarily to be used on all occasions but certainly to be there so that it could be used and that people would know it was there.  Under the present scheme of things, there is no deterrent of any kind.</P>
    <P>Let us not be carried away by ideas of civil liberties.  When we are talking about taking away life and humanity entering into it, all that people talk about is the life of the person who has taken a life without any reference to the consequences for the family of the person whose life he has taken. Let us forget about this kind of mollycoddling humanity.  Humanity can be exercised, even though you have capital punishment on the Statute Book.  Humanity can always be exercised by a humane Government and a humane Minister, as it has been at all times in the past under any Government in this country, but, until such time as it is restored, you are <Col N="1321" /> going to have trouble and more trouble and the lives and property of citizens will be less secure.</P>

We know, too, that, when he introduced this Bill and when he saw the reaction to it throughout the country and the widespread objections raised against it, he decided he would then start to consult the people.  He has since consulted the various groups.  We have the recent business of his consulting the NAC, most of the members of which are the Minister's nominees.

There is no assurance whatever that these amendments will go through the House.  We are not going to take any chance with the Minister.  We just do not know what he will do when he gets this money.  We want to ensure, in opposing this motion, that he will never get the money.</P>
      <P>Neither are we going to provide money to enable the Minister to send more of the farmers to jail, as he is providing for in section 8 of the Bill. Enough of the farmers are in jail already or have been in jail in the recent past.  We are not going to provide him with more money to send more of them to jail when they should be at home working their farms and trying to recoup some of the £6 million loss suffered last year as a result of the way they were misguided and misled into a line of production for which the Government had no market. Neither are we going to vote money to ensure, as is provided for in section 1 of the Bill, that a farmer will not be allowed to sell his cattle in his own backyard or that he will not be allowed to take up his neighbour's cow and have her sold in his backyard.</P>
      <P>This is a most far-reaching measure.  There is no indication in this measure that there is any good in it or that anybody in the country is likely to reap any benefit from it.  We are being asked to provide the Minister with money to enable him to wreak his vengeance on the farming organisations of this country, organisations that have done a good job.  We refuse to do that.</P>

      <P>We are not going to provide the Minister with money to enable him to deprive the co-operative societies of the right to carry on the business of co-operative marts in the best interests of their own members. That is something which the law of the country entitles them to do.  That is something of which the Minister is setting out to deprive them.  Under this Bill, for which he is looking for money this evening, he wants to say to the co-operative societies: &ldquo;You cannot run your business according to the existing law.  You must accept the cattle belonging to the puffers and the racketeers.  Nobody must be refused. You must give the same benefits to those who are not members as to those who are.&rdquo;  There is no point in the Minister and other Ministers and the Taoiseach going around the country blowing about their support for private enterprise and for co-operation if they are going to set out in this piece of legislation to kill co-operation and if they are going to come to us in this House to enable them to kill co-operation. If this House decides that this should be done, we have much less sense than I ever thought we would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the co-operative marts have not the right to make their own decisions about entries, if private enterprise marts are not free to make these decisions, then it is the end of these marts.  When these farmers were investing their money, they were not warned by the Minister: &ldquo;When you invest <Col N="1327" /> your money, we will move in to control your business and, in order that we will not be prevented from doing that, we will seek and get the protection of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;  That was the time to warn the people but, instead of doing that, the Minister comes along now and tells them that now that they have successfully established their business he is going to take it over and is going to look to the Dáil for money to take it over.</P>
    <P>This is something that we in this House should never agree to.  This Bill is purely destructive and is of no benefit to any section of the community. It is brought in at the end of the session and is being bulldozed through the House.  If the Minister thinks he is going to bulldoze such legislation through this House, he has another think coming to him.  If he wants opposition he will get it and we tell him that he will not get legislation like this through the House without opposition from this Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Money Resolution is a public scandal and Dáil Éireann is a much poorer place than I thought it to be if it does not refuse to furnish money to the Minister for Agriculture to publicise before the world that our farmers are not fit to be spoken to unless they are approached under police protection.  I ran the Department of Agriculture for six years, for more than six years, and I introduced more schemes in that time to bring our farmers into closer contact with the Department than all the Governments who went before me.  But if any inspector of my Department had come to me and asked me for authority to bring with him an inspector of the Garda to interview a farmer, I would have told him to go and seek a job in Grangegorman, because that is all he would be fit for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we imagine the picture of this country being given to the world when it is said that an officer of the Department of Agriculture should not be asked to take the risk of interviewing farmers except under police protection? We hear of farmers in other countries demonstrating every day of the week, French farmers, German <Col N="1328" /> farmers, Dutch farmers, but where have we heard of the representatives of the Department of Agriculture in any of these countries seeking power in a Bill to approach individual farmers under police protection?  How low can we sink?  How low can the Department of Agriculture sink?</P>
    <P>Can anyone imagine the officers of the Department of Health, the officers of the Department of Social Welfare, the officers of the Department of Labour coming into this House and asking for approval of a Bill so that they should have our authority and our permission to seek the company of members of the Garda Síochána when going about their business?  Can you imagine what the Labour Party would say if the Minister for Labour should come in here and ask that, any time a representative of his Department was transacting business with any trade union, he should bring with him a Garda?  Can you imagine the spectacle of an officer of the Department of Labour marching into Liberty Hall escorted by a posse of Civic Guards and warning all and sundry to get out of his path and that if not, he would force his path and that, if not, he would force assistance whatever number of Gardaí he would consider appropriate?</P>
    <P>God knows, it is a bad day for this country when the Minister for Agriculture has to go about his duties under police protection.  I hope we can say that we in this House will not vote this man any money for such a purpose. I wish I could believe that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party would say to themselves that they have chosen as Minister for Agriculture a man who cannot approach the farmers except under police protection and that it is time that such a man was elsewhere.  We have seen members of this Government marching through pickets; we have seen them using the expedient of going in the back door to avoid the embarrassment of facing the picket; we have seen the Minister's predecessor mobilising the Black Marias, collecting the farmers from before this House and bringing them to prison, but this Minister is the first Minister of this State who has brought a proposition before Dáil Éireann asking Dáil Éireann to provide him <Col N="1329" /> with the money to provide police protection for himself and his inspectors in their contacts with the farmers.  I dare you to vote money for such a purpose; I dare you to get up and apologise at every street corner of this country for ever bringing in such a proposal.</P>

      <P>Listen carefully, for several of the words in this section are polysyllabic, but, if the Deputy does not understand them.  I pray him to interrupt me and I will try to convert them into monosyllabic words the better to penetrate his intelligence. Section 7 of the Bill to which I am now referring reads:</P>
      <P>An officer of the Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputy Booth to an old practice here.  We define &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 1: &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Section 7 days:</P>
      <P>An officer of the Minister shall, for the purposes of the execution of this Act, have power to do all or any of the following things,</P>
      <P>That means, for the Deputy's information, the things that I am going to read out.  It does not mean that the Minister is following people around the room.  It means the things I am going to mention and the things referred to:</P>
      <P>that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to enter, inspect and examine&mdash;&ldquo;inspect&rdquo; means to look around; &ldquo;examine&rdquo; means to look closely &mdash;at all reasonable times</P>
      <P>God only knows what that means, Sir, because &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in Fianna Fáil language may mean anything on God's earth.  It was interpreted today as meaning that, if amendments were circulated to Deputies at 3.24 o'clock, they had been circulated in due time for mature consideration at 7 o'clock the same evening.  So, &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; I must leave to Deputy Booth's personal interpretation.</P>

      <P>Now, I must ask Deputy Booth to concentrate his attention because he has apparently failed to understand this paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1331" /> (b)  to take with him a member of the Garda Síochána if he has reasonable cause to apprehend any serious obstruction in the execution of his duty;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The distinction is a fine one.  When this Bill was under discussion, the Minister was engaged in public business in the Seanad and he sent the Parliamentary Secretary to us&mdash;I have forgotten what Department &mdash;Deputy Gibbons.  He would not trust the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davern, to speak.  So, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Gibbons, was sent in and told us that the reason this Bill was being brought in at the present time was the dangerous atmosphere that was abroad.  Now, either Deputy Gibbons was speaking the truth on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture or he was not.  If he was, I do not think I am going beyond the limits of legitimate interpretation if I say that this subsection, paragraph (b), represents a claim by this Minister to ask money from the Dáil to provide him with police protection, or the officers of his Department, when they go to transact their business with the farmers of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was Minister for Agriculture for seven years.  Senator Ryan was Minister for Agriculture for 15 years.  The formidable Deputy Paddy Smith threatened to bring in ten fields of inspectors and to line the ditches of the famers with Civic Guards.  None of them ever did it.  In all my experience I never remember even an inkling of a suggestion being made that the officers of the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1332" /> require police protection going about their duty.  I am not painting a picture of the farmers of this country as being all haloed angels.  Some of them are cranky, like the rest of us; some of them are difficult, like the rest of us; some of them are suspicious, like the rest of us; but the character and hallmark of an officer of the Department of Agriculture always was that he did not try to force his way in; he did not try to coerce a farmer.  He went to his gate and, if he was not bidden welcome, he went to a neighbour and tried to get the neighbour to explain the mission on which he was and, if the farmer said: &ldquo;No; I do not want you&rdquo;, he went away.</P>
      <P>I remember very well one time that I was charged by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, to eliminate a certain cattle disease in the Loop Head Peninsula and I remember sending a staff of veterinary surgeons, officers of the Department, to the Loop Head Peninsula. Every farmer, with the exception of about six, received them warmly and gladly and had them treat their cattle.  When that was done, these same officers went back and, by persuasion and by reassurance, they got five of the recalcitrant six to welcome them in. One fellow stood out.  It never dawned on them even to ask me: &ldquo;Are we to break our way in?  Are we to get Civic Guards?&rdquo; They simply said: &ldquo;Very well; we have done all in our power to explain but he has exercised his perfectly undoubted right to say: `That is my gate.  Do not open it.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>That story had a sequel because in the following year we went back.  The cattle of all the other farmers in Loop Head were cured of the infestation.  Six of this man's cattle were dying and he came to us then and asked us to come to his aid and we did not say: &ldquo;Because you threw us out last year, your bleeding cattle can die now.  We do not care.&rdquo; We told the officers of the Department to jump at the chance, that the man had learned by experience what he would not learn by advice, by all means to go in and help him all they could.  He lost a couple of cattle but we saved the rest and we were proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not an extraordinary metamorphosis <Col N="1333" /> in the relations between the Department of Agriculture of that day and the Department of Agriculture today who have asked this House for police protection?</P>
    <P>I want to make this perfectly clear. When I speak of the Department of Agriculture, I ask the House to think of me as speaking of the Minister for Agriculture.  That is what I am asking of you.  The Minister, oddly enough, has suddenly grown sensitive.  He has the kind of feeling that I am pursuing a dark vendetta against his person. That is not true.  It is too late in my life to be pursuing vendettas against anybody.  I am pursuing vendettas against the policies for which he stands but I do ask the House to bear this in mind that 90 per cent of the personnel of the Department of Agriculture today is the same personnel as served me when I was Minister for Agriculture. The change is not in the Department, in the building, in its personnel or its establishment.  They will serve whatever Minister it is their duty to serve. The change is in the Minister and the policies for which he stands.  I give him this credit, at least, that I think he will be glad if I make that distinction and whatever strictures I have to pass on the request presented by him to this House.  I pass them on him and not upon the establishment over which he presides.</P>
    <P>There is no money going to be voted from this side of the House to send police into the farmers of this country. There is no money going to be voted from this side of the House to proclaim to the world that the Irish Department of Agriculture is no longer able to function amongst our own people unless under police protection. I say deliberately that we shall resort to every legitimate parliamentary device to make manifest our detestation and repudiation of this slander not only on the farmers but on the public servants who serve them.  The Deputy from Carna who, for his local associations, if not for his own distinguished person, has been high in my esteem, urged me not to be so warm in my protestation.  I think if he had ever been Minister for Agriculture he would share my sentiments of revulsion at <Col N="1334" /> this provision.  When the Minister discussed this proposal with the members of his Party, I think the vast majority of them said: &ldquo;We will vote with our Party in any Division but we are damned if we will vote for that.&rdquo; I like to think that is true and I like to think his Parliamentary Secretary was one of the first who made it clear he thought this clause unnecessary.</P>
    <P>That is not the only reason I urge the House to reject this Money Resolution. I will be no party to voting money to enable this Minister for Agriculture or any Minister for Agriculture, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, to implement section 3 of this Bill in its present form.  Section 3 (2) sets out:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, at the time of the granting of a licence, attach to the licence such conditions as he shall think proper and shall specify in the licence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, amend or revoke a condition attached to a licence.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies understand what that means?  Look down at subsection (6) which says:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, a person who carries on the business of a livestock mart at any place and who, immediately before the passing of this Act, carried on that business at that place, shall, if, in relation to the place, the regulations under this Act are complied with, be entitled to be granted a licence in respect of the place.</P>
    <P>Judge now what the true meaning of that is.  When I first read it I said this removes a formidable objection that first presented itself to me when this Bill I first considered, but consider subsection (6) in the light of subsection (2), if subsection (2) is to stand and if we are to give the Minister money to implement it.  Under subsection (6) every existing mart can claim and get a licence to trade. However, on the following morning, the Minister may, under subsection (2), attach to the licence such conditions as he thinks proper and shall specify in <Col N="1335" /> the licence.  Here the Minister will be filled with righteous indignation that I misrepresent him.  He will say that what the subsection says is that the Minister may at the time of granting the licence attach to the licence such conditions as he shall think proper and shall specify in the licence.  Remember that under subsection (6) a mart in being has a right to a licence.  This seems watertight but you have to reckon with the Minister for Agriculture. Having granted the licence under subsection (6)&mdash;he places a statutory duty upon himself to do that&mdash;and having prescribed the conditions of the licence at the time of granting it, he provides under subsection (3):</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, amend or revoke a condition attached to a licence.</P>
    <P>So that immediately the entire guarantee of the right to a licence by way of succession evaporates in the light of the Minister's power to amend or revoke any condition attaching to it. Suppose the condition of the licence is that it shall trade between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Suppose the Minister wants to close it down and amend that to: &ldquo;Between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.&rdquo;, that is good-bye to the mart.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies, probably Deputies on this side of the House, who will say: &ldquo;Ah, that is fantastic.  That could not be done.&rdquo; There are very few Deputies on any side of this House who have ever seen Fianna Fáil with an absolute majority in Dáil Éireann.  I do not need to warn you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because we have watched it together, but I warn Deputies the moment Fianna Fáil get a clear majority in this House, they go berserk. Deputies can see themselves that, amonst the whole crowd of them, the Minister for Agriculture is the most berserk.</P>

      <P>Here is only the very opening of this story.  I want to direct the attention of Deputies to section 6 of the Bill. Here also is a section for the financing of which this Party will not vote. Section 6 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, for the purpose of ensuring the proper conduct of <Col N="1337" /> places where the business of a livestock mart is carried on and the proper conduct of such business, adequate and suitable hygienic and veterinary standards in relation to such places and auctions of livestock at such places and the provision of adequate and suitable accommodation and facilities for such auctions and for persons and livestock at such auctions, make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to such places and such businesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entitled to discuss the principle of the Bill but I am entitled to give my reasons why I will not vote money.  I am not discussing the principle of the Bill.  I am discussing segregated, clearly-indicated vindictive provisions in the Bill which no self-respecting Deputy should vote money for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> I direct the attention of the House to section 6 (2).  The Minister wants money under this Money Resolution to prescribe the manner in which entries for auctions of livestock at such places shall be received.  Is there any other business in the country for which the Minister claims the right to prescribe the manner in which the business is carried on?  A very large number of these auction marts are operated by farmers' co-operatives, controlled, it is to be presumed, by a committee of farmers representative of the farmers of the area.  In the situation as it at present obtains, if the local, individually-owned mart treats its customers with disrespect or injustice, every customer has a remedy available to him to take his cattle to another mart and he is quite entitled to go to his neighbour and say to him: &ldquo;I brought my cattle there and asked that they be included in the catalogue and I was told that they would be put in the catalogue at 9 o'clock at night.  I was entitled to be treated fairly.&rdquo; Anybody attempting to operate such a system in rural Ireland would very quickly find that the majority of the farmers would take their cattle to another mart.</P>
    <P>While it is true that a mart cannot last if it has not buyers who come there, the buyers will not come to a mart where there are likely to be no cattle.  There is a sanction operated every day, operated by those who deal with marts, to see that those who deal with marts get fair treatment.  There is sufficient proliferation of marts in most parts of the country and east of the Shannon to make sure that competition operates effectively.  The Minister has said that one of the reasons he has brought in this Bill is to prevent undue proliferation of marts but now we are to provide and pay for an inspectorate and we are asked to vote money for them to go in and examine every entry of cattle in an auction mart and weigh up whether every entrant has been equitably treated by the owner of the mart.</P>
    <P>This is regulation gone mad.  Can you picture any dispensary with an inspector from the Department of Health going in there and asking: &ldquo;What time did you come in this <Col N="1339" /> morning?  Did he see you yet?  Did he give you pills or a bottle?&rdquo; Can you picture a Department of Health official going to a dentist's waiting-room and asking: &ldquo;Did he pull your tooth yet or did he only fill it?&rdquo; Can you picture an inspector of the Department of Labour going into Liberty Hall, or wherever the headquarters of the Irish Workers Union now are, and querying them as to the order in which their membership is enrolled?  Or is it that the farmers of this country are an inferior race?  Are we to proceed on the assumption that the marts run by farmers' co-operatives are corruptly run or on the assumption that we are back in the old days of the gombeen man when the people were illiterate and helpless in the hands of the landlords and had to go hat in hand to get a little credit from the gombeen man?</P>
    <P>I know the farmers of this country. I have lived and had a shop in a poor part of Ireland, in County Monaghan, but I know no man today who is a potential victim of the gombeen man. The merchants must go out and seek trade and custom.  Are the patrons of these marts so poor and craven that they need the Minister for Agriculture to see that they are not robbed and plundered by the marts operated by their own neighbours or else by the marts operated in their immediate vicinity and in competition with so many other marts adjoining that the Minister for Agriculture says he needs power to prevent further proliferation of marts?</P>
    <P>Are you surprised, Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I will not vote money for these purposes?  But that is not all the Minister wants money for.  He wants money to hire inspectors and, having satisfied themselves that the cattle tendered for sale are properly entered on the auctioneer's list and that the entries for such auctions shall not be refused except in circumstances prescribed by the Minister's regulations, he now wants further finance under paragraph (c) to prescribe the manner in which such auctions shall be conducted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> I ask rational Deputies to visualise the situation.  A man who has been selling cattle all his life sees four bullocks walk into the ring and proceeds to sell them in accordance with the ordinary custom of the trade.  The owner of the cattle is there beside him. If the owner feels the auctioneer is not giving him a fair run and not giving the bidders a fair opportunity, all he has to do is raise his hand and say: &ldquo;Withdraw the cattle&rdquo;.  He can stop the auction and say: &ldquo;I am not satisfied. You are not giving the bidders a fair do&rdquo;, and he can add, in the presence of the assembled company: &ldquo;And it will be a long bitter day before I ever trouble you with my cattle again&rdquo;.  But that is not what will happen here.  What will happen here is that there will be a gentleman in a white coat, with documents of identity. The auctioneer will get up and offer the cattle for sale, offer everybody an opportunity to bid&mdash;four bids, five bids, six bids&mdash;and he will then say: &ldquo;I am going to sell the cattle.  I am asking you the first time.  I am asking you the second time....&rdquo;&ldquo;Whoa&rdquo;, says the fellow in the white coat. &ldquo;Start all over again.&rdquo;&ldquo;Very well, Sir.  Six nice bullocks here.  We will put them up again.  First time, anyone care to to bid?  Second time, anyone care to bid?&rdquo;&ldquo;Whoa&rdquo;, says the fellow in the white coat, &ldquo;You are not complying with the Minister's regulation.  The Minister says you must wait three minutes.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anticipating. I am stating the grounds on which I refuse to vote money for a particular purpose.  I am not invoking the principles of the Bill or its detailed provisions, which are, as I have said, so <Col N="1343" /> manifestly unjust in their character that no sane Deputy could provide supply for them and I have done that to such good effect, I think, that the Chair feels it is almost impossible to believe that supply is asked for such a purpose.</P>
      <P>I want to point out why I refuse supply.  I refuse to vote money for this provision.  Deputy Clinton has already referred to this matter.  Section 7, subsection (2), provides&mdash;I ask you to listen very closely to the words&mdash; that:</P>
      <P>If any person wilfully delays an officer of the Minister in the exercise of any power under this section, or fails to comply with the requisition of such an officer in pursuance of this section...</P>
      <P>he will be deemed to have committed an offence.  Look now at subsection (4) of the same section:</P>
      <P>An officer of the Minister performing functions under this Act shall be furnished with a certificate of his authorisation to perform these functions and when visiting a place where the business of a livestock mart is carried on shall, if so required, produce the said certificate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Mark these words:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the person who carries on such business or any other person holding a responsible position of management at the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observe the situation that arises.  We are asked to vote money to provide inspectors who shall have the right to go in and ask Deputy Allen for information and Deputy Allen commits an offence if he refuses to furnish that information.  But if Deputy Allen is not a person holding a responsible position of management at the place he has no right to say to the officer of the Department: &ldquo;Produce your authorisation&rdquo;.  Deputy Allen, in the context I have just read out, is only a person who, the inspector has reasonable cause to believe, is employed in the place.  Has anybody ever heard before of this House being asked to supply money to provide an officer who shall have the right, without showing any warrant of authority, to <Col N="1344" /> go in and address a question to anybody on a premises and thereby create an offence punishable by six months in jail if that person refuses the information, without any obligation on the Minister or his servant to produce authority and say: &ldquo;I represent the Minister for Agriculture and I am acting under the Livestock Marts Act&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>How many members of Fianna Fáil understand that is what they are being asked to vote money for&mdash;to pay officers to exercise a right of that kind?  The thing is as daft as a six-penny watch, which is bad enough, but it is also unjust.  I know why these absurdities and monstrosities have crept into this Bill.  This Bill was drafted in a temper, at short notice, by a neurasthenic Minister who wanted to ram it through.  If the draftsman and those responsible for this type of work had been given time to sit down and read the Bill, then these idiotic anachronisms would not exist in it. While they are there, I shall not vote money to provide the personnel because to do so would be an outrage on the due processes of law in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to a paragraph which I do not believe Deputies fully appreciate.  Deputy Clinton has spoken of a Bill to jail farmers.  I want to warn the House that we are now being asked for money to jail a member of any committee of any agricultural society that operates a cattle mart.  I say that, according to the terms of this Bill, when enacted, if Deputy Allen or the Deputy sitting beside him were members of a co-operative society in their relevant constituencies and an offence were committed down in Wexford or down in Cork by the mart officials operating under the committee of management to which they belong, then, on their emergence from Dáil Éireann into Kildare Street or Merrion Street, they could be arrested, brought before the courts and fined or imprisoned. Does anybody in this House want to vote money for that purpose? But that is in the Bill and that is what it is proposed to do.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, I believe the requisitions upon us to provide money for <Col N="1345" /> these crazy purposes are due as much to the temperament of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as to his real intention.  I believe that, if this whole question of cattle marts, their administration, and so on, had been discussed quietly with the IAOS and with the proprietors of marts and with the representative bodies of farmers, such discussion would have produced two results.  The Minister would have had a balanced view put before him for and against the control by the Department of Agriculture of the whole business of marts.  I admit that there is a case to be made for as well as against that matter, in principle.  I believe that ultimately, having heard all reasonable views&mdash;and when better than during the Recess&mdash;he could have come to a decision.  He could then have issued a White Paper and circulated it to the co-operative societies, to the proprietors of marts and to farming organisations saying, in effect: &ldquo;Having listened to you all on this matter, these are the lines on which I propose to proceed and I should be glad of your comments&rdquo;. All that could be done before next October.  On the other hand, the Minister might say, in effect: &ldquo;The game is not worth the candle.  There is so much to be said for the proposal and there is so much to be said against it.  I shall not ask Dáil Éireann for money for it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister could come in and say, in effect: &ldquo;I am satisfied that legislation is necessary and here is the story.  I saw the NFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, the body over which I myself preside. I discussed the matter with the representatives of the marts co-operatives and marts proprietors and here is the story they told me.  Now, this is the fairest thing I can do in all the circumstances and I have no hesitation in asking for the money to do it&rdquo;.  I can fully understand the Minister coming back to the Dáil and saying, in effect: &ldquo;There is a great deal to be said for marts but there is so much to be said against the proposal that I have decided to drop it&rdquo;.  I remember myself doing just that on the issue of the County Committee of Agriculture Bill in which Deputy Patrick Smith imposed <Col N="1346" /> the requisition of 50 per cent of outside members.  It was argued for and against.  I remember saying, when I was Minister for Agriculture, in effect: &ldquo;To hell with it.  Who the hell cares?  Let us get on with the mountain of urgent and important business which we have to do.  Let them go on chewing the rag and making up their minds. I do not give a damn.&rdquo; I dropped it because I thought there was an awful lot to be said for and against it and I had much too much to do to agonise whether I should or should not introduce legislation to that effect.</P>
    <P>The last thing I should do would be to rush into the House in the month of July and to say: &ldquo;You must make up your minds about this before the House adjourns.&rdquo; Why?  The whole cattle population of this country will not emigrate.  I wish to God some of them could emigrate at the present time because we cannot sell them.  It would not go in the next six months. Why could that attitude not be taken and the whole matter excogitated and come back here with a substantially agreed decision?  The matter is not necessarily acrimonious.  How can the matter have become one which can give rise to such furious acrimony as this Bill has done?  It may be that this was worth while in order to teach the Minister his job.  This is not the way to go about getting agriculture to function in this country.  I believe this House would react sympathetically and with understanding to any proposals the Minister might bring before it after mature reflection and consultation with all those concerned.  He might come here and say, in effect: &ldquo;I do not intend to do anything because I do not think a conclusive case can be made one way or the other&rdquo;.  I would say: &ldquo;I do not think the Minister ought to do anything until he is convinced that a certain course is necessary in the public interest&rdquo;.  If he had come back and said, in effect: &ldquo;Farmers of one organisation after another came in and said they wanted this general supervision by the Department of Agriculture of this whole business&rdquo; and if he had gone on to say that the proprietary marts were against it but that the co-operative <Col N="1347" /> marts said they did not care, that they were quite indifferent, that they were just as glad to have the Minister's representative there as any other, I do not rule out the possibility that I should have said: &ldquo;There is good ground for bringing in proposals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us not have a Bill that we have to shove down anybody's throat with a ramrod.  Above all, let us have a Bill which, by the care in its preparation and the forbearance shown by those producing it, has procured a substantial consensus of all parts of the House that, with the information the Minister has accumulated, he has no alternative but to introduce the measure.  I am as certain as I am standing here that, if the Minister had pursued that course on this Money Resolution, not a word would have been spoken and we should have given it to him.  We might have brought in a list of amendments but we should have argued them quite peaceably.  No matter what Minister brings in a Bill, if it is brought in and discussed in the right spirit, two heads are nearly always better than one. However, this Bill starts off loathed before it reaches its adolescence and I hope rotten and dead before it attains its maturity.</P>

      <P>We have had instances again and again of different Departments being unable to meet their commitments in regard to the provision of public funds for services which would be of marked advantage to the economy and to individuals in different spheres of activity.  We have had a reduction in regard to local government funds for road improvements and reduced amounts for housebuilding, water, sewerage and other essential schemes.  The Minister for Lands told us that he must reduce by 20 per cent the amount for afforestation.  This brought about a great deal of redundancy so far as forestry workers are concerned.</P>

      <P>In view of the short supply of money, I claim that there is no justification for providing money for this Bill.  Is that not justifiable? This Bill is a vindictive one.  It was brought in in a hasty, ill-considered fashion and there was no justification for it.  I am speaking on behalf of the Labour Party.  Surely we are not going to vote for the provision of public money for the implementation of a measure which is vindictive and was brought in in a hasty, ill-considered fashion?  If regulations were required, one would expect an intelligent Minister, a Minister who had the interests of the marts at heart, a Minister anxious to secure the development of <Col N="1349" /> the marts and to provide better services, would first have consulted the various marts committees and have found out, if such a Bill were necessary, how can we improve the system.</P>
      <P>Is it necessary to have State interference? I dislike State interference where it is unnecessary and unjustifiable. Already we have too much State interference, and, as Deputy Dillon showed in the past hour, we can see in the various sections the amount of State interference this Bill contains.  As I was saying, if we were to provide regulations for the development of the marts, if it were thought necessary that a licensing system should be implemented, the Minister should, first and foremost, have had consultations with the interests concerned and particularly with the different marts committees.  No such discussions were held.</P>

      <P>Do not interrupt me.  The Deputy will have plenty of time to make his speech.  However, I do not mind if he interrupts me for half an hour because I will take him on.  We have the Minister's statement of 21st June in which he was making a case for this Bill and, to my mind, it was a very weak case.  Why is there urgency about this Bill?  This is, if you like, adjournment week and this is not a matter of urgency.  We felt it would be advisable to postpone the Committee Stage until next October and possibly, in the intervening period, we might be able to get some new ideas about what a measure of this nature should be like, if we think such a measure is necessary at all, of which I am very doubtful.  I am doubtful of the necessity for such a measure because the marts were established without any State aid.  They were established by farmers coming together in different centres and most, if not all, of them are working smoothly and successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conversant with the Cork Co-operative Marts which operate in Cork county.  They are managed by a most capable committee of farmers, men of the highest integrity.  I mention men of the highest integrity because it is implied <Col N="1350" /> in the Bill that people in control of the marts at present are people of doubtful character.  That is the implication to be drawn from the various provisions whereby the police can walk in and inspect books, records and documents.  That is the implication but it is not the case and I am sure the position in Cork is no different from that in other counties and that the marts committees elsewhere, as in Cork, are composed of men of the highest integrity.  I know that the members of the Cork Co-operative Marts are people of the highest integrity. They did not ask the State or the Minister to implement this Bill. Neither did they ask for the provision of public funds to carry it on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If any mart should get into difficulties so far as its application for a licence is concerned, or if an application for a licence is refused, the Minister is the sole authority.  We have enough political jobbery at present without giving a Minister more authority in these matters.  Everybody knows the present system, which I am hopeful of dealing with in the not too distant future, in regard to the granting of approval under the Planning Act and that appeals to the Department of Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am rather doubtful and I would be doubtful no matter what Government are in power&mdash;and I am not reflecting on the members of the present Government&mdash;of giving a Minister authority to decide an appeal.  We know that, when a Minister has that authority, those trying to get approval from the Minister will travel around trying to get someone supposed to know the Minister, trying to get some of the Minister's Party to whisper into the Minister's ear that this fellow is a great Party supporter and helped in the provision of funds at election time.

      <P>I shall be brief. I do not want to hold up the House, nor do I want to hold up the Minister other than to express some relevant views on the Bill.  I oppose this Money Resolution because there is a very strong feeling against this Bill among the mart committees generally.  They feel that the introduction of a measure such as this, without any prior consultation, is a reflection on them.  We know that the mart committees came together in co-operative societies.  Most of the marts are on a co-operative basis.</P>

If there is justification in going along to the premises of a co-operative mart owner, inspecting it at any time and tearing the place asunder, if the officer of the Department so wishes, because he believes there may be some breach of the law within the premises then the same justification could be made for going into any big store in Dublin, privately or co-operatively owned, and examining the books on the suspicion <Col N="1355" /> that something shady is going on within the premises.</P>

      <P>This is how I see the implications of this Bill.  I am stating that I oppose the Money Resolution and I shall close in a few more sentences.  I do not like arguing with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle as I have great respect for the Chair.  You are quite reasonable most of the time except when you are under any pressure.  I am sure you are not.  To give you a little ease, I shall close by repeating the statement I made at the outset.  It is the firm conviction of the Labour Party, having discussed the pros and cons of this Bill, that we should oppose it in its entirely and that we should oppose the provision of the moneys being asked for in the Resolution before us.  But if the Minister is agreeable to postpone the measure and have the consultations we think are necessary with the different mart committees and tries to devise some measures, if they are required, which he thinks would be helpful towards developing the marts, perhaps we could treat it differently.  But from the case made for this Bill&mdash;I do not want to repeat the arguments made by previous speakers&mdash;we have no hesitation and no alternative but to oppose the Bill. If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had been more lenient with me, I would have given some more reasons but I think it better to leave them over until the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The House finds itself in the rather unusual position that a Money Resolution is being opposed; but, when the House feel so strongly about a matter that they must oppose it at every step and give reasons for such opposition, then one knows that this unusual aspect is just a facet of the unusual situation in which a Bill is being pushed through here in the most blatant manner by somebody who has indicated during the passage of the Bill his disrespect for this House and those <Col N="1356" /> prepared to sit in it.  When one finds a Minister say to an august member on this side of the House who has said that he would not stand for this Bill &ldquo;Then you can sit for it&rdquo; one realises that such is the reply of a man who either has a lack of knowledge of proper behaviour or else of a man who has gone around the bend.  That sort of thing is neither dignified nor proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been unkindly dealt with by the electorate either.  I must make sure that I remain within the conventions of order in this House but the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has advised us that we are entitled to discuss under this Money Resolution the normal aspects of the spending of money.  A point was made here that the Garda would not be brought in to control the operations of marts unless there was some suspected breach of the law but I would draw the attention of the House to paragraph (b) of section 7 of the Bill which says that an officer of the Minister shall, for the purposes of the execution of this Act, have power to do all or any of the following things, that is to say, to take with him a member of the Garda Síochána if he has reasonable cause to apprehend any serious obstruction in the execution of his duty.  I would draw your attention to the fact that, in the normal aspect of the spending of money, there is provision for the bringing in of Gardaí on to the floor of the mart.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (f) of section 7 is a much more powerful and strong provision. This paragraph says that an officer of the Minister may:</P>
      <P>exercise such other powers as may be necessary for carrying this Act into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that this suggests, even though <Col N="1357" /> the Minister has now withdrawn the subsection, that there is power given to the inspector to call in Gardaí if he thinks this is necessary and that I regard as a valid and proper reason why we should speak and vote against this Money Resolution.  I refer also to a matter of broad principle contained in the Bill which will result in the spending of money by officers of the Department in advising the Minister to exempt from the provisions of the Bill certain marts, to grant licences to certain people and to refuse licences to others.</P>
    <P>This means that, if the Minister so desires, having received all this advice from the officers of the Department who are paid to provide such advice, he may decide, if he or his successor should be a culpable political Minister, to provide a mart in a particular area which would give a colossal income every year and that he could give this facility to a supporter of his own political Party while refusing it to the supporter of another.  That decision would be made on a point of political expediency rather than on whether a mart was proper at that particular place and the Minister will spend money for the purpose of obtaining the advice of his officers to such effect.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech, the Minister mentioned six different instances where there was control of agricultural produce by the Department of Agriculture.  I refer now to the fact that in each such case each item was something processed or manufactured from agricultural raw material. The difference in this case is that a bullock walks out of a ring sold to the buyer in exactly the same condition as he walked into it.  There is no change in that bullock and no processing has been done on it.  This is a service that is being provided rather than a case of manufacture or processing and the Minister is now asking money for the purpose of controlling for the first time something that is not a matter of production, something that is not a matter of processing or manufacture, but something that is merely a service provided. We might as well legislate to provide cover for somebody selling a farmer's diary between 25th December and 1st January.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> The provisions of section 3 are repugnant to this side of the House because they give the Minister power to give to anyone he likes and to refuse to others the sole right of selling cattle in any part of this country.  It is repugnant to the Constitution that the Minister should have the right to grant a licence to one person and refuse one to another.  Competition between marts is something that will look after itself because, if one mart goes down, it is because another has come up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Money Resolution, money is being provided for the purposes of the Bill. The money must be provided directly for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the money will be used for the provision of inspectors to carry out the provisions contained in the Bill.  I do not wish to widen the debate but under the Bill power is being taken by the Minister to decide who shall sell cattle and who shall not and the voting of money for the provision of inspectors to advise him on this matter is improper and we desire to vote against the provision of that money in the Resolution.  If there are to be offences, somebody must decide and somebody must prosecute.  This will require very considerable staff, certainty at least one senior inspector per county over perhaps 20 counties at the moment and probably over the whole 26 counties very soon when certain areas in the west of Ireland have got their marts.  These people will go there to look for alleged offences and, having discovered these offences, will take the necessary steps to prosecute persons who they feel have transgressed the law under this Bill.  This will involve us in very considerable legal expenses which are being provided for under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very repugnant to us and to the Constitution because the punishments for these offences are so disproportionate as only to be described as penal.  The provision of punishment so disproportionate to the normal punishments prescribed in law for other offences against our law and against our people indicates that this Bill is <Col N="1359" /> something that goes far beyond the normal administration of justice and is, in fact, as it has been described, a vicious piece of legislation being bludgeoned and bulldozed through here by a man who believes that it is in the best interests of his political Party to break the farmers rather than to assist them, the horrible part of it being that in the process of finding out whether or not he is right&mdash;and I really believe he is not&mdash;with such a determined man in the position which he holds, very many innocent and decent people are going to be hurt.</P>
    <P>I would refer also to something that was referred to before, that is, the fact that while the holder of a livestock mart may be entitled to a licence under this Bill because he is operating at the moment immediately he applies the inspectors we are going to pay with the money we are now voting will fasten on him and will decide on the various sets of regulations which they will impose and demand from him capital expenditure of an order which may set his work in this regard, be it co-operative society or individual person, at nought because the first requirement of a mart is that it shall be solvent and in a position to pay up to the seller of the cattle.  I have referred to the exemption and I would also refer to the question of regulations.</P>
    <P>We are voting money here so that the inspectors whom we shall pay shall attend livestock marts and decide how an auction shall be carried on. Deputy Dillon was most explicit and most colourful on this.  The inspector shall stand beside the auctioneer and instruct him how to do the work.  I made the point on Second Reading, and I make the point now, in relation to the provision of the inspector and the moneys which we shall pay him by way of salary and travelling expenses, that he is not a person to have there because the position is that every auctioneer must beware of puffers, must beware of people who bid when they have not got money, must accept a bid only when he is prepared to guarantee to the seller of <Col N="1360" /> the cattle the money related to the bid which he accepts.  We are now going to have an inspector who shall say: &ldquo;This five cattle made £55.  There is a bid of £55 10s.  Why are you not taking it?&rdquo; That auctioneer may know that the bid of £55 10s. came from a person not in a position to pay the £55 10s.  Yet, if the inspector insists that he accept the £55 10s., we may very quickly find that the mart may become insolvent because it has to pay up for mistakes made not through the incompetence of the operator or the negligence of the auctioneers and the principals but as a result of the regulations laid down by the Minister and for which inspectors are being provided to see that they are obeyed.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the question of offences.  We are sending these inspectors along and we are now going to send people who transgress to jail for six months.  It is very easy to see why we on this side of the House oppose this Bill step by step at every Stage, including the Money Resolution to provide machinery by which the provisions of the Bill can be carried out, when it is realised that very many offences of far greater gravity do not carry these penalities.  Everything dealt with in a District Court is related to a possible sentence of imprisonment of six months and £50 fine.  Yet we are here talking about a contravention of a mart regulation.  A fellow who gets a few drinks and whacks his cattle in before somebody else or an auctioneer who is guilty of a technical offence is subject to a colossal fine or six months imprisonment. The whole point is that the Bill is disproportionate in its approach, that it is absolutely penal.  Even in regard to the penalties proposed, the Bill is so disproportionate as to be clearly something brought in by somebody who wanted to do a hatchet job. That is a good reason why we do not want to provide the inspectors, the staff of the Department of Agriculture and the other people who will operate this Bill when it becomes an Act.  We are entitled&mdash;and I am glad that you, Sir, have allowed me to make this point within the Rules of Order&mdash;to protest here in every way we can and <Col N="1361" /> I feel that I have done so and remained within the Rules of Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): This is a Money Resolution and, as I understand it, on Second Reading, the principle of the Bill has been accepted by a vote of the House&mdash;not accepted by this side of the House but by a majority vote.  I rise to register my objection to providing this money not on the basis of the Bill as a broad issue but on certain itemised points which I will deal with, some of which have been dealt with already.</P>
      <P>The first one that I should like to mention is in connection with section 7, sub-paragraphs (a) and (b).  The Minister is asking us to provide money by which he will pay an inspectorate to enter, inspect and examine at all reasonable time by day a place where the business of a livestock mart is carried on and then, under paragraph (b), that his inspector may take with him a member of the Garda Síochána if he has reasonable cause to apprehend any serious obstruction in the execution of his duty.</P>
      <P>I object to providing money for that because I think, on general principles, it is an expenditure that is not necessary. I am not aware of any Minister who has occasion to send inspectors into various forms of activity in our society taking unto himself powers that his inspector may call upon a Garda, and provide the Garda with the necessary travelling expenses, to carry out an inspection.  That is a type of expenditure which I am not aware we have ever put upon ourselves before and I object to it on that ground and I object to voting money for something that as far as I know is unprecedented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister can tell me that there are some other Departments where money is provided and where it has been decided to give an inspector of a Department the right to call in a Garda whenever he wants and whenever he thinks he might be obstructed and where the travelling expenses of this Garda are provided, he is entitled to tell me when he is replying but it seems to me objectionable to allow any inspector the right to put upon the State extra expenses of that nature merely <Col N="1362" /> because he apprehends he is going to be obstructed, and to ask the people to pay his travelling expenses to a mart ten or 15 miles out.</P>
    <P>Apart from the objectionable aspects of it, we are being asked to provide money for a totally unnecessary function, for something I am not aware was ever sought before.  I do not know of any corresponding office where analogous powers have been claimed and given.  There is already plenty of machinery available to the Minister to rectify a situation like that, if it did arise.  Here, expenditure is to be incurred because an official of the Department will anticipate an obstruction that may never take place.  In any other Department of State, if an inspector goes in, he has to be obstructed and he has to prove that he was obstructed before the machinery is availed of to correct it.  However large or small the expenditure may be, it is unnecessary and we are entitled in this House to object to it.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) of the same section we are asked to provide money for an inspectorate:</P>
    <P>to make such examination and inquiry as may be necessary to ascertain whether the provisions of this Act and the regulations thereunder and the enactments for the time being in force relating to public health are complied with, so far as respects the place;</P>
    <P>Here we are asked to provide money for the Minister to duplicate the fairly elaborate services in the matter of hygiene and public health which we already enjoy.  Goodness knows, we have enough legislation in regard to public health and in regard to the control of factories, abattoirs and places like that, which would adequately cover our marts.  We already have medical officers of health; we already have veterinary inspectors looking after our slaughterhouses; and every county council has a health authority which has the responsibility of seeing that the hygiene regulations are carried out. Every dispensary doctor is an MOH in his own right.  He is paid an extra amount in his salary for it and he has dispensary nurses at his disposal.  Now <Col N="1363" /> we are being asked to vote money so that an inspector may have power to do something that is already being adequately done.</P>
    <P>I know of no case where there has been a gross breach of the public health or hygiene regulations in the marts in this country.  I do not feel disposed to vote money to provide an extra inspectorate so that the Minister can satisfy his own grandiose notions and build himself up to the position virtually of a dictator over every mart in the country.</P>
    <P>Again I do not feel we should vote money under paragraph (e) which empowers an officer of the Minister's Department:</P>
    <P>to require any person whom he finds in the place and whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be employed in the place to give such information as it is in his power to give as to who is carrying on the business of a livestock mart in the place;</P>
    <P>If we are to vote money to provide an inspector to the Minister to go into every mart and start nosing around and asking anyone he sees: &ldquo;Who is the boss here?&rdquo;, we have come to a very low stage in regard to legislation. Surely there are other means open to the Minister of establishing the ownership of a mart without sending an inspector in and having him ask the doorman or the fellow who sweeps the yard who owns the place?  All he has to do is to ring up the Revenue authorities who will soon tell him who is the owner of a mart in any part of the country.  I do not feel that we as a Party should vote money for that purpose.  It is giving the Minister unnecessary dictatorial powers over a private enterprise.  Whether it is a co-operative mart or a private mart does not matter.  They were established by private enterprise and we certainly do not feel we should vote money to provide the Minister with inspectors to go in and act, as they must act on occasions if this legislation is passed, in a highly provocative manner.</P>
    <P>The members of the Minister's Party, although they are brought in here <Col N="1364" /> under command, must, in the stillness of the night, wonder in their own minds whether they are doing the right thing or not.  Although they will vote otherwise, many members of the Fianna Fáil Party must be perturbed at the implications of these sections in this wretched Bill.</P>
    <P>I think also we should not vote money for a Bill which provides, under section 3 (1) here, again a duplication:</P>
    <P>On the application of or on behalf of a person who proposes to carry on the business of a livestock mart at a specified place in such form and containing such particulars as the Minister may direct, the Minister may, at his discretion, grant or refuse to grant a licence authorising the carrying on of the business of a livestock mart at that place.</P>
    <P>The operative phrase there is &ldquo;at that place&rdquo;.  You can imagine the amount of expense that such an investigation might involve where the location of a mart is in question.  When the Minister was Minister for Local Government, he spent nearly a year and a half piloting a most elaborate Town Planning Bill through this Dáil. We have already gone to pretty considerable expense in drawing up preliminary plans for towns and cities.  We have established planning offices and we have sent people to be trained.  Now we are being asked to set up a somewhat analogous system, provide a new inspectorate to decide whether a mart should go here or there.  We already have all the machinery available to us to do that and now we are being asked to do the same thing in another way the second time.  We should not do it.  It is an abuse of the public purse.  It is even an abuse of the Minister for Finance if he has to come in and listen to the debate hour after hour.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (2) of section 3, the Minister may at the time of the granting of a licence attach to the licence such conditions as he shall think proper and shall specify in the licence.  Again, we are voting money to provide the Minister with an inspectorate which will provide him with <Col N="1365" /> information.  I believe this is totally unjustified expenditure of money.</P>
    <P>In section 6 (2), we find that the Minister takes extraordinary and unprecedented powers for which we are asked to provide the money because this cannot be done on a shoestring. It will mean that the Minister is entitled to send his inspectors to any mart to see how it is being conducted. Whether these individuals would be specially trained inspectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He can prescribe the manner in which such auctions shall be conducted and he provides in his amendment that the conditions of sale shall be exhibited.  He can prescribe requirements as to the size, design, maintenance, repair, cleansing, cleanliness, ventilation, heating and lighting of any buildings in which auctions are held.  He can prescribe requirements as to the accommodation including washing facilities and sanitary conveniences at such places.  There is hardly a single matter here which is not already covered in existing legislation.

All these things are already covered by our hygiene regulations appertaining to every hotel, every butcher's shop, every place of public meeting, schools and churches, everywhere. They may not always be applied with due rigidity.  There are some shortcomings but the mere passing of legislation will not make a dirty house clean and the mere expenditure of public money to provide the inspectorate which the Minister proposes to foist on us will not of necessity make these places any better.

      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): We have every form of auctioneering <Col N="1368" /> system in this country from the simple shop to the auctioning of farms.  We have auctioneers standing on stools in our fairs.  We have them standing at present in our shops.  Are there regulations by which some Minister's representative may go in and stand beside those auctioneers to see how they are conducting their business? Has the Minister for Industry and Commerce taken powers in the case of commercial auctioneers in this city to appoint inspectors to go in and see that certain regulations made by him are adhered to?  I submit that here we have a special body of men picked out for a special form of inspection, which is, in its essence, both vindictive and provocative.  We are asked to provide money for them.  In my opinion, this is quite unnecessary.  In my opinion, it is wrong.  It would be departing from the fundamental principles of democracy if we failed to register our objection to this provision.  Certain facets of this Bill are more appropriate for discussion on the Committee Stage rather than on this Money Resolution. I have endeavoured, within the limits of my ingenuity, to keep within the range of the Ceann Comhairle's wishes and I hope I have succeeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as I see it is that, under this Money Resolution, we are asked to decide two or three important matters.  We are asked to decide that money should be provided by the Oireachtas for the particular purpose of any Bill which might be introduced during this session dealing with the control by the Minister of livestock marts.  I do not know whether this is the normal wording of a Money Resolution: I assume it is. Why the wording should be such as to cover not only this Bill but any other Bill in this connection introduced during the present session I do not know, but, in any event, that is the wording of the Resolution before us. We are asked to decide on the provision of money by the Oireachtas for this purpose without any indication having been given to the House by the Minister, when introducing the Resolution, as to what the bill will be in terms of money.  We have not been told what the cost to the taxpayer will be.  The Minister simply moved the Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not fault him so far as procedure is concerned, because that seems to be the standard practice, but, in this particular case, it was surely known to the Minister and to the Government as a whole that there were strong views in relation to this measure, as to whether <Col N="1370" /> or not it was appropriate, as to whether or not the Dáil and the Seanad should vote moneys in connection with it.  It seems to me that in those circumstances it would not have been out of place for the Minister in moving the Resolution to give the House some idea of the amount of money involved.  If he did not do it in moving the Resolution, it would have been quite within the Rules of Order and procedure for the Minister to intervene at any point in the discussion and make his point of view known and thereby make the kind of information we want available to the House.  Certainly it is open to the Parliamentary Secretary to intervene. I can understand, of course, that the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary might have found considerable difficulty in informing the House as to what the cost of this measure will be.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to various aspects of this measure: I want to refer to section 7.  It has been made quite clear that we are not prepared to agree to the provision of money by the Oireachtas for the purpose set out in paragraph (f) of subsection (1) of section 7, that is, the provision of a Garda escort for an officer of the Minister. Deputy Dillon and others have dealt with that particular point. I want to refer in particular to paragraph (f).  Section 7 provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  An officer of the Minister shall, for the purposes of the execution of this Act, have power to do all or any of the following things, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>... to exercise such other powers as may be necessary for carrying this Act into effect.</P>
    <P>So long as that provision remains, would it be possible for any Deputy, would it be possible for the Minister or for the Government, to hazard even a wild guess as to what the cost of implementing this Bill is likely to be? We are here invited by the Government in paragraph (f) to give the widest possible powers to an officer of the Minister to exercise any powers under the sun which may be regarded as necessary in order to carry this Act into effect.  There is no restriction, no limitation whatsoever, as to the powers <Col N="1371" /> which may be exercised by an officer of the Minister under that particular paragraph.  There is no limitation as to the amount in quantity, in quality or in financial terms of the assistance he may call to his aid for the purpose of implementing this Bill, if it becomes an Act, under that particular paragraph. There is no boundary whatsoever set on the financial provisions which may be entailed so long as that particular paragraph remains a part of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to challenge the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary and any Deputy on the opposite benches as to whether or not they can give any reasonably accurate estimate, an estimate within a half a million or a million pounds, of what the cost of this Bill, if it becomes an Act, may mean so long as we are invited to pass that praticular provision in paragraph (f) which, as I say, is completely unlimited, completely unrestricted, as regards the cost of this Bill and as regards the powers which it will vest in an officer of the Minister if this House decides to pass the Money Resolution and this Bill.  That is one reason why I feel that the House should, in no circumstances, allow this Money Resolution to pass as long as this Bill in its present form is the only Bill dealing with livestock marts.  As I pointed out, the terms of the Resolution are wide enough to cover another Bill if the Minister chooses to bring it in.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Clinton was speaking here earlier this evening in opposition to this Money Resolution, he referred to the power of an officer of the Minister to summon the Garda to his assistance which is contained in section 7 of the Bill.  The Minister drew Deputy Clinton's attention at that time to the fact that it was proposed in the list of amendments which had been circulated to delete that particular provision.</P>
    <P>I want to say this, and I want to say it quite seriously, and I am not suggesting that there was any effort on anybody's part&mdash;I was about to say &ldquo;to deceive&rdquo; or &ldquo;to double-cross&rdquo; the House: I am not suggesting that for a moment.  However, so long as <Col N="1372" /> paragraph (f) remains, it does not matter a hoot, to my mind, whether or not you take out paragraph (b) of section 7 (1). Paragraph (b) is the provision which authorises an officer of the Minister to summon a Garda to his assistance and to take with him a member of the Garda Síochána if he has reasonable cause to apprehend any serious obstruction in the execution of his duty.  Apparently, that particular provision alarmed a number of people, including the National Agricultural Council, and the Minister was advised to delete it and has agreed to delete it, as he himself has pointed out, in the amendment which has been circulated. It does not matter a hoot whether or not he deletes it unless he also deletes paragraph (f).</P>
    <P>So long as paragraph (f) remains, that is wide enough to bring back into operation in the implementation of this Bill everything that is in paragraph (b) of that section.  So long as paragraph (f) remains, I do not see how anyone in this House can hazard a guess as to what we are involving ourselves in in pounds, shillings and pence if we allow this Money Resolution to pass and subsequently allow this Bill to become an Act.</P>
    <P>In this Money Resolution, the Dáil is asked to acquiesce that it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as may be necessary in connection with this or any other Livestock Marts Bill. I want to make this point, and to put it as clearly as I can without endeavouring to debate the principle or the principles, because I think there are possibly more than one, involved in this Bill.  I accept the position that, once this Bill has passed its Second Reading in this House, the House is taken as having approved the principle involved in the Bill.  That is so, even though the Bill is passed only as a result of a majority division here in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Esmonde points out, it was a particularly small majority, but, big or small, <Col N="1373" /> having passed its Second Reading, this House is taken as having approved the principle of the Bill.  I do not want, now, to endeavour to discuss the principle of the Bill but I want to suggest that we are not committed, by reason of having given this Bill a Second Reading, to having agreed that the timing of the Bill is right or that it is appropriate that this Bill should proceed to any further Stages at this time.  So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to state and to assert and to argue to the best of my ability that it is not expedient at this time that we should provide moneys from the Oireachtas to implement the provisions of this Bill.  I do not think it expedient to do that at this time because of the various provisions contained in the Bill, but, before I come to the provisions in the Bill, I want to state that I do not regard it in any way as expedient that this House should authorise the provision of moneys for this or indeed for any other Livestock Marts Bill at the present time, in the present situation, in the present circumstances which exist as between a major section of the agricultural community, on the one hand, and the Government, on the other.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything in relation to this Resolution which will in any way exacerbate the situation which exists or continue the cleavage and the division that is there at the moment or in any way accentuate the feelings that have been aroused as between the NFA and the Government. Surely, however, I am entitled to say that, at a time when, to the knowledge of Deputies and the public at large, strong feelings have been aroused and strong views are being expressed and a strong stand has been taken, whether right or wrong, by the Government, this is not the time to ask this House to pay out money to implement a Bill of this sort?  Surely it is not expedient in point of time to ask the House to provide moneys to implement a Bill of this sort at this time?  Before I am convinced by the Minister or anyone else that it would be expedient to authorise moneys for the purposes of this Bill at this time, I should certainly want a great deal more information than we have so far been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> I object to this Money Resolution on the ground that we do not know what it will cost the taxpayers; that, because of the provisions of the Bill as they stand, it is not open even to the Minister or the Government to hazard a guess as to the cost of its provisions. I object to the Money Resolution because I do not think it is expedient at this time to provide these moneys; I object to this Money Resolution because I do not think this House has enough information as to how this Bill is likely to operate if it is passed in its present form.  I do not think we have enough information because the Minister is not yet in a position to give the House any adequate information with regard to the precise regulations he proposes to make under the Bill, if it becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>When we are asked to vote moneys to implement a Bill which depends as much on Ministerial regulations as this Bill does, it is absolutely necessary that the House should be given the fullest information it can be given with regard to the number and type of the regulations.  I am not faulting the Minister for not being in a position to give that information now, except to this extent, that, if he did not endeavour to rush the Bill and get it through the House before the recess, he would be in a position, when we come back after the summer recess, with a few months of quiet in which to clarify his mind, to tell the House the particular types of regulations he proposes to make.  He is not in a position to do that, now, and, as the Bill depends so very much on Ministerial regulations, until such time as he is in a position to give that information, it is not expedient that this House should authorise the moneys.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the fact that the Bill depends very largely on Ministerial regulations.  It is a Bill which also depends for its implementation on Ministerial discretion.  The Minister may be in a position&mdash;presumably he will be&mdash;to give the House an indication as to how his discretion will be used.  Objection was taken, and I do not want even accidentally to allow myself to become involved in a discussion of the principles contained in the <Col N="1375" /> Bill, but there was considerable discussion and objection with regard to section 3 and to the fact that under section 3 the Minister is to have, if the Bill becomes an Act, practically unrestricted discretion as far as new marts are concerned as to whether or not he will grant a licence.</P>
    <P>The particular section goes on to give the Minister power to attach conditions to licences which he may issue and, both in relation to new marts and the licences for existing marts, it also contains power in the Minister to amend or revoke conditions attaching to any licences he may issue.  Until the Minister is in a position to give the House precise and detailed information of the type or types of conditions that might be attached to licences, or the circumstances in which he would feel it proper to amend or revoke conditions attached to licences, I would not regard it as expedient that we should authorise money for the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to section 6 of the Bill which is the section dealing with regulations in relation to the marts.  This is the section of the Bill which sets out that the Minister may:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of ensuring the proper conduct of places where the business of a livestock mart is carried on and the proper conduct of such businesses, adequate and suitable hygienic and veterinary standards in relation to such places and auctions of livestock at such places and the provision of adequate and suitable accommodation and facilities for such auctions and for persons and livestock at such auctions, make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to such places and such businesses.</P>
    <P>It goes on to specify without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of section 6 particular matters on which the Minister may make regulations.  I do not intend to deal with these in detail.  In relation to the kernel of the livestock mart, the nerve-centre of the business, the conduct of the mart itself, we are asked, in the situation which I <Col N="1376" /> have described, in the midst of the difficulties which have existed in the agricultural community, to deem it expedient to provide moneys to enable the Minister to operate the Act and make the regulations.</P>
    <P>I do not regard it as expedient that this House should do so until the Minister can spell out to the House the type of regulation he proposes to make under section 6.  When I hear the type of regulation spelled out and when I can give a judgment on it, I am doubtful if, even then, I will regard it as expedient to authorise these money but, without that knowledge it is not, in my judgment, expedient that we should do so.</P>
    <P>One of the matters dealt with in the Bill is the right of an officer of the Minister to seek the assistance of the Garda Síochána and a parallel but more far-reaching and widespread power contained in paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) of section 7:</P>
    <P>to exercise such other powers as may be necessary for carrying this Act into effect.</P>
    <P>In relation to those powers, am I right in thinking&mdash;would the Minister give this information to the House? &mdash;that if this House agrees to this Money Resolution we are automatically endorsing the provisions of section 7 and giving our approval to the expenditure of moneys provided by this House in connection with the expenses to be incurred under section 7 as drafted?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has made a case that certain amendments are in the pipeline and that we should look at this Money Resolution in the knowledge that these amendments are there for our consideration.  That is a point of view, but, as I have already made clear, under the terms of this Resolution as it stands we are asked to provide money for any Bill the Minister may introduce in relation to this topic. I am not satisfied that the House should do that.  I am not satisfied to vote any moneys at all.  I feel particularly strongly that at the present time, in present circumstances, in the situation now existing, it is not expedient to vote these moneys and that the right thing for the Minister to do, if he wants to <Col N="1377" /> amend this Bill, would be to withdraw it entirely and come back with fresh proposals in the autumn.</P>
    <P>In any event, surely it would be reasonable for the Minister, even if he is determined to pursue this Bill as it stands in the House, to let us have a breathing-space to consider these amendments properly and to consider in what other ways the Bill needs to be amended?  The Minister would be doing well by this House and by the agricultural community if he agreed to withdraw this Money Resolution and defer further consideration of it and of this Bill for some months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Resolution we are discussing at present asks the House to authorise the expenditure of an unnamed sum of money to implement the Livestock Marts Bill, 1967, or any other Bill that may be introduced in this session under the same title.  When an individual is faced with a demand to spend money, the first questions he asks himself is: &ldquo;Can I afford to make this payment?&rdquo; and secondly: &ldquo;Is the expenditure necessary?&rdquo; I venture to suggest that that is a reasonable test for us, as custodians of the public purse, to apply to any request for the expenditure of money which comes before us.</P>
      <P>In the first place, I ask myself: can the Exchequer at the present time bear the expenditure which this Resolution seeks to impose on it?  I can only try to estimate the financial condition of the country and of the Exchequer at the present time by the various yardsticks available to me.  According to the measurements which I make with those yardsticks, the country is not in an affluent financial condition at present.  I think I am correct in saying that no provision was made in the Budget for the expenditure we are now asked to authorise.  In fact, I would say the Bill was not thought of at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, without going into any of these things in detail, one knows how difficult it is to get a housing grant paid at present.  One knows the long delays of several months that applicants for housing grants have to experience.  One <Col N="1378" /> also knows that only within the past few weeks it was announced that road grants were cut by 26 per cent, or something in the neighbourhood of £1 million.  That suggests to me that we are not well off.  It suggests to me that we should not spend any money or commit ourselves to any expenditure which we can avoid.  If the Minister could tell us how much money is involved in this Resolution, we might be in a better position to give a considered opinion on it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell the House where the money he is asking us to vote is to come from.  It has not been provided in the Budget.  Will it mean there will be longer delays in payment of housing grants and Land Project grants?  Will it mean it will take longer for farmers to get compensation for reactor cows under the Bovine TB Eradication Scheme?  Will it mean we will have a further reduction or revision of the amount of the road grant for each county?  Thoses are pertinent questions, questions which any set of legislators faced with a demand of this sort should ask themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister for Finance or any member of the Government seriously thinks, or has made the case recently, that we have money to waste or that we have more money in the Exchequer than we need to meet normal commitments.  Unless we have, we should not be spending money or authorising the expenditure of money on the Bill we are now discussing.  So much for the state of the Exchequer and state of the national purse, as far as we can judge it.  As I said before the Dáil went into recess for a short time, if a reduction of the Road Fund grants by 25 per cent this year as compared with last year is an indication of the financial position of the Government and of the Exchequer then I venture to suggest we are in a bad state and that every penny that can be saved should be saved and that there should be no waste and no extravagance.</P>
    <P>Is this expenditure necessary?  That is the next thing any prudent legislator should ask himself.  I am forced to say it is not necessary.  Livestock marts are a comparative innovation in this <Col N="1379" /> country.  For years and years, longer than anybody in this House can remember, we have had the traditional type of fair, the traditional buying and selling in public places, and the Government did nothing about it.  The Government did not regard the holding of fairs on the streets as injurious to public health or as unhygienic.  There was, indeed, a certain school of thought which complained bitterly about the marketing system which was available to the agricultural community but there was one person who did nothing to improve the marketing system either inside or outside the country, the Minister for Agriculture.  He and his predecessors were prepared to let things jog along as they had jogged along for centuries, to let the system of buying and selling that had been in operation over the years continue.  The farmers decided to establish the marts system and immediately the Government, through its Minister for Agriculture, rush in at the first opportunity, without waiting to see how these marts operated, with this Bill, to impose the most stringent and, in some cases, the most objectionable conditions and regulations regarding these livestock marts.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins stressed the fact that it is most inexpedient at present that this money should be voted or that this measure should be passed.  I could not agree more and the vast majority of the people are of the same opinion.  The Minister conceived this measure in a fit of bad temper.  He conceived it when he and operators of these marts, or some of them, were on very bad terms, and that is putting it at its mildest.  Now the Minister seeks to steamroll this Bill through the House in the shortest possible time so that he may be provided with the machinery to chastise certain people with whom he recently fell out.  It is as simple as that.  There should be a cooling-off period.  The Minister should be allowed to take a holiday.  He should be allowed to relax and to forget about the unfortunate incidents that have taken place over the past six to 12 months before he arms himself with a dangerous weapon such as this to wreak <Col N="1380" /> vengeance on the people with whom he is as yet on extremely bad terms.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable proposition.  If this House does nothing more than ensure that the Minister has two or three months to think the matter over, to reconsider the position, before it gives him the big stick which he is now seeking, it will have done a good job. This measure is totally unnecessary at present.  Even on the Minister's case it is unnecessary.  It is an intrusion on the rights of private operators and cannot be justified.  Even on the Minister's case when he saw fit to quote an occasional isolated abuse, as he described it, the measures contained in this Bill cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of dealing with the Bill item by item, or of making more than a passing reference to any section.  Section 2 prohibits the operation of a livestock mart for the sale of cattle, sheep and pigs without a licence. I have already stated that this system of selling in public was operating long before any of us were born.  I do not think there were any abuses; if there were abuses they righted themselves. Section 3, which has been dealt with at length by Deputy Dillon and other speakers, gives the Minister a completely blank cheque and authorises him to impose conditions or to revoke or amend conditions.  In other words, it empowers him to do exactly as he likes with these people who are engaged in a legitimate business.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister: why does he pick out the people who are operating livestock marts, apart from all the other people who are engaged in buying and selling?  A lot of them, some of whom I know myself, have gone into this on a non-profit-making basis in order to provide a service for the locality in which they reside.  Why, I ask, does the Minister want to get a grip on the throats of these people, as distinct from so many others who are engaged in trade and commerce?  Section 4 gives the Minister power to exempt particular marts from all the conditions of the Bill, to exempt particular individuals from any or all sections of the Bill.  How can that be justified? What has the Minister in mind? We are rapidly approaching a state <Col N="1381" /> of affairs when a Minister will come into this House with a Bill which is so vague that it will give him a blank cheque to do what he wants without giving real information to the House.</P>
    <P>We will reach a stage, if this goes on, when the Minister for Agriculture will come in here with a Bill authorising him to take such steps and do such things as he thinks expedient for the improvement of agriculture in the country.  That is the stage we are coming to.  That is the sort of Bill we are having introduced into this House, not alone from the Minister's Department but from every Department. That is the trend.  I feel, and have felt for some considerable time, that it is a dangerous trend.  It takes, perhaps, a good many years for a trend like that to become really harmful but, while 20 years is a long time in the life of an individual, it is a very short time in the life of a nation or the life of a country.  If that trend continues, I venture to suggest that the people will lose control of the Departments of State which they have through their elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I said that the Minister introduced this measure, or announced his intention of introducing it, committed himself to introducing it, in a fit of bad temper and he wrote section 7 into it in that frame of mind, the section which authorises the introduction of the Garda, if necessary.  Who is to decide whether that is necessary or not?  We know that we had extreme cases in the not too distant past when the Minister or one of his colleagues used a sledgehammer to kill a fly, when they called out the Army under the pretence that it was necessary and when everybody knew that it was unnecessary and that it should not have been done.  That is what section 7 has written into it.  It may be that there are amendments before this House, if we had time to consider them, which water down section 7. The very introduction of those amendments by the Minister is the best possible evidence to me that now is not the time to entrust this measure to the Minister because already he has been <Col N="1382" /> convinced, apparently from outside this House, that he went a bit too far, that his proposals were too drastic, that the sections in the Bill are not necessary and, if he gets another few months to cool off and think over the matter, I believe that he will be convinced that there are a lot of other sections in this Bill that are too big and too strong and too heavy and quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>It is only a very short time since the Bill was circulated.  Permission to print it was given on 31st May.  I do not know when it was printed and I cannot be accurate as to the day on which we received it but I venture to suggest that it is a short time ago. Already, as I say, the Minister comes in with several amendments watering it down somewhat.  Is that not evidence that he went too far?  Is it not evidence that he conceived the Bill in haste?  Is it not evidence that he framed it and introduced it in bad temper?  I understand that the concessions made do not go very far but is the more important aspect of it not that the Minister is grasping out for the remainder of the Bill: for section 2 which will enable him to grant licences; for section 3, which will enable him to attach conditions to those licences and amend or revoke them; for section 4 which will empower him to exempt marts from licences and for the gloriously vague but very dangerous section 6 under which he can make regulations to his heart's content; for section 7 which will enable him to go back to the days of the Department of Supplies during the war and require the keeping of records, authorising his inspectors to inspect those records, and all the rest of it? He is grasping out now for those sections and, if he gets them in his present frame of mind, he will use them against the people he thinks it was necessary to introduce this Bill to deal with.</P>
    <P>The Minister's judgment on the whole sorry episode between the Department and organised farmers in this country has not been sound and I think that is a reason, and an excellent reason, why we in this House should refuse to give it to him, even at the end of a session when we would prefer, I suppose, to get home.  That is <Col N="1383" /> an excellent reason why we should not allow this Bill to be steamrolled through this House without full consideration and without the certain knowledge that it will have been properly considered, that its provisions will have been properly ventilated and that public opinion will have had an opportunity of making itself felt on it before we pass it.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend to this House that it refuse to authorise this expenditure because the amount of the expenditure is unknowable&mdash;it has not been provided for in this year's Budget and the Exchequer, as far as we can see, is in a very poor financial position and cannot afford this&mdash;and also on the ground that the purpose for which the money is being spent is not a necessary purpose, that it is a waste of money, an extravagance in which we are being asked to indulge in order to allow the Minister to vindicate himself and to get his own back on the people with whom he has fallen out. I do not think the House should lend itself to this sort of measure at this particular time.</P>

      <P>I am in full agreement with my colleagues who have spoken this evening that we should not vote the financial provision for this Bill.  I consider that this is the most hasty and ill-conceived piece of legislation that has been introduced in the 16 years I have been in the House.  It is a Bill that nobody wants, brought in by the Minister for reasons best known to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, personally, am opposed to giving the money on three grounds.  First of all, I conceive that this Bill is taking more control from the public representatives and giving it to bureaucrats. In effect, what we are asked to do here is to vote money so that an unknown civil servant can go into a farmers' co-operative and dictate terms to them.  Right through this Bill, there are dangerous provisions and every one of them will cost money, not a small amount of money but a considerable amount of money.  Deputies on the other side of the House, who have been extremely silent during this financial debate this evening, should stop to consider, <Col N="1384" /> when they go into the Lobby, as assuredly they will go into the Lobby, because, make no mistake, we intend to bring them there and we intend to fight this piece of financial legislation to the last ditch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am frightening the Minister.  When they go in to vote, they can be conscious of the fact that they are voting money for a useless price of legislation and, not only that, an interfering piece of legislation, interfering with the rights of the farmers to whom perhaps this country owes more than to any other section of the community.  The farmers were the people who established the right to a free Parliament here.  The co-operative effort was brought about entirely by them and it takes a Fianna Fáil Government to come to this House to ask us to vote money to impose restrictions on the farmers.</P>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I should like to read one short subsection in this Bill and it is only one which proves the restrictions that are being placed on a free community.  Section 6 (2) says the regulations may:</P>
      <P>(a) prescribe the manner in which entries for auctions of livestock at such places shall be received,</P>
      <P>What does that mean?  We are being asked to vote money to the Minister&mdash; and if the Minister himself were deciding this, although I do not agree with a lot of what he does, I would not object so much&mdash;so that a civil servant employed behind closed doors in the Department of Agriculture may go into a mart and say to a small farmer who has brought his cattle maybe 20 miles to a mart: &ldquo;You may not sell them here today.&rdquo; I defy the Minister when he answers us here to say that is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, perhaps, is not alone in what he is doing, bringing in legislation here which is taking rights away from the public and handing over control to bureaucracy.  I ask the Minister to deny that when he is replying.  What else does this Bill mean?  Does it not mean&mdash;and perhaps I take a kindlier view than some of the other people who have spoken before me&mdash;that he is being walked into this Bill by officials who say: &ldquo;It is necessary, Minister. We must have control over the marts.&rdquo;? A sum of £80 million a year is the turnover in these marts operated by private enterprise which is following the traditions of the great co-operative movement founded by Sir Horace Plunkett, the founder of the very Department whose officials will go in and control the efforts of this private enterprise.  This in itself is sufficient reason to vote against the money Resolution for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very significant fact that since this Bill came in there has been more opposition to it.  I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary has arrived because I was going to congratulate him on being the one man who made a speech here when we were discussing this Bill previously.  He gave his reasons for the introduction of the Bill.  Apparently somebody lost a job in Waterford and the Parliamentary Secretary came in and joined the death or glory struggle along with the <Col N="1386" /> Minister for Agriculture to impose this Bill on the Irish people.  As I say, I congratulate him and I hope that when I sit down he will give his reasons why we should spend the money and tell us where we are going to get the money.  Deputies on this side of the House are accused of trying to delay the Business of the House.  It is our democratic right and our function to see that money is properly spent. There is nothing in the Book of Estimates, nothing in the Estimate for Agriculture or in the Estimate for Finance, which covers this Marts Bill. This is some late notion on somebody's part.  Perhaps, as I say in the kindness of my heart&mdash;Fianna Fáil Deputies know I am a kindly fellow&mdash;it is not the Minister for Agriculture who is really at the back of it but that he may have been walked into it by his officials, but it is another nail in the coffin of democracy in this country.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why we should vote against this Money Resolution. There is no earthly reason for this Bill.  The State is already contributing the necessary finance for health purposes and for veterinary purposes. The Department of Justice pays a sum annually for the Garda who maintain law.  We are told, by way of innuendo from Deputies over there, not only in speeches in this House but in other places, that the farmers are obstructing the free will of the Irish people, obstructing the sale of cattle, and that is the reason we are asked to vote money tonight.</P>
    <P>The next thing we shall be asked to do is to vote money to protect small farmers against big farmers.  Fianna Fáil have a story for everything.  Everything they do is supposed to be for the small man.  As I say, I am a very nice man and I do not like to express what is uppermost in my mind, and what other Deputies have been saying, that probably there is a little bit of spleen involved in this; when they do not succeed one way there is always the feeling that they should use the full force of the State to secure what they want.  The Minister for Agriculture is here tonight looking for finances so as to put into effect the policy he wishes to impose on the farmers.  I wonder <Col N="1387" /> what Sir Horace Plunkett, a man who did so much for the co-operative movement and for the small farmers, would think of this if he were here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a man who actually founded the Department of Agriculture and felt so strongly about the co-operative movement that he resigned the control he had held for seven years in the Department rather than see the co-operative movement he had founded suffer.  The co-operative movement survived but in 1967 a Fianna Fáil Government comes here with a direct attempt to take control of a great private enterprise with a turnover of over £80 million a year.  There is heavy investment in it; probably Fianna Fáil Deputies have money invested in it.  I hope they do not lose it. I do not wish them any harm.  There are bank funds invested in it.  Anybody who has money invested in a co-operative society has his security for the future upset when he finds that it is being put under the control of somebody unknown and unnamed in the Department of Agriculture.  That is what we are asked to vote money for tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised when the Minister for Finance came in to occupy the seat of the Minister for Agriculture.  I was surprised that he should be opposed to our efforts to try to prevent money being spent foolishly.  Surely all the signs and portents indicate that this country has no money to spare and that we should be trying to save money?  I can see no good purpose whatever in this, nor can I see where the money will come from.  That is the key to the situation.  It is not in the Book of Estimates, not in the Estimate for Agriculture or the Estimate for Finance.  This Bill will cost money. Perhaps it will cost very little but we have not been told.  That is the difficulty with Fianna Fáil.  They are not really democratic.  They do not open their mind and heart to the Irish people.  If they did, we should not be sitting here for so long but would <Col N="1388" /> probably be at home now looking after our constituents and perhaps thanking people for having given us such a good vote in the local elections. Instead, we must be here asserting our rights in a democratic Parliament just because Fianna Fáil will not take the nation into their confidence.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will bear with me if I ask the Minister one or two simple questions concerning where he is to get the money.  They are very simple, only two-markers, and I am sure the Minister, with his usual courtesy, will answer them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the Chair, I shall not ask the question this time but I shall go on to other matters.  I had hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister would tell us.  He is my only hope in the Fianna Fáil Party.  In the previous debate on this matter, everybody in Fianna Fáil was silent, apart from him. If I thought he wished to speak, I would give him five minutes before I sit down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing in this Bill for which I could never consent to vote money is contained in section 6 (2) (b) which provides that entries for auctions of livestock shall not be refused except in circumstances prescribed by the regulations.  I do not know what that <Col N="1390" /> means and I do not think the Minister or anybody else knows.  This is the most contradictory Bill I have ever read.  We are asked to vote money for it.  If you are asked to vote money for a contradictory measure, even the simplest Deputy will see that it is a waste of money.  For that reason I feel that to ask the House to vote this money is an insult to our intelligence.</P>
    <P>When replying to this very interesting debate, could the Minister give us any real reason why this Bill has become a death or glory struggle?  Why must we pass this Bill almost overnight? Is it because the Department is going on holidays or is it because the Minister feels that his <i>amour propre</i> would be destroyed in some way if he did not get the Bill overnight? We have been presented with amendments which I am told are an improvement on the general situation. I have not had time to study them yet, nor has anybody else.</P>
