      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, line 21, to delete &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2) &rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to subsections (2) and (3)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we could take amendments Nos. 1 and 4 together.  The amendments meet the purpose of Deputy <Col N="1442" /> Dunne's amendment No. 5, the idea being that where two or more prohibition orders exist, we go back to the earlier one in regard to the limitation period.  It has happened in some cases over the years that a second prohibition order has been made in regard to what has basically been the same book.  What Deputy Dunne has in mind in amendment No. 5, and what I propose to make certain in amendments Nos. 1 and 4, is that the limitation period should operate from the earlier year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was prompted to put down this amendment by reason of the fact that it is conceivable that a book might be banned from the date of its appearance as a paperback as well as from the date of its previous appearance as a hard-covered book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often, the difference in time between the appearance of a book initially as a hard-covered book and subsequently as a paperback could be a number of years&mdash;usually, two, possibly more years.  It would not seem equitable that the author should be penalised, as it were, doubly, as has been the case by having the date made applicable from the most recent binding.</P>
      <P>Another reason why I put down the amendment&mdash;it is also the case the Minister mentioned &mdash; concerns subsequent alterations in books which require their re-publication more or less, as it were, as new books entirely: the corrections and alterations mean publication as a new edition.  It is undesirable and I think unfair that the operative date should be the later one in instances of that kind.  The Minister is doing the right thing in amending the Bill in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question.  I think that what the Minister is doing here is the right thing.  I am wondering, however, what the position is where there is a new edition containing new material which might possibly be regarded as objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is new material, it would be a new book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure of that.  Under the terms of the Minister's amendment, even if the title is changed, the prohibition is being lifted at the earlier date.  This will be automatic in future.  It is simply a question of coming up to the particular time prescribed and then the prohibition it automatically lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, I think that what the Minister is doing here is the right thing, namely, that where there are two prohibition orders the earlier date will be the operative one.  Probably what I have in mind will not arise because, generally speaking, I think, in relation to prohibition orders, it would be the reverse.  Matter would possibly be deleted to get through the censorship code.  I am just wondering, if the other situation does exist&mdash;if there is a second or third edition which is also the subject of a prohibition order&mdash;in which a book is subject to a prohibition order by reason of the addition of objectionable material.  I should just like the Minister to consider that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne stated that oftentimes a book comes out in a paperback edition.  Would it not be possible that a book in a paperback edition, considerably abridged, if necessary, would have new material added to it with a view to reaching a wider section of the public than the original hard-covered book which is more pricey?  If the order applies only to the first edition which was hard-backed, and the second book does not appear for a period of five, six or seven years after that, is it possible, then, that the whole purpose of this prohibition order will be invalidated because very few people, except people like Deputy Dunne, would buy a hard-backed edition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point by Deputy O'Higgins and the Parliamentary Secretary is met by the fact that the Board can re-ban.  Normally, you have deletions in the paperback.  If there is an accentuation of obscenity in the paperback, this can be met by the Board re-banning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we go ahead with this amendment, I should like to say that I do not propose to move my amendment No. 3 on the basis that the Minister is now reducing the proposed period of 20 years to 12 years. I should like to thank the Minister for meeting me in part at least.  What motivated me in suggesting ten years is that basically section 3 is a review section.  As Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, the Board can now review a prohibition if this 12-year period is accepted.  The point I tried to bring out was that the 20-year period was too harsh, too long and unfair to the author and the publisher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has accepted my suggestion in this amendment to reduce the period from 20 to 12 years because he indicated in his introductory speech that he was not adopting a rigid attitude so far as the period of 20 years was concerned.  It is only right that when any effort at liberalisation of censorship is being made and the principle of change accepted, that a reasonable number of years, a number of years which would have application to reality should be determined on.  It is obvious that the banning of a book for 20 years in the times in which we live&mdash;and we nearly always relate every argument nowadays to the time in which we live, but in this instance it is relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am doing my best to be relevant, despite the persecution which is my lot.  I congratulate the Minister on his attitude in this because I realise that in moving into the sphere of censorship, it is necessary for a politician to take his courage in both hands.

      <P>The Minister deserves commendation for trying to meet the wishes of reasonable people.  I think the reduction of the period from 20 to 12 years represents an effort in that direction.

If the book was indecent 20 years ago, it is still indecent 20 years afterwards.  It is just pandering to so-called liberal thought that this ban should be lifted and I am very sorry to see the Minister give way to the amendments.  This can do no good.</P>

It is well known, particularly on the Continent, that one set of publishers may produce a book bearing on the outside something from the New Testament but inside you find it is a pornographic book.

      <P>I think the Minister has met the views that were expressed in the House fairly in the amendment he has proposed.  The Minister and Deputy Moore, if he was present for the Second Reading, will probably recall that there was a pretty general view that the period of 20 years was too long.  I think everybody who took part in the Second Reading debate recognised that there was some substance in the point of view expressed now by Deputy Moore but that it was rather too facile reasoning to say that because a book was banned under the 1929 or the 1946 Act on the ground that it was indecent or obscene 20 years ago that meant that the book should be condemned as indecent or obscene forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister agreed on Second Reading that the case for lifting a prohibition order after a particular period of time, whether 20, 12 or ten years, was justified by the fact that community standards change and that we are in a situation where community <Col N="1449" /> standards are changing and that, as far as passing judgment on any book is concerned, the judgment should be passed from the point of view of contemporary community standards.  I do not think that the Minister, in introducing, first, the amending Bill&mdash;remember, all that is being done now is to reduce the period of the prohibition order as proposed by the Minister in the Bill&mdash;is pandering, as Deputy Moore says, to what he calls &ldquo;so-called liberal thought&rdquo;.  He is doing something that requires to be done in view of the undoubted fact that community standards have changed and are changing.</P>
    <P>It is quite justifiable for somebody to say that he regrets to see what is going on today and that he would prefer that both individual and community standards should remain as they were, ten, 20 or 50 years ago but, as a Legislature, we must recognise what is happening and, in the introduction of this Bill and now in the introduction of these amendments, the Minister is realising what is happening. It is on that basis, first of all, that there was a justification for putting a given life to prohibition orders and, secondly, that is the justification for reducing the given period originally proposed.</P>

I merely wanted to say to the Deputy that he, particularly, is aware, I am sure, certainly as much as anybody in this House, of the fact that complaint has been made through the decades concerning the content of certain of the great poems in Irish. <i>Cuairt an Mheán Oíche</i> is one.

Very often, if we analyse our own views on certain matters, we have to admit that they are based on bias, to some extent, on prejudice in certain regards and perhaps on resistance to change.  Changes are not always pleasant things: they are very often unpleasant.  Let me say this.  Nobody is more revolted than I am on occasions on reading some of the trash we have to read in those books which have been on the register as banned, not for the same reason as Deputy Moore would have them, for pietistic reasons, but for the lack of uniformity or music in the words used. They strike decadence in my ears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to Deputy Moore on the basis that we are discussing literature.  We are discussing books of known literary merit. We are not discussing the hot type of book and the muck which was clearly what Deputy Moore had in mind.  I would like to remind the Deputy that he used the expression &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;. What is the meaning of that?  I would like Deputy Moore to explain to me what &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; I can define.  It is a man with the principle of all things to all men at a particular time to suit his own particular attitude and frame of mind.  That is a liberal to me.  I would like to remind Deputy Moore that Brendan Behan, O'Casey or indeed Joyce or Hemingway did not write for the sake of being obscene.  Some of those authors are on the register of prohibited publications. That is not to suggest that those are in fact obscene publications.  I would like to remind Deputy Moore that those men did not write some of those publications for the sake of being obscene. Brendan Behan's &ldquo;Borstal Boy&rdquo; deals with a boy who is in a British gaol. The last speaker made a point with which I agree.  We are today discussing changes in the existing law on censorship. We have to take a realistic look <Col N="1453" /> at this whole question.  We are discussing amendment No. 2 at the moment which reduces the period to 12 years.  I have amendment No. 3 down which seeks to reduce the period to ten years.  I am glad, as I said, that the Minister came some way towards meeting my proposed period of ten years.  However, I will have an opportunity of discussing that when it comes up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one comment I should like to make.  I agree with Deputy Andrews almost entirely, except in regard to one point.  I am sure the Deputy did not mean this but it could be interpreted from what he said that all books in which muck occurred were written by people who wanted to write literature.  In fact, that is not so.  There are people who write muck because otherwise they could not sell their books.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided the people who are acting as censors for the time being appreciate the difference we then can easily find common ground.  There is just one thing about this, that is, that if it is literature&mdash; perhaps that is not the correct word&mdash; the attitude goes too far and the stage could be reached at which those writing books for the purpose of setting down good literature might find that they have licence to put in more than is necessary of this type of raw material. As long as that attitude will be looked after, the suggestion in the Minister's amendment, which covers 12 years, is acceptable.  There is, again, the point Deputy M.J. O'Higgins made that they can be re-banned.  That covers the whole thing and we are wasting time on something which is not very important to authors.</P>

Writing can be great without being pornographic and without being indecent.</P>

In America, where there is no censorship, groups and organisations of Catholics and non-Catholics have been established to advise parents and general readers on books that should not be read.  That system has succeeded very well.</P>
      <P>To get back to the point I was trying to make, we should not go too far with the banning of books, but if a book is deliberately obscene and pornographic, and in the opinion of the Censorship Board, was written for the purpose of spreading pornography and obscenity, to which Deputy Tully referred, that book should be banned. Many paperbacks are written for the purpose of finding a ready market among young people, adolescents and the like.  They are not literature: they are sold to corrupt youth and such books should be banned.</P>

      <P>This, of course, is an eternal subject which has exercised many minds over many years&mdash;the minds of St. Paul, Milton, and Deputies &mdash;but, to put the matter into perspective, what we are doing in this Bill and in the amendments is rationalising censorship and making it appear to be and operate as a sensible system.  I would, as I think every Deputy would, defend the principle of a censorship code.  One must have a means of protecting <Col N="1458" /> people against evil literature which can be just as damaging as drugs.  I think everybody in this House would agree we must have a censorship code.</P>
      <P>I think our system, which has evolved over the years under all Governments, is a very good one.  As I said on Second Reading, other countries are beginning to move towards some such system as we have, where you have a consistent system of censorship under a Board which applies a consistent set of criteria in its assessment of publications.  To my mind, the system we have is far superior to that which operates in a number of other countries, where control is operated through the courts and is subject to the varying notions of different police prosecutors and magistrates as to what is and is not obscene.</P>
      <P>That system is not as good as ours; in fact, there is no country in the world that does not operate a system of control on publications of one form or another.  Our system is quite good and the only reason I introduced this Bill was to remove anomalies which I could see quite plainly existed in it, and to rationalise the system so that it would appear to be, and would in fact be, a system of censorship that in 1967, and in the future, would command the respect of all right-thinking people. This is what impelled me to bring in this Bill in the first instance.  There was one very grave anomaly in this system as it operated heretofore, that is, that once a publication was banned, it was banned for ever.  This created a situation in which very many works that have come to be recognised as of fine literary merit remain banned.  Many of the authors affected in this manner were very fine&mdash;Irish authors of international repute, men like Frank O'Connor and Seán Ó Faoláin.  The fact that some of their books were banned has caused our system of censorship to fall into a degree of disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the system a responsible, well respected system which can stand on its own two feet, as a rational attempt by a responsible community to restrict works of <Col N="1459" /> indecency.  This is what censorship means; not a means of restricting forever works of literary merit which, according to certain community standards at a particular period, may not have been regarded as being fit to be read but in the changed circumstances would be generally acceptable.  As Deputy Moore said, one cannot change basic morality, and there is nothing in this Bill to suggest that any book which offends basic morality will, in the future, be admitted, any more than it was in the past.</P>
    <P>The safeguard is, of course, in section 3 which provides that any book on the lapse of a prohibition order can be re-banned for a further period.  This re-banning process can continue indefinitely. But the important thing is that we safeguard from perpetual condemnation literature which may have in fact&mdash;I think it was Deputy M.J. O'Higgins used the phrase first&mdash; offended community standards at a certain period but which, of its nature, should be given the chance of being reviewed again by a censorship board, in the context of the community standards of a different age.</P>
    <P>That is basically the thinking behind the Bill.  I think it is very sensible.  We have a sensible censorship board; I think any works coming before it for review will be looked at in a sensible way.  Works of evil intent will be re-banned; works of literary merit, without evil intent which may have offended community standards in the past will be allowed to be read and, in this way, the system can adjust itself to attitudes.</P>
    <P>The specific purpose of the amendments under discussion concerns the limitation period of the prohibition order.  I suggested 20 years initially but all members who contributed here on Second Reading suggested a shorter period.  Ten years was mentioned by, I think, every speaker as being more appropriate.  I have adopted the period of 12 years.  I feel that is the absolute minimum period we should adopt because it is important that we should not breach the whole idea of censorship and there would be an obvious breach of the principle of censorship <Col N="1460" /> if one allowed too short a limitation period.  One must take it that the particular Censorship Board at the time reflects the community attitudes of the day.  Obviously, community attitudes cannot change overnight.  Therefore, one must select a reasonable period.  I suggested 20 years initially in the Bill. I said I was completely open on the matter.  I was being cautious because one can easily be wrong-footed on a sensitive matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>I have come down on the side of 12 years as being reasonable, having regard to the points of view expressed in the House and the point of view which I expressed that there should be a reasonable period because anything less than a reasonable period would be a breach of the whole principle of censorship.  I feel that 12 years is reasonable and, possibly because I am a lawyer, 12 years appealed to me because it is enshrined in many statutes as a limitation law.  It is the period recognised as giving one squatter's title to property.  It is a limitation period that has been well accepted over the years and for that reason, I feel it would be an appropriate period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>May I speak on the section?  I just want to give my reasons for putting down the period of ten years.  I do not think the public are aware that effectively section 3 of the Bill is a review section by virtue of section 7 of the 1946 Act.  It is very important to remember, and it will allay the worries of people such as my friend and colleague, Deputy Moore, that books sent to the Censorship Board or books sent on appeal to the Appeals Board will be books of known <Col N="1462" /> literary merit.  They will not be indecent; they will not be obscene; and if they are indecent, or if they are obscene, they will get the short knock they deserve.  We are discussing books of known literary merit, not the sala-cious muck that has created great fears in the minds of some of the speakers. This is really a review section under which books brought to the attention of the Censorship Board may be re-banned.</P>
      <P>I made the suggestion on Second Reading that in some instances an appeal should lie from the Appeal Board to the High Court.  I have thought this matter out and having seen the constitution, the personnel of the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board I find that the Censorship Board is headed by an eminent judge of the Circuit Court and the Appeal Board is headed by another eminent judge of the Superior Courts.</P>
      <P>There is a matter I would like to bring to the Minister's attention and I would like him to answer it when replying.  Has an author or a publisher or five Members of the Oireachtas the right to appeal personally to the Appeal Board; in other words, have they the right of oral hearing?  As I read the 1946 Act, it would appear that the method adopted now on an appeal from the Censorship Board to the Appeal Board is that the author or publisher must submit a written memorandum of the reasons why he thinks his publication should not be banned.  If that is the situation, I feel it contravenes the principles of natural justice. This is I believe an important point so I would ask the Minister to reply to this question.  I would also ask the Seanad possibly to take judicial note of my words on this matter and they might put an amendment in to give the author or the publisher or five Members of the Oireachtas the right to be heard orally before the Appeal Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that aspect, Deputy Andrews raises a point which carries some weight but I think the situation is met to the extent that under the law at the moment the Censorship Board or the Appeal Board can call in the author or publisher or <Col N="1463" /> five Members of the Oireachtas in the case of the Appeal Board to discuss or explain to the Board or the Appeal Board what is involved or what matters require to be clarified.  This discretion at the moment under the censorship code goes, I feel, a long way to meet the point of view expressed by the Deputy.  I do agree with him that it is not written into the law that the author or publisher or five Members of the Oireachtas have the right to be heard.  It is a discretionary matter which resides with the Board and the appeal authority.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is open to the Board and the appeal authority to invite or have the people mentioned by the Deputy who are concerned with a particular publication before the Board or the Appeal Board to discuss the matter.  This discretion does reside in the board or the authority.  The right to demand is not there on the part of the author or the publisher or the Members of the Oireachtas.  It is a matter that could be considered and I will look at it between now and the Seanad discussion on the Bill.  These people can be called in under the law at the moment and the Censorship Board or the appeal authority have discretion to do this if they wish.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the following substituted &lsquo;which is the work of an Irish national not more than once every year and in the case of any other work not more than once every three years&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>This section removes the time-limit of 12 months for the taking of an appeal against a prohibition order made in respect of a book on either of the two statutory grounds referred to in paragraph 2 above. One appeal only can be taken in respect of any such prohibition order and that provision is not being changed.</P>
    <P>I think it unreasonable that this should be so restricted as to permit one appeal only.  The period of 12 years upon which we have agreed is a very considerable one, and I think that to limit the right of an author or another party to appeal against a prohibition to one opportunity within 12 years, is hardly a fair dispensation.  I suggest, therefore, in my amendment that Irish authors should have the right to appeal against a prohibition every year within each 12 month period because it seems to me that there is a case for showing in our legislation that we are conscious in our obligation to provide some preference for our own nationals while, at the same time, not discriminating unduly against people from outside countries.</P>
    <P>It is quite conceivable that a book written by an Irish author might be banned this year and be thought quite fit for de-banning next year or in two years' time.  Under the law as we are now formulating it, such a person would have a right of appeal against the ban only once in a period of 12 years.  I am really seeking for an Irish author the right to re-activate his appeal every year.  I suggest it can be described in that novel fashion.</P>
    <P>In so far as non-Irish authors or outside authors are concerned, I suggest they should have the same right of appeal after a period of three years.  I think this is a reasonable proposal and I should like to have the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the receiving end but about the actual publication itself.  I do not think it is practicable to draw a distinction between Irish and foreign authors in respect of publications.  Furthermore, I would be against the amendment on the basis that it would drive a coach and four through our censorship code. As I said before, I would defend absolutely the idea of censorship.  One must have a fairly consistent system, a system which appears to make sense in the context of any particular age or period of time.  If we introduced the idea of reviewing decisions which are applicable to a particular period of time every year or every three years as suggested by Deputy Dunne, we would drive a coach and four through the whole principle.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is practicable.  We have gone a long way to meet the point of view expressed by Deputy Dunne in reducing the limitation from 20 years to 12 years. That is as far as one can go.  So far as I am concerned, that is the full stop. Having assessed public opinion on this matter, and having assessed the views expressed in the House, we have come down firmly on the side of 12 years, and no more, in regard to a concession in that direction.  I think that is a reasonable period.  If one were to do what Deputy Dunne suggests, one would drive a coach and four through the whole principle of censorship, and these matters would be coming up for review constantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> It does not even make practical sense.  We have had the same appeal board for a fair length of time.  The present Chairmen of the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board have held office for many years.  It is not practical to propose a system of appeal or review which would involve going back to the same person within 12 months or three years.  Twelve years is a reasonable period.  Community standards may change imperceptibly over 12 years, but anything less would make nonsense of the whole idea of censorship. We must make a stand somewhere.  We have gone a fair way towards meeting the views expressed in reducing the limitation period from 20 years to 12 years, and thus far shall I go.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> On Second Reading, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins on behalf of this Party, intimated that there was a case to be made for the suggestion now put forward by Deputy Dunne in this amendment but at that time the life of the ban was 20 years.  It is now reduced to 12 years and we do not think the same case can be made for giving a right of appeal every 12 months to an Irish author, or once every three years to a foreign author.  Another thing which strikes me about the proposal to distinguish between Irish authors and foreign authors&mdash;European, shall we say&mdash;is that in this day and age we hear so much talk about entering the EEC and this will run against the Treaty of Rome, if and when we become subject to that Treaty.  I should like to say that Deputy O'Higgins's view on the necessity for this amendment has changed since Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing we can be sure of is that, if we get into the Common Market, we shall be worrying more about the Treaty of Rome than about the Censorship Act.  There is a lot to be said for Deputy Dunne's amendment, because, with all respect to the Censorship Board, there is a tendency for the Board to deal with what the courts might refer to as old offenders: if somebody writes a book that book is banned, the Board watch out for the next book by that author <Col N="1467" /> and give it the heavy hand.  The fact that this has happened on more than one occasion is sufficient reason to have another look at the Board within 12 months or two years.  I believe the Censorship Board are tougher on Irish authors than outside writers.  Maybe they are right in doing that but that is not my opinion.</P>
      <P>Twelve years is too long.  Three years seems to be a reasonable time because though the Minister says the Chairman of the Board and the Board members will be there for a long time, the tendency in the Department of Justice has been not to appoint young people to the Board and some of the members do not survive for 12 years.  It might therefore be a good idea to accept the principle of the amendment and to change the Board more often.  If some of the personnel were changed more often, there might be a different approach to this question.</P>
      <P>I am not now making a case for the free entry of pornographic books. Enough of them are getting in, banned or unbanned, but there should be some way whereby the borderline case gets reviewed.  With the change which has taken place in the modern world in many fields, I am sure a number of books which have been banned during the past ten or 12 years, particularly some Irish ones, may be perfectly respectable reading within the next ten or 12 years in certain circumstances. Therefore, there is nothing out of the way in the suggestion made by Deputy Dunne.  He and I are talking about books which were not written in a pornographic way simply for the purpose of being sold as pornographic literature.  We are talking about literary works which happen to transgress.  We know of books which have been banned just because they happened to have a few &ldquo;damns&rdquo; here and there. Books do not get banned for as little as that nowadays.</P>

      <P>With all respect to Deputy Dunne, I do not think we can subscribe to the aim of his amendment because I think it would be bad and wrong to try to define on the floor of this House standards of conduct or morality in one area or another as between writers of various nationalities. If we read the Bible, we know that in this respect the mind of man does not change all that much; and standards of morality, whether here or elsewhere, may be open to discussion, as indeed the question of censorship in general is open to discussion.  As Professor Joad used to say, it all depends on what one means by standards of morality.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that all leading Irish writers are free from contravening the borderline in this respect.  That is not to say that all works of Irish authors would be open to doubt.  I am not for one moment taking a narrow-minded view of this matter but I think it is up to us in the House, and to the Minister as the person responsible for the administration of the censorship legislation, to observe or to judge this matter in an objective, fair-minded and impartial manner.  I think the Minister has succeeded in doing that and despite the arguments that may be put forward about media of communication and the shortening of the lines of communication&mdash;the advance in technology and all that&mdash;we should not allow our minds to run riot in this matter, to run away with the idea that standards of morality change from decade to decade.

They are theoretically immutable but the application of the standards of morality has not been ever found to be uniform throughout the world, as far as I know.  The Minister <Col N="1469" /> suggested, in what may have been a purely debating phrase, that I was seeking to legislate for two distinct things&mdash;Irish and non-Irish morality. Of course this is nonsense.  We are not making laws here in regard to morality. We cannot legislate for morality.  We can legislate only for the application of certain principles within human competence.  Morality is something which goes far deeper than any Act of the Oireachtas.  It is in the soul of every individual and of the community, more particularly in the soul of the individual, and I suggest that the <i>diktat,</i> if the word is permissible, as far as morality is concerned must emanate from sources outside this House.  I would be the last person to seek to deliver sermons on matters moral.  I am concerned with the application of the censorship laws as we have known them up to now and as we are trying to re-draft them for future use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe at all that any amendment of mine will result in creating different standards of morality here.  Let us recognise that the susceptibilities of Irish society are not necessarily at one with those of other nations.  If you walk down the streets of Paris and other continental towns, you will see there quite openly prostitution. Brothels are legalised in certain countries.  Is it to be suggested that our standards here are even remotely related to that attitude of mind? Obviously, they are not; and I think it a good thing they are not.  Although a liberal in thought, I do not believe in the absolute licence which would be imputed to me by Deputy Moore, given the opportunity.  That is not my stand on this matter at all.  We have different standards here by reason of our history and our whole background.  While these standards may be condemned by some who may not appreciate the Irish stream of thought and development and who are out of touch with the Irish temperament and while these standards may not be approved of by all sections of our own society, nevertheless they are the standards which seem best suited to and most acceptable to the people.  That is the final test. The democratic examination of them is <Col N="1470" /> the final test.  It is not just because they do not correspond either with the fancies of the lunatic fringe referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary or the highly-specialised or very obscure notions of complete licence in literary matters which are to be found in exquisite circles in this country.  We have to try to find a commonsense balance. That is what I am trying to do.  I am trying to get at what is commonsense in the application of what may be a very contentious law.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a mark of the maturity of this Parliament that we are able to discuss these things today in the manner we are doing.  Even from the experience of the short period I have been here, I can say that 20 years ago I could not conceive of this type of discussion without heat, to say the least of it, and without a great deal of craw-thumping, to say the most of it.  We have had the minimum of that today, thank God.  I suppose a certain amount of it is inescapable, but it is down to a minimum.  I feel a great confidence in the Censorship Board.  I do not know the personnel of the Board.  I sincerely hope it is not constituted, as are other boards, of failed politicians.</P>

      <P>I know I am expressing what is probably a vain hope. However, I do not want to go into this and I accept your ruling, Sir.  The Minister must repose some confidence in the Censorship Board.  It is not right to say that a great deal would be imposed on the Board if they were asked to review the works of foreign authors after three years and those of Irish authors after 12 months and in each period of 12 months.  I think the Board are well qualified to change even their minds.  It was mentioned that 12 years was the standard period in regard to the term of office of the chairman and the members of such a Board.  It seems to me an average Board could be expected to change their mind in a couple of years, it being determined of course by what Deputy M.J. O'Higgins referred to, community standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community standards, as we know, <Col N="1471" /> can change very rapidly.  I must express the view that I do not like a lot of the changes in community standards in the use of words, as I said before, which to me are revolting, either in the written form or indeed in the spoken form.  It is very distressing from a certain point of view, but it is there and we have to accept it.  I am thinking of a story by Frank O'Connor.  This does not relate to the ill-use of language or the use of bad language.  This story, with its artistry and delicacy, lifts one right out of the world.  It is about a father telling his small child the facts of life, the normal facts which every child eventually must learn.  This was banned in this country. Yet any adult who reads it could not be but struck by the consummate tenderness of the whole situation, the great delicacy with which the problem was handled and the artistry of the man telling the story.  Yet, as I say, that was banned.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that a couple of years hence, with changing attitudes, the Censorship Board, having read it and having listened to other people who had read it talking about it and being impressed by it, must certainly say: &ldquo;We made a mistake.  We should have let that through.&rdquo;  Under the law as it stands, they cannot deal with more than one appeal.  If they turn down one appeal, the book remains banned for 12 years.  I am seeking to change that. I am seeking to provide that an Irish author should have the right to appeal every year and that a non-Irish author should have the right every three years to appeal, not that there should be only one appeal in 12 years.</P>
    <P>The reason I make the distinction between the Irish and non-Irish author is chauvinistic, if you like, to give preference to the Irishman.  It seems to be becoming unfashionable to say anything favourable about Irish people.  We have gone so European that we are becoming masochistic about it and we have to apologise now and say <i>mea cupla</i> before advocating anything Irish or even saying that we are Irish.  I remember a time when the exact opposite was the case, before you young fellows came into the House.  If you could not prove that you were <Col N="1472" /> Irish, there was no chance of gaining entry.  This is an example of the danger I am talking about.  What greater change could there be than that?  At one time you could not get in here unless you were dressed in a trench coat, a soft hat and bearing the Tri-colour aloft, singing &ldquo;The Legion of the Rearguard&rdquo; at the top of your voice.  I should like to see anybody trying that now.  He would not have a vote; the original inventors of the role would shoot him down in ambush. That is beside the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It was agreed on the last day that the point between the Minister and myself here is that the Minister wants to introduce a new offence, the offence of driving a motor car while the concentration of alcohol in the driver's blood exceeds 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, whether the person is intoxicated within the meaning of section 49 of the Principal Act or whether his judgment is impaired.  That is the Minister's proposal. I had been making the case that I consider that proposal unnecessary to achieve the very laudable object behind the section, of putting the drunken driver off the road.  I put forward as an alternative that the percentage of alcohol specified should be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the driver is intoxicated within the meaning of section 49 of the Principal Act and that the driver then should have shifted to him the onus of proving that his judgment is not impaired and that he is fit to drive.</P>
      <P>I have heard it stated since then that the difference between the Minister and myself is a very slight difference.  I do not regard it as a slight difference.  I consider that there is a substantial point at issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth stated on the last day, if I remember correctly, that in effect, when the Minister's proposals become law, if a man wants to drive he should not drink because he will then be certain that the concentration of alcohol in his blood does not exceed the stipulated percentage.  I agree with Deputy Booth when he says that that is the only safe course for a driver to adopt should this section become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the argument the last day that my amendment would meet the case adequately, that it would put on a person in whose blood there was this concentration of alcohol the substantial onus of proving that he was fit to drive a car, that his judgment had not been impaired, and I suggested that my proposal should be given a fair <Col N="1474" /> trial.  I am still convinced that, if given a fair trial, it will prove adequate and satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister intervened at that stage to say that my proposal had been tried in England and had not worked.  With all respect, I say that the Minister was not correct in saying that my proposal had been tried in England under the Road Traffic Act of 1962.  As I understand it, the British Road Traffic Act of 1962 did not constitute any given percentage of alcohol in the blood <i>prima facia</i> evidence of impairment.  It merely enabled the court to have regard to such a concentration of alcohol in the blood but it did not constitute that concentration <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 21, page 21, of the Report of the Commission on Driving While Under the Influence of Drink or a Drug, it is stated:</P>
    <P>In Britain the relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1962, became law on the 20th December 1962.  Section 2 requires a court to have regard to evidence as to the proportion or quantity of alcohol or any drug in the blood or body of an accused person as ascertained from a specimen of blood, urine or breath. Refusal without reasonable cause to furnish a specimen for this purpose may be treated as supporting any evidence given on behalf of the prosecution, or as rebutting any evidence given on behalf of the defence, with respect to the condition of the accused at the material time.  No specific level of blood-alcohol is laid down.  Prior to the Act, urine samples and (occasionally) blood samples (taken with the consent of the accused) had been tested and the results given in evidence.</P>
    <P>That is a very different provision.  That is simply making the matter of alcohol in the blood, in the breath or in the urine, evidence which can be given in court, but it is not evidence which the court is obliged to accept.  It is one of the many aspects of evidence which the British courts were required to consider, and it will be noted that no specified blood-level was laid down in the British Act of 1962.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> Our proposals are very different from those.  Our proposals say that the court is obliged to hold the accused guilty if his blood contains the specified concentration of alcohol unless the accused proves that he is not guilty.  I want to emphasise that.  That is going a very long way, and I am convinced that quite a few Members of the House do not realise just how far it is going. We had a fairly full debate on this the last day and I do not suppose there is any point in arguing indefinitely about it.  I am against the Minister's section 28 of the Bill because it is an innovation in our criminal code when it is coupled with section 29.  It is creating an offence which it will be impossible for a motorist in his own mind to ascertain or define.  When this section becomes law, a motorist may be driving along the road perfectly competent, perfectly capable, firmly believing that his blood alcohol concentration is legal and still he will be committing an offence which will carry the penalty of a heavy fine, imprisonment and disqualification from driving a motor car.</P>
    <P>I am against this section because I do not think it is necessary in order to rid the road of drunken drivers.  If I did, I would agree to it.  I am against the section because, as I say, coupled with section 29, which is the compulsory blood testing section, it is running contrary to the whole criminal code known in this country since the foundation of the State.  It may not be repugnant to certain other continental criminal codes which are far different from ours, but ours has worked very well over the years and has produced, by and large, a law-abiding community.</P>
    <P>Those are in a nutshell my serious objections to the section.  If I were asked what my strongest objection is, I would say it is that here an offence is being created which it would be impossible for a motorist to define in his own mind.  A situation is being created in which a law-abiding motorist will not know whether he is within the law or without the law, unless he has a test carried out every time he drives a car if he has drink taken, which of course is absurd.</P>
    <P>I do not think this House wants to <Col N="1476" /> lay it down, in the words of Deputy Booth, that if a man drives, he should not drink or, to go further, if a man drives, he may not drink.  I do not think this House wants to do that, but, in effect, that is what is being done in this section, because there is scientific evidence to show that a person may be impaired on drinking as little as 2¾ pints of stout socially or four small whiskeys socially.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is taking a stand on this section, a stand on the basis that it is absolutely essential, that he is not prepared to listen to argument or to think again about it. There are several well-conducted, law-abiding, highly respectable social functions held in this city from time to time, and if this section were law and enforced and breathaliser tests and blood tests carried out, there would be wholesale and unnecessary disqualifications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of truth in what Deputy Fitzpatrick has been saying.  Let me repeat what I said on the last occasion this matter was before the House: I deplore the drunken driver.  I believe no mercy should be shown to him if he is proved to be guilty.  However, we have a situation here in which it is possible&mdash;and it has been admitted by the Minister&mdash;for a man to have 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and still, while not a safe driver, be deemed not drunk.  This man can be convicted because there is no way out for the court.  Even though the police testimony bears out the fact that, while this man had 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood, he was, in the opinion of the police, not drunk, the court will have no discretion to accept the police evidence There will be no way in which this can help the man who was not drunk on this amount of alcohol, although there may be only one or two cases of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has been brought out in this debate is the fact that there are no statistics available to show how many fatal accidents are due to drunken driving.  A recent investigation in Germany has shown that the vast majority of accidents occur in the <Col N="1477" /> case of people who have been driving less than five years and there are far fewer accidents in the case of those who have been driving longer than five years.  The report goes on to say that suspension of driving licences is, therefore, not a good thing in the case of a man who has been driving less than five years.  We have not done any research and we have no statistics to show how many accidents are caused by drunken drivers.  My own opinion is &mdash;I have no evidence to support it, but I am sure other Members of the House support it&mdash;that a great number of accidents are caused in the group which has been driving for less than five years.  A great number of accidents are also caused because of mechanical defects and the cars are so badly wrecked there is no way in which one can detect why the drivers had this head on collision, sometimes on a straight stretch of road.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should accept the amendment and leave some way out for the odd driver who may go before the court to prove that he was not drunk.  It is no use the police saying that, in their opinion, he was not drunk if he had 125 milligrammes of alcohol in his blood.  I would strongly urge the Minister to leave some loophole, not to enable the drunken driver to get away but to ensure that the driver in the genuine case, the case in which the driver has a high absorption rate, will not be convicted unnecessarily.  Anybody who drives immediately after drinking enough to put 100 milligrammes of alcohol in his bloodstream is asking for trouble.  I should be pleased if the Minister would say over what period a man can build up to this amount of alcohol and for how long afterwards can this alcohol content in his bloodstream remain a tolerable amount, an amount which will enable him to drive safely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult problem and I am certain I am the only person in the House who has had to make a decision as to whether a person was or was not capable of driving a car.  In a matter such as this, one must naturally recall personal experience.  I <Col N="1478" /> recall one particular case in which a man was charged with being drunk in charge of a car.  The evidence in his defence was that he had lost a great deal of sleep over two nights and had driven a long journey.  He was on the point of reaching home when he was apprehended by the gardaí.  His defence was accepted by the court.  In another case a man was charged with being drunk in charge of a car. He was involved in an accident. His defence was that he had received a head injury during the accident and, as a result of that, his conduct following the accident was due to concussion and not to drunkenness. This case was contested at some length and eventually the court accepted that he had been suffering from concussion and he was acquitted.</P>
      <P>These are cases in which I, as a doctor, would be very glad to have some test of an objective character to help me in reaching a definite opinion. I have no doubt such a test would be of great help to the court also.  This is, I think, the situation Deputy Fitzpatrick is more or less trying to present. The test would be an ancillary one and the court would use it with the other facts to adjudicate as to the capability of the driver.  That would be a reasonable approach.</P>
      <P>As I understand the Minister's case &mdash;it has not been controverted&mdash;the justice, on having the facts presented to him that the blood alcohol content of the accused was over 125 milligrammes, has no choice in the matter and I understand he must also take away the man's driving licence.  That is going too far.  If two-threequarters is the standard amount of beer which will produce this blood level and a man finds himself in a group in which he has to stand the fourth round, and he wants to partake himself in that round, that may easily bring about the undesired result.  The same would apply if he is standing the fifth round of whiskey.  In such circumstances, we would, I think, be going too far in taking away his driving licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on the last occasion that it would be most unlikely that a man would be charged with just this one offence.  The gardaí would probably <Col N="1479" /> have an idea that the man is already drunk and not capable of driving his car and he will go before the courts to face two or three charges in all probability.  The justice should be in a position, as he finds on the different charges, to place the penalty accordingly; in other words, he decides that the man was not drunk in charge of his car but he took a chance in allowing his blood alcohol content to go above a certain level.  In that case the justice should, instead of removing the driving licence, be in a position to impose a fine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has anyone adverted to the recently reported case in London in which a man was arraigned before the court after one of these tests and it was subsequently discovered that the tests on which he was arraigned related to somebody else?  There had been a slight crossing of wires in the administration.  I believe the man was convicted but, on appeal, it was established that the machinery had broken down and the tests related to another person.  From the debate so far it is obvious the House is finding it difficult to disentangle section 27 from section 29.  The possibility of the evidence getting confused under section 27 is relatively unlikely as compared with the probability that will arise under section 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone dealing with this Bill has emphasised the necessity, recognised by all, of controlling and preventing the driving of cars by inebriated people. I wish to remind the House once more that ten years ago I told this House that, if we wanted effectively to reduce the accident rate on our roads, we must control drunken driving and, until we do, there will be no effective reduction in the number of accidents, fatal and otherwise.  Therefore, I do not believe there is any difference amongst the Members of this House as to the desirability of taking effective measures to prevent people under the influence of drink from driving. However, I want to renew an appeal which has been made by a number of Deputies.  In our desire to attain that end, let us not go clean crazy. Unless we can carry with us the general <Col N="1480" /> consent of society as a whole, legislation passed by this House will not be effective and, in fact, may do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>I approach with great reserve the section which provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may approach anybody who is driving a car&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we must take sections 27 and 28 together.  I approach with great reserve the section which provides that a member of the Garda Síochána may approach anybody who is driving a car and require him to submit to the breathaliser test.  When that was discussed on Second Stage, I said that, with very great reluctance, I was prepared to go that far but I thought it was a very extreme limit to the discretion which we ought to confer on the Garda.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that, on the general question, which I understand the last speaker was discussing, I am not prepared to go farther in the direction of the Minister's view than he is prepared to go.  I understand that the argument he makes is that a man may have 125 milligrammes of alcohol, or whatever it is, in his blood but is, in fact, not drunk and it is unreasonable to withdraw his licence when, in fact, he is not drunk but is only committing a statutory offence.  In this Bill, we are not legislating against the drunken driver.  What, in fact, we are saying is that the problem of drunken driving has become so complex and difficult to control that we have made up our minds to determine the statutory limit of alcohol content in the human blood over which nobody may drive a car, even though he is as sober as a judge because there is no other way of getting a satisfactory definition of statutory drunkenness, for the purpose of this Bill, except by taking a wholly arbitrary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising the extreme difficulty of this situation and its adequate control, I do not see how else the Minister can improve the situation except by saying: &ldquo;I admit that 20 per cent of persons with this alcohol content in their blood might not be drunk or might not be incapable of driving a car but <Col N="1481" /> I am certain that 20 per cent of the total number of persons with that level of alcohol in their blood would be incapable of driving a car and the other 60 per cent, between these two extremes, would, to say the least of it, be doubtful and we are asking everybody, in order to suppress this very manifest evil, to accept the self-denying ordinance that they agree that if their blood alcohol content approximates to this level, they simply will not drive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said on an earlier stage that, so far as the young are concerned, I think one must be reasonable but provide them with a rational liberty.  I have no hesitation in saying to young people: &ldquo;There is only one safe guide for you. If you drive, do not drink and, if you drink, do not drive.  If you are going to a party, one member must go on the wagon and stay on the wagon.  The next night you are going out you can choose some other fellow and let him go on the wagon and you on the spree but let there be one person in the car who does not drink at all.&rdquo;  I think that is a reasonable stipulation to make on the young.</P>
    <P>When we come to mature citizens of the State, we must then ask ourselves if it is reasonable, faced with the problem which faces us, that we have to put down a statutory definition of incapacity to drive a car which is 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  Admittedly there are individuals in whose circumstances that does not amount to drunkenness at all.  However, in order to deal with the problem, we have to ask people who have strong heads to forgo the right to drive a car in certain circumstances in order that we may control those for whom an alcohol intake of this kind constitutes a danger.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to discuss this particular section&mdash;section 28&mdash;which lays down a definition without having in the background of my mind the attendant sections&mdash;section 27, which has just been disposed of, and section 29 which follows immediately afterwards.  I have the kind of feeling that anyone who comes part of the way to meet the Minister in his <Col N="1482" /> understanding of this problem, to try to help him to resolve it and to encourage people to accept the restrictions he prescribes is gradually slipping down the slope towards acceptance of the principle in section 29 which I think so revolting and horrible that my natural instinct is to attack the whole scheme.  I have resisted that inclination and continue to do so and say, for the record here, that I am prepared to accept the breathaliser test as something which I hope we shall be able to get rid of some time, sooner or later.</P>
    <P>While it is necessary to meet the urgent situation of the rising death rate on the roads I am prepared to accept the statutory definition of drunkenness as set out in section 28, but I earnestly hope that when we come to section 29 the Minister will see his way to make some gesture towards those who feel as deeply as I do about the constitutional rights of citizens which appear to me to be most grossly outraged by the proposals contained in section 29.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make just one point on the section.  There is the question of the lack of statistics in relation to drunken driving.  We are asked to make up our minds about accepting the level of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  The House is somewhat hog-tied in relation to lack of statistics on drunkenness as a contributing factor to road accidents.  I want to pay a tribute to the work done by the Garda over the years in preparing abstracts and statements with regard to road accidents generally.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick and all other practising lawyers in the House will know what I am speaking of here.  I should have thought it would be simple to arrange a study of some particular area, in an informal manner, to discover to what extent drink does contribute to accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest something like this: in the case of every accident, the investigating officer would make a finding as to whether drink was involved, whether it be the case of a pedestrian, a pedalcyclist, a motorist, or a motor-cyclist. It might be that there would not be sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution <Col N="1483" /> but the experience of the Garda would help in getting some statistical information by which we could make up our minds when a matter of this nature and of this seriousness comes before us in the House.  I would urge the Minister to set up a study session of road traffic accidents in a particular area.  The findings and the information from the investigation would be very valuable to us and to those concerned with road safety in general.  The problem, as I say, of making up our minds on section 28 is caused by the lack of statistics and therefore I would ask the Minister to consider setting up a study area either in the city or country.</P>

      <P>In this section we are prescribing a most rigid code in an effort to deal with the problem of drunken driving.  It is with certain reservations that I support the section. I appreciate that some norm must be found to determine when one is incapable of driving by reason of the alcoholic content, or the drug content, as the case may be, of one's blood. However, it seems to me that the regulation laid down here is very severe. It means that a man who has taken more than 2¾ pints of beer or stout will be regarded as being incapable under this section.  Likewise, the man who partakes of two glasses of spirits will be deemed to be drunk and incapable of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to hear the Minister elaborate on the point he has made that Deputy Fitzpatrick and others are wrong in suggesting that this minimal amount of drink is sufficient to put people outside the law under this section. If what is being said is true, that something like 2½ pints of stout puts one outside the law, we are obviously going to make life miserable for a large section of our people who enjoy driving and who enjoy having a few drinks&mdash;unless we expect everyone to stop drinking altogether and become Pioneers.  If what is said is true, one would be better off giving up drinking. However careful one might be about one's drinking habits, there will no longer be any enjoyment in drinking if one drives and one will no longer be able to relax in the publichouse or hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> I am with the Minister all the way in implementing the most rigid regulations to control drunken driving but I am concerned that we might destroy the enjoyment of so many people who like to have a few pints with their friends after work.  If you keep to something like three pints of stout as being the number of drinks which is sufficient to render one liable under this section, it will be a great source of worry and anxiety to every man who enjoys a few pints.  However, if no other way can be found, I would have no hesitation in supporting the measure but, as I say, with certain reservations.  There are some people who can take two glasses of spirits and still be competent and there are many more of us who on this small amount of liquor would most probably feel incapable of driving or of performing any useful function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This boils down to a battle of the small ones, the number one can take without reaching the statutory limit, as indicated by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon was most reasonable in his approach to the problem.  He indicated that there was a need for some limit.  I am sure that no matter what limit was set by the Minister, there would be objections from some quarters.  Everything should be done to free the roads from drunken drivers.  It is a good day's work when any action of ours keeps these people, who are a hazard to other road users, off the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had my way possibly I would go much further than the Minister.  We have had suggestions about leaving loopholes; we should not leave any loophole for drunken drivers. If we decide on a limit, as in the case of any other limit, it must be enforced as a limit.  I believe this limit is reasonable and I fully agree that the Minister should implement it without leaving loopholes. I think some Deputy spoke about fellows taking a chance, then the public are at the mercy of people who drink to excess and take chances. Far too many people are taking chances at present and we have far <Col N="1486" /> too many accidents as a result of drunken driving.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about statistics but statistics will not give a clear picture of the situation in regard to drunken driving.  Recently, I sought information regarding the number of traffic accidents at Walkinstown Cross and was told that one accident took place there in a month.  I myself know that at least two accidents a night take place at this cross and in this period in which I was told there was one accident, I was a witness myself of four accidents taking place.  From people who live close by, including some members of the clergy and others who attended people knocked down at this crossroads during this period, I know that at least two accidents a night take place there.  The statistics in regard to drunken driving do not give the complete picture.  People involved in such accidents are very clever and will pay any price to cover up the facts when they know they are at fault and have been drinking to excess.  This happens day in, day out.  We must have some reasonably strict line where a decision can be made as to whether a person has consumed too much alcohol.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to deprive anybody of the opportunity to enjoy a drink with his friends at night after work. There are plenty such opportunities without creating a hazard on the road on leaving the public house or other place where drink is consumed.  This Bill is not intended to deprive people of the opportunity to enjoy a drink with their friends but there is the question of limiting the amount one can consume when one is driving a vehicle. There must be some limit.  For that reason I strongly support the Minister and I trust that this measure will contribute to reducing the number of accidents and to putting off the road drunken drivers and people who have no sense of their responsibility to others.  Far too many take chances and far too many lives have been lost as a result of drink.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the results appearing after investigation do not always reveal the true position.  I was a witness of two accidents and in one case the <Col N="1487" /> driver, in my opinion, was very drunk but by the time the matter was fully discussed in the court he was seen as an archangel&mdash;he had not got a drop. The man was unable to stand when he got out of the car.  He had to be lifted from the car and put sitting in the ditch.  He was incapable of standing and yet we were told that man was fit to drive, or that was the opinion of the judge who tried the case.  In this Bill we are defining clearly how far one can go and still be within the law.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> After listening to Deputy Dowling, it is necessary to repeat that the House appears to be unanimous on the necessity to put drunken drivers off the road.  I do not think anyone here is an advocate of the drunken driver or approves of drunken driving or of impaired driving which is a much lesser offence.  Neither in the Act of 1961 nor in this Bill are we talking of the socially drunk.  We all agree that a person who is socially drunk should be off the road: take his licence from him.  Within the limits of these two measures we are speaking of a person whose judgment is impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor and we agree that such a person should go off the road.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We agree on that.  I understand it is common case that we are not even considering the socially drunk.  Neither of these pieces of legislation even seriously consider him.  We go further and agree that a person whose judgment is impaired as a result of the consumption of intoxicating liquor should not drive a car.  There is even something to be said for one of the statements made by Deputy Dowling if taken away from the remainder of his extravagant remarks, that is, that there should be no loopholes left to a person whose judgment is seriously impaired when driving a car.  I respectfully say to the House that if my amendment is <Col N="1488" /> accepted, there will be no loopholes because a person in whose bloodstream there is a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood or a person who refuses to submit himself to a blood test will be deemed to be unfit to drive until he satisfies the court by satisfactory evidence that his judgment was in fact unimpaired at the material time.  That is my amendment in a nutshell.</P>
      <P>If I may say so with respect, this morning's debate was very constructive and helpful.  We have been told from time to time that the courts have no proper yardstick by which to decide when judgment is impaired.  We are giving them a yardstick in my amendment and we are saying that a man's judgment is impaired until he proves the contrary.  Take the case mentioned by Deputy Briscoe this morning.  The evidence will have to be satisfactory evidence&mdash;I should prefer to have the evidence of a doctor but I do not want to write that into the Bill&mdash;by a doctor or a member of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It will have to be evidence that he was fit to drive.  The evidence of the medical practitioner and the garda will have to be so satisfactory as to rebut the onus which I propose to put on the shoulders of the accused person, that is, as against the attitude of the Minister that where the defendant refuses to undergo the blood test, he will be deemed to be unfit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe gave me food for thought when he said that you could have a case where a member of the Garda is satisfied that the person was perfectly normal, perfectly able to drive a car and that his judgment was not impaired, but because his blood test shows 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood his driving is impaired.  He is convicted; he is fined and his driving licence is taken away for 12 months.  That will be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had Deputy Gibbons giving us two cases of which he had experience. One excuse was that the man was up all night and he got off; another man <Col N="1489" /> had concussion and he got off.  If my amendment becomes law, the district justice will say: &ldquo;Oh, well, if there is doubt as to whether the man's condition is due to fatigue, loss of sleep or concussion, I have a yardstick here: there is a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood in his blood.  At the moment a great many people are not satisfied with such a concentration and therefore I am afraid I must come to the conclusion that the onus of proof placed on the accused has not been discharged.&rdquo;  As the law stands at the moment, if a doctor goes into court and says that he examined the accused and that his condition could be due to the consumption of alcohol or to fatigue, there is doubt in the mind of the district justice as to whether the man's condition is due to the consumption of alcohol or to fatigue.  The man must get the benefit of this doubt.</P>
    <P>At the moment if a doctor comes into the court and says that this particular man got a head injury, that he bumped his head against the car and that he is behaving a bit funny, that could be due to the fact that he cracked his head against the car or could be due to the consumption of alcohol.  As I understand the law, that creates a reasonable statutory doubt in the mind of the district justice.  Under the law, as we understand it, the accused person is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>There is no question of a doubt if my amendment is accepted.  If there is a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood the man is presumed to be guilty of a statutory offence.  If the doctor comes in and says that the man's attitude could be due to alcohol or fatigue, there is then again a doubt in the mind of the district justice but the onus of proof that the man is fit has not been discharged.  I hope I am making myself clear.  If the doctor merely comes in under the law, as I want it to be, and says that the man's condition could be due to alcohol, fatigue or concussion, the accused has not discharged the onus of proof and will be convicted under this section.  I say that that is going far enough and is putting a <Col N="1490" /> strong enough weapon into the Minister's hands to rid the road of impaired driving.  I am not going to refer any more to drunken driving.  When we talk about drunken driving, we are creating a wrong impression.  My amendment gives a strong enough weapon to the Minister.</P>
    <P>When I say I am fortified in my argument by the Report of the Commission on Driving while under the influence of Drink or Drugs, set up on 14th September 1961 and which reported to the Minister on 15th May 1963 that what I say is desirable and what the Minister proposes is wrong and undesirable, I think I am on very firm ground.  When I quote from an address, which was criticised here last week, by the President of the Safety First Association of Ireland to bus drivers in November 1966, a few months ago, who confirms he still believes&mdash;he was a member of the Commission&mdash;that the Commission are right, that I am right and the Minister is wrong, I think I am on very firm ground indeed.  The Minister, having heard arguments from all sides of the House this morning, should have another look at this section and should give it some further consideration.  He may have been influenced by the fact that he thought my proposal was given a fair trial in England but I hope I have convinced him this morning that it was not given any trial in England and was never the law in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we had fairly well dealt with this section and with this amendment last week.  As far as I can see, we can go on with the process of repeating the arguments for and against forever.  This morning so far it has simply been a review of what was said here last week.  Deputy Fitzpatrick maintains that if we accept his proposal to make this <i>prima facie</i> evidence, putting the onus on the driver of proving his fitness to drive, the position will be satisfactory and we will have power to deal with this type of driver.  I maintain that it is quite obvious if this is only to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence&mdash;in other words, it is only the district justice who justifies the State in bringing the matter to the obvious conclusion&mdash;that the <Col N="1491" /> argument as to whether the driver is impaired in his driving ability or not will continue as at present to revolve around the evidence of a clinical nature, the evidence regarding the driver's behaviour.  It is on this type of evidence that the case will be decided in future, as at present.</P>
      <P>This is not sufficient for what I want to establish in this Bill.  The scientific test which I am proposing in this section will be largely irrelevant if we accept the amendment.  We will be to all intents and purposes back to the present position of relying on evidence as to the man's behaviour and for clinical evidence as to his condition.  This is not satisfactory.  I am satisfied that the public in general accept that this position is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick says that we all want to put the drunken driver off the road, and not alone that but want to put the impaired driver off the road. I maintain that his proposal here will make it impossible for us to do this successfully because of the position that exists at present.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the proposal to make this scientific evidence as to the blood-alcohol content conclusive evidence of an offence is contrary to our legal code in that it involves the presumption of being drunk until proved otherwise.  The offence the driver will be convicted of is the offence that his blood-alcohol content has been raised to this level. A person will be guilty of this new offence if he raises his blood-alcohol content to the level specified in this section.  That can only be proved by a scientific test as proposed in the Bill. It cannot be established by the clinical evidence or by a person's behaviour. A person's behaviour in carrying out other actions other than driving a car may be perfectly normal and his ability to act while driving a mechanically-propelled vehicle may be impaired, even though his behaviour otherwise is beyond reproach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way it can be established that a person has raised his blood-alcohol content to this dangerous level <Col N="1492" /> is by some scientific test as proposed here.  The two tests we are proposing are a blood test or a urine test. Unfortunately, the breathaliser test has not been established to be sufficiently reliable as to be taken as conclusive evidence.  So, at present at any rate, these are the only two really scientific tests that are available.  There is no other way of establishing whether a person has committed this offence, which I am proposing to create, of driving after he has raised his blood-alcohol content to this level.  If we establish it by these scientific tests, then there is no reason to assume a man guilty.  He is guilty if he is driving, and if we pass this legislation, this offence will be committed and there is no use in assuming something that has not been proved.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion to give his amendment a fair trial, my stand on that is that this will be very close to the present position.  Surely this has had a fair trial and it has not been successful in reducing the rate of accidents, and the public demand something else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick at one stage referred to the new offence which I am proposing to create as a lesser offence.  I do not agree that it is a lesser offence and I think Deputy Fitzpatrick went back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy at one stage said it was a lesser offence but he corrected that later and admitted that it is not a lesser offence.  In my opinion, it is not a lesser offence and, in fact, a person's ability to react responsibly in times of danger and stress while driving is impaired, and a lot of people would say that such a person is a greater danger than the person who is really drunk and practically incapable, as we understand it at present.  The person who is stimulated by alcohol and whose confidence in himself is exaggerated rather than the reverse, is, in fact, a greater danger on the road than the person who is practically incapable due to the consumption of alcohol and who is obviously so incapable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Deputy Briscoe, I think, takes a completely unrealistic approach to this whole matter.  He deplores the drunken driver.  We all deplore the drunken driver.  That is not enough.  I am not interested in the drunken driver here. The present position with regard to drunken drivers will remain.  It is a different person I want to get at&mdash; the person who is not drunk but who is not fit to drive a car.  It has been scientifically established that people reach the stage of being unfit to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle on the public road long before they become drunk.  This continuous reference to drunken drivers is completely irrelevant here.  The question at issue here has nothing whatever to do with that. This is a question of ensuring that people will not take the terrible risk of driving cars when they are unfit to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doubtful if anybody, even the most hardened and practised drinker, is fit to drive when the blood-alcohol content has been raised to this level.  I suppose it is impossible to establish that every individual would, in fact, be impaired at this level.  It may be that there are some exceptional individuals who can raise their blood-alcohol content to this level and still be fit to drive.  If there are such people, they are exceptional; they are in a small minority.  Even they can never be sure that they will retain this facility throughout their lives or that they will retain it in all circumstances.  We all know that a person's capacity to consume alcohol and still retain his faculties varies according to his physical condition, according to when he had his last meal and how fast he can consume alcohol, and other such considerations.  There may, conceivably, be people who will not be impaired in their driving ability at this blood-alcohol level, but if there are, they are few and far between. They are exceptional, but it is in the public interest to ensure that <Col N="1494" /> people who are affected will not be allowed to drive and that they will commit an offence if they drive.  There is no other way of establishing it than by scientific tests.  The whole object of these sections is to safeguard the public from those people who at present endanger themselves, their passengers and other members of the public with impunity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe makes the fundamental mistake of thinking that what we are trying to deal with here is the drunken driver.  I am asking the Dáil to give power to control a different problem altogether, the person who is very probably a greater danger to the public and a more prolific cause of accidents.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Gibbons that other factors cause accidents and may, in fact, cause more accidents, such as a person suffering from loss of sleep, great tiredness, mechanically defective vehicles, and so on.  These things also cause accidents and people who drive in those circumstances are also dangerous to the public.  All possible steps should be taken to safeguard the public from that type of person as well.</P>
      <P>The fact that there are those other causes of accidents is no reason why we should not try to deal as effectively as possible with the particular cause which is relevant to this section.  I want to point out again to the House that the quantities Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned as giving rise to this level of alcohol content are applicable only to certain types of people and to alcohol being consumed in certain conditions. The reference to 2¾ pints of beer is applicable only to a person weighing 11 stone who drinks this quantity on an empty stomach and does so in an exceptionally short space of time&mdash; drinks it practically in the one continuous action.  People who drink in the normal way, under normal conditions, may conceivably consume more without committing the offence I propose to create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental point which some Deputies seem to be ignoring, and it does not seem to be possible to get them to understand, is that this is not a question of dealing with a drunken <Col N="1495" /> driver.  The proposal is to create this new offence.  Therefore, the issue involved in this simple offence is very simple indeed.  It is purely and simply whether or not we create the offence of having 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  If we decide to create the offence, there is only one way to establish that this level of blood-alcohol content has been reached, and it is something which cannot be established either by clinical opinion or by lay observation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion by Deputy Andrews that we should wait before we tackle this problem until statistics are available, I do not know how anybody can imagine that we could compile statistics of accidents caused by people who had raised their blood-alcohol content to the level of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres without having the exact powers asked for in this Bill.  I can see no possibility whatever of compiling these statistics. With regard to the question of statistics of accidents caused by drink, I dealt with that on Second Stage.  I pointed out that such statistics as are available at the moment or such statistics as could be compiled are entirely valueless.  Deputy Dowling gave us some of the reasons why this is so. Accidents are ascribed to drink only where it is the belief of the gardaí that it would be possible to establish legally they were, in fact, caused by drink. Obviously, that is the vast minority of such cases, cases which were either caused by drink or were contributed to by the consumption of alcohol. Certainly in the case of a serious accident in which a driver is injured it is impossible to test the driver, which is the normal thing.  I am satisfied that the compilation of such statistics would be a complete farce. They would be valueless and I am not in the least interested in embarking on what I regard as the nonsensical operation of trying to compile such statistics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy, while supporting the proposal in the main, thought that possibly the level of blood-alcohol content which we are proposing here might be rather severe.  The probability is that <Col N="1496" /> the level might be higher than it should be.  In Great Britain the level adopted is 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres and we are going a considerable distance beyond that.  I might remind Deputy Treacy that when the 1961 Act was being passed here, a Labour Party Deputy proposed a level for this offence of 50 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  All the evidence is that, if anything, the level proposed here is too high and it is more likely that in future this level will be reduced rather than that there should ever be a proposal to raise it.</P>
    <P>Any further discussion here is largely irrelevant, because it is purely and simply a question of whether or not we create this offence.  If we create it, it can be established only by scientific test and in no other way. It is a question of whether or not the blood-alcohol content has been raised to this level and clinical observation or evidence as to a person's behaviour or any evidence to prove that he is, in fact, fit to drive, although he has done this, would be completely irrelevant. A decision based on such evidence would be in regard to a completely different offence from that which I am asking the House to create.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief. I do not think the Minister doubts the sincerity of the people taking part in this debate but I should like to say to him that he was quite right.  I was under a complete illusion that this was to catch drunken drivers and I learn that it is to catch impaired drivers, which is a totally different thing.  I appreciate this point now.  I may have been very slow in coming to this.  I do not believe that any man can have 125 milligrammes of alcohol in his bloodstream, per 100 millilitres, and not be impaired; this I accept.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Fitzpatrick has lost my support for his amendment because I admit I was completely off the beam.  I can see <Col N="1497" /> now exactly what the Minister is getting at, particularly in view of the fact that he has mentioned there is in England a measure of 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  It is not easy for me to stand up here and say I was wrong but I believe my arguments in view of what the Minister has said were incorrect and I go along now with the Minister in relation to the section.</P>
      <P>It is a very important point because many members of the public will not realise that it is designed not to catch the drunken driver but the driver whose ability has been impaired by the consumption of alcohol.  I was also interested to note that the 2¾ pints related to their being consumed within a very short period, almost one after another, on an empty stomach, and that a man's normal evening's drinking would not necessarily be affected over a long period.</P>
      <P>I should like to make this point&mdash; I know it has nothing to do with the Minister's Department&mdash;but the curse of drinking in this country is this business of buying rounds and drinking against the clock.  Maybe if somebody could remove these licensing hours and people were free to drink slowly, instead of drinking against the clock, we would have a lot less drunken driving.</P>

      <P>The Minister regards as a very foolish notion the views put forward by some Deputies, and by some authoritative spokesman for the liquor trade, as such, that a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood represents about 2¾ pints of stout and approximately two glasses of liquor, say, whiskey.  The Minister says that may be so, that in a person of about 11 stone weight who would consume that amount of alcohol on an empty stomach this is the effect it would achieve.  It is very important that the public at large shall understand fully and clearly and without any ambiguity whatsoever what precise penalties are contained in section 28.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and if there is present in his body a quantity of alcohol such that within 3 hours after so driving or <Col N="1498" /> attempting to drive the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood he shall be deemed until the contrary is proved to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to try to say if he can, if he disputes the quantities of drink we have mentioned&mdash;2¾ pints or two glasses of liquor&mdash;the amount of alcohol he or his experts say this represents in terms of pints and spirits?</P>

      <P>Let us keep the three hour period in mind.  The Minister should now be in a position to tell us in his opinion and in the opinion of his experts what amount of alcohol this fairly represents in the average person. If we are to win respect for this measure and the co-operation of the public, drinking people should clearly know when they have crossed the Rubicon and incurred the serious penalties of this section and the following section if they exceed X number of pints or X number of half-ones.  We should forget about milligrammes and millilitres and spell out in plain King's English what we are talking about.  It is not good enough for the Minister to disregard the opinions of responsible people in the trade that the milligrammes referred to here can amount to less than three pints of stout.  This will come as a shock, I maintain, to the average drinking person who likes a few pints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should much prefer if we could have greater clarification of what is <Col N="1499" /> involved when we talk in terms of milligrammes and millilitres and have it spelled out in terms of pints and half-ones as the case might be.  I appreciate that there is some difficulty about it but if one section of the trade and certain Deputies of this House can bring forward a measurement or a standard in this regard, surely it is not outside the ingenuity of the Minister's experts to tell us precisely what amount of alcohol this means from the point of view of the average consumer.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Briefly, I want to correct the record in view of some things the Minister said. He says that if my amendment is accepted, the law will be very much as it is at the present time.  This is clearly not so.  If the Minister thinks that, as I am sure he does, he does not clearly appreciate the significance of my amendment.  The significance of my amendment is shifting the onus of proof on to the accused.  At the present time the State must prove that a man is impaired.  If my amendment is accepted, the man who is charged must prove that he is not impaired.  During my professional experience, a very high percentage&mdash;I would say probably 80 per cent&mdash;of the people for whom I have acted and who were acquitted or whom I have seen being acquitted in courts were acquitted on application for a direction by the defence because the State had not proved their case.  If my amendment is accepted, that can never happen again.  There will be no such thing as a direction if the 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood is there.  I hope that is clear on the record and clear in the minds of the Deputies.  I will go so far as to say that if that is accepted as being in effect the result of my amendment it means a tremendous change in the law as we understand it at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that we are dealing in section 28 with the impaired driver.  In section 28 we are going to punish a person whose blood alcohol concentration is 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres, whether he is impaired or not.  Let us get that clear on the record.  It is known from statistics and <Col N="1500" /> from the best authority that can be had in the country that while a great many people will be impaired at this concentration there is a fair percentage who will not be impaired.  Let us put the record straight on that.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy for Deputy Treacy's commonsense approach in his last remarks when he asks for guidance for the public and a yardstick for drivers by which they will know when they are committing an offence because they will not know now when they have committed an offence.  I emphasised this point several times in the course of my remarks and I do not want to over-emphasise it.  One of my most serious complaints about this section is that a man may be committing an offence, violating this section without knowing it.  The Minister admits that a person could be outside this section having consumed 2¾ pints of stout but says he would have to do it pretty quickly.</P>
    <P>Various people have different views about drinking, usually depending on whether they drink themselves or depending more importantly on whether they think that other people should drink.  I do not know whether the House in general would think that four pints of stout is an abnormal amount of drink.  It is a matter of opinion. If the Minister disagrees with 2¾ pints, the figure which has been quoted, I do not think he can disagree with paragraph 8 on page 125 of the Report of the Commission on Driving While under the Influence of Drink or a Drug:</P>
    <P>As a very general guide it may be stated that a man of 11 stone weight would be unlikely to exceed a blood alcohol level of 125 mg. unless he drank more than 6 small whiskeys or gins in a period of approximately two hours, or more than 4 pints of stout or beer in the same period.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the House to decide whether drinking four pints within two hours, presumably on a normally full stomach, is heavy drinking.  That is a matter of opinion, but, reading that paragraph, it is clear that as a general rule or as a general guide, individuals drinking less than that over two hours, presumably on a normally full <Col N="1501" /> stomach, would have this concentration. It is admitted as a general principle that one person can have such a concentration of alcohol and not be impaired, while another person would be impaired.  Therefore, I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Treacy's approach to the problem which this section will create for the ordinary law-abiding citizen.</P>
    <P>Let us not leave section 28 without bearing in mind that if we pass it, and if the Minister has no further thoughts about it, section 29 follows as night follows day.  Section 29 is the section which says that a man must submit himself to blood being extracted from his body with a hypodermic syringe and that if he does not&mdash;if he says he will not submit to a blood test&mdash;he can be brought to court, fined, put in jail and have his driving licence suspended. Once we accept section 28, we are right into section 29.</P>

        <i>(Dublin):</i> I am rather dubious about this section. As someone who is engaged in the trade, I have never at any time encouraged drunken driving.  Those of us who drive cars with our families are always rather dubious about driving at night in case this particular type of person is on the road.  I am under the impression that we are going too far too quickly and that we are going to bring within this section people who are innocent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers have pointed out, there is no indication for any man who wants to take a drink of how much he may take.  The Minister has not given any guideline as to exactly what amount of drink we may consume or as to the alcohol content of the various drinks.  If this Bill passes, the public will be left completely in the dark.  If I wish to partake of refreshment, the <Col N="1502" /> Minister has not told me the alcohol content of each drink.  If I go out to a lounge or a hotel tonight, there is no indication as to how far I can go or where I must stop.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the breathaliser test in principle, but I think the offence is too great.  It should be a separate offence and if you are caught with a certain amount of alcohol, it should carry a certain penalty.  In my opinion, the onus should be placed on the policeman to charge me with drunken driving and take me to court and say this is the offence with which he is charging me.  It is wrong to take this test, find this amount of alcohol in my blood and disqualify me from driving.  We are going too far and we are bringing in a very dangerous section if we bring this in.  I can visualise many innocent people who will be caught within this 2½ pints of stout&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin):</i> 2¾ pints of stout.  There are people like dockers who work in an overheated atmosphere for an hour or two hours and it is one of the regulations that they must get a break.  It is nothing unusual for them to take a certain amount of that type of beverage.  This happens with dockers and in breweries where people work in a very heated atmosphere.  If such a person drives home for lunch and a policeman stops him, he can lose his licence.  That is taking it too far.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about an innocent person who goes out at night. He has no guideline as to what he is to drink.  Once he steps outside the door he can be challenged by a policeman and can automatically lose his licence.  I should like to see this as a separate offence.  If the person has this amount of alcohol, there should be a fine, but the onus should be placed on the policeman to prove that he was incapable of driving.  We could bring in this kind of legislation and see how it works.  If at a later stage we thought it unsuccessful, we could go a little further, but I would be very careful about introducing it in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> We are trying to encourage tourism and various other types of trade.  We are opening car-ferries.  Will this have a depressing effect on our tourist industry?  I cannot answer that at the moment.  The Minister might tell us if he thinks it will have any effect on our tourist industry and on the car-ferries. It is mandatory at the moment&mdash;and no doubt the Minister for Local Government is aware of this&mdash;for any licensed premises or hotels opening today to have car parks.  Does this mean that we want to encourage people who patronise hotels to go out and drive? One seems to contradict the other, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>It is part of local government law that anyody who opens a hotel bar or licensed lounge bars must provide sufficient car parking space.  This encourages people to get out their cars and go drinking.  This Bill should be doing away with car parking at places where drink is sold.  We should be providing here that signs be put up that no car parking will be allowed within two miles of any place where drink is sold or consumed.  On the section, my opinion is that the penalty for this offence should be less than disqualification. There should be an offence by all means, but if the man who consumes that amount of drink is to be penalised, there should be an onus on the policeman who finds him in such a condition to prove the case in court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The only viewpoint that has been raised is the suggestion that I should endeavour to indicate to people what amounts of different types of drink it is safe for them to consume without reaching the blood-alcohol level specified in the section.  I should not like to advise what are safe quantities to consume in normal circumstances. I do not know what normal circumstances are: they vary with the individual, and the question of the state of health and physical fitness comes into it.  It is the blood-alcohol content that affects ability to drive, not the quantity of liquor consumed and it is this which must be the test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it reasonable to ask me to provide an alternative test of the number of small whiskeys or pints consumed <Col N="1504" /> during a specified period by different people of different physiques. If I were to do so, is it to be taken as an adequate defence to show that even though the blood-alcohol content had been raised to this level, the amount of drink which I specified had not in fact been consumed during the specified period?  Am I to draft out a table showing people's weights on the one hand, showing the different quantities of all the different types of alcoholic drink that are available that could be consumed within different periods for each different category of person? This, in itself, would be valueless because it would also depend on the physical condition of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>If a person, when driving a car, insists on sailing as close to the wind as possible, it is not unreasonable to ask him to establish for himself just how much drink he can consume without committing this offence; but it is certainly not reasonable to ask me to do it for him.  The only thing I can do is to direct people's attention to Appendix V of the Report of the Commission on Driving While Under the Influence of Drink or a Drug.  It is a report of an eminent member of the Commission, Professor Hickey, on tests conducted by him.  In it he gives a table&mdash; Table I&mdash;from which Deputy Fitzpatrick has been quoting.  In paragraph 2, which I shall quote fully, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The amounts of drink listed in Table I are the minimum quantities that must have been taken to produce the blood alcohol levels stated.  To produce these levels the quantity of drink would have to be consumed very quickly.  In practice, two-thirds of the population ...</P>
    <P>We do not know which two-thirds.</P>
    <P>... could drink half as much again and many individuals ...</P>
    <P>We do not know who they are.</P>
    <P>... could drink twice the quantities listed without exceeding the stated blood alcohol level provided the drink was not taken at an unusually rapid rate.  The human body eliminates the amount of alcohol in approximately one ounce of whiskey <Col N="1505" /> or gin or in a half a pint of average stout or beer per hour.  Accordingly for prolonged periods of drinking an amount equivalent to half a pint of beer or stout, or a little less than a small whiskey could be regarded as disposed of in each hour.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be possible for me to indicate to every individual in the country, who wants to drive his car and consume the maximum possible amount of liquor while doing so, a reliable guide as to what he could consume in all the different circumstances of environment and state of health.</P>
    <P>If such a person is determined to take this risk, I do not think it is unreasonable for me to say to him: &ldquo;Make this calculation yourself; get out your stopwatch and time yourself and decide when you have eliminated the effects of a sufficient quantity of alcohol and then go ahead and consume more.&rdquo;  If he wants to do that, it is reasonable for me to say he should take these precautions himself.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8 of Appendix V states:</P>
    <P>As a very general guide it may be stated that a man of 11 stone weight would be unlikely to exceed a blood alcohol level of 125 mg.  unless he drank six small whiskeys or gins in a period of approximately two hours, or more than four pints of stout or beer in the same period.</P>
    <P>If people of 11 stone weight want to take that as a guide, they can do so but at their own risk, not with any authority given by me because, as the professor says, this is a very general guide.</P>
    <P>Such a man would be unlikely to exceed the blood alcohol content but Professor Hickey does not say it would be impossible.  One of the difficulties about disposing of the section is the fact that while I am here all the time, Deputies can come and go and we can go on forever, as far as I can see, with new Deputies coming and going, raising the points Deputies Fitzpatrick, Treacy and others, who have been here all the time, had already raised and to which I had replied.  Our discussion here will be completely inconclusive if the <Col N="1506" /> same points are to be raised over and over again.</P>
    <P>This is the only new thing that has been raised: Deputy Treacy made the not unreasonable request that there should be some indication, in easily intelligible terms, as to what a person can do safely and what he cannot do, but I want to point out that I cannot give a reliable guide.  The best Professor Hickey could do was to indicate on the basis of these tests what appeared to be fairly general guides. However, he indicated that there can be no undertaking given to anybody in any particular set of circumstances as to what amount of alcoholic drink he can safely consume.</P>
    <P>It all boils down to the fact that it is the individual's duty to the general public to ensure that he does not take this risk and does not commit this offence.  In view of the seriousness of the act of driving a motor car, in view of the disastrous consequences for himself and his passengers and for completely uninvolved members of the public, I think it is reasonable for us to require people to ensure that they do not impair their driving ability by raising their blood alcohol content to this level and to put the onus on the person himself of not consuming alcohol in such quantities and at such a rate as will produce this condition.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;he can lose his licence.  It brings us back to what Deputy Booth said. We are, in effect, saying; &ldquo;if you drink, don't drive.&rdquo;  Table I of Appendix V gives the minimum intake of Irish whiskey or gin, and average Irish beer or stout capable of producing certain blood alcohol levels.  At 125 milligrammes, we are given 4½ small whiskeys or 2¾ pints of beer. There are no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; or &ldquo;buts&rdquo; about that.  Admittedly, Professor Hickey said in paragraph 2 that in practice two-thirds of the people could drink half as much again.  That would make it, I think, about 5½ pints.  This is what I am complaining about.  You can have a number of innocent, law-abiding, capable people caught up in this through no fault of their own.  You could go the whole way and say, as Deputy Booth says: &ldquo;If you drink, don't drive.&rdquo;  But I do not think we are in that state of mind yet.  I do not think the country would accept that. In my opinion, the reply given to Deputy Treacy proves that this will be an unnecessary hardship on people. The only safe way is not to drink at all or have the publicans install breathalisers or other instruments to test people before they get into their cars. Or else, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, prohibit cars within a certain distance of public houses.</P>

      <P>I want to get the record <Col N="1508" /> straight.  I was not suggesting for a moment that we should legislate by statute to say: &ldquo;If you drink, don't drive or if you drive, don't drink.&rdquo; What I did say, and what I will repeat, is that the only safe way for a driver to behave, if he wishes to save himself from the danger not only of an accident but of a prosecution, is not to drink at all.  Several speakers have said they would like the Minister to give some indication as to what they must drink.  I cannot imagine anything further from the Minister's mind than suggesting to people what they may drink.  They are not under any obligation to drink anything at all unless they want to.  To suggest it is permissible to drink alcohol up to a certain limit before driving is, I think, putting temptation in the way of drivers&mdash;a temptation we should try to remove from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to do in this Bill&mdash;I support the Minister absolutely to the limit on this&mdash;is to create a scientifically established, technical statutory offence, not because that offence in itself means that driving skill is necessarily impaired but because there is too high a risk of driving ability being impaired to allow of any temptation.  I support the Minister also in his contention that the amendment would put the law back to approximately where it was before. There is no clinical test known that can establish driving ability.  There are certain tests which are used&mdash;walking along a white line and picking up something off the floor&mdash;but those are all arbitrary tests and are not scientific in any way.  They are only sufficient to allow a man to have an opinion based on some test, but it is far from conclusive.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment were accepted, it would give a false sense of security to moderate drinkers.  They would say: &ldquo;I will take a chance on it.  I will probably be able to fight my way out of this.  I know a doctor, a broadminded man without straining his conscience in any way and, if I get him down quickly, he will be able to satisfy himself I am reasonably able to drive.&rdquo;  That opens the door again.  We have got to stand on this statutory technical offence.  Once we <Col N="1509" /> weaken on that, we have given the whole thing away.</P>
    <P>I am not disregarding the report of the Commission, but we have to remember the Commission dealt with the matter in a theoretical way.  The members of the Commission were not the people who will have to enforce the law.  It is only when you are in an executive capacity, as the Minister is&mdash;the man who has to frame the law and then enforce it&mdash;that you can see that section 28, as drafted, is the only way in which you can properly do it.</P>
    <P>I would not contest for a moment that certain people with an alcohol content above that set out in the section may not have their driving impaired.  I admit that there may be something in what Deputy Treacy says, that certain people's enjoyment of an evening may be impaired or even ruined by having to restrict their drinking but it is far better that people's enjoyment of an evening should be ruined and that they should live to see tomorrow than that they should have a hell of a good night and wake up dead in the morning wrapped around a telegraph pole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I seriously hope the fate I have described will not overtake the Deputy.  It would be a most alarming experience.  We have got to get down to the hard facts of life, that once you allow opinion, technical opinion, lay opinion or anything else, to be brought into legal proceedings, you are bound to have doubts arising which, very rightly, must be resolved in favour of the accused.  The result would be that this section would become something of a laughingstock or that people would feel that it was worth while taking a sporting chance and having just one more for the road.  That is one thing we have to get them to come off at all costs.  They must have no chance of escape.  They must be told, as they are going to be told in the Bill, that too high an alcohol content is an offence <Col N="1510" /> and that is the end of it and there is no defence against it except another analysis which queries the scientific finding.</P>
      <P>We have got to get away from this feeling that we can encourage people to drink.  We have to leave them in a state of doubt.  That is far better than to tell them to go on by all means and have five pints, six pints, four half-ones, three large ones, whatever it may be.  That is only encouraging people to do the one thing which we want them not to do.  If there is this doubt, as there will be, a lot of people will be prepared to take the obvious solution and just not have the drink if they are going to drive.  If we do this, we will make a very marked improvement in road conditions generally but if we weaken on this, we might as well throw our hat at the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my disappointment at the Minister's reply to my pertinent query.  I had hoped that if he was not in a position now, he would avail of an opportunity after consultation with his experts to translate into everyday understandable language the officialese and gobbledegook and technical terms, &ldquo;milligrammes&rdquo; and &ldquo;millilitres&rdquo; in terms of pints and half-ones, as I said.  Obviously, the experts who brought out the report on drink and driving were able to do this. Dr. Hickey and others made a gallant effort to spell out in terms of drink and alcohol content what was involved.  I merely ask that the Minister would make a new endeavour to translate into terms of drink consumed what 125 milligrammes and 100 millilitres mean to the drinking public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are legislating here for the vast majority of our people who are partial to a drink.  We are imposing very severe penalties.  Any of us driving a car may be stopped by a garda and, if he has the slightest suspicion that we have drink taken, he may insist on our taking a breathaliser test, may insist on a urine test and may insist on our acquiescing to a minor operation in the form of the extraction of approximately an eggcup of blood from our veins.  In all the circumstances, the public are entitled to know just at what stage they transgress the law and <Col N="1511" /> what amount of alcohol renders them liable to all the very serious penalties under the Bill.  I have not mentioned at all the question of fines&mdash;the minimum is about £100&mdash;and the most important matter of the withdrawal of a driving licence.</P>
    <P>We are all with the Minister in his desire to eliminate death and accidents from the roads and we are all setting our faces sternly and uncompromisingly against the drunken driver.  I do not want to be interpreted as seeking to compromise the Minister one iota in regard to this matter but, if we are to win respect for this measure, it is vitally important that the public should be clear as to what is involved.  The public should be informed as fully as possible.  It is not good enough to leave the interpretation to doctors or lawyers.  We are legislating for the man-in-the-street, the man who enjoys his pint or his half-one when he can afford it.  The Minister has an obligation to spell out what is involved.  I appreciate the difficulty but he should spell out what is the average amount of drink, in terms of pints, whiskeys or gins, which brings one across the Rubicon as regards violation of section 28.  At what stage does one cross the Rubicon?</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that each person has to apply his own test.  The Minister even indicated that we should purchase stopwatches in order to see how long it would take us to consume so many pints, and all the other scientific devices that are involved.  Maybe our friends in the liquor trade would help us in this regard.  Certainly, we are grateful to Dr. Hickey and the other experts on the Commission for the information they have given in this regard but I feel that the Minister is evading his responsibility.  It is his duty.  It is we who are making the law in this House and if we are to win respect for that law, it must be clearly understood by the people what is involved.  It is not sufficient that we should argue among ourselves in a pub at night whether we have exceeded the 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood at any given time.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the invidious position <Col N="1512" /> in which we seem to be placing the Minister.  Nevertheless, I would ask him to reconsider that aspect of our query and consult again with his experts and bring back to this House an indication of what he considers the amount of alcohol, on average, that would produce the alcohol content referred to in section 28.  This is important if we are to win the support and co-operation of the public for this measure.</P>

I think that is not so.  It is clear from this report that the members of the Commission went abroad, to Switzerland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden and Denmark, and there consulted police officers, judges, medical men, who were intimately associated with this problem, and that they went to London and there took part in a seminar which was studying the same problem.</P>

      <P>Prior to the 1st May all employment of a casual nature otherwise than for the purposes of the employer's trade or business and otherwise than for the purpose of any game or recreation where the persons employed are engaged or paid through a club, was excepted from social insurance.

      <Col N="1533" /> Ordinary rate employment contributions, containing normal cover against unemployment, are payable in respect of female domestic servants employed in hotels and institutions and also in respect of male domestic servants wherever employed.</P>
    <P>Special rate contributions, value two shillings less than the ordinary rate for women, are payable in respect of female domestics employed in private service.  Prior to the 31st October, 1966, this class had no cover against unemployment. Since then, the lower rate of contribution applicable to them has included a specially reduced unemployment insurance element calculated to give title to unemployment benefit subject to satisfaction of a special additional condition related to the age and employment history of the claimant.  The position, therefore, in relation to females employed in private domestic service is that they are not debarred from unemployment benefit although they pay less than the full rate of contribution.</P>

      <P>In order to make satisfactory provision for a pension fund it is necessary to have a reasonably consistent body of membership and to be able to anticipate some consistency in income.

The British and Commonwealth Life Assurance Companies had investments in this country, at 31st December, 1965, equal to 60.5 per cent of the funds they hold to cover their liabilities to Irish policyholders. The present voluntary arrangement with the companies provides for a progressive increase in their investments here, so that they may achieve a total investment equal to 66? per cent of their liabilities to Irish policyholders by the end of 1969.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When I reported progress, I stated that I proposed to conclude my remarks on this amendment by referring again to the Commission on Driving While Under the influence of Drink or a Drug.  Deputy Booth stated that the members of this Commission did not have any practical experience of the difficulties involved in the offence with which we are dealing under this section &mdash;the offence of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle while impaired.  I want to put it on record that this Commission was composed of a number of very eminent and responsible people&mdash;the President of the High Court, the State Pathologist, the President of the Safety First Association, a number of medical practitioners, a superintendent of the Garda Síochána, district justices and civil servants.</P>
      <P>This Commission studied the whole problem very carefully from the date on which it was set up, 14th September, 1961, until the date on which it submitted its report, 15th May, 1963. During that period study groups from the Commission visited a number of continental countries where they contacted members of the police forces, members of the judiciary, chemists and others involved in this problem in those countries.  In addition, a study group visited London and attended the Third International Conference on Alcohol and Road Traffic.  Having done that, they came back and submitted a report to the Minister's predecessor which recommends the amendment which I put down to this section, and which opposes the section which is being insisted upon by the Minister. Therefore, I say it is very difficult to understand the Minister's attitude in refusing point blank to accept the the recommendations of this Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began my argument in favour of my amendment by referring to this Report and I wish to conclude by again putting on record that the Report to which I refer supports my argument and does not support the Minister's proposal as contained in the section. That, coupled with the discussion we have had over several hours on this amendment, should, I think, convince <Col N="1539" /> the Minister that, even at this stage, or certainly between now and the Report Stage of this Bill, he should reconsider the matter.  I think I am not unfair when I say it appears to me that I am not alone in being uncomfortable about the section as drafted.  I think there are Members on all sides of the House who believe that the section goes too far, is unnecessary and that as drafted, it will create serious difficulties for law-abiding, unimpaired motorists.</P>
    <P>I wonder what would be the position if on an amendment such as this the Minister were to have a free vote of the House.  Practically all that can be said has been said on this amendment. The strongest argument in its favour is the Report of the Commission.  It cannot be said that the members of the Commission had anything in mind other than a genuine and sincere effort to rid the roads of the motorists whose judgment is impaired due to the consumption of alcohol while at the same time preserving the rights and liberties of the individual and preserving the code of criminal law as it has been operated since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Fitzpartick said he was concluding and that he was provoked, I undertook not to provoke him into concluding again. By that I intended to indicate that I would not speak again.  I hope that in replying briefly to what he has just said, I shall not unnecessarily prolong the discussion on this section and this amendment.  I dealt with this question of the Commission's recommendation on this matter both on the last occasion when we discussed the section and in the debate on Second Reading.  In fact, in my introductory remarks on Second Reading.  I quoted this section from the Commission's Report and I think I should do so again.  The Commission said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any legislative changes are to be really successful and effective they must, in our view, have the support of the bulk of public opinion.  In countries where a certain blood-alcohol <Col N="1540" /> level has been prescribed as conclusive evidence of critical impairment, public opinion has, we believe, been conditioned, perhaps gradually, to accept the position. Here the whole procedure of taking and analysing blood samples and giving evidence of blood-alcohol levels in prosecutions would constitute an innovation in criminal procedure with which everyone concerned might take some considerable time to become familiar, as well as an interference with personal rights which public opinion might be still slower to accept as necessary or desirable.  It may be that, as a result of experience, public opinion would in the course of time be conditioned to accept and approve a prescribed level which would be conclusive evidence of impairment.  We doubt very much if the education of opinion on the matter has yet reached that stage.</P>
    <P>That was in 1963.  I went on, and I quote from my own speech in introducing the Second Reading of the Bill:</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that the support of the bulk of public opinion is extremely desirable for legislation of the kind now proposed.  There have, however, been developments since the Commission's Report.  World opinion has moved sharply against the drinking driver and the further studies undertaken since the report have confirmed very forcefully the importance of an objective test.  The increase in serious road accidents here has undoubtedly strengthened public opinion, and indeed I wonder if the Commission under-estimated the extent to which the public even in 1963 were prepared to support legislation designed to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Nobody can be under any illusion as to the concern of the public as regards the drinking driver or as to the intense desire of the vast majority of the public to have this danger eliminated from the roads.  I am perfectly convinced that the public are now in 1967, even if they were not in 1963, prepared to have this objective test provided for in order to go as far as possible in <Col N="1541" /> eliminating this danger.  I can only repeat that here the real division between us in on whether this objective test should be established.  If this is to be only <i>prima facie</i> evidence, if the scientific establishment of this level of blood-alcohol content is to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence, what is it to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of?</P>
    <P>It has been scientifically established that a blood-alcohol content of this level in practically all, if not in all cases, results in the serious impairing of a person's ability to drive.  I admit it has not been established in the case of every individual in the world, and I do not think it would be possible to establish that, but it has been established that in the vast majority of cases, and very possibly in all cases, this blood-alcohol content results in serious impairment of a person's ability to drive.  I am asking the House to make it an offence for a person to raise his blood-alcohol content to this level and proceed to drive.  That is the difference between us.  There is only one way of establishing blood-alcohol content and that is by scientific test.  It is impossible for a person to prove by any other type of evidence that his blood-alcohol content was not at this level.  That is the offence I am asking the House to create.</P>
    <P>It may be possible for him to prove to the satisfaction of an individual judge that he was not unfit to drive in so far as that particular individual trying the case understands what would establish fitness or unfitness to drive, but it is in fact impossible for him to disprove that he had this blood-alcohol content.  I am convinced on the basis of scientific evidence available that blood-alcohol content of this level constitutes in practically all cases impairment of the ability to drive.  I am asking the House to provide that people who impair their driving ability to that extent will not be allowed to drive legally on our roads.  Those are the facts of the situation.</P>

      <P>The next thing I want to say is that the Minister seemed to infer that the Commission, if they were reporting in 1966 or 1967, would have reported differently.  I want to say&mdash;I have to put this on the record again&mdash;that the only evidence I have is a statement made in public by Father Denis P. Kennedy, SJ, President of the Safety First Association of Ireland and a person whose name appears third on the list of the Commission Report. It is quite clear at the present time that Father Kennedy, who is President of the Safety First Association of Ireland&mdash;I think that is mighty important&mdash;still believes, not withstanding the lapse of time, that the recommendation of the Report is the correct recommendation and the correct way of dealing with this problem.  He cannot be regarded as irresponsible, as reckless, and certainly cannot be regarded as the advocate or the friend of the reckless or drunken driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> The last thing that the Minister said is that scientific tests have proved that a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood is evidence that a person is unfit to drive and that his judgment is impaired. I will stake my reputation on saying that the scientific test to which the Minister refers is no more and no less than <i>prima facie</i> rebuttal evidence that such a person is impaired or unfit to drive.  That is what my amendment seeks.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would like to say this very briefly on the section.  I think what I have to say might not have been relevant or in order on the amendment.  Section 28 proposes to create this new offence, that is, the offence of driving with a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. That is a new offence but it is an offence which will carry exactly the same penalty as the offence under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, of drunken driving.  It will carry the penalty of a substantial fine, imprisonment, if it is thought necessary, and consequential disqualification for 12 months.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case Deputy Briscoe mentioned this morning of a man who is charged with having this concentration of alcohol in his blood and who is brought before the court by a garda on that offence.  The garda gives evidence that, in his opinion, notwithstanding this concentration, the man was perfectly fit to drive a car.  He still must be convicted and he still must be fined.  More important, he still must lose his licence for 12 months. That is going to an altogether unnecessary extreme.  If the Minister intends to use his majority to put this section through the House, I sincerely hope he will give a discretion to the judiciary in certain cases not to disqualify a driver.</P>
      <P>That is an amendment I was thinking of for Report Stage, an amendment which would enable the justice, if he were satisfied that, notwithstanding the concentration mentioned, the accused person was not impaired, it should then not be obligatory on him to suspend the licence and this disqualification would not be consequential.</P>

      <P>I would like to add something to the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The attention of the House should be directed to this manifest inequality in the mandatory character of the penalty and the withdrawal of the licence.  I have had in my experience in public life a not inconsiderable number of cases in which a man's licence to drive was withdrawn, which meant acute temporary hardship when a man had no other means of earning his livelihood, than driving a vehicle as an employee of a transport company or carrying on his normal avocation, part of which was driving motor vehicles.  On the other hand, we have met persons who have been disqualified from driving, to whom the disqualification meant no more than the employment of a chauffeur for the period of disqualification.  It involved them in no inconvenience, in nothing other than having this man in constant attendance, but no more than that.</P>
      <P>It has always seemed to me that we did not have regard to that disparity of circumstances when we made this penalty of disqualification mandatory. I have often wondered if a district justice or a judge becomes satisfied in the course of proceedings that he is dealing with a dipsomaniac who will not reform.  He may say: &ldquo;I know it will be a great hardship on you in your circumstances to withdraw your licence; I know it will mean substantially depriving you of your means of livelihood; but your record and condition is such that you are not a suitable person to live with a licence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot remember a single case in which this House has made a penalty mandatory and withdrawn the discretion from the presiding judge which has not resulted in isolated cases of acute hardship which were certainly never present to us when the mandatory penalty was prescribed.  It is now obvious that we are extending the scope of offences which will give rise to this mandatory penalty from the case of the drunken driver to the incapable driver.  We are transferring substantially the obligation on to the driver to rebut this so-called scientific proof of his incapacity.  I wonder do <Col N="1546" /> Deputies want to withhold from the district justice or the judge a discretion as to whether in a given case incapacity as distinct from drunkenness has been proved within the terms of this Bill, and whether he should withdraw the driving licence as well as impose such other penalties as are required.</P>
    <P>I suggest that once we have diminished statutory drunkenness and included incapacity as defined in this Bill, it becomes doubly easy to return to the district justice's discretion to determine the question as to whether in a given case disqualification from driving is the appropriate penalty.  In fact, there may not be many of those cases to argue against our providing that, when the only provision we make is leaving it within the discretion of the judge who is actually hearing the case to decide what, in all the circumstances, it is just to do.  It is not an equal penalty to prescribe in the Bill for this new offence of statutory incapacity to say that everybody convicted under this section must lose his licence.  It is a different sentence to withhold the licence of a person whose livelihood depended on it.  It is no more than an inconvenience to such person as can afford to pay somebody else to drive.  That is something which should not be absent from the mind of the Minister when he considers the case put by Deputy Fitzpatrick in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have also dealt with this question of the same penalty being proposed for this new offence as is there already for the person who is convicted of an offence under the law as it exists.  We are discussing whether this is a lesser offence. I am unable to agree that it is a lesser offence.  It is at least equally serious and likely to have at least as serious consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the theoretical point made by Deputy Briscoe, and again referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick about a garda being compelled to prosecute a person whom he believes to be fit to drive, I think the normal person will agree that a garda who is so sure that a person is fit to drive will not go to the extent of bringing such a <Col N="1547" /> person to the station and conducting these tests which may establish that he is not fit to drive.  This is a scientific test and in any case I would believe it to be a more reliable test than the opinion that an individual garda might form as to the person's fitness.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Deputy Dillon that suspension of a person's driving licence very often involves severe hardship.  The possession of a driving licence is often a necessary thing to enable a person to earn his livelihood. This hardship often arises.  I agree it is a severe hardship but I cannot agree that it is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence.  You cannot utilise that fact, that the suspension of a driving licence may make it impossible for a person to earn his livelihood at his normal business, to permit people to earn their livelihood by unnecessarily endangering other people.  The penalty for the offence of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor is there as it exists at present.  But we all know that even the existence of this penalty&mdash;which can be very severe in certain cases&mdash;has not discouraged many people from committing the existing crime.</P>
    <P>I believe that in order to make it inadvisable for people to impair their driving ability in this way it is necessary that there should be a severe penalty, not primarily from the point of view of imposing this hardship on people but from the point of view of protecting the public and discouraging them from taking this risk, thus, as I say, protecting the public from people who will do this and would be more likely to take the chance if the penalty of the automatic suspension of driving licences did not apply. It is generally accepted that the suspension of the driving licence is appropriate to the offence, as it obtains under existing law.  I maintain that this new offence of driving while the ability to do so safely is impaired is of at least an equally serious nature and, therefore, the penalty should be the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is overlooking the essential element in <Col N="1548" /> this whole problem.  Surely Deputies are not dead to the fact that one of the legitimate provisions of the Constitution is that all men are equal before the law, that there should be the same penalty for everybody if they infringe the law.  Therefore, we ought to be very careful to ensure that the judiciary will measure the penalty in each case so as to maintain substantial equality between all.  That, then, is the ideal towards which we aim but, being practical men and women, we know that to attain to an absolute ideal is often simply impracticable. Therefore, in the other Road Traffic Acts we said that if a man is convicted of drunken driving, as defined, his licence shall be taken from him and it is mandatory that it shall be.  I think we went perhaps further than we ought to have gone in doing that.  There is not one of us who has not had cases brought to his attention.</P>

      <P>For a long time in England there was no Court of Criminal Appeal, but there was always the prerogative.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and I do not think there ought to be a prerogative.  We deliberately, consciously, and resolutely withdrew from the Minister for Justice the prerogative to restore a licence but we left the right to go to the circuit court.  My suggestion to the Deputy is this.  We ought to go as near as we can to refrain from mandatory penalties in that they do not bear equally on those on whom they fall. Say, for drunken driving, you lose your <Col N="1549" /> licence.  To most individuals in this House that simply means getting their sons to drive them or hiring a chauffeur for the period but a working man who earns his living is out of a job. He has to go home to tell the wife he cannot earn unless he can get work as an unskilled labourer, which he may not be able physically to do.</P>
      <P>All I am suggesting is&mdash;now that we are going a further step to create what Deputy Fitzpatrick described as a statutory offence of incapacity&mdash;should we not say, in respect of that, it is safe to restore to the courts the discretion which the courts normally have to prescribe such penalty as they think appropriate within the overall limits fixed by this Oireachtas, by statue? This is the kind of thing I have seen happen so often in this House and I believe Deputy de Valera is long enough here to share my experience. We take a step in one particular Bill to deal with one particular evil and we solemnly go on record as saying: &ldquo;We recognise this to be a serious breach of an important fundamental principle but the evil is so great we think ourselves justified in doing it&rdquo;.  All that is in the records of Dáil Éireann, in volumes 20 years ago, if anyone would look them up.  But 20 years later you find yourself confronted with the argument: &ldquo;But is that not there already; what are we trying to do now?&rdquo; and slowly we slip down the slippery slope, gradually losing our hold of the fundamentals until we do not know where we are going.  All I am saying to the Minister is that with regard to drunken driving, we accept it as an exception to the general rule and we prescribe a mandatory penalty.  We have in our own experience, even in that extreme case of drunken driving, seen what seem to be cases of grave hardship. Two men are put up, one after another, in the district court for precisely the same offence.  One loses his entire livelihood, the next man experiences a minor inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked in this new statutory offence which rests on what we are told and are expected to believe is scientific truth&mdash;I do not accept the infallibility of these scientific tests&mdash;<Col N="1550" /> to extend the same principle as we thought it right to extend to the ordinary offence, which we could test by the evidence of rational men as to whether a man was so drunk as to be unfit to drive a car.  Remember, we are not asking the House to make the maximum penalties which the court may in its discretion prescribe if a person is convicted of a statutory offence.  What I am suggesting to the Minister is that in respect of this new statutory offence we should simply give back to the courts the discretion we took from them in the case of demonstrable drunken driving, and it is good for the whole legal system that we should be on record as saying: &ldquo;Though we did concede the desirability of a mandatory penalty in regard to demonstrable drunken driving when we created the new statutory offence, we drew back that much; we restored to the court the discretion we took from them in the earlier Road Traffic Acts when we were dealing with the offence of drunken driving.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark you, I think the Minister is wrong when he says: &ldquo;I see no distinction between the quality&rdquo;&mdash;I think what he said was, between the gravity of the new statutory offence that is being created and the offence of drunken driving.  There may be no difference in the gravity but there is certainly a difference in the quality.  A man who sits into a car blind drunk in the ordinary meaning of the word&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will be safer than the man with the 125 milligrammes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and tries to drive a car manifests something approximating alcoholism.  He is a person habitually drunk or it would not occur to him to sit into his car and try to drive while he is drunk.  A man can easily commit this statutory offence without ever having been drunk in his life.  The net result may be perhaps very similar to the point of view of the man on the road and we must keep the pedestrian on the road constantly in our minds in considering this legislation.  I again appeal to the House: Do not let us go off the deep end on this; let us keep fundamental principles in proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> There is a difference in quality in this new offence we are creating and it is quite possible for a man to commit the offence we are now creating in this Bill who has never been drunk in his life.  Therefore, when the Minister says: &ldquo;I cannot concede for a moment that the gravity of the new statutory offence is less than the old offence of drunken driving&rdquo;, I want him to concede to me that there is a difference in quality.  It is on that distinction in quality that I ask the House to say: &ldquo;Now we are going to take a step back from the attitude we adopted <i>vis-à-vis</i> the judiciary in dealing with these offences.  We thought it right to leave no distinction where a man drove demonstrably drunk but we think it proper to restore the distinction where the offence is the statutory offence created by this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that from the point of view of enforcing new legislation of this kind which demands, for its success, pretty general support from the population as a whole, it will be greatly to his advantage if he meets the Opposition in some of these matters even if he has to come back in six months' time and say: &ldquo;Well, I allowed the arguments of the Opposition to weigh with me and manifestly the Opposition were mistaken, and I am coming back to the House now and saying the acceptance of your proposals has made the whole scheme fail to work&rdquo;.  I do not think any of us will need to hang our heads in shame if that should eventuate.  I certainly would not. I would be inclined to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You are deserving of all praise.  You showed due regard for the due process of law and, in your desire to maintain that, you find that in practice you have gone further than you wished to go and, in the light of experience, that we should have asked you to go and we are now prepared with virtual unanimity to agree that the more Draconian procedure was the right one&rdquo;.  I do not think, if the Minister meets us in these matters, that will in fact be his experience, but from the point of view of getting general support for reform of this kind, I urge on him that he would not go far wrong if he deliberately <Col N="1552" /> made certain concessions, even though he were a bit uneasy about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My natural inclination would be to go along with Deputy Dillon but I think he is missing a point of fundamental distinction in this.  If he will allow me to say so, I see an outmoded philosophy in the approach to the gravity of a crime behind some of his remarks.  The nature of a statutory crime of this nature is not a question of moral responsibility of the individual or the maintenance of equitable balances between members of the community.  The crime the Minister has provided for is a new crime, a new provision, to ensure that persons who are a potential danger to the community at large and to individuals who are likely to come in their path will be prevented from driving a motor car in circumstances in which they could do damage.  This is something where the interests of the community are present.</P>
      <P>On the question of rights, as the Minister says, there is no fundamental right to career around in a motor car to the risk of my neighbour.  There is, however, a right on the part of this House, acting for the community, to see that the interests of the rest of the community are protected.  We are then down to this fact.  Let us hasten to agree with Deputy Dillon on the fallacious approach to scientific tests that can be anything but infallible. I share his scepticism in that regard, perhaps surprisingly to him, but&mdash;and here is the &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;a large amount of experience has shown not only in connection with tests but in connection with commonsense and circumstantially and every other way that if an individual has consumed a certain amount of alcohol, in some cases a trivial amount, in exceptional cases a large amount, it is an undisputed fact that if a significant proportion of alcohol is imbibed of the order of a couple of whiskeys, then the reactions of that human being are affected and particularly affected in exercising the skill necessary in driving a motor car. I do not think even Deputy Dillon would controvert that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is so, the problem of the <Col N="1553" /> Minister is how to ensure that a person in that impaired condition will not drive.  The question of drunkenness, as the Minister has said, is beside the point.  That is a separate thing.</P>

      <P>I went further when speaking on the last day and said that it is quite possible that a man who is blind drunk is a lot safer than a man who is impaired at a certain level.  Therefore, I completely disagree with Deputy Dillon on his evaluation of the relative gravity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is not capitulation.  I would be a bit cynical about this, having seen in practice how these things work out.  On the question of the crime itself, the situation is perfectly clear.  I agree with Deputy Dillon on this.  If any mistake is made about this, it is the hedging about the scientific proof.  It seems to be implied&mdash;maybe I am wrong&mdash;<Col N="1554" /> that while scientific proof would be theoretically available, it would, in fact, be much more doubtful and that, therefore, scientific proof in this type of legislation should not be attempted.  Am I paraphrasing the Deputy properly?</P>

Having stated the only criterion, namely, the alcohol level, that seems to be feasible to capture this crime, it seems to me that any arbitrary test, whether it is a reliable test or a scientific test&mdash;and I share the Deputy's scepticism&mdash;is still sufficient for the purposes of this Bill, and it is on an average worked out that it is to be judged and not on its specific accuracy in a particular case.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;whose capacity to drive is impaired and as a result are a potential danger to other users of the road.  We are dealing with more than that.  In this section we are dealing at worst with a section of people whose judgment may be impaired, whose capacity may be impaired, and at best from the point of view of the general public, with a section of people whose judgment is probably impaired.  Even on the Minister's case, he does not say that everyone in whose blood there is a concentration of 125 to 100 is impaired.  At most the Minister will say that it is most likely that he is impaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the section after the amendment had been disposed of, I made a plea for the type of person who could satisfy a judge or a district justice, on medical evidence, that while <Col N="1555" /> he had the offending concentration of alcohol in his blood, his judgment was not impaired.  In such a case, the district justice should have discretion and should not be obliged to disqualify such a person from driving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this discussion away from the scientific and the academic, back to the practical. I took the opportunity of discussing this Bill with various groups I met in the past month.  The general feeling was that the drunken and incapable driver should be put off the road.  Some people did not understand this blood test.  They felt that, if it was a help, it should be used, but they all felt there was something unfair in it, particularly to the extent that it was mandatory on the courts to take away a person's driving licence.  I would say for all practical purposes it was accepted up to that point.</P>
      <P>If I serve any purpose here, it is to represent the views of those people as expressed to me.  It was mentioned early this morning that people who may be drunk would not be aware at what stage they exceeded the 125 mgs.  It was suggested that the onus should be placed on someone to indicate what amount of alcohol could be taken.  I feel that the manufacturing people might take that on, and perhaps some of them would suggest that four pints of their beverage would keep a person five or seven mgs. under that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the situation in which people are drinking and sliding into impairment.  There can be none of us here who has not on occasion found himself having to advise certain people not to drive their cars home on a particular night.  Those people were very drunk, or nearly very drunk, and it was easy to deal with the situation. A person who is in between the 100 to 125 or 130 is not drunk and may appear capable enough.  No one may think of advising them.  They may go on the road acting with full responsibility, and they may get into some difficulty and find themselves charged with this offence.  The point was made this morning that they are not aware of the situation and it would be harsh in those <Col N="1556" /> circumstances if a person lost his or her licence.  This should be left to the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>Again looking at it from the practical point of view, I am certain that it is most unlikely that any person will be tried for or charged with this offence alone.  There will be others tagged on. He will be charged with drunken driving, with careless driving, and with dangerous driving.  He will be charged with a whole litany of offences and the court will be given discretion in the matter.  If the courts decide this man was not drunk but that his driving was impaired, there should be a situation in which the punishment would be made to fit the crime.</P>
    <P>The other big problem I find from my experience of driving on the road is the man with the bicycle without any kind of light, particularly a rear light. I believe statistics will show that a number of people place themselves in danger, and I have no doubt that a number have been killed, just because they had not rear lights on their bicycles.  Then, at one stage, are we to make it mandatory on the courts to try such a man and to prescribe that such a man must not be allowed to ride a bicycle?  This is the one thing in my experience of driving I dread, particularly when one is approaching an oncoming car.  I urge the Minister to give the courts discretion in deciding what the penalty should be under this section.</P>

      <P>During the week in the <i>Evening Press</i>&mdash;on 22nd May to be exact&mdash;there was an article which caught my attention.  According to it, West German motorists will have to get drink and drive badges, if the Hanover traffic judge is to have his way.  He feels that individuals should be entitled to have their capacity tested to find out to what extent blood-alcohol content will impair their standard and the results should be stamped on their licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objections I have to the section is that it is proposing to find an average.  We do not know if we are averaging at the best or the worst. I do not believe we can average.  I also <Col N="1557" /> object to the mandatory suspension of licences.  The merits of capital punishment as a deterrent to murder are being considered by enlightened Ministers for Justice throughout the world and they are doing away with capital punishment without any adverse effects.  The effects of compulsory suspension of licences are, to say the least, most doubtful.  It has not been proved anywhere that the suspension of licences has improved the situation as far as road accidents are concerned. In my view, it lends itself to creating a much worse situation than exists before mandatory suspension comes in.  It lends itself to more people taking chances of driving without licence or insurance.</P>
    <P>This has been the experience in England.  A high number of drivers are known not to be covered by insurance. By trying to do away with the menace of the drunken driver and creating a new offence to make it more and more difficult for a drunken driver to appear on the road, what we are doing in effect is creating what will possibly be a worse situation in which a person, whether drunk or sober, who has an accident, would have no insurance and the other people involved in that accident will not thank the Minister one bit for creating such a situation in which more drivers are on the road without insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I suggest again that the Minister should give discretion to the courts. There are degrees of guilt in any offence under existing law or under this proposed new law, and the courts should have discretion.  As I pointed out the last day&mdash;had I known this would be taken today I would have been here earlier&mdash;people could continuously commit offences under this unknown to themselves.  They might be perfectly responsible, decent people, no threat to society, but because we decide to build up figures which are not intelligible to everybody, they might find themselves without licences.  I object very much to this compulsory suspension and I suggest the Minister should have another look at it.</P>

      <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;Let us retire from all this high theory of science and come down to practical facts.&rdquo;  I have had a lot more practical experience than even the learned doctor.  If the Minister thinks it strange to hear Deputy de Valera and myself arguing across the floor about the extent to which discretion should be left to the courts, he is mistaken.  Our argument is founded on the accumulated commonsense of generations of our people.  It is that the general principle ought to be that we in the Oireachtas prescribe what in our well-considered judgment is a crime, that we, in our well-considered judgment, after argument and debate, very often tedious, reach a consensus on the quality of the crime and prescribe the maximum penalty.  For Deputy Gibbons's benefit, I want to lay emphasis on &ldquo;maximum penalty.&rdquo; Then we hand the matter over to an absolutely independent judiciary, who are absolutely guaranteed against interference by us, for determination of the merits of the particular facts of the particular case brought before them as to what penalty should be imposed if the independent judicial tribunal is satisfied a crime has been committed.</P>
      <P>That is the general principle.  That principle is not founded on some daft scientific theory but on the experience of a free people trying to legislate for the common good in a way that will be consistent with the fundamental rights of the individual.  I speak not only from personal experience but from vicarious experience going back over hundreds of years&mdash;my father was a Member of the House of Commons and my grandfather was a Member of the House of Commons.  A hundred years ago it was unthinkable to prescribe a mandatory penalty and the whole public conscience would have been outraged if a mandatory penalty were prescribed, even for the most awful crime of all.  It was always kept in reserve as a royal prerogative to temper a mandatory penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there gradually began to come in&mdash;I think during the First World War&mdash;on the theory that a person was committing an offence against the <Col N="1559" /> safety of the State if he consumed too much sugar or offended against the Defence of the Realm legislation, this whole concept of mandatory penalty and it was accepted as a kind of concomitant, the kind of liability the individual citizen should be made to bear, bearing in mind that all the other citizens were out in the trenches fighting the war.</P>
    <P>Because people were carried away from the common experience of wisdom in these matters by the appeal to the supreme good of the community, this principle of mandatory penalty came in.  Deputy Gibbons and I, and Deputy Lemass and Deputy Fitzpatrick have seen in our personal experiences cases where we felt that the withdrawal of all discretion from the trial judge was not doing equal justice as between one offender and another.  It was exactly the same as convicting two men in the same court of the same offence and finding one man £10,000 and the other man 1/-. If any court in the country did that tomorrow, there would be an uproar. But if you bring in a lorry driver and convict him of drunken driving and if you bring in a millionaire and convict him of drunken driving a Rolls Royce, in effect you fine one a penny and the other his whole livelihood.</P>
    <P>We have agreed, with great reluctance on my part, in earlier Road Traffic Bills, to say in respect of the crime of drunken driving we are prepared to go to that length of these inequitable penalties.  Nobody ought to drive a motor vehicle when it is demonstrably obvious he is drunk.  If he has not sufficient intellectual capacity left to him to restrain himself, his friends ought, if necessary, restrain him by force and put him out of the car. We are now creating a new offence. I want to impress this on Deputy de Valera, because the Minister, I am afraid, has tried to close his mind against me.  I am not saying that the new offence is one of less gravity, but it is of a different quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not contesting that.  All I am saying is that the quality of the offence is different.  All I am asking is, not for a reduction in the penalties prescribed, but in the line of the quality of the offence to restore to the court what we have taken away from it.  This was beautifully illustrated on Monday on Telefís Éireann. Some colleague of Deputy Gibbons forgot his lessons in medicine.  He was summoned to a Garda station to test a man alleged to be drunk.  He asked him not to say but to spell &ldquo;British Constitution.&rdquo;  The fellow made the best fist he could of spelling &ldquo;British Constitution&rdquo; but he did not make a very good fist of it.  This was advanced in court as proof that he was drunk. That dark-haired fellow who conducts the programme on Telefís Éireann went out on to the streets of Dublin and stopped the first nine people he met.  Three of them spelled &ldquo;British Constitution&rdquo; correctly; three of them spelt it wrongly; and three of them said: &ldquo;There is a catch in this; I am not going to try.&rdquo;  Of course, the man who is blind drunk could not say &ldquo;British Constitution.&rdquo;  His tongue would get caught up in the poly-syllabic word.</P>

      <P>It might be too difficult. The man who commits this new statutory offence might well find himself able to say &ldquo;British Constitution&rdquo;, or to spell it, or to sing an aria from an opera, or to do anything else he is asked.  We are creating an entirely new statutory offence and I think the unique quality about it is that, wholly unconsciously, a man may be committing an offence who never was drunk in his life and who would have a strong moral revulsion from ever admitting to the fact that he could contemplate getting so drunk in the ordinary sense of the word as to be guilty of this crime.  I am only asking that in that context, not that we mitigate the penalty, not that we reduce the penalty, but that we restore to the judiciary the discretion we took from them when dealing with the grosser offence of driving while demonstrably, manifestly, in the ordinary sense, drunk.</P>
      <P>Now, I fully appreciate the difficulties of the Minister for Local Government. But I do urge on him that it is not good policy in legislation of this kind simply to dig your heels in and to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If everybody were reasonable, this <Col N="1562" /> would be a very much happier place than, in fact, it is.  But we are not perfect.  Human nature is not perfect, and the whole purpose of Parliament is to recognise that the rules of logic are not inflexible in dealing with our fellow men.  If everything could be worked according to logic, this House could be dispensed with.  We could install a computer, feed the facts into it and get law out at the other end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting to that stage, and I hope Deputy de Valera and I, from our opposite sides of the House, will combine to call a halt to that tendency.  Yet, from his lips I hear the rebuke that it would not be logical.  Of course, it would not be logical.  If I commit a venial sin today, must I, for the sake of being logical, commit a mortal sin tomorrow?  Am I not entitled to say that, having trespassed once, I am now resolved not to trespass any more?</P>
      <P>I admit that in the previous Road Traffic Acts for the grosser offence we did trespass on this fundamental principle of discretion in the judiciary.  I am now putting the case to this House that we are creating a new offence, an offence unknown in our law heretofore, an offence with the unique quality that the most conscientious citizen of this State could be guilty of without being aware of it, and that in those circumstances we ought to pull back and say, without regard to what we did in previous Road Traffic Acts, that here we call a definite halt and declare that in the circumstances of such an offence, it is essential for the protection of the humblest as well as the most powerful in the land, that the independent judiciary should be permitted to function again.  That is a case I believe Deputy de Valera agrees with but he does not think it is expedient on this occasion to add to his reputation as the traditional sore thumb from the Government back benches.  If there is any rebuke on the grounds of honesty, I direct it to Deputy de Valera for his failure to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this becomes a personal issue between Deputy de Valera and Deputy Dillon, I should like to say that I think Deputy Dillon is getting away from the basic fact of section 28, which is that this is a new offence on a purely scientific level.  It is not a question which we can equate with drunkenness simply because, I think correctly, the Minister has decided that the offence of carrying a quantity of alcohol in the blood is at least as serious as that of what we now know as drunken driving.</P>
      <P>I do not accept for a moment Deputy Dillon's suggestion that drunken driving is a gross offence, whereas the offence under section 28 is something slightly more respectable.  I feel very strongly that a person who is mildly inebriated may be far more dangerous than one who is grossly drunk because it is accepted that one of the first effects of imbibing alcohol is that one gets a feeling of well-being and a feeling of being much more competent than before.  Even Deputy Lemass in an intervention last week said that in certain circumstances he would regard it as quite a good thing to have a large whiskey before driving. A large whiskey before driving could easily give a driver a sense of elation and false confidence which would make him an unholy menace on the road, without his being drunk in any sense of the word, but simply because he overrates his own ability at that moment.  Alcohol does effect the self-critical qualities which we are supposed to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how we can have any question of the equality of the gravity of the offence arising under this section. Either the accused has that percentage of alcohol in his blood or he has not.  We have got to stick to this and, if we give a discretion to the court, while I agree with Deputy Dillon that it is unthinkable that one court could give two very different sentences in very similar cases, there is always a possibility that different courts in different parts of the country may interpret any discretion differently. One cannot have complete uniformity in that way and that can lead to injustice or certainly to a blow against <Col N="1564" /> overall equity.  Once we accept that this offence is purely the offence of having so much alcohol in the blood, no question of discretion then arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera and and Deputy Dillon can argue this out between themselves.  I cannot see how there can be.  You make a specific statutory offence.  Once you have broken the law, you have broken it. You can bring all sorts of questions of discretion in in other things but not in this one where it is purely a breach of a statutory requirement.  In the case of the customs regulations, you either comply with them or you break them; you either smuggle or you do not smuggle.  In this case you either consume sufficient alcohol to raise the alcohol content of the blood over the limit or you do not.  It is just as easy as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Any effort here to say that we are creating a fairly respectable offence as compared with the gross offence of drunken driving would do a great disservice to the whole question of road safety.  This is exactly as serious as drunken driving and in many cases it is more serious because a person is liable to drive faster in an elated condition than in a grossly drunken condition.  In a grossly drunken condition he would probably hit the wall before he got up any speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a case where I support the Minister absolutely.  I quite see with Deputy Dillon that it might be a very severe blow to, say, a lorry driver that he should lose his employment over a period by having his licence withdrawn. At the same time, a lorry <Col N="1565" /> driver should not be drinking while he is on duty and while he is off duty he should take reasonable precautions not to imperil his own livelihood.  You do not have to go that far for a drink. You do not have to drive to a pub for a drink.  There are very few people who cannot walk the necessary distance to get all the drink they want. If a man goes out and has a few drinks and insists on taking his car with him and then puts the community in peril of their lives by reason of his over-consumption of alcohol he has nobody to blame but himself if he and his family suffer by reason of his losing his job.  I know it is a hard thing to say but I think it should be said.</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate also that there may be differences of circumstances.  It may be possible for a man of ample means who has lost his licence to employ a driver.  At the same time, that man should be put off the road and the blow to his self-esteem will hurt very badly.  I have had one experience of reporting a case of dangerous driving which resulted in the driver being put off the road.  I know that that hurt him very much more than the £50 fine which was imposed at the same time.  It would be a blow to any of us if we had to face our friends and say: &ldquo;I am not allowed to drive.&rdquo;  It would be a fearful blow to our self-esteem.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is going to come as a surprise to anyone.  It is up to us to make sure that it does not.  Everyone in public life must broadcast this information at every conceivable opportunity: the Government, in the name of the community, are going to act strictly and firmly to stop this question of driving when one's judgment is impaired in any way.  None of us would be happy, when cold stone sober, getting into a car being driven by somebody who had recently consumed a number of drinks.  We would not be happy if we thought Aer Lingus pilots were being allowed to take off with us in the plane if they had alcohol in their system.  We have tremendous confidence knowing that an Aer Lingus pilot or, in fact, the pilot of any responsible airline, or the driver of any responsible bus company, will <Col N="1566" /> not be allowed to take charge of a plane or a bus if his judgment is impaired in any way.  But the driver of a private car can do every bit as much damage to human life and limb in a very short time.  He may not be able to knock off 35 people, but there have been cases of very serious accidents which have involved well over the dozen, caused by people who made an error of judgment due to their lack of capacity to drive.</P>
    <P>I would stick with the Minister absolutely on this.  I know it is going to hurt people but I am afraid there is no alternative.  However, I do say again there is no necessity for anyone who has to take a car on the road to take drink before driving.  Deputies may say it will spoil the evening, but that is not point at issue.  Are you going to kill somebody or kill yourself?  The casualty figures are far too frightening to allow any discretion in this matter. Let us be consistent.  Let us be resolute and let us make it absolutely clear to people driving that they drive at peril of losing their licence, at the very least, if they are found to have an alcohol content over the prescribed limit, which, I agree with the Minister, is, if anything, on the high side.  In fact, it is quite obviously on the high side.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Commission has gone further, and the Minister has gone further than that.  I am saying that it is obvious, therefore, that this may be a lesser offence and that discretion should be given to the district justice to treat it as a lesser offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must criticise, when speaking on the section, the method of introducing what the Minister has now called a new offence, because we simply introduce <Col N="1568" /> a new offence of a different type by adding on to section 49 of the 1961 Act, which is perfectly clear, the words &ldquo;or while there is present in his body a quantity of alcohol such that, within three hours after so driving or attempting to drive, the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood&rdquo;. If this new offence had to be created, it should have been created by a completely new section and discretion of the type for which I have been asking should be given to the district justice; if the justice were satisfied that, notwithstanding the concentration of alcohol complained of, the man was fit to drive, he should not be punished in the same way as the statutory drunk under section 49 (1).</P>
    <P>That is why I say we are dealing here with what, at worst, can be a lesser offence than the statutory drunken driving offence under section 49 (1).  I have never had brought home to me more forcibly the value of a protracted debate on a matter like this, because it appears that it is almost impossible to say everything that might be said or to get every thought that might be expressed on a matter like this.  I am convinced that if the Minister thinks again on this&mdash;I shall not even rely on Deputy Dillon's reference to &ldquo;quality&rdquo;&mdash;he will realise there can be an essentially different kind of offence.  Under section 28 a man can be convicted whether he is impaired or not, if he has that concentration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said already, this whole question of making the punishment fit the crime is essentially a question of what standard we should take, whether we take the standard of hardship on the person who commits the crime or of the injury to the victim of the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with some Deputies is, apparently, that while they agree in theory with every possible step being taken to make the roads safe, to deal with road accident problems, they recoil from the consequences of these measures.  Deputy Dillon, at the outset, argued that the penalty for a crime should be the same for all, and that is <Col N="1569" /> exactly what the section provides, that all justices will impose the suspension rather than that some justices will impose it and some will not.</P>
    <P>In regard to this provision for the present offence, which is an offence which cannot be established with the same degree of certainty and uniformity as this proposed additional offence, Deputy Dillon says we should not automatically continue it because it is there already.  I agree with that, but I maintain that this new offence is of such gravity that it is required in the public interest that a person who commits the offence should be effectively prohibited from doing it again for a specified period.  It may be severe on the individual who breaks the law, but the important thing is to protect the public.  This sanction against the wrongdoer is necessary in order to discourage this type of action.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can dispute the fact that the public demand this type of protection and I think it is a reasonable demand.  The Oireachtas has already conceded this protection to the public and I am not prepared to take it away from them.  This mandatory suspension of a driving licence for the present offence has been in existence for some time and it has not been noticeably effective.  Deputy Dillon argues that this new offence is of a different quality from the offence already there under existing law.  That may be, but I certainly cannot agree that it is of a less reprehensible quality. In fact, I think it very well may be more reprehensible.  The drunken driver, as we understand the term at present, may be incapable of reasoning intelligently at the time he commits the offence of driving his car, or attempting to drive it, while in this condition; but the person who is not drunk, but who has consumed alcohol to the extent specified in this section, will be more keenly aware of the fact that he is at least taking a serious risk of breaking the law.  In my opinion, this new offence will certainly not be of a less reprehensible quality than the present one.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy, in referring to the severity of the hardship that may be imposed on people by this mandatory suspension of driving <Col N="1570" /> licences, adverted to the fact that there is a provision whereby a court, when making a disqualification order, may postpone the operation of the order for a period up to six months, and, in doing this, the court must take into account the personal circumstances of the defendant, including the nature of his employment.  This, of course, does not remove the extra hardship involved for some people but it does at least give the court discretion to allow the person concerned to make other arrangements, if it is possible to make them.  It gives him reasonable time in which to do that.  If it is not possible to make other arrangements in regard to his employment, then the person has to recognise the fact that the crime which he committed, of his own free will, is of such a nature, and this is something he should have realised beforehand, as to involve these consequences, consequences which, in his particular case, necessitate a change of employment to an employment which will not entail his doing something he has proved himself unworthy to do, namely, to drive a vehicle on the public road.</P>
    <P>People whose employment necessarily involves them in driving a vehicle have a special responsibility to ensure that they do not render themselves liable to this penalty.  It is a very serious thing to drive a vehicle on the public road and people who have to do so in pursuit of their livelihood should appreciate the seriousness of doing it and should appreciate more than others their responsibility to ensure that, when they drive on the public road, they are in a fit condition to do so.  I can see no justification for asking me to remove this protection which the public have had up to now, a protection they have had by virtue of the fact that there was an insistent demand from the public that those who committed this crime of driving a vehicle when not in a fit condition to do so should have their permission to drive such a vehicle withdrawn, at least for a certain specified time.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said the mandatory quality of the penalty prescribed for drunken driving has not had the effect desired.  I want to make this clear: Deputy Fitzpatrick and I have repeatedly said here today that we regard both the old offence under the 1961 Act and the proposed new offence of driving in an exalted state of mind as very grave offences which, we are agreed, must be brought under control.  But there surely is a difference in quality between the offence of getting footless drunk into a car and the offence which one can commit without being aware that one is committing it.</P>

      <P>That is because the the Deputy is persuaded of the absolute validity of logic.  I am not: I do not think logic matters so much.  I think we made a mistake in leaving it to the judiciary in the first instance, but I understand how it came to pass and, when I hear the Minister say that this was done as a result of a general outcry from the public, it brings my mind back to the atmosphere of the 1914-1918 war: every outrage on public liberty is done at the clamorous outcry of an outraged public.</P>
