    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Taoiseach whether it has now become accepted practice for the Attorney General to ask for specific minimum sentences, including the suspension of driving licences, where appropriate; and, if not, why an exception was made in the case of the NFA road traffic prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice of the Attorney General to ask for specific minimum sentences and this was not done in the cases referred to in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Surely the Taoiseach must be aware that in certain of the prosecutions brought against farmers arising out of the road blockade superintendents and prosecutors demanded, or requested, that the driving licence of the people prosecuted should be suspended.  Would the Taoiseach agree that that did, in fact, happen?  If it did happen, is it, as he appears to admit, a complete <Col N="2" /> departure from the established practice in this country, to leave the penalties to the courts within the limits prescribed by statute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases State solicitors did request the justice to suspend driving licences.  The Deputy will remember that the prosecutions against the members of the NFA arose out of concerted action which gave rise to multiple offences and prosecutions and the Attorney General thought that that fact merited special consideration. In these circumstances he considered it proper to give directions to ensure that these cases were presented in a uniform way and that the attention of the court should be directed to the provisions of section 31 of the Road Traffic Act, which provides for suspension of licences in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, and as I think I told him last week, it is the practice for practitioners in the law courts to press their cases in the optimum way possible and whether it is <Col N="3" /> on behalf of the Attorney General or on behalf of a private citizen, the justice or judge is in no way bound to accept the contention put forward on behalf of a plaintiff or prosecutor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Taoiseach will admit that it has never been the practice in this country, at least in our system of criminal law, for the prosecutor to demand a jail sentence, or to demand a specific minimum sentence such as disqualification from driving. The Attorney General has always been satisfied to let the courts know that he takes a serious view of a specific offence and to leave it to the courts to mete out punishment within the limits prescribed by statute.  Will the Taoiseach agree that these prosecutions were brought weeks after an isolated demonstration by the NFA and in some cases a month after the offence was committed and that there was no repetition or threat of repetition? I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should realise that that is the sort of thing that encouraged the situation to get out of hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Might I now suggest to the Taoiseach that, in future, prosecutions be conducted in the normal way, in accordance with tradition and precedent here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refute again emphatically that the Attorney General requested minimum sentences in these cases.  I want to reiterate that he directed the attention of State solicitors to section 31 of the Road Traffic Act, for the purpose of ensuring that the cases be presented in a uniform manner.  There were several hundreds of these cases.  Might I again suggest to the Deputy that in his own experience he must realise it is often more than a month, and more than two months, that prosecutions are brought in the district court arising out of summary offences and that there was nothing whatever unusual <Col N="4" /> about these cases; often a month or five or six weeks elapse.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our application for entry into the EEC was made without reservation, and that means without reservation with regard to the economic and political obligations concerned. We will, of course, seek certain transitional arrangements in relation to economic matters.  There is nothing whatever about neutrality or about political unity in the Treaty of Rome and in fact, the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; does not appear in the Treaty <Col N="5" /> at all but it is obvious that by means of this economic unity it is proposed to advance to a formal political unity. But the formal political unity has not yet been worked out amongst the existing members of the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of people at work in the State in (a) 1951 and (b) 1966; and what further action the Government are taking or intend to take since a reply of 17th November 1966 to provide work for Irish people at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of persons at work in the State in 1951 was 1,217,100 and the corresponding figure for 1965 is estimated at 1,050,000.  The preliminary estimate for 1966 is not yet available.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the replies given by the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries, Lands, and Industry and Commerce to similar questions on Thursday last, the 2nd March, 1967.  More especially, the provision of increased employment will depend on our success in achieving a higher degree of economic development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not realise that there are now 70,000 fewer people at work in Ireland than there were in 1951?  In view of the fact that the previous Taoiseach promised 100,000 new jobs, and unemployment is now standing at almost 64,000, could the Taoiseach tell us if there is any hope or what policy the Government have to provide work for these unfortunate people at the present time?</P>

In many cases the assumptions can only be made on the basis of existing circumstances.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> Under the Housing Act, 1966, each housing authority is required to draw up a scheme of priorities in the allocation of houses, having regard to the circumstances in their districts.  The existing regulations will cease to have effect when such a scheme comes into force in an area.  It will be open to authorities in whose areas retired members of the Defence Forces require to be rehoused to make appropriate provision in their new scheme of priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any inconvenience, delay or expense is occasioned by the manner in which the registration of title system is at present operated.  The policy of having a central office and local offices of the Land Registry is provided for in a recent enactment of the Oireachtas, namely, the Registration of Title Act, 1964, which came into operation on 1st January of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central office is the office for the registration of all land in the State.  The functions of the local offices are as prescribed by Rules made by the Registration of Title Rules Committee, with my concurrence. Each local office provides separate registers of freehold and leasehold land registered in the particular county.  The local registrar transmits to and receives from the central office documents connected with registration.  The local office is a very valuable facility for registered <Col N="26" /> owners and their solicitors in that they may inspect the registers of land in their area and also lodge with the local office all applications in connection with registration.</P>
    <P>I see no reason to alter a policy and practice which have existed since the registration of title system was first introduced in 1892.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any allegations that have been made recently seem to be to the effect that all coursing is cruel and should be prohibited.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Animals Acts, 1911, and 1965, contain express provisions allowing coursing.  The question of coursing was discussed at some length in the Seanad during the debates on the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 1963. That Bill, which became the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965, was a Private Members' Bill, promoted on behalf of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  The Bill did not seek to do away with coursing although the subject was mentioned in the debates.</P>
      <P>The law provides adequate penalties for cruelty to animals generally and the Garda have from time to time prosecuted persons for cruelty arising out of the so-called &ldquo;blooding&rdquo; of greyhounds.  If specific allegations of cruelty are brought to the notice of the Garda, no doubt they will take appropriate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the undoubted costs being borne by several competing companies at the moment in underwriting rather expensive advertising campaigns?  Is he further aware of the tremendous cuts in cost which have occurred in Britain over the past week?  Is he satisfied that the situation of the prices here is as a result of genuine competition between different companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in regard to the cuts that have taken place in other places, I understand they are to a large extent based on regional variations. In other words, where costs can be cut in regard to the transporting of petrol in certain regions, this cut is being passed on to the consumer.  This is not being done in this country. Indeed, it is doubtful if it is something that should be pushed too far.</P>
      <P>As regards how much money goes in advertising, this of course is a very debatable proposition because, as we know, advertising itself may well lead to the greater use of the commodity, and advertising agents exist because it is believed their activities increase the consumption of a commodity rather than add to the overheads.  Furthermore, I would point out to the Deputy that one of the larger companies operating in this country has not increased its prices apart from increases imposed by taxation, since August, 1958, and has in fact decreased its prices on six different occasions.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 14 to 25 and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) taking all the controlled dwellings, of which he is landlord&mdash;</P>

      <P>(II)  during the period of six years ending on that date, he has expended a sum exceeding two-thirds of that aggregate.</P>
      <P>on maintenance such as is referred to in the paragraph of all or any of the dwellings,</P>
      <P>the paragraph shall apply in respect of the controlled dwelling unless it is a dwelling for the repair of which he is not liable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage there was a discussion on an amendment I moved to enable landlords of large blocks of property, who had been keeping the property in good repair, to qualify for the 15 per cent increase on the basic rent, provided that they had spent the prescribed sums in relation to the aggregate of the basic rents of their dwellings, on repairs in the period 1960 to 1966.  My thinking in moving the amendment was that it would be unreasonable to insist on itemised evidence in the case of large properties where landlords did, in fact, carry out these repairs but due to the varied nature of the work did not have itemised accounts in each case.  I held to that view in the course of the discussion but I think Deputies O'Higgins and Fitzpatrick were very <Col N="39" /> strongly of opinion that while there was merit in it in the case of large landlords, it should not be the case where smaller landlords with a small number of houses were concerned and that these landlords should be able to itemise repairs.  The danger in the amendment I moved on Committee Stage was that in such a case the increase might apply to a tenant in respect of whose house no repairs had been carried out.</P>
    <P>I promised to look into the matter and decided that the best way of meeting it would be to specify a limit.  I am specifying, therefore, in the amendment that to benefit from the provision the landlord must have more than 300 dwellings let.  Landlords with estates over that number will have the benefit of the provision for the reasons I have given but under that figure the obligation is on the landlord to prove in respect of each tenant that the work was carried out to the extent necessary to qualify for the increase.</P>
    <P>The second point made in this discussion in Committee was that the amendment would permit the landlord even though he might not be liable for repairs to a house, to increase the rent provided he had spent money on houses where he was liable for repairs. I accept the validity of this point also, although in the case of the large estates we are discussing there is no case where the landlord is not liable for repairs.  The present amendment provides that the new provision cannot be availed of unless the landlord is liable for repairs.</P>
    <P>The third point raised in this debate on the Committee Stage was that where, in fact, a landlord had not carried out repairs to a particular house in the estate that particular tenant should not be liable to pay the 15 per cent increase on the basic rent.  I am satisfied after this further examination that it would be undesirable to have such a provision and I think the limit we have set of 300 houses and above it will provide a safety margin. We can take it as a matter of fact that any landlord dealing with property to <Col N="40" /> the extent of 300 or more houses will, for his own very good reasons, maintain a sufficient repair and maintenance organisation.  He will want to ensure that the houses in which he has equally a vested interest with the occupier will be kept in good repair. Broadly speaking, I think I have met with this amendment the views expressed in the Committee Stage and I ask the House to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has modified considerably the amendment as compared with the amendment which was produced on Committee Stage and, to the extent that he has modified it, I think this is a considerable improvement.</P>
      <P>Just so that we may get our minds on to what is involved here, it was suggested by the Committee Stage amendment, which the Minister proposed, that, where a landlord was a landlord of a plurality of properties, of more than one property, if he carried out the repairs to the prescribed minimum value within the prescribed period, he would be entitled to increase the rent on all properties and that was there, <i>simpliciter,</i> whether or not he had done repairs to a particular property and even, as I suggested on Committee Stage, if his arrangements with the tenants were such that he was not responsible for the repairs to some of the properties. It was pointed out that a landlord might have as many as half a dozen properties in different parts of the city and that he might spend a considerable amount on the repair of one of those properties alone and would therefore be entitled, under the Minister's amendment, to increase the rent of all properties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made it clear that he was not thinking in terms of a landlord who owned maybe up to a dozen properties but that he was thinking in terms of the kind of estate landlord who had an interest in several hundred houses, who maintained a proper maintenance unit and who kept the property under repair, going on right through the year, from week to week and from month to month.  He made it <Col N="41" /> clear that, from information he had obtained, in the case of these concerns it had not been the practice to keep detailed schedules of repairs relating them to individual properties.  I accepted on the Committee Stage that that was the position in relation to the estate landlord, to describe him as that for want of a better word.  But I did see two dangers.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick of Dublin who suggested the compromise that the Minister might reconsider the matter and introduce an amendment on Report Stage which would make it clear that this particular operation would be limited to these cases of the estate landlord who had several hundred houses.  The Minister indicated that he would consider that favourably. I felt there were still two dangers, one of which was that, if an amendment were passed in that form, even though regulated as regards the number of dwellings to the higher category, there was still the danger that some tenants, who, by reason of their agreement with their landlords were themselves responsible for their own repairs, would find themselves billed with an increase in rent because other property of the landlord was repaired.</P>
    <P>I suggested there was a second point the Minister should look at.  I think he has dealt fairly with the case up to this, that is, with the first points that were made to him.  The second danger I saw was that unless the Minister were prepared to modify his proposal, making it clear in some way that if it could definitely be established that repairs were not done, that not one penny of repairs were done on a particular house, the tenant in question should not become liable for an increase in rent and that, unless we did that, we should still be falling short of what was required.  That is still my view.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, under the proposal the Minister has introduced now, a situation can arise&mdash;I am nearly certain it will arise&mdash;where the rent will be increased on some tenants to whose houses no repairs at all have been carried out.  The tenant, for example, who keeps a house, the subject <Col N="42" /> of the tenancy, and who himself takes a certain amount of trouble with it, who takes pride in the house and carries out small repairs that may be necessary and relieves the landlord of the burden of doing that type of small repair, will now find that his rent can go up even though the landlord has not spent a penny piece on repairs as I understand that the whole principle in this section is to relate the rent increases to repairs carried out.  There is machinery in the Bill&mdash;indeed, it was in the 1960 Act as well&mdash;whereby the landlords can find the increases taken off them if the repairs are not carried out so that clearly the principle is to relate the rent increase to the repairs carried out.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested in this amendment that that principle is all right, so far as the small man is concerned. However, in the case of the big landlord, it does not matter whether he actually repairs particular houses or not, provided he has spent the prescribed minimum within the prescribed time over the entire of the property.  I know that the Minister is trying to be fair in this.  I appreciate the problem of these landlords.  I imagine that the legislation envisaged in this particular amendment should be purely temporary because I think they should be put on notice that in future they will be required to schedule in some way the houses on which repairs are carried out.  If the Minister agrees with me that something like that could be done, that they would be put on notice, I would think that it would not cause hardship to them if the Minister were also to except from this amendment the cases of houses where it is admitted by both sides&mdash;where it is claimed by the tenant and admitted by the landlord&mdash;that no repairs were carried out.  In such a case, I would suggest that the tenant should not find himself liable for the increase.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the case where the landlord is not making any case that repairs may have been carried out to a house but, unfortunately, in the absence of a system of listings these repairs might have been forgotten. I am talking about the case <Col N="43" /> where it is conceded on both sides that no repairs were carried out.  In such a case, I think the principle enshrined in the Bill dealing with the repairs&mdash;in other words, that increases should be related to repairs&mdash;should prevail.  I would strongly urge the Minister that in those cases the principle should be adhered to.</P>

      <P>At this stage, having regard to the fact, of which I am satisfied, that these itemised accounts were not carried out by these people during the period in question, 1960 to 1966, I prefer to leave the amendment as it stands, but I shall certainly bring it to the notice of the companies concerned&mdash;there are very few of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Road Traffic legislation was last <Col N="45" /> considered by the Oireachtas in 1961. The Bill which became law in that year as the Road Traffic Act, 1961, was a comprehensive measure.  It brought up to date and consolidated all existing legislation dealing with road traffic but it also introduced many new provisions, such as those for speed limits and driving tests. Deputies may well ask, therefore, why it is necessary for a Minister for Local Government to come before the House again some 5½ years later with a new Road Traffic Bill which is designed to make extensive amendments in the 1961 Act.  I should say at the outset that I am fully aware that legislation alone will not solve our road traffic problems, but without up-to-date legislation the work of all those concerned with road traffic may well be frustrated or even negatived.</P>
    <P>The necessity for the amendment of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, arises mainly out of the Report of the Commission on Driving While under the Influence of Drink or a Drug which was presented to my predecessor in 1963.  The establishment of this Commission was decided upon following the debates in this House on the provisions of the 1961 Act relating to drink and driving.  Deputies may recall that in the course of those debates an amendment was moved which sought to make provision for blood tests and to fix a specific limit for the alcohol content of the blood.  I think I can say that the reaction of Deputies to that proposal was in general favourable though some did not, of course, agree with the details.  The then Minister indicated that, while he appreciated the arguments advanced in favour of the proposal, he could not accept it without having its full implications exhaustively examined and he therefore undertook to set up a Commission to examine the various technical, constitutional, social and administrative problems involved.</P>
    <P>Arising from this undertaking, a Commission under the chairmanship of the then President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Cahir Davitt, was established in September, 1961, with the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> To investigate and to report on the feasibility of fixing a standard, by reference to the alcohol-content of the blood or by any other test, as constituting drunkenness for the purpose of the offence of drunk-driving and the legislative measures which might be taken to deal with the offence of driving, attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle in a public place while under the influence of drink or a drug, including the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  objective tests of drunkenness,</P>
    <P>(b)  graded offences, according to the degree of drunkenness,</P>
    <P>(c)  penalties, and</P>
    <P>(d)  method of trial and court procedure generally.</P>
    <P>The Commission reported in May, 1963, and the report was published in October of that year.  The main recommendations are summarised in the appendix to the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with this Bill.  When the report was published, it was announced that the Government, while accepting in general the import of the Commission's recommendations, wished to consider further specific aspects of these recommendations, in particular, whether a blood-alcohol level of 125 milligrammes should be taken as absolute proof of the commission of an offence related to drink and driving and not merely <i>prima facie</i> evidence as recommended by the Commission.</P>
    <P>It was also announced at that time that the Minister would be prepared to consider any views which interested persons might wish to put forward and, in response to this invitation, some 18 submissions were received and examined.  The Government have given full consideration to the recommendations of the Commission and the views submitted by interested parties and Part V of this Bill is intended to give effect to these recommendations, subject to certain modifications which I shall mention later.</P>
    <P>At this stage I feel sure that the House would wish me to pay tribute to the members of the Commission. Their report is, I think, a model one <Col N="47" /> and, in itself, is evidence, if such were needed, of the careful and diligent fashion in which the Commission carried out its duties.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the subject and because of the public interest it has aroused, I propose to depart from the usual practice by first discussing the provisions of Part V of the Bill, the greater part of which is concerned with the problem of drink and driving.</P>
    <P>A prohibition on the driving of vehicles while under the influence of drink has been provided for by law for almost a century.  None of the statutes dealing with mechanically propelled vehicles enacted prior to 1933 contained any specific provision on the subject of drunken driving.  Cases of that kind were dealt with under the Licensing Act, 1872, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that any person who is drunk while in charge on any highway or other public place of any carriage or steam engine was liable to a penalty not exceeding 40/- or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment with or without hard labour for up to one month.  The Road Traffic Act, 1933, contained stronger measures to protect the public against the drunken driver. It introduced a new offence of driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while incapable of exercising effective control over the vehicle through having consumed intoxicating liquor or taken drugs.  Being drunk in charge of a vehicle or driving or attempting to drive an animal-drawn vehicle or pedal cycle continued to be dealt with as previously under the Licensing Act, 1872.</P>
    <P>The provisions of both the 1872 Act and the 1933 Act relating to drink and driving were replaced by sections 49 and 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961. Under these sections, it is an offence to drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle or to be in charge of a mechanically propelled <Col N="48" /> vehicle in a public place while unfit to drive through drink or drugs.  In addition, penalties were substantially increased. The wording of these sections was intended to make it perfectly clear that in order to commit an offence a person need not be drunk in the socially accepted sense.  These changes in the law, however, have not been as effective as was intended and, as the Commission in its report states, it is on the whole probable that under the present system many persons who would deservedly be convicted if there were a fixed standard of incapacity are now acquitted.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1961 the Statistics of Road Accidents in Ireland issued annually by the Garda Síochána contained figures for the number of accidents in which alcohol was considered to be the primary contributory factor.  For the years 1958 to 1960, these figures show that between 4 per cent and 5 per cent of fatal accidents and just over 2 per cent of all accidents were primarily attributed to this cause. However, it is clear that these statistics substantially understated the extent to which drink is a factor in road accidents mainly because, in the absence of any fixed standard of incapacity to drive, only those accidents in which one or more of the persons involved was considered to be clearly intoxicated were attributed to alcohol.  In addition, it was extremely difficult to obtain information as to the condition of the driver in cases where he was either killed or removed to hospital. For these reasons, these statistics were not compiled after 1960.  Irish statistics are not by any means unique in tending to underestimate seriously the real position; it appears to be generally accepted that official statistics in many countries have a built-in tendency to do so.  Figures prepared for the Commission by the Garda Síochána showed that, in 1960, 88 of the persons involved in the 294 fatal accidents had some drink taken.  This alone would seem to indicate that drink plays a more prominent part in causing road accidents than the statistics published prior to 1960 would suggest.</P>
    <P>Abroad, surveys have been conducted <Col N="49" /> on what I might term a grand scale to determine the part that drink plays in road accidents.  The most recent and most comprehensive of the studies made abroad was that made under the direction of Professor Borkenstein of Indiana University in the City of Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.  The results of this survey show that the average risk of being involved in an accident for drivers as a whole increases as the concentration of alcohol in the blood increases beyond about 40 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood and that above a concentration of about 80 milligrammes the risk increases rapidly.  The survey also confirmed that accidents in which alcohol plays a part are more likely to be more serious.</P>
    <P>Studies on this scale have not been conducted here, but it is reasonable to assume, as our Commission did, that drinking and its effects on human behaviour in this country are a phenomenon which can hardly differ significantly from similar phenomena in other countries.  Such investigations as have been made here confirm that drink does play a significant part in road accidents.</P>
    <P>The results of the Grand Rapids Survey were not available to the Commission on Driving While Under the Influence of Drink or a Drug but they considered the results of a great many other important investigations on the subject of drink and driving. The conclusions which had been reached following these investigations, which are entirely consistent with the results of the Grand Rapids Survey, were summarised by the Commission as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Alcohol is a significant factor in a considerable proportion of road accidents and particularly in fatal accidents.  Drivers who had recently consumed alcohol are significantly over-represented in the accident group.</P>
    <P>(2)  Of drivers involved in accidents after taking drink, a relatively high proportion have high blood-alcohol levels.</P>
    <P>(3)  The risk of being involved in <Col N="50" /> an accident increases greatly as the blood-alcohol level rises.  Both drivers and other road users become less skilful and more accident prone at the same blood-alcohol level.</P>
    <P>Numerous experiments have been conducted by experts in various countries to assess the effects of alcohol on driving performance.  The overwhelming conclusion reached in these experiments is that relatively moderate concentrations of alcohol affect driving performance critically, irrespective of individual tolerance to alcohol.  For example, a special committee of the British Medical Association reported in 1960 that it was &ldquo;impressed by the evidence of the rapidity with which driving ability deteriorates, even in the most hardened drinkers and the most experienced drivers, at concentrations of alcohol in the blood in excess of 100 mg&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1965 they felt that, in the light of more recent research, this figure should be revised downwards to 80 mg.  The Committee could not conceive &ldquo;of any circumstances in which it could be considered safe for a person to drive a vehicle on the public roads with a level greater than 150 mg.&rdquo;  Even in regard to relatively low concentrations of alcohol in the blood, the consensus of opinion is that some impairment sets in at an early stage and that there is no threshold for sudden deterioration &mdash;impairment develops progressively as the dose of alcohol increases.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to discuss the effectiveness of the present statutory provisions on drunk driving, it may be helpful to say a few words about what happens when alcohol is taken.  Alcohol is not digested but is absorbed directly into the blood stream from the stomach and small intestine.  The blood then distributes the alcohol throughout the body from which it is subsequently eliminated.  Initially, the absorption rate is much faster than the rate of elimination and so the concentration of alcohol in the blood usually rises rapidly to reach a peak within from 30 to 90 minutes after the cessation of drinking, depending on a number of factors.  After the alcohol has been absorbed into the blood, it is taken up <Col N="51" /> by the body tissues and fluids, roughly in proportion to their water content. Alcohol produces its well-known effects by depressing the central nervous system. These effects progress with increasing concentration of alcohol&mdash;at an early stage, attention and judgment are impaired, as are self-discipline and those skills involving refined co-ordination. Visual acuity suffers also at an early stage and sensory mechanisms are affected.  Later, behaviour becomes irregular, speech becomes hesitant or thick, memory becomes confused, and errors in co-ordination and some impairment of balance become noticeable. Generally, however, it is at a later stage still that staggering, slurred speech, flushed face, glassy eyes, etc. appear and it is only at this stage that subjective examination of a person can lead to a definite conclusion that he is under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>This recitation of the sequence of events which occurs when drink is taken may at first glance seem a bit unnecessary but it must be emphasised that the arguments in favour of a more scientific system of assessing incapacity require a proper understanding of this sequence.  The fact is that what all of us generally take to be almost the first signs or symptoms of alcoholic influence appear, in fact, only at an advanced stage of impairment and that, long before these symptoms make their appearance, the individual concerned may be quite incapable of driving safely.  The law in this country has, of course, recognised for many years that it is not only the person who is drunk in the social sense who is a danger on the roads&mdash;this is why the present provision on the subject prohibits driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of intoxicating liquor to such an extent as to be incapable of exercising proper control over a vehicle.  However, it is one thing to provide that a person whose driving ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol, even though he is not drunk or completely intoxicated, should not drive, but it is quite a different matter to enforce this kind of provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Most people are familiar with the procedure which operates at present when a person who has been arrested on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive, or being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of drink, is brought to a Garda station.  Unless the suspect is obviously very drunk, it is the practice of the Garda to call in a doctor to examine him officially on their behalf.  The suspect is not obliged to submit to this examination and he may call in a doctor of his own choice to examine him at his own expense.  If the suspect does not consent to be examined, the Garda doctor confines himself to observing his appearance and behaviour and he may give the result of his observations in court.</P>
    <P>The examination of a suspect by a doctor, usually referred to as a clinical examination, is not a standard or prescribed one&mdash;the doctor relies on his own judgment and experience as to what is necessary to enable him to assess the suspect's condition and give an opinion as to his capacity to drive. The clinical test usually consists of noting the suspect's ability to walk or stand, the condition of his speech, the odour of his breath, the colour of his face, the condition of his eyes, etc.  In cases where it is not possible to secure the attendance of a Garda doctor at the Garda station, the gardaí themselves and other non-professional witnesses may give evidence in court of what they observed in relation to the defendant, including evidence of opinion as to the capacity of the defendant to drive.</P>
    <P>In prosecutions relating to drink and driving, the prosecution relies to a great extent on the opinion of the doctor and on the evidence of the gardaí and, to a lesser extent, on the evidence of independent witnesses as to what they observed in relation to the accused.  Before a conviction can result the prosecution must, of course, establish that the accused was, at the material time, under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, but for witnesses, whether medical or lay, to feel any degree of certainly in expressing an opinion <Col N="53" /> that the accused person was incapable to that extent, the symptoms observed must as a rule be of the advanced kind.  However, as I have explained already, what one might term the outward signs of intoxication appear only at quite an advanced stage of impairment. It is quite possible, therefore, that a clinical examination of a suspect may not disclose any evidence of incapacity even though the individual concerned might be shown by some objective tests, for example, a test of his breath, blood or urine, to be completely incapable of driving properly and safely.</P>
    <P>There is the other side of the coin. As I shall mention later, the case for an accused person, and this I regard as extremely important, may be prejudiced because of the unreliability of clinical examination.  Its unreliability is confirmed by scientific studies and indeed by evidence given to the Commission here.  The reasons are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  A clinical examination is not sensitive enough to detect the impairment of driving ability which occurs at a stage before the ordinary symptoms of intoxication appear.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some drivers may, on clinical examination, display symptoms similar to those due to the consumption of alcohol, but which are in fact, due to a completely different condition.  Many illnesses, injuries, and conditions have an effect on a person's behaviour similar to and difficult to distinguish from that of alcohol.  Apart from the odour of breath there is no single symptom or sign caused by the consumption of alcohol which may not also be found in some pathological state. These factors may prejudice the case for an accused person.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Clinical examination does not produce consistent results&mdash;results depend on the interpretation of the examiner, his experience and skill, as well as how successfully the subject has &ldquo;braced&rdquo; himself during the examination.  The ability of some individuals to fight off the effects of alcohol for limited periods can account for a serious conflict of <Col N="54" /> evidence about his condition&mdash;he may be able to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; a clinical examination even though he showed unmistakable signs of the effects of alcohol before or after the examination. In this way, an experienced drinker may escape conviction while a less experienced drinker, whose driving capacity may be impaired only to the same extent, may be convicted.</P>
    <P>(iv)  With clinical examination, there can be no uniform standard as to what constitutes proper control of a vehicle&mdash;doctors use their own individual methods and have no standard formula to guide them.  This results in contrary conclusions as between doctors, and as between doctors and other witnesses, on the degree of incapacity of an individual; different verdicts can, therefore, be reached on similar facts and this, of course, may appear to involve unfair discrimination and injustice.</P>
    <P>In case of reasonable doubt the courts must acquit.  As stated earlier, is a probable that under the present system the net result is that many persons who would deservedly be convicted if there were a fixed standard of incapacity are now acquitted.</P>
    <P>As a result of their investigations, the Commission concluded that &ldquo;the methods used hitherto in this country appear to have been comparatively ineffective in dealing with the problem of drink and driving&rdquo;.  In particular, they felt that &ldquo;a clinical examination is not a reliable method of estimating the extent to which a person's capacity to drive has been worsened by the consumption of intoxicating liquor&rdquo;.  These views are entirely consistent with the conclusions reached in numerous studies carried out throughout the world and have been confirmed since the Commission's report by studies made by OECD and the European Conference of Ministers of Transport. Indeed, subsequently also, the authorities in Great Britain, faced with a similar problem to ours, opted for the kind of solution which is now proposed in the Bill.  I do not see how any reasonable person could oppose such a solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> Faced with the situation I have described, there is no alternative to taking such steps as are necessary to ensure that the general body of road users will be protected from the minority who continue to drive when their capacity is impaired.  Fortunately, years of research and experiment have now provided scientific methods of dealing with the problem.  Medical science has established that it is not the amount of alcohol consumed by a person which affects driving ability, but the amount absorbed into the blood and thus circulated through the body, affecting the brain and other nerve centres and correspondingly the mental and/or physical faculties.  The extent of the effects of alcohol on an individual is closely related to the concentration of alcohol in the brain tissues.  It is not, of course, possible to measure directly the concentration of alcohol in the living brain, but, since it is the blood, which circulates rapidly through the body, which carries alcohol to all tissues, including the brain, the concentration of alcohol in the blood is accepted as the best bio-chemical index of alcoholic influence.  There is a constant ratio between the concentration of alcohol in the brain and the concentration in the blood and in assessing the effects of alcohol on driving performance it is, therefore, most satisfactory to make the assessment by reference to the concentration in the blood rather than by reference to the quantity of alcohol consumed.</P>
    <P>The Commission concluded, and the Government have accepted this view, that the blood-alcohol level seems the obvious measure of impairment.  Apart from the fact that it is the practice in a great number of countries to use the blood-alcohol level for this purpose, a number of impressive arguments can be made in support of this course. Firstly, and probably most important, the blood-alcohol level can indicate when there is a serious worsening of driving ability which would not be evident on clinical examination. Secondly, and also very important, is the fact that, once relatively low <Col N="56" /> blood-alcohol levels are exceeded, the driving ability of all persons is worsened to some extent and, once relatively moderate blood alcohol levels are exceeded, the driving ability of all concerned is critically impaired, irrespective of individual tolerance to alcohol.  It must also be taken into account that the risk of accident involvement is correlated to blood-alcohol levels, and that scientific evidence indicates that driving performance deteriorates as the blood-alcohol level increases.</P>
    <P>It has been decided, therefore, to make use of the blood-alcohol level in dealing with offences related to drink and driving.  However, this decision does not, of itself, solve our problems because the blood-alcohol level could be used in three ways&mdash;(1) merely to corroborate or rebut evidence based on clinical examination, or (2) as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of incapacity to drive, or (3)  as conclusive proof of an offence.  The Commission took the view, and it is also my view, that the first of these courses&mdash;that is, to use the blood-alcohol level merely to rebut or to corroborate evidence based on clinical examination or observation&mdash; would not give satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>What I have said earlier about the unreliability of evidence based on clinical examination should make it obvious that acceptance of the blood-alcohol level as the principal evidence is clearly desirable because, as the Commission reported, &ldquo;the element of opinion would then be displaced from its paramount position and it would be possible to fix a uniform standard of incapacity.&rdquo;  If the law were to provide merely for the taking and analysis of samples of breath, blood or urine and the use of the results as evidence of incapacity to drive, it is extremely unlikely that there would be any greater uniformity in court decisions than exists at present or any appreciable improvement in law enforcement. If the taking and analysis of specimens is to be worthwhile, it seems clear that a fixed blood-alcohol level should be prescribed by law. Experience in Britain fully supports this.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommended the <Col N="57" /> adoption, initially at any rate, of the second course, that is, making a specified blood-alcohol level <i>prima facie</i> evidence of impairment of driving capacity.  Because of the importance of the matter, I think I should quote the following extract from the Commission's report in which the considerations on which they based their recommendation are set out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If any legislative changes are to be really successful and effective they must, in our view, have the support of the bulk of public opinion.  In countries where a certain blood-alcohol level has been prescribed as conclusive evidence of critical impairment public opinion has, we believe, been conditioned, perhaps gradually, to accept the position. Here the whole procedure of taking and analysing blood samples and giving evidence of blood-alcohol levels in prosecutions would constitute an innovation in criminal procedure with which everyone concerned might take some considerable time to become familiar, as well as interference with personal rights which public opinion might be still slower to accept as necessary or desirable.  It may be that, as a result of experience, public opinion would, in the course of time, be conditioned to accept and approve of a prescribed level which would be conclusive evidence of impairment.  We doubt very much if the education of opinion on the matter has yet reached that stage.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that the support of the bulk of public opinion is extremely desirable for legislation of the kind now proposed.  There have, however, been developments since the Commission's report.  World opinion has moved sharply against the drinking driver and the further studies undertaken since the report have confirmed very forcefully the importance of an objective test.  The increase in serious road accidents here has undoubtedly strengthened public opinion, and indeed I wonder if the Commission under-estimated the extent to which the public even in 1963 were prepared to support legislation designed to deal <Col N="58" /> with this problem.  For my part, I have no hesitation in recommending to the House the proposal put forward in the Bill, that a specific blood-alcohol level should be made conclusive evidence of a new offence.  I should emphasise that the Commission did not rule out the introduction of such a system at some future date&mdash;they merely considered that it was unlikely to be acceptable at the time they reported.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of any legislation on the subject should, I think, be to prevent persons from driving when their blood-alcohol concentration exceeds a level at which it is dangerous to the public to do so.  The Commission's own view that, at a blood-alcohol level of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, the driving ability of the great majority of persons will be seriously impaired would seem to justify a provision making that level proof of guilt rather than <i>prima facie</i> evidence as they recommended.  All the scientific evidence available shows that at this blood-alcohol level capacity to drive safely will be seriously worsened in the case of the great majority of persons, if not all.  I feel, therefore, that the community should be entitled to say that any person whose blood contains that concentration of alcohol should refrain from driving, whether or not he considers he is completely capable of doing so.  This argument is reinforced by the fact that there is no doubt that, even at lower blood-alcohol levels, driving performance is affected to some extent in all individuals irrespective of individual tolerance to alcohol.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts as to whether the implementation of the Commission's recommendation would materially improve the position in relation to the detection and prosecution of offences involving drink and driving. One of the main criticisms of the present system is that the lack of any prescribed standard of incapacity leads to lack of uniformity in court decisions and enables persons whose driving ability is significantly impaired, to escape punishment in the courts.  It is very doubtful whether, if a particular concentration of alcohol were to be <Col N="59" /> taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of incapacity to drive, there would be any greater uniformity in court decisions&mdash; different courts would be likely to accept different evidence as discharging the onus on the accused.  Moreover, experience of the operation of similar provisions would justify the view that the courts would probably tend to be easily satisfied that the onus on the accused had been discharged, particularly where the penalty on conviction is a heavy one.</P>
    <P>A further argument is that, in order to discharge the onus which would be placed on him, a defendant would have to rely on evidence&mdash;including evidence of opinion&mdash;based on clinical examination or observation.  It would be very undesirable and unsatisfactory if the courts were to accept such evidence&mdash; which has been shown to be extremely unreliable&mdash;as discharging the onus on the defendant or, in effect, rebutting the evidence as to blood-alcohol level. There are, therefore, grounds for believing that the establishment of an elaborate system of breath, blood or urine testing would not lead to any appreciable improvement in the position unless evidence as to the blood-alcohol level were made conclusive proof of an offence.  This the Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>The legislation which makes a specified blood-alcohol level conclusive proof of an offence is almost invariably criticised on the grounds that it does not take account of the varying individual tolerances to alcohol.  We often hear it said, and this, of course, is perfectly true, that some individuals can consume far more alcohol than others and still appear to be under the influence to a lesser degree than others who do not drink as much.  Evidence of the quantity of drink taken by an individual cannot, by itself, be regarded as an accurate indication of the extent to which he was impaired.</P>
    <P>This is not, however, the case with the blood-alcohol level which, as I have said already, is the obvious measure of impairment.  The overwhelming conclusion reached in numerous studies made on the subject <Col N="60" /> is that, when relatively moderate concentrations of alcohol are present in the blood, driving performance is adversely affected, irrespective of individual tolerance to alcohol.  For example, the special committee of the British Medical Association reported in 1960 that it was &ldquo;impressed by the rapidity with which driving ability deteriorates, even in the most hardened drinkers and the most experienced drivers at concentrations of alcohol in the blood in excess of 100 milligrammes&rdquo;. In 1965 they added that &ldquo;there can be very few persons in whom impairment of the ability to drive properly and increased risk of being involved in accidents are not present to a significant extent at blood alcohol concentrations in excess of 80 mg./ml.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amount of drink a person has taken is a primary factor in determining his blood-alcohol level but there are also many other factors involved, for example, the person's weight or build, the form in which alcohol is taken, the rate at which it is consumed, the type of drinker&mdash;heavy, moderate, regular, light&mdash;and the time which has elapsed since food was taken.  For this reason, one cannot state that so much drink will, on average, produce a certain blood-alcohol level.  Very considerable differences in blood-alcohol levels can, in fact, occur in different individuals who have taken the same quantity of alcohol.</P>
    <P>However, scientific evidence shows that it is the blood-alcohol level which really matters and, as I have already pointed out, the risk of accident involvement is correlated to it and scientific studies indicate that driving performance deteriorates as the blood-alcohol level goes up.  Although the degree of impairment and the risk of accident involvement varies slightly between different individuals at concentrations of alcohol of up to 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, scientific evidence shows that the variable factors responsible for these differences are dominated by alcohol at concentrations in excess of this.</P>
    <P>I know that a considerable amount of discussion is likely to arise on the <Col N="61" /> question of whether the blood-alcohol level specified in the Bill is the right one.  In discussing this question it is important to bear in mind that all the evidence available suggests that at relatively low blood-alcohol levels, say 30-50 milligrammes, some impairment of driving ability will occur in all individuals, irrespective of individual tolerance to alcohol, while at relatively moderate blood-alcohol levels, somewhere between 80 and 150 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, the great majority of persons will be seriously impaired.  A number of countries in Eastern Europe completely ban driving after drinking.  In a number of others, for example, Norway and Sweden, a blood-alcohol level of 50 milligrammes is taken as proof of an offence.  This is really a preventive measure&mdash;something like a speed limit &mdash;and, in fact, comes fairly close to spelling out the old advice: &ldquo;If you drink, don't drive.&rdquo;  Some impairment does set in at a fairly low blood-alcohol level, but, as a general rule, it would be mild in degree.  It is extremely unlikely that at this stage a proposal to make a blood-alcohol level of 50 milligrammes conclusive proof of a serious offence carrying heavy penalties would gain the support of public opinion in this country.</P>
    <P>One could, of course, go to the other extreme and fix the level at 150 milligrammes or over.  At this level the majority of persons would be obviously intoxicated; in other words, they would display symptoms which, on clinical examination, should give a positive result.  There would, therefore, be no point in fixing a blood-alcohol level as high as 150 milligrammes.  The difficulties and cost associated with the establishment and operation of an elaborate system of breath, blood or urine tests would hardly be commensurate with the results.</P>
    <P>The answer, therefore, seems to lie somewhere between 50 milligrammes and 150 milligrammes, but selection of the precise figure is very difficult. If the figure selected is on the low side, too many drivers will be drawn into the net and the provision will be criticised on the grounds that it is too <Col N="62" /> harsh; if the figure is too high, a considerable number of drivers who are seriously impaired may escape conviction. A suitable blood-alcohol level should represent a level at which a significant number of persons will be impaired though not necessarily showing obvious signs of intoxication.  It should be one which a reasonablyminded public will, in its own interest, accept as fair and just.  The Commission on Drunk Driving, having considered the evidence available on the question of the blood-alcohol level at which serious incapacity to drive sets in, concluded that 125 milligrammes would be a suitable level.  At that level they believed that &ldquo;the great majority of persons will be critically impaired.&rdquo; An important advantage of the 125 milligramme level is that at that level it is quite clear that light drinkers, moderate drinkers and even heavy drinkers will practically all be critically impaired.  I realise, of course, that some persons will show definite signs of impairment before the concentration of alcohol in their blood reaches 125 milligrammes and this is one of the reasons why it is proposed to retain the existing offences of driving while unfit side by side with the new offence.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated, the Bill fixes the maximum level at 125 milligrammes, but if it becomes clear during the debates that a lower level would command a significant volume of support, I am certainly prepared to ask the Government to reconsider the level.  Again, if subsequent to the enactment of this Bill, developments make it desirable to reduce the specified level, the necessary amending legislation will be brought before the Dáil.  The Bureau to be established under section 36 of the Bill is being empowered to keep the whole question of drink and driving under continuous review and the reports and recommendations which will be available to me from this source will help to determine what changes, if any, will be proposed in the future.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the Bill creates new offences, the essence of which is exceeding the specified blood-alcohol level, irrespective of whether the person concerned is drunk in the <Col N="63" /> normal sense or not.  I shall certainly not attempt to equate the level specified to any particular quantity of drink, because the relation between drink consumed and the blood-alcohol level, which is the criterion of incapacity, varies so much with various factors&mdash;weight and body build, food taken, rate of drinking, and so on.  But I can say that the only sure way to avoid committing one of these new offences is to restrict drinking while driving to a very small amount.  If the Bill results in drivers doing this, all its complex novel provisions will have been fully justified.  Deputies who reflect on what I have said earlier on the effects of drink on the capacity to drive, even at the early stage of drinking, will find no difficulty in agreeing with me on this.</P>
    <P>I come now to the implementation in legislative form, in Part V of the Bill, of the decided principles I have mentioned.  Subject to the objective test being conclusive evidence, Part V follows closely the recommendations of the Commission, and I may say that the details have been confirmed as sound by the OECD report I already referred to.  Part V is undoubtedly complex.  This is unavoidable because of the provisions needed to ensure, first, that a specimen of blood, breath or urine can be taken; second, that a decisive determination of blood-alcohol will be available to the courts; and third, that the procedure, while avoiding an unbearable cumbrousness and expense, will&mdash;and this is most important&mdash;be fair to the accused and preserve his rights.  Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that the powers of enforcement are really effective, not merely to secure convictions, but to achieve the real purpose of the new proposals, that is, to offer a strong deterrent to driving while unfit.  Deterrence is best secured where the probability of conviction is very high.  So we have the paradox that, while the Bill is designed to make the law really effective, our hope is that it will not result in more convictions but rather in fewer offences.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss separately <Col N="64" /> each section of Part V but, instead, to describe generally how it is proposed to operate the provisions.  As I have said already, the Government have decided that a new offence should be introduced rather than use the blood-alcohol level as evidence of prosecutions for the existing offences of driving, attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of drink.  Provision for the new offences is made by amending sections 49 and 50 of the 1961 Act so that these sections will contain provision for two alternative offences&mdash;the existing offences and the new offences of driving or attempting to drive, or being in charge of, a mechanically propelled vehicle while there is present in the body a quantity of alcohol such that within three hours afterwards, the concentration of alcohol in the blood will exceed 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  The same maximum penalties will apply to the new offences as apply at present to the existing offences.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to retain the existing offences because cases may arise in which the services of a doctor cannot be obtained by the Garda in time to take a specimen from a suspect.  In other cases, the accused may not have been apprehended at the material time, or may have been under the influence of drink to such an extent that he was quite incapable of understanding the requisition or of consenting to the provision of a specimen.  There will also be cases in which, though the blood-alcohol level of a person is below 125 milligrammes, the Garda will have sufficient grounds for a charge of driving while unfit.  In such a case, the prosecution would, as at present, rely on evidence based on observation and clinical examination, where it has been possible to have such an examination carried out.  The retention of the existing offences is also necessary to deal with cases of being under the influence of drugs.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the existing offences, a member of the Garda Síochána will be empowered to arrest, without warrant, a person who, in his opinion, is committing or has committed the new offence.  However, an <Col N="65" /> offence based solely on the concentration of alcohol in the blood creates new and difficult problems of enforcement. Such a provision could not be effectively enforced unless provision were made for &ldquo;spot checks&rdquo;&mdash;indeed it would be patently illogical to provide for such an offence but to restrict a Garda's power of enforcement to cases where the suspect shows obvious signs of intoxication, when the blood-alcohol concentration would already be very high.  There would, therefore, be little point in making it an offence to drive while the concentration of alcohol in the blood is in excess of 125 milligrammes if the Garda were not given the powers they would require to enable them to detect and apprehend drivers who show no obvious outward signs that they are unfit to drive but whose blood-alcohol levels are, in fact, greater than 125 milligrammes.</P>
    <P>The new offence would, of itself, certainly increase greatly the likelihood of conviction in the really bad drunk driving cases now brought before the courts.  It might also lead to prosecutions being successfully taken in a number of other cases, in which the driver, though suspected of being incapable of driving properly, does not display symptoms positive enough for the Garda to institute proceedings. But, of itself, it would not have any great effect as a deterrent in the large number of cases where ability to drive is impaired but little or no outward signs of it can be detected.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of cases which escape detection and conviction at present and which are certainly the greatest source of danger.  In the debate on the drunk driving provisions of the 1961 Act in Dáil Éireann, many Deputies expressed the view that it is not the driver who is &ldquo;dead drunk&rdquo; who is the big danger on the roads, because he will not get very far without being detected; they felt that the real danger was caused by the person who had had quite a few drinks but who did not display any of the usual signs of intoxication and believed that he was just as good a driver as ever, if not better.  Unless <Col N="66" /> there is provision for spot checks, these drivers will continue to escape detection.</P>
    <P>Simple screening tests will also benefit the driver in that they will enable a Garda to satisfy himself quickly, and with little inconvenience to the driver, that the blood-alcohol level is not excessive.  A preliminary breath test could, therefore, save a suspected driver the embarrassment and inconvenience of being brought to a Garda station, being examined by a doctor and being required to provide a blood or urine specimen.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill provides, therefore, for preliminary breath tests &mdash;a garda will be empowered to require the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle to exhale into an apparatus designed to indicate the presence of alcohol in the breath. However, before such a requisition can be made, the garda must be of opinion that the person has consumed intoxicating liquor.  This means that a garda will not be able to stop individual vehicles at random on the road and, without anything to go on, require the driver to take a test.  The preliminary test will be a simple procedure&mdash;it will only take a few minutes and will be carried out on the spot by means of a small portable apparatus such as is used in Germany and some of the Scandinavian countries.  This apparatus does not give results reliable enough to be used as evidence in court; it does, however, give a fair indication of the extent to which alcohol is present in the body and is, therefore, an effective method of eliminating at once those drivers whose blood-alcohol levels are not excessive.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the power to require a preliminary test will be a discretionary one and it will not be necessary to avail of it in all cases.  A garda will have power to arrest a person who, in his opinion, is committing an offence related to drink and driving, even if a preliminary breath test has not been carried out.  The purpose of the test is, on the one hand, to aid in the enforcement of the new provisions <Col N="67" /> and, on the other hand to prevent unnecessary inconvenience to drivers. It will be an offence to refuse or fail to undergo a preliminary test when required to do so, because, if it were possible to refuse with impunity to undergo such a test, guilty drivers could escape the provisions of the law completely.  However, that provision alone would not fully solve the problem because guilty persons might well refuse the test and deliberately choose the lesser offence and the lesser penalty involved so as to evade proceedings for the far more serious offence, with far heavier penalties, of which they might be convicted if their blood alcohol level were found to exceed 125 milligrammes. It is, therefore, proposed to extend the power of arrest without warrant to persons who refuse the preliminary test.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of the Bill relating to the taking of breath, blood or urine specimens.  Under the Bill, such specimens may be taken or provided only at Garda stations.  When a person is arrested because he is believed to have committed one of the existing offences or the new offences or the offence of refusing a preliminary specimen of breath and is brought to a Garda station, the garda then in charge there will be empowered to require him either to provide a specimen of his breath or a specimen of his blood, or both.  As an alternative to permitting a blood specimen to be taken, the arrested person may provide a specimen of his urine.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill authorises the making of a requisition for a specimen of breath, it is proposed to accept the recommendation of the Commission that, initially at any rate, breath analysis should not be used as a method of producing evidence for use in court.  The reliability of this method when used in normal everyday conditions has not been conclusively established, although it is used, under special conditions, in some countries, notably the United States.  Research on the subject is continuing and it is likely that the technique of breath analysis will improve.  It is, therefore, considered <Col N="68" /> wise to provide in the Bill for the taking of breath specimens from arrested persons &mdash; such a specimen could be taken in addition to a specimen of blood or urine and it would, therefore, be possible to use breath analysis experimentally in conjunction with blood or urine analysis in certain areas, probably the larger cities.  If the improvement in breath-testing techniques continues to a sufficient degree, it might be feasible, in time, to replace blood or urine analysis by breath analysis.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that breath analysis would have important advantages &mdash;it occasions less inconvenience to suspects and gives an immediate result whereas the result of a blood or urine test would not be known for some days.  Reliance on breath analysis has, however, disadvantages also: it is not at present as reliable as blood-analysis and it makes it more difficult to give a suspect a sample for independent analysis and to keep a sample for further analysis in case of dispute.  An important consideration too is that blood or urine analysis can be carried out by a scientific authority, independent of the prosecution, whereas breath-analysis would almost certainly have to be carried out by the Garda or technicians employed by them.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to rely on blood and urine analysis in the initial period.  I agree, however, with the views of the Commission on the manner in which breath-analysis might be introduced and the provisions made in the Bill will make it possible to implement in this regard the recommendations of the Commission which, I might mention, are set out fully in the extract from the Commission's report which has been included in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>I should say a few words on the use of urine samples.  Direct analysis of the blood is to be preferred for several reasons, but because of the objections some people have to giving a specimen of blood, it was thought better on balance to permit as an alternative the giving of a specimen of urine.  Just as the concentration of alcohol in the blood can be determined by analysing <Col N="69" /> and relating the concentration in the breath, so also can it be determined by analysing and relating that in urine. But urine analysis ranks rather with direct blood analysis than with breath analysis.  There is, of course, a relationship between the concentration of alcohol in the urine and that in the blood.  The determination of the alcohol concentration in the urine can, as in the case of blood, be carried out by a scientific authority, independent of the prosecution, which can also determine then the related blood-alcohol level.  A sample of the urine taken can be returned to the suspect for independent analysis or part of the sample originally analysed can be retained for further analysis.  There are some technical and practical difficulties, but it is considered that these can be surmounted; indeed, urine analysis is used generally in conjunction with blood-analysis in other countries.  On balance, therefore, it was felt that it was better to provide this as an option to giving a specimen of blood.  If, however, experience shows, that the difficulties involved are greater than we expect them to be, I may have to return to the House with a later Bill proposing that only blood samples may be offered.</P>
    <P>The procedure to be followed when a specimen is being taken or provided at a Garda station will be prescribed in detail by regulations under the Bill. This course was recommended by the Commission and the regulations will, of course, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and can be annulled by resolution of either House.  When it is intended to obtain a blood or urine specimen, the garda will call the Garda doctor to the station.  When the doctor arrives, the garda in charge for the time being there will formally require the arrested person either to permit the doctor to take a specimen of his blood or, if he so opts, to provide for the doctor a specimen of his urine.  The arrested person will then be cautioned in prescribed terms; I shall say more on this later.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Bureau, to be established under section 36, of the Bill and to which I will refer later, will <Col N="70" /> supply to Garda stations sealed containers containing all the apparatus and equipment the doctor will need to obtain a specimen&mdash;sterile syringe, cotton wool, antiseptic material, glass tubes, etc. and only the equipment contained in one of those containers will be used by the doctor to take the specimen.  It is envisaged that regulations will prescribe that the specimen of blood must be taken from a vein and must if practicable, amount to at least seven millilitres, about two teaspoonfuls. The Commission recommended that the blood specimen should be taken from a vein instead of being obtained by the capillary method, for example, by pricking an ear-lobe, so that a more convenient quantity could be taken in one go and to make for more accurate analysis.  When the specimen has been taken the doctor will be required to complete and sign a form of certificate relating to the taking of the specimen and to write on a label attached to the tube containing the specimen the name given by the suspect.  This label will bear an identification mark which will also be stamped on the form of certificate and on the container in which the doctor will place the tube containing the specimen and the certificate.  The container will then be sealed with a selfsealing flap and given to the garda in charge of the station.</P>
    <P>Since it is essential to have evidence of the blood-alcohol level in order to prove the new offences, it is necessary to prevent people, particularly those who suspect that their blood-alcohol concentration may be in excess of the prescribed level, from evading the new provisions by refusing a specimen.  In some countries, this is done by extracting a specimen by force.  This procedure would not be accepted in this country and was not recommended by the Commission, although they stated that they could see nothing unconstitutional in it.  The solution put forward by the Commission was that &ldquo;it should be made an offence, punishable in the same way as the offence for which he was arrested, for the suspect to refuse to permit samples of his blood or urine to be taken when so required, except where reasonable grounds exist <Col N="71" /> for such refusal.  The onus of establishing the existence of such grounds should rest upon the suspect if and when he is eventually prosecuted for the offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This recommendation is being implemented&mdash;the Bill provides, for example, that a person who has been driving or attempting to drive and who has been required to permit a blood specimen to be taken or to provide a urine specimen and who neither permits the blood specimen to be taken nor provides the urine specimen, shall be guilty of an offence, the maximum penalty for which will be exactly the same as that which applies to the existing offence of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of drink and which will also apply to the new offence of driving or attempting to drive while the quantity of alcohol in the body is above the level specified in the Bill.  The effect of this will be that a person who refuses to undergo the test will not gain any advantage from doing so.</P>
    <P>The Commission considered that refusal or failure to provide a blood or urine specimen should not be an offence &ldquo;where reasonable grounds exist for such refusal&rdquo; but they felt that &ldquo;the onus of establishing the existence of such grounds should rest upon the suspect if and when he is eventually prosecuted for an offence.&rdquo; They decided that it would be inadvisable to specify what they would regard as reasonable grounds for refusing to permit a specimen to be taken but they believed &ldquo;that a person's reason for refusing must be something of substance and not trivial&rdquo; and that &ldquo;an objection on the grounds of inconvenience or discomfort should not be regarded as reasonable.&rdquo;  In the opinion of the Commission, the question of what would constitute reasonable grounds for a refusal was best left to the discretion of the courts.</P>
    <P>These recommendations are being implemented by section 35 of the Bill which provides that, in a prosecution for refusing or failing to permit a blood specimen to be taken, it will be <Col N="72" /> a good defence to satisfy the court that there was a special and substantial reason for the refusal or failure. The onus will be on the defendant to satisfy the court that he had a special and substantial reason for his refusal or failure.  It is intended that all cases of refusal or failure to permit a specimen to be taken will be brought before the courts and that it will be left to the courts alone to decide whether or not a particular reason is a &ldquo;special and substantial&rdquo; one. Furthermore, the defendant's refusal or failure to provide a specimen may in any event be given in evidence.</P>
    <P>Under section 35 of the Bill it will also be a good defence for the defendant to show that, when required to permit a specimen of blood to be taken, he had not been cautioned in the prescribed terms of the possible effects of his refusal or failure.  It is intended that the caution, which will be prescribed by regulations, will consist of a warning, in simple language, that refusal or failure to permit a blood specimen to be taken is an offence, unless a urine specimen is provided, and that the maximum penalties for that offence are similar to those which follow from a conviction of the offence for which the person was arrested.  The arrested person will also be informed that he will have a good defence to a prosecution for refusing to permit a specimen to be taken if he satisfies the court that he had a special and substantial reason for doing so but that a refusal or failure may be given in evidence in a prosecution for an offence of driving, attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle while unfit.</P>
    <P>The Commission considered that the analysis of all blood and urine specimens should be carried out in the same institution under the control of a Medical Director.  They considered that this institution should be an independent authority and not under State control.  These suggestions are being implemented by sections 36 to 40 of the Bill.  Under section 36, an independent corporate body will be established.  It will consist of from three to five members appointed by the Minister for Local Government and will also have <Col N="73" /> a Director; it is intended that he will be a person who has medical or scientific qualifications, or both.</P>
    <P>Under section 37, the Bureau will be responsible for the analysis of all specimens of blood and urine and the determination of the concentration of alcohol in them.  It will also be required to arrange for the provision of equipment for the taking or provision of specimens of blood and urine and may undertake research into matters affecting driver fitness and road safety.  The Bureau will be empowered to enter into an arrangement with an appropriate institution, such as, for example, a scientific or medical department of a university college, under which the work of analysing specimens would be undertaken in the university laboratory by persons employed there.</P>
    <P>The Bureau will be established by means of an establishment order.  This procedure is not a new one&mdash;it is based mainly on the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 under which bodies may be established to perform functions in, or in relation to, the provision of health services.  The establishment order procedure is a flexible one which will enable different provisions to be made as circumstances change and new provisions to be added in the light of experience.  Examples of the provisions which may be contained in the order are given in section 39 of the Bill.  The net expense of the Bureau will be met out of the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>When a specimen of blood or urine has been taken at a Garda station, it will be the duty of the member of the Garda Síochána then in charge there to have the specimen despatched to the Bureau as soon as possible.  Before handing over the specimen to the Garda, the doctor who obtained it will be required under section 42 (1) to certify the prescribed particulars on a prescribed form which he must also give to the garda in charge of the station.</P>
    <P>The Commission considered that it should not be necessary for the doctor who obtained a specimen to appear in court to give evidence of this and they <Col N="74" /> recommended that the law should provide accordingly.  They believed that this departure from what is usual in criminal procedure was necessary if the new system of dealing with the problem of drink and driving was to function satisfactorily.  The certificate procedure is, therefore, designed to make it unnecessary for the prosecution to have the doctor in court to give evidence relating to the taking or provision of the specimen.  Under section 43 (1) of the Bill, the certificate completed by the doctor will be sufficient evidence in any legal proceedings of the matters certified, until the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>Section 42 (2) deals with the procedure to be followed when a specimen is received by the Bureau.  It provides that a part of the specimen shall be analysed and the concentration of alcohol therein determined, and that the remainder of the specimen shall be preserved.  Regulations under section 46 will prescribe in some detail the procedure to be followed upon receipt by the Bureau of a specimen and the methods to be used in the analysis of specimens.  The regulations will also specify the persons by whom determinations as to blood-alcohol levels are to be made and the procedure and methods to be used in making such determinations.  It will be noted that only a part of the specimen is to be analysed and that the portion of the specimen which remains must be preserved in accordance with the prescribed procedure&mdash;this will ensure that some of the specimen will remain in case a further analysis is required under section 44 by the person from whom the specimen was taken or by whom it was provided.  When a determination as to the concentration of alcohol in a specimen has been made, the Bureau must notify the Garda and the person from whom the specimen was taken.  The Commission considered that it should not be necessary in the normal run of cases for the person who made the analysis to appear in court to give evidence.  They recommended, therefore, the acceptance as evidence in court of the certificate of the analysing authority as to the results of an analysis.  This is being provided for in the Bill&mdash;a certificate issued by the <Col N="75" /> Bureau to the Garda under section 42 (3) will contain the result of the determination and, under section 43, must be accepted as conclusive evidence of the concentration of alcohol.</P>
    <P>The notification to the person from whom the specimen was taken or by whom it was provided, will be effected by issuing to him in the &ldquo;prescribed manner&rdquo; a statement in the prescribed form containing the result of the determination and such other matters as may be prescribed.  The regulations to be made under section 46 of the Bill will prescribe the form of this statement.  It is intended that the statement will, in addition to notifying the person of the result of the determination, inform him of the provisions of section 44 of the Bill relating to his right to have a further analysis and determination made.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommended that, as an extra safeguard, an accused person should have the right to require the Bureau to make a second analysis of the specimen taken on behalf of the Garda and retained by the Bureau for this purpose.  They recommended that the right to request such an analysis should be exercisable only within a prescribed period after the first analysis has been made and that the second analysis should be made at the expense of the person who requested it.  Section 44 implements these recommendations.  When a request for a second analysis under section 44 is duly made to the Bureau, they will be required to analyse a portion of that part of the specimen preserved after the first analysis and to make a new determination as to the concentration of alcohol in it.  The second analysis and determination must be made in accordance with the procedure prescribed by regulations under section 46&mdash;the same procedure as was used in the first analysis and determination &mdash;but it will not be carried out by the person who dealt with the case previously.</P>
    <P>On completion of a second analysis and determination, a certificate containing <Col N="76" /> the results will be issued to the garda in charge of the Garda station from which the specimen was sent to the Bureau.  A statement conveying similar information will be issued to the person from whom the specimen was obtained.  A person who makes a requisition for a second analysis will have the right to request the Bureau to make the analysis or determination in his presence or in the presence of a person nominated by him.  Provided the request is made in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period the Bureau will be obliged to comply.  If the certificate issued following a second analysis and determination specifies a lower concentration of alcohol than that specified in the certificate issued after the first analysis, the lower figure must be taken.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides a further safeguard. Under it, a person who permits a specimen of his blood to be taken or provides a specimen of his urine must&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  be given an opportunity of providing an additional specimen to a doctor of his own choice or,</P>
    <P>(b) if he requests, be supplied by the Garda doctor with an additional specimen provided by him.</P>
    <P>The Commission recommended that provision on the lines of section 45 should be made.  It will be open to a person to have a specimen which he or his doctor has obtained under the section analysed by an independent analyst and to call the person who made the analysis as a witness in court. In the event of any material difference between the results certified by the Bureau and those given in evidence by the accused's own analyst, it would be a matter for the court to resolve the controversy as best it could, taking into account all material circumstances relating to the case.</P>
    <P>I hope I have given the House a reasonably comprehensive statement of the provisions of the Bill relating to driving while unfit through drink. If any further information is required, I shall do my best to supply it.  Many of the provisions of Part V of the Bill, <Col N="77" /> and indeed, of the Bill as a whole, are more appropriate for discussion on the Committee Stage and for this reason, I have refrained from discussing each and every one of them at this stage.</P>
    <P>In addition to dealing with the problem of drink and driving in so far as mechanically propelled vehicles are concerned, Part V of the Bill amends the law on driving a pedal cycle while under the influence of drink, section 47 increasing substantially the maximum penalties which may be imposed for this offence.  This implements a recommendation of the Commission which pointed out that a cyclist who is under the influence of drink can be a serious danger to other road users as well as to himself and considered that the law should emphasise the seriousness of the offence.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill concludes with amendments of the provisions of the 1961 Act which contain the more important offences related to driving and parking.  Sections 48 to 50 relate to careless and dangerous driving and section 51 to dangerous parking.  The existing offence of driving without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration is split into two separate offences, one of which&mdash;driving without due care and attention&mdash; will carry a heavier maximum penalty than the present offence.  It is intended to deal under section 49 of the Bill with the type of case in which juries and justices have tended to acquit on a charge of dangerous driving but which nevertheless involves more than lack of consideration.  Amendments to section 53 and 55 of the 1961 Act, which deal with dangerous driving and dangerous parking, respectively, are designed mainly to remove technical difficulties which have arisen in the operation of the existing sections. In addition, the power of arrest without warrant is being extended to both dangerous driving and dangerous parking cases.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the other Parts of the Bill.  Many of these provisions are selfexplanatory and notes on them have been provided in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> Part I contains the usual provisions relating to short title, interpretation, commencement and collective citation and construction.  The provisions of section 3 under which the 1961 Act and the Bill must be construed together as one Act will have the effect of applying many important provisions of the 1961 Act to the Bill, for example, the definitions, the general power to make regulations, the financial provisions, and the provision relating to the general penalty in section 102 of the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>Part II is aimed generally at ensuring that vehicles in use on the public roads are road worthy, particularly in relation to the design and fitting of vehicle parts and driver equipment, the design and quality of the vehicles themselves and, in the case of goods vehicles, their ability to carry loads.  A number of the new provisions will place the responsibility on the supplier of vehicles, vehicle parts, equipment, etc., of ensuring that what is supplied by him meets the requirements which will have been determined beforehand.  Under modern conditions with the increasing technical complexity of regulations, the exercise of control in this way is very desirable.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part II of the 1961 Act, which place responsibility on the owner or user of a vehicle, will continue to apply, to ensure that the vehicle (once supplied) is properly maintained and used.  Taking into account the need for European harmonisations as well as developments arising from the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and having regard to the possible special needs of various interests, flexibility in the use of the new controls will be essential.  The specific requirements will, therefore, be determined by regulations under the appropriate sections.  Before such regulations are made the various interests involved will, of course, be consulted.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in this part of the Bill will empower spot checks to be carried out on vehicles in use on the public roads in order to ensure that they are roadworthy, the exercise of a measure of surveillance over the vehicle maintenance schedules and procedures of statutory bodies or firms having reasonably large numbers of vehicles <Col N="79" /> in their fleets, more adequate checking of vehicles suspected of carrying excess weights and a sliding scale of fixed penalties where serious overweight is detected.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Part of the Bill are rather technical and complex and are, I feel, more appropriate for discussions at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill amends and extends Part III of the 1961 Act so as to provide for control of driving instruction, eyesight tests for persons who make application to undergo the driving test, the issue in certain cases of limited certificates of competency to drive and the postponement or remission of disqualifications for driving.</P>
    <P>The driving test scheme has now been in operation for almost three years and has proved itself as fair and efficient.  The rate of failure in the test, which in the last six months of 1966 averaged 55.2 per cent indicates, however, that there is a grave lack of competent driving instruction throughout the country.  Control of driving instruction for reward would go some way towards solving this difficulty and powers to this end are provided in section 18 of the Bill.  There are many possible developments in relation to this control, which can be operated in stages.  It is envisaged that the initial stage would be the licensing of driving instructors.</P>
    <P>One aspect of driver testing which is not covered in the scheme hitherto operated in this country and which is commonly part of the test in other countries is that of a test of the eyesight of applicants.  While there is no proven association between poor eyesight and accident causation it is accepted that a person with defective vision is at an immediate disadvantage. The problem is not, however, a simple one.  There are many aspects of eyesight which may affect driving&mdash; visual acuity, static and dynamic, field of vision, night vision, etc., etc., and in relation to none of these, with the possible exception of static visual acuity, is there a standard below which it is internationally recognised that a person should be debarred from driving.  The nature and scope of the <Col N="80" /> eyesight test, under section 19 of the Bill, will therefore be determined from time to time by regulations following investigations and consultations with bodies competent to advise on the subject.  For the present it is envisaged that the test will be a simple one of visual acuity but a more complete test may be introduced later.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill covers a point which has occasioned some hardship for a limited number of applicants for the driving test.  In line with international practice the number of classes of vehicles for driving licence purposes has been kept to the minimum consistent with conditions in this country. As a result some classes embrace fairly wide ranges of vehicles and the driving test must take account of this by requiring that the vehicle on which the test is carried out is representative of its class.  A certain hardship may result in a special case where a person wishes to take the test in a particular type of vehicle and it is clear that there is no likelihood of the person concerned driving a more difficult type.  The issue of a limited certificate of competency in such a case would meet the exceptional difficulty involved while retaining the overall pattern of the present driver licencing system.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 21 of the Bill will enable a court, when making an order disqualifying a person from driving, to postpone for up to six months, the commencement of the period of disqualification provided it is fully satisfied that this action is justified by exceptional circumstances. In this way a court can, for example, give a convicted person whose livelihood depends on driving the opportunity to train, say, a member of his family so that he will be in a position to support himself and his dependants.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill will restore to the Minister for Justice the power to remit ancillary disqualification orders, that is, those which may be imposed at the discretion of the courts.</P>
    <P>Ancillary disqualification may be ordered by a court at its discretion, (1) where a person is convicted of any offence under the 1961 Act, except, of course, those to which consequential disqualification applies, and (2) where <Col N="81" /> a person is convicted of any other offence in relation to a mechanically propelled vehicle or a crime or offence in the commission of which a mechanically propelled vehicle was used.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to give the courts this wide power because the circumstances of the case, however minor the charge, may indicate the wisdom of disqualifying the offender for a while.  On the whole the courts have exercised the power sensibly, but there have been cases where a court has imposed disqualification for a very minor offence with no exacerbating circumstances. This can operate very harshly when the court also decides not to suspend the operation of the disqualification order pending appeal.  Thus, although the present law provides for an appeal to a higher court against an ancillary disqualification, whether the conviction is being appealed or not, the appeal can take a long time to come to hearing.</P>
    <P>Again, the disqualified person can, after 3 months, go back to the court which made the order and seek to have the disqualification removed, but this provision does not apply to disqualifications for periods of less than six months and, in any event, the court has power to remove the disqualification only after it has operated for six months.  It is important that there should be some machinery for dealing quickly with such harsh decisions, relatively rare though they may be.  The Bill proposes, accordingly, to restore the power of remission in respect of ancillary disqualifications.  Cases where this power is exercised will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with speed limits.  Apart from a number of minor amendments to the existing provisions, this Part of the Bill authorises the introduction of a general speed limit for all mechanically propelled vehicles and in respect of all public roads, or all public roads with specified exceptions, should this course appear desirable in the light of experiments and research in this country and abroad.  The provision for general speed limits is a flexible one which will enable such <Col N="82" /> limits to be introduced for holiday or other peak traffic periods or for an experimental period or on a permanent basis.  Another important amendment in this Part of the Bill is the provision in section 24 which makes possible the application of special speed limits on specified roads for certain periods of the year, e.g. during the summer months in a holiday resort.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill modifies the compulsory insurance provisions of the 1961 Act.  Section 52 terminates the system under which cover may be afforded by an approved guarantee. This system has not, in fact, been operated in this country for a number of years and it has disadvantages both for the guaranteed person and for third parties.  Sections 53 and 54 are concerned with limiting to statutory bodies and semi-State companies the right to become an exempted person under the 1961 Act, that is, a person who, in effect, is allowed to carry his own insurance.  The present option, under the 1961 Act has been availed of only by Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is considered that, in present circumstances, it would be unwise to continue to permit bodies other than statutory and semi-State bodies to be exempt like the State from the compulsory insurance provisions of the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill contains minor amendments and extensions of the provisions of the 1961 Act relating to the control and operation of public service vehicles.  In addition, it provides for the transfer from the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to the Minister for Local Government of the power conferred by section 86 of the 1961 Act to make statutory instruments to control and regulate stopping places and stands for omnibuses.  These powers, which are of a general nature, are applicable throughout the entire State and are ancillary to the powers conferred by section 88 of the 1961 Act to make general bye-laws for the regulation and control of traffic.  For reasons which I shall refer to later, these latter powers are being transferred from the Commissioner to the Minister and it is considered desirable, therefore, that the powers conferred <Col N="83" /> by section 86 should also be transferred.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill deals with the regulation of traffic.  Section 58 is a new provision, designed to deal with pedestrians who are under the influence of drink in public places to such an extent as to endanger traffic or themselves. It implements a recommendation of the Commission on Driving while under the Influence of Drink or a Drug.</P>
    <P>Section 59 repeals section 88 of the 1961 Act, under which the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána may, with the consent of the Minister, make by-laws applicable throughout the State, for the general control and regulation of traffic and pedestrians in public places, and instead, empowers the Minister to make regulations for similar purposes.  By-laws under section 88 are in effect, the Rules of the Road, the formulation of which must, in the light of developments in recent years, now be regarded as a matter of policy. As such, it is more appropriate that they should be made by a Minister directly answerable to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 60 is designed to make it clear that restrictions on vehicles using a bridge may be related to axle or wheel loads as well as overall weight and to make it possible to bring combinations of vehicles (as well as single vehicles) within the scope of such restrictions.</P>
    <P>Section 61 is purely an enabling section under which all traffic management functions in a specified area can be vested in one road authority.  This would, of course, have obvious advantages, provided the authority concerned was capable of discharging the functions effectively and had established an adequate organisation for the purpose. It will be possible to transfer to a specified road authority, by order under section 61, functions of the Commissioner as well as functions of other local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 62 replaces section 97 of the 1961 Act under which a member of the Garda Síochána may remove or arrange for the removal of a vehicle which is left on a public road in such a position as to cause, or to be likely to <Col N="84" /> cause, danger or obstruction or is abandoned on a public road.  The problem of abandoned vehicles has become a serious one in recent years and the new section will enable regulations to be made establishing an effective system under which vehicles may be removed, stored and, after the expiration of a specified period, disposed of. Under the section, it will be possible to deal with the &ldquo;remains&rdquo; of vehicles and to dispose of valueless vehicles and also other vehicles which are not claimed and the owner of which cannot be traced.  The new section, in addition to dealing with vehicles which have been, or appear to have been abandoned, covers vehicles which are parked in contravention of the 1961 Act or regulations or by-laws made under it, for example, at a meter parking place or on a clearway.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill contains two sections.  Section 63 will enable the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to appoint persons to aid in the enforcement of the system which has come to be known, incorrectly, as &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo;.  The growing volume of vehicles on the roads is making ever increasing demands on the Garda, whose duty it is enforce road traffic legislation.  The stage has now been reached where the Garda, particularly in Dublin, are becoming seriously short-staffed and are scarcely able to cope with their primary tasks of preventing and detecting crime and preserving law and order.  Much of the work connected with the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act is of a very routine nature and could well be performed by persons other than gardaí who are highly and expensively trained in police duties proper.  Faced with the choice of expanding the strength of the Garda Síochána or recruiting a special traffic service whose personnel would not be required to be of the physical standards and police training of the Garda, it has, very naturally, been decided to opt for the latter.  The Bill provides that the new personnel will be used for the work of affixing and delivering &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; notices. The members are to be appointed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and their remuneration and <Col N="85" /> conditions of service will be fixed by the Minister for Justice in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The actual cost of the Force will be recouped from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions for failure to pay &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; imposed by members of the new traffic corps will be taken by the Garda with the members acting as witnesses.  The corps will not have any powers of arrest.</P>
    <P>The intention is to employ members of the new corps in Dublin initially. Details of the hours of work and the level of remuneration have not been worked out, but it may be that they will be employed on a part-time basis only, concentrating on the peak hours. If the scheme is a success in Dublin it will be introduced in other cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Section 64 is designed to remove certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with section 112 of the 1961 Act, which makes it an offence to take or use a vehicle without the consent of the owner or other lawful authority. The scope of section 112 is being widened so as to make it a specific offence, not just as heretofore, an offence of aiding and abetting, to allow oneself to be carried in a vehicle which is known to have been taken without the owner's consent.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the various amendments to the 1961 Act made by section 6 and the Schedule to the Bill.  These are mainly Committee Stage points and notes on each of them are included in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat that I appreciate that legislation by itself cannot solve all our road traffic problems, but it must provide the framework for action on a wide front and not merely that of enforcement.  The Bill aims at bringing right up to date our legislation on this important subject, which is of practical concern to practically everybody in the State in his daily life.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Col N="86" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this Bill is to amend and extend the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and to make further and better provisions for the regulation of traffic and the safety of road users in general. The Road Traffic Act, 1961 is a fairly lengthy measure which was enacted here after considerable discussion and, indeed, as the Minister said, it was thought then it would not be necessary to come back to this House for a long time with any amending Bills.  As the Minister has also said, the volume of traffic on the roads, particularly mechanically propelled traffic is increasing yearly.  The fact must be faced up to that it is becoming a growing problem.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1961, contained in a concise form all the legislation dealing with road traffic in this country and it is very important that road users, whether they be motorists, cyclists or pedestrians, should be able to ascertain, without much trouble, the law governing road traffic.  Therefore, it is a great mistake that the Minister did not give us a completely new Bill, a completely new measure, which would consolidate and bring up to date in one measure the Road Traffic Act, 1961 and this measure.  It is a bit early on to start dealing with this matter piecemeal.  If we continue to do so, we will have our road traffic legislation in the form of a patchwork quilt. I think I am correct in saying that the measure with which we are now dealing amends in 33 respects, at least, the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and each and every one of those amendments is set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say it is beyond me why the Minister did not re-write the 1961 Act and write those amendments into it and why he did not add such new sections as he has included in the present Bill.  If he had done that, we would then have in one measure the entire law relating to road traffic.  It is not necessary for me to labour this point.  It is elementary.  It is something which appeals to the layman just as well as to the lawyer.  We had recently here a commission working on income tax law for years.  It consolidated all <Col N="87" /> the various Acts from 1918 to date. The case which arose in that code could have been avoided if the various Acts had been re-written year by year. However, to conclude my remarks on this particular aspect of the matter, I must say that I consider it a great pity that the Minister did not give us a completely new measure.</P>
    <P>There is another thing, by way of general remark, that strikes me about this Bill, that is, that practically every section provides for the making of regulations by the Minister.  I did not count the various sets of regulations that will be made under this Bill but they will certainly run into dozens. Many of them could have been avoided by writing the proposed regulations into the Bill and discussing them here. For example, dealing with the bloodtesting provisions of the Bill, the Minister said that it is envisaged that this will be done by regulation.  As the Minister has in the back of his mind the type of regulation which will be made, why could not as many of those regulations as possible have been incorporated in this Bill?  They would then have been presented to the House and could have been discussed here.  I do not know why this was not done.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the first 18 or 19 sections of the Bill provide for the making of regulations.  Section 46 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to sections 26 to 45.</P>
    <P>Regulations will be made for each of those sections.  This system of enacting legislation by regulation is bad.  I know I may be told that these regulations will be laid before the Dáil and that Members will have an opportunity of discussing them.  I do not think that is satisfactory.  They will be made at different times, when the Bill itself is not fresh in the minds of Deputies.  It would be far more satisfactory if they were written into the Bill.  Furthermore, it would be much easier for the public to know where they stood if they had only to refer to the Act when it became law, not to mention that it would be easier for the legal profession <Col N="88" /> to advise their clients.  In general, the Government, or perhaps the civil servants, have become obsessed with making regulations.  They have a feeling that, if they do that, they are clipping the wings, so to speak, of this House and getting more power for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know he is responsible.  Here is a further example.  Up to now we used to have what were known as traffic bye-laws made by the Commissioner of the Guards.  Now, the responsibility for making these bye-laws is to be taken away from the Commissioner and given to the Minister.  They will not longer be known as bye-laws, but as regulations.  That is why I say somebody has become obsessed by the desire to regulate everything by measures that are never properly discussed in this House.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there are many parts of the Bill that might be better dealt with in Committee, but I would like to make a passing reference to some of the things that can be done by regulation.  For example, Part II of the Bill is an attempt to improve the roadworthiness of vehicles by prescribing that certain parts of a high standard shall be used and that inferior component parts shall not be used.  If I understand section 9 correctly, it gives the Minister power to make regulations, in particular and without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), providing for all or any of the following matters:</P>
      <P>(a) prohibiting importation either absolutely or save under a licence (which may contain conditions) issued by the Minister or by specified persons;</P>
      <P>Under this section the Minister is going to take unto himself the right to decide what vehicle parts may be imported into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps there is a lot to be said for that.  Perhaps there is a lot to be said for restricting the importation of inferior <Col N="89" /> parts or parts that would not serve their purpose properly.  But in this regulation the Minister also takes on himself the right to decide, by regulation, who will import vehicle parts.  He can issue licences and decide that only A or A and B shall have the right to import these vehicle parts. That is entirely unsatisfactory.  Paragraph (a) of this subsection could have stopped at the prohibition of imports.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph is even worse. Under it the Minister will have power to decide who within the country may or may not sell these various vehicle parts.  What is the object of that?  How does that come into the realm of this measure?  Surely, if the parts are properly manufactured, it does not matter who sells them because they cannot do any harm?  Under this section the Minister can decide by regulation that firm A shall have the sole monopoly of selling various parts or appliances for motor vehicles.  That is unsatisfactory and I shall deal with it more specifically by amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow the course the Minister took.  I propose to take the sections of the Bill more or less as I meet them.  I have been talking about Part II, which contains the general provisions relating to vehicles.  That is certainly a part of the Bill which can be more satisfactorily dealt with on Committee Stage.  Part III of the Bill deals with driving licences.  In my opinion it contains at least a couple of points of principle which are certainly proper for a Second Reading discussion.</P>
    <P>First, the Minister has decided to take unto himself again the right to restore ancillary disqualification orders made by the District Court and the Circuit Court.  Up to 1961 the Minister for Justice of the day enjoyed&mdash;or should I say, suffered&mdash;the right to restore at his will all driving licences suspended by the courts.  Experience taught that that was most undesirable and one Minister for Justice, Deputy Everett, on coming into office stated that so long as he was Minister for Justice, he would refuse in any shape or form to restore any licence. Once a disqualification was imposed <Col N="90" /> by the court, he refused to interfere. At any rate, the 1961 measure accepted the fact it was wrong that the Minister for Justice of the day should have the right to restore driving licences which had been taken away by the courts either under a consequential disqualification or an ancillary disqualification order.  I think the reasoning behind that was sound.  This is a very small country, where everybody knows everybody else or knows somebody who knows everybody.  It is very unsound that a Minister for Justice should have the right to interfere with a decision of the courts under this particular heading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>I should state briefly at the outset that the principle upon which the Bill is founded is that opportunities for employment shall be made available to disabled persons and that this shall be guaranteed by law.  I must express regret at my inability to follow the procedure of the House in supplying or circulating a copy of my Second Reading speech.  The reasons for that are obvious: I am not supported by a brigade of civil servants and must rely &mdash;to use a historic expression&mdash;on my own strength and, of course, on that of my gallant friends who are as interested in this measure as I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically every day we open a newspaper we discover some section of the community anxiously seeking to attach to itself as its own private property the term &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo;.  One would be tempted to think it was a kind of banner to be seen and waved and one cannot but wonder at the sections of the population who carry it so proudly and, in some cases, so unjustifiably. &ldquo;Underprivileged&rdquo; is, I should imagine, an American word which has become part of the jargon of people who do not like the simplicity of &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;, &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; or &ldquo;want&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Underprivileged&rdquo; connotes <Col N="91" /> that one is in possession of some privileges but not enough.  &ldquo;Privilege&rdquo;, I understand, is defined as the possession of some advantage over another, some advantage, be it material, financial or spiritual.</P>
    <P>In speaking of the disabled, I shall not apply to them the term &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo; because they are people with no privileges, people deprived of fundamental rights, in many cases by accident of birth and in some cases by reason of what happened during their lives.  Whatever their condition, I think it can truly be said of the disabled that they have been deprived of advantages which the ordinary citizen acquires by simply coming into the world.  By the disabled, I do not mean those who are physically or obviously disabled: in the terms of this Bill the disabled are all those people who have to grapple as best they can with life and who in many cases are ill-equipped to do so because the life and society into which they have come are the society and life which we ourselves have made.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for considerable reflection that in spite of the colossal advances that have been made in technical matters, even in matters artistic, in every sphere, one might say, of human activity, that so far as the inhumanity of man to fellowman is concerned&mdash;which, as has been said, &ldquo;makes countless thousands mourn&rdquo;&mdash;we do not appear to have progressed much since the beginning of civilisation whenever that was.  Since it appears to be a fact that the most learned men cannot fix that time, I can hardly be expected to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not ground the arguments for the Bill upon pity because that in itself is not an admirable argument on which to seek justice in any cause.  I hesitate to use even the word &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;, because there is about it a certain pomposity.  I feel that this Bill is justified for reasons of practicability as well as for reasons of simple humanity.  When one thinks of humanity, I dare say that we who live in this country are as humane as those who live elsewhere.  I do not think we <Col N="92" /> are any more humane nor do I think we are any less.  We are just as liable to be disturbed when we hear of people in other lands who are deprived of their natural rights because of their colour, because of their blood group, because of their philosophical beliefs&mdash;and this is as it should be.  But, to my mind, there is a certain selfindulgence in this sympathetic wincing at events which are taking place far away, places with strange sounding names, when, right in our own four green fields, there exists a problem for our own attention to which we might well turn our hand.</P>
    <P>It is to enable Dáil Éireann to give this problem thought and attention that I bring forward this Bill.  In doing so, I make no claim to any superior consideration of humanity than any other Member of this House.  I know that we are all people who feel for the misfortunes of those whom we represent. There are differences of approach. the time has come when, I believe, we must translate our sentiments into positive action.  The day when man's welfare, the welfare of disabled people, indeed, the welfare of anybody could be and should be left to the whim of fortune is long past.  The world into which we are marching or strolling or being dragged or pushed&mdash;what term one should use correctly, it is difficult to say&mdash;the world into which we are moving, at any rate, is not a world of <i>laissez faire</i>, of come-day-go-day-God-send-Sunday. It is a world which has rejected altogether, and rightly so, the jungle notion that the race is to the swift, that the fittest only will survive and, as far as the rest are concerned, then God help them, we are sorry for them but it is the will of God.  That notion has gone and all the communities making any legitimate claim to civilisation have long accepted that the central authority has on it an obligation and a responsibility so to regulate society as to ensure that, in so far as it lies within the compass of human endeavour, justice shall prevail.</P>
    <P>It is not to be thought that we shall achieve absolute and pure justice in this Dáil or in the next Dáil, in our lifetime or in the lifetime of this nation or this race because perfection is something <Col N="93" /> which apparently does not belong within the possibilities of human achievement.  However, there is a realisation that, upon us all, is laid the obligation, particularly upon those of us who have the high honour to belong to a national Parliament and particularly on those of us who have the extremely high honour and the fortune to belong to Dáil Éireann, to do our bit, to do what we can to add to the sum of human happiness.  This measure is designed to that end.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the notion&mdash;I know there are advocates of the notion in this House as well, quite fossilised survivals of another age&mdash;that free and unhampered competition without any regulation whatsoever is the road to happiness.  Invariably, this argument is made by people who have achieved security, whether by their own efforts or by the efforts perhaps of those who have gone before them, by hereditary advantage.  There is the notion abroad and no doubt luck, an t-ádh, plays a part in every human situation.  It was interesting to hear the Taoiseach on television on Friday or Saturday night last talking about this matter.  The Taoiseach, a man commendably modest, it must be said, when he was asked about his arrival in his position of eminence, repeated what had been said to him by somebody in America, some wise American: Má bhíonn tú ar an gcoirnéal cheart den tsráid cheart ag an am ceart ar an lá ceart&mdash;if you are at the right corner of the right street at the right time.  That can make up not 100 per cent of human events but a good 50 per cent.  As I say, the Taoiseach, with his modesty and his honesty, admitted this fact.  It is not often that one hears a politician admit these simple truths because they detract from the sin common to all politicians, that of vanity.  However, that was said. I want to put it the other way.  I want to turn that around and think of the unfortunates of the world and think of the disabled people, the disabled person who was at the wrong corner of the wrong street at the wrong time; in other words, who has not had that degree of fortune or luck which has attended the lives of others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> It is probably true to say that, with the advance of knowledge, the actual incidence of disablement itself, particularly congenital disablement, may be reduced in generations to come by the extension of the acquisition of further knowledge as to the root causes but that, for the moment, is something very much in the future.  The problem with which we are faced, the problem which lies on the conscience of this country, is the problem of the disabled as they are.  Of course, the solution would be made easier if we had full employment. We have not full employment.  We have a progressively increasing unemployment figure.  If one is to look at the future in a realistic way, there is no reason to suppose but that this figure may very well continue to increase if we are to face the winds of change which seem to be our lot in Europe.</P>
    <P>Emphasis is given then to the need for this measure at this time, the need for this degree of protection for the disabled. When you have unemployment, substantial unemployment, the fittest naturally have a very considerable advantage in taking up whatever jobs there happen to be.  In that kind of situation, even more so than in a condition where we might have&mdash;as we will, please God, one day, when we have a Government in power who have a proper view as to the needs of our Irish society&mdash;full employment, there is a greater need for a measure of this kind to be brought into operation on behalf of disabled people.</P>
    <P>In my experience, there has been a great lack of proper appreciation of the potential which is represented by the many thousands of disabled people throughout the 26 Counties.  How many thousands are there?  If you try to find out, you will get no adequate or reliable answer.  I have made inquiries in writing in different directions with the object of discovering an authoritative figure as to the number of disabled people, that is, people who are physically and may be deemed to be mentally disabled in Ireland.  Nobody can tell you.  There is no way, they say, of knowing.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister for Labour will justify his existence in <Col N="95" /> this particular.  Indeed he would more than justify his existence and his political career if he were to undertake to discharge the duty of society in this matter.  The first step is to discover how many disabled people there are.  There were over 18,000 at the end of March of last year in receipt of disability benefit.  This, of course, is no true indication of how many disabled people there were because this 18,000 would include people who are temporarily ill, out of work for reasons of a purely transient sickness.  In the 18,000 there is a very considerable number, not apparently determinable because nobody has undertaken the task of trying to discover it, who are permanently disabled. These are people who are certified weekly by doctors as being incapable of taking up ordinary employment. As I say, this 18,000 is impossible to break down because there is no source to which one can go for the analysis.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread misunderstanding in regard to disabled people. When disabled people are thought of, they are usually seen in the mind's eye as people who are physically deprived and they are usually thought of as persons of not great, and often very minimal, education.  For this reason they are regarded, mistakenly, by large numbers as a kind of an appendage, a lower appendage of the workingclass. This is a misconception and a grave one.  Some of the greatest people the world has ever seen have been people who were disabled.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was disabled; Fintan Lalor was disabled; Toulouse Lautrec was disabled.  The Minister has heard of him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Michael Davitt had one arm, an extraordinary man, described by one of the bishops as a strolling man of whom nobody should take heed in those days.  Some of the greatest people the world has seen, <Col N="96" /> and certainly this nation has seen, have been people who could fall within the category of those who must apply for disablement benefit.  I say this in an endeavour to wipe out the impression which is so erroneously obtained by so many that disablement is confined to one particular group of society.  One of the greatest public servants that we ever saw in this country was a man who suffered from a physical disability, a man whose mind and energies were unsurpassed and unsurpassable.</P>
      <P>I often think, and I am sure the Minister and any reasonable person will agree, that with disability there is a law of compensation at work which usually provides the disabled with an intense desire and drive to prove to themselves that they have the dignity common to other men, that they have the right to walk as equals with other men.  This natural compensation exists and results not alone in enabling them to prove themselves as good as others but in very many cases to prove themselves to be far superior to the rest of mankind.  It could be said, that physical handicap is a goad to achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times we have all decried in this House the loss to the nation resulting from children having to leave school before their full educational potential had been developed, and these were normal children.  Here is a world of relatively unexplored potential.  We will need to mobilise in Ireland all the talent we can in industry, in commerce, in the professions, in every direction, if we are to survive in the tough conditions which lie ahead of us.  We are a diminishing population.  I am not laying the blame on this Government now for that.  This is a trend which has continued.  The Government, of course, have their own responsibility for it but the Government did not start emigration.  Emigration seems to have been inherent in the nation since the Famine and has continued uninterruptedly since the Famine.  With communications as they are, with the alleged attractions of England being made more apparent to the youth through television, and so on, with simplicity of travel, the availability <Col N="97" /> of transport to a degree that did not exist before, it would appear that the population may continue in this disastrous downward direction.  If we visualise a declining population, it follows that we should lose no opportunity to foster talent wherever we can find it.  I am as sure as I am standing here that in the ranks of the disabled there is a reservoir of talent and perhaps flashes of genius which, if not encouraged and given a chance to develop, may be lost to us.</P>
    <P>The measure which I propose is designed to enable the disabled to display such qualities as they may have.  It is not alone for those who may be outstanding that I am concerned. I mention them merely as people who inevitably will develop if the Bill becomes law.  I am concerned mainly with the broad mass of disabled persons who never get a chance.</P>
    <P>I know that there are quite a large number of societies&mdash;I think, 30&mdash; caring for physically handicapped persons of one kind or another.  No words are needed from me in praise of those who run these societies and the noble, magnificent, self-sacrificing work of rehabilitation in which so many of these agencies and so many private citizens are engaged.  But the State should not be content to allow matters to rest at that.  Voluntary effort must be encouraged and praised and fostered in every way but there is a need for conscious regulation on the part of the central authority and an urgent need for it in order to ensure that the disabled worker will be given a chance &mdash;that is all we ask&mdash;a chance to live. That is all that this Bill seeks for the disabled&mdash;a chance to live.</P>
    <P>Nobody need tell me that if two men apply for a job, one of whom is obviously able&mdash;bodied whereas the other is obviously disabled, the disabled man will get the job.  We should try to put ourselves as a society into the mind of a worker who suffers from some disability and who has no way of concealing it.  Not all children are little angels.  Children can be very cruel to one another.  If a child has some disability which he cannot conceal, it sometimes happens that his playmates make life more difficult for him.  As <Col N="98" /> the child grows, life does not become any easier.  He finds himself pushed aside in the rush for advantage in the world as we know it, in the ruthless kind of society in which people have been brought up to push aside everybody in the path of self-advancement.</P>
    <P>What chance has a disabled person in that struggle?  Yet, by dint of this tremendous compensatory quality with which they are endowed, some disabled persons manage, not alone to survive in that unpleasant and awful, deadly struggle, but to get ahead of others. But of the majority, of the many thousands whose number we cannot determine, whose number the Minister will not be able to say and whose number apparently nobody is able to say&mdash;none of these societies, nobody interested in the subject, is able to say how many of these there are&mdash;we do not know how many will be made to suffer to a degree far beyond that which is apparent by their obvious external disabilities.</P>
    <P>In the last year and a half, we had great parades&mdash;I am not against parades or introducing a bit of colour into our lives&mdash;and we have commemorated and we are commemorating the gallant men of other years, and rightly so.  They say of the Irish&mdash;and talking of ourselves among ourselves we can say things which are not always the most pleasant but which we would take as deadly insults if they were said by outsiders&mdash;that we are a great race for commemorations, and it is true. When a man is safely dead, he was the greatest man in the world.  I remember that in my own lifetime in connection with one of the greatest social reformers this country ever saw and who was scarified and blackguarded into the ground right up to the moment, practically, when he breathed his last breath and overnight, because he was dead, he was almost canonised.  That is one of our faults.</P>
    <P>We have in the hall here, given to us by the late Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, the copy of the Proclamation, a wonderful literary effort, bearing on it the mark of literary nobility and the great talent of James Connolly and the others, the poets, who were with him. It bears the words &ldquo;to cherish all the <Col N="99" /> children of the nation equally.&rdquo;  At times it seems to me that this means nothing.  What does &ldquo;to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo; mean? It meant something to those men.  It must have meant something to them, or else why would they have gone to their death, an awful, ugly, cruel death?  What does it mean to us, to this Dáil which came into existence because of what they did?  Do we cherish all of the children of the nation equally?  Of course, we do not cherish them equally. Some amongst us, I am certain, do their best to achieve this end but there are others who do not seem to give a damn one way or another as long as they are here.  As was remarked by Dr. Johnson of a politician, he remembered he had a salary to draw but forgot that he had a duty to perform.</P>
    <P>There are some, I am afraid, who fall within that category, who do not seem to care very much.  However, there are others, and they are not confined to any one side of the House; they are to be found even in the Front Benches and in the back benches on all sides, who do really care.  This, of course, to the cynical who regard all politicians as mountebanks, may come as a surprise but there are in all Parties people who feel about social problems and who would not be here if they did not, whose only interest in being in the Dáil is to try to grasp this sorry scheme of things and remould it nearer to the heart's desire.  There is no greater degradation then the degradation of idleness.  There is no greater joy in life than the joy which comes from congenial work; there is know greater reaction, when all is said and done, when the pubs have emptied out and the fires of youth are banked down, than the work which one likes to do. There is a lot of truth in the words of the old preachers that an idle mind is the devil's workshop.  It is in this spirit that I ask the House to accept the proposition that I am putting forward here, that we should guarantee to disabled people, to the most helpless section of our community, a right to work, a chance to live.</P>
    <P>Within the past couple of months, I heard about a boy whom I knew as an <Col N="100" /> infant and who at the age of five years was stricken with polio.  All his right side, his right arm and leg, were badly affected.  However, he was fortunate because he shone at lessons and he applied himself with the energy to which I have referred to the task of learning and scholarship.  He did his leaving certificate last year and he got honours in four subjects, including Irish and two foreign languages.  He can write with his left hand far better than most of us can with our right hand.  He cannot write at all with his right hand.  He was looking for a job and he wrote 60 applications in reply to advertisements and there was not a hope for him, not a hope.  The position may have improved now but that was the situation at the time.  I do not think this is an isolated case.  There are many cases, perhaps very much worse, but we do not hear about them.  They are not brought to our notice.</P>
    <P>As well as this disinclination on the part of the State and the central authority to do something for the disabled, there is also a tendency, I am afraid, amongst certain sections of the population to try to conceal disablement in children.  This is a sort of a follow through of the old attitude which existed years ago towards other diseases, notably tuberculosis.  We all know people who will not mention the word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; for fear of it.  This concealment of tuberculosis in other years, particularly amongst families in rural areas, had economic connotations. We were all aware that a girl with tuberculosis did not have as good prospects of marriage as a healthy girl. There is still a carry over of that attitude among certain sections of the population which militates against the improvement of the lot of the disabled.</P>
    <P>The boy I mentioned is just one instance.  There are many other instances.  I had a man with me this afternoon who had heard about this Bill.  He lives in Ballyfermot, rather inevitably, I suppose.  He tells me that he was a soldier in the Army for 21 years.  About ten years ago he developed tuberculosis and was hospitalised in St. Bricin's.  He was discharged after 21 years' service with <Col N="101" /> active tuberculosis.  He went from St. Bricin's to Peamount Sanatorium where he spent a year.  He is a married man with three children, the eldest being 12 years.  As I said, he spent a year in Peamount and it was discovered that he had what is called a kidney disease.  He tells me that a gastroectomy was performed in 1959, if I have the medical term correctly.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the kidney was removed.  You can see by the man that he is not in the whole of his health, to put it mildly, by just talking to him.  He was in touch with another Member of this House to whom I will not refer by name, a Deputy who also represents the area of Ballyfermot, a person in some authority, who should have been able to help him.  He got a letter from the Department of Social Welfare dated 7th December, just in the mouth of Christmas, which said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am desired...to refer to your recent enquiry regarding your claim to disability benefit and to state that benefit has been paid to and including 3rd December, 1966.  Your claim was disallowed after that date following a second examination by a Medical Referree who again expressed the opinion that you were capable of light work.  Your claim has now been reviewed and it has been decided to resume payment of benefit <Col N="102" /> for a period of twelve months from this date....</P>
    <P>The amount he is getting for himself, his wife and three children is £5 18s a week.  The point is that he does not want £5 18 s a week for doing nothing. He wants a job doing light work. Through the good offices of the Deputy to whom I referred previously, he was sent for interview for a job in a Government Department of a nature suited to his abilities, but he was turned down.  Why?  On medical grounds.  He was deemed not to be capable of doing the job.  This is another example of what happens. This man is anxious to work.  He wants to work and in his own mind he is able to work, but that is too much to ask in this enlightened Christian society.</P>
    <P>The 18,000 people to whom I referred earlier get disabled persons' allowances to the amount of 47/6 a week only if they can prove they are destitute.  We know the definition of &ldquo;destitute&rdquo; from question and answer here last week.  If a person has a bed in the house, it does not matter if there are no clothes on it, he is not destitute. That is counted as income of 1/- per week under our philanthropic dispensation in the matter of social laws.  So a person has to prove destitution to get the 47/6d.  The people who founded the Minister's Party, and the people who founded this State, used to talk about the British poor law.  Dickens made a fortune writing about some aspects of it.  There was a television personality who was never done talking about it on British television.  He has now gone to his reward, whatever that might be.  The poor law was a better proposition than this.  This method of treatment and the amounts which are paid to these unfortunate people are worse than the British poor law.</P>
    <P>As I said, there were over 18,000 of these people on 31st March last, plus 161 persons undergoing rehabilitation. Of that huge concourse of people, 18,500, 161 persons were undergoing rehabilitation.  If I made no other arguments for the intervention of the State, or the central authority, or the Government, in this matter <Col N="103" /> ment is eloquent enough.  Most jobs that become available, if they are what can be called decent jobs with wages within reasonable limits, and if they have any security of employment attached to them, have also got a medical examination attached to them.</P>
    <P>This is part of the philosophical attitude of some, not all, employers. It would not be fair or right to say it applies to all employers, but of a very great proportion of our native-grown employing class it is true to say that when they look for labour they want the best; they want them in perfect condition.  In many cases, and certainly in regard to State employment, they have medical examinations before jobs are allocated, medical examinations for jobs which do not require medical examinations, jobs which would not impose any strain or necessitate strenuous activity&mdash;desk jobs, as they could be described.  Why should there be a medical examination for jobs such as that?  Why should the disabled be barred from jobs of that kind when they are the people who could discharge such jobs, I would say with certainty as effectively as, perhaps more effectively than, those who are lucky enough to be sound in mind and limb?</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to those who are unfortunate enough to be blind.  The Minister I know has circularised a number of organisations and asked for their views on this Bill.  I hope he has included the National League of the Blind, which is the most representative body concerning itself with the affairs of the blind in Ireland.  I have here a report over the name of Mr. Patrick Lyons, the general secretary of the National League of the Blind.  I should like to read this paragraph from it:</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to assess a problem, there are few things so frustrating as the inability to obtain such factual information as can be quoted with any degree of accuracy, and this is where our problems begin&mdash;in other words we are unable to say with any degree of certainty the actual extent of blindness in this part of Ireland. <Col N="104" /> The number of registered blind persons is generally given as about 7,000, but this figure, while no doubt being an approximation to reality, cannot be taken as accurate, because of the absence of a proper system of registration, and of a uniform definition of blindness.  This is why we urge as one of our objectives, the compiling by the appropriate Government Department of a proper register of blind persons with a view to the prevention of blindness where possible.  We further recommend the acceptance both by the State and local authorities of a uniform definition of blindness.</P>
    <P>There it will be seen&mdash;and I had no pre-knowledge of this report&mdash;that the views of Mr. Lyons, who must be regarded as an expert in this field because he is secretary of the organisation, coincide with mine, deduced quite independently of his.  The eloquence of these words is such that I think I should read them for the record:</P>
    <P>We have, I hope, average intelligence, and the genius or the backward person is as much the exception among the blind as in any other section of the community.  Blindness is a disability which imposes certain limitations.  The nature and extent of such limitations may depend in great measure on the person so handicapped, or on the circumstances under which blindness came about.  Never generalise about blind people.  The only common bond linking us may well be our inability to see.  Apart from this single factor sightless people vary enormously in interests, attitudes and temperaments.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister close study of this document which, I feel, if he has not got it he will be provided with, because it opens a window for us fortunate ones on the minds of those who are not quite so fortunate.</P>
    <P>This Bill which I propose will be hailed by the blind and by all other disabled people as a boon, but I do not claim any credit for that.  I am ashamed that it was not brought here long ago.  In drafting the Bill, I had the privilege of leaning upon British legislation in this matter, enlightened <Col N="105" /> British Labour legislation.  Twentyfour years ago the British introduced a Bill of this kind.  For 24 years in England the disabled have been looked after in the manner which I propose here.  It may be stated that 24 years ago there was a war on in England. It is true that often, to coin a phrase, &ldquo;out of evil cometh good&rdquo;.  War does produce, now and again, strange results. The last war gave us penicillin, for instance, as well as other things.  It gave us this Bill which was put on the Statute Book in England.</P>
    <P>Hansard covering that period makes fascinating reading, because quite apart from the question of war disabled who were being dealt with, at least 50 per cent of the discussion on the Bill as it went through the British House of Commons had to do with people who were disabled for congenital reasons or through accidents in industry.  In Britain, of course, they had a long history of industrial accidents, particularly in the mines, but, as I say, I had the privilege of reading the discussion that took place there.  Indeed, in my own experience of workers, I visited labour exchanges in and about Camden Town and other places when I was looking for work myself in bygone years.  I have seen the operation of the legislation in relation to disabled persons in Britain. Like all legislation, it cannot be described as the last word in social justice but, without question, it represents a tremendous improvement there.  It is not an improvement <i>vis-àvis</i> the situation here because here we are dependent upon the good nature and public spirit of a number of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and other people of that kind.  These are limited in number and limited in scope.  That is all we have here apart from the workshop for the blind and a few other employment outlets for the disabled.</P>
    <P>Guaranteeing work to those who require it is the fundamental principle enshrined in this Bill.  I understand that the Minister last week tried to jump the gun in this matter.  I do not care what he does so long as we get results.</P>

      <P>No. If I might pursue this without disorder, I should be very much obliged.  I want to make the issue very clear.  The people who take up this work of rehabilitation, as it is called, voluntarily are beyond praise. They should be embraced in whatever institutions are set up, on a national advisory council, or provincial or regional councils.  But the principle I seek to establish is that the State will lay it down as the law that in every firm in which there are considerable numbers of workers, beginning with the Civil Service, going on to the semi-State bodies, to the local authorities, to those industries which are helped by the State and those industries which employ large numbers of workers, a minimal percentage of jobs will be provided for these people.  I want the Government to tell employers that it is their duty to employ disabled from the register in certain jobs and, if they do not do so, they will be guilty of a breach of the law.  That is the principle.  I hope there will be no evasion of it.  It is a principle the initiation of which here is long overdue. I have asked questions about this in the past but I never got anywhere. I hoped at one stage that redundancy amongst Ministers and the changes in personnel would eventually throw up somebody with an enlightened outlook who would do this as a member of the Government so that neither I nor anybody else would have to fight for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to what is, perhaps, the most difficult and complex aspect of what is described as rehabilitation, namely, the employment of the disabled.  I want to deal in this context with the problem of the mentally retarded.  I have looked through the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Mental Handicap which was issued in 1965.  The Commission was constituted of eminent, interested and dedicated people.  They examined the situation in relation to mental care, treatment and education, particularly the education of young people mentally retarded.  They presented a document which is very useful as far as it goes.  It gives a picture of the situation.  They made recommendations in regard to improvements in <Col N="107" /> methods of care of the mentally sick. They suggested the initiation of steps to enable little children to be educated at least in part.</P>
    <P>The problem is unquestionably complex.  I have some acquaintance with mental hospitals in this city.  I was a member of the Old Grangegorman Joint Board, as were other Members of this House.  I have had occasion to visit patients in mental hospitals.  I want now to pay a special tribute to that small group of employers in Dublin who have endeavoured to provide occupational therapy for certain of these patients.  To people such as those who are already employed, this Bill, if it comes into effect, will not make any real difference.  These employers are already doing the good work set out in the Bill.  Unfortunately, not all, and indeed very few, employers have that interest in the people to whom I refer. The Report of the Commission did, as I say, an excellent job in its own way, but it did not propose a solution.  I suppose it takes temerity for anybody to presume that he has a solution to the rehabilitation of mentally ill people or the provision of employment for them.</P>
    <P>This is the big problem of our age, the biggest problem and one in relation to which we feel particularly helpless. It is something, nevertheless, which we have to face.  It is the problem of the future and I have not the slightest doubt that, as time goes on and as technology develops and medicine develops, some answers will be found for the multifarious aspects of the mentally distressed.  Given all that, remember the famous statement of the man to whom I referred earlier as one of the most eminent of disabled men&mdash; James Fintan Lalor, the hunchback from outside the Heath of Maryboro, the man with the gift of imagination and foresight.  What did he say? &ldquo;Somewhere, somehow and by somebody a beginning must be made.&rdquo;  A beginning must be made here with the colossal problem of ensuring that those who are mentally ill, retarded, and who are capable of being put to work if provided with the opportunity will be provided for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> Again, in this matter of the numbers of people who may be described as mentally handicapped, it is difficult to get conclusive figures.  For instance, in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry there is a totally different set of figures from those given in the document produced by the Department of Health, &ldquo;The Problem of the Mentally Handicapped&rdquo;.  I shall refer to the document issued by the Department of Health because I think that the incumbent, at the time at any rate, of that office was a man on whose word one could rely.  It says that there are 18,000 mildly handicapped people in the country and 4,800 moderately handicapped people.  In other words, it is reasonable to say that there are approximately 23,000 mentally handicapped people who could be brought, with an effort, within some distance of proving themselves useful citizens. What greater cure can there be for such people than to be restored to the companionship of fellow workers and to join in the ordinary business of life? It does not seem to me that enough is being done in this regard.  In so far as this Bill can help, or urge, or if necessary, compel greater attention to, and speed up, the task of bringing those who are mentally handicapped, moderately or mildly as described in this document, and who can work, nearer to the therapy of daily work, I want to urge it on the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the document on mental handicap issued by the Department of Health, paragraph 31, page 10, says: &ldquo;The placing in employment with adequate after-care of patients who have been trained in residential institutions and who are capable of employment has already been mentioned.  How should such placing and after-care be organised and who should be responsible for it?&rdquo; There is a question mark after that and that is what we are left with&mdash;a question mark.  It is in an endeavour to answer that question that I have tabled this Bill.  I tabled it, seeing that nobody else is bothering.</P>
    <P>I have urged on the Minister as best I can the considerations which prompted me to table the Bill.  First of all the Bill provides for the establishment of a register; it provides that <Col N="109" /> every disabled person in the country shall, if he or she so desires, apply to have his or her name included in the register of disabled people.  The Bill also provides for substantial employers, and the definition of a &ldquo;substantial employer&rdquo; is left completely to the Minister.  It can be discussed with voluntary bodies&mdash;the National Advisory Council and, I suppose, the provincial councils or regional councils. The definition of a substantial employer can be determined by the Minister and these other parties.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that every substantial employer shall, as determined by the Minister, be required to take into employment a percentage of disabled people.  I must emphasise that it does not at any stage or in any particular require that there should be any disemployment of people in existing jobs.  There will be no interference whatsoever, if this Bill becomes law, with those in existing jobs.  It refers only to vacancies in the future.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give this Bill serious and urgent consideration.  He will also have consultation with the National Advisory Council, if the Bill becomes law, or if the principle is accepted, and I do not care what he does with the Bill if he accepts the principle.  All I want to get, as I have said twice, or possibly three times, before, is a chance in life for disabled people, a chance for them to live in the same way as other citizens.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Minister will be able to determine, or each employer will&mdash;and I stress particularly the Civil Service, semi-State bodies and the local authorities&mdash;what the quotas will be.  He will also, in consultation with the parties to whom I have referred, be enabled by the Bill to designate particular jobs as suitable to be filled only by disabled people.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In asking the House to give the Bill a Second Reading, I want to avail of <Col N="110" /> the opportunity to clear up a great deal of misconceptions which have been circulating in the past few days with regard to this whole matter.  I want to emphasise strongly to the House that I am under no embarrassment whatever in introducing this Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.  There is no reason indeed why an embarrassment should attach to anybody in this House, anybody in the Seanad, anybody in the Government, or anybody who had anything to do with the preparation of the Income Tax (Consolidation) Bill of 1966.  We are dealing here with what I would call a practical, sensible, parliamentary device to overcome a difficulty which has arisen.</P>
    <P>I want to stress especially that the Standing Joint Committee which laboured so long and arduously over the Income Tax Bill of 1966 did its work competently and thoroughly.  I want to repeat that we are all, and should all be, profoundly grateful to that Committee for the magnificent work it did.  In particular, I have no hesitation in paying a tribute to the Chairman of that Committee, Deputy Sweetman, for the dedication he brought to his work on the Committee and, indeed, for the anxious way in which he watched over the development of this monumental piece of legislation from its earliest stages. That applies equally to all the other members of the Standing Joint Committee. Nothing could be further from the truth than that this Committee, or indeed the House, or the Government, overlooked in any way the question of the impact of the Constitution on the Income Tax Bill of 1966.  I want to scotch any such erroneous impression.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Standing Joint Committee has been printed and published and is available to anybody who wants to read it.  Anybody who takes the trouble to read the Report will find that on Thursday, 5th January last, at a meeting of the Committee, Mr. V. Grogan, the Director of the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, was called before the Committee and examined.  I want to read you the Report of the Committee on that examination.  I shall read it in full <Col N="111" /> because I think it important I should do so.</P>
    <P>The Chairman, Deputy Sweetman, posed the first question and said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Grogan, you have examined the Bill, as apart from preparing it, and you have examined all the amendments submitted and passed by the Committee?</P>
    <P>Reply: I have.</P>
    <P>Question: Are you satisfied that the Bill as amended by the Committee, represents the present statute law?</P>
    <P>Reply: I am.</P>
    <P>Question: In connection with income tax?</P>
    <P>Reply: Yes.</P>
    <P>Question: And leaving out, of course, any reference to corporation profits tax but putting in references to income tax and sur-tax that might have appeared in a corporation profit tax Act or section?</P>
    <P>Reply: That is so.</P>
    <P>Question: Any member of the Committee is entitled now to put any question he wants to the witness.</P>
    <P>Major de Valera: The Attorney General has certified that this Bill is in accordance with legislation as it stands.  I take it that means that it embodies all provisions which are on the Statute Book and it is not a certificate as to what the law is at the moment?</P>
    <P>Reply: I agree.  The Attorney General's certificate is in conformity with the Standing Orders of the Dáil and Seanad and merely certifies that the Bill reproduces the existing enactments as they now appear on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Question: Is there any implication that every provision in this Bill is good law at the moment?</P>
    <P>Reply: No.  That would be beyond the function of the Attorney General in connection with a Consolidation Bill.</P>
    <P>Question: Is there implied any judgment as to the enforceable validity <Col N="112" /> of such a section as section 483?</P>
    <P>Reply: No.  No such implication could be raised on the Attorney General's certificate.</P>
    <P>Question: On constitutional grounds or otherwise?</P>
    <P>Reply: The Attorney General's certificate is, I repeat, in compliance with the Standing Orders of the Dáil and Seanad in relation to Consolidation Bills and the Attorney General is entitled to do no more than that.</P>
    <P>Question: As the Bill stands, the intention is that the law will be as heretofore on the Statute Book?</P>
    <P>Reply: The intention must arise from the construction of the statute. The intention of the Oireachtas in passing this Act is to make no change in the law as it appears on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Question: As it appears on the Statute Book?</P>
    <P>Reply: Yes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The witness then withdrew.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have read this Report of the Standing Joint Committee because I feel I must make it abundantly clear that the Committee had regard at all times to the difficulties that might possibly arise in regard to the constitutionality or otherwise of some of the provisions of this Consolidation Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that the Income Tax Bill of 1966 is a Consolidation Bill and the very essence of a Consolidation Bill is that it can do no more and no less than consolidate the statute law as it stands.  A consolidation Bill could not attempt or purport to remove anything from the law; or put anything into the law.  The Committee had to satisfy itself that it did precisely what it should do in accordance with our Standing Orders, namely, take all the statute law as we have it in this country governing income tax and put it into one statute.  This is very valuable work indeed.  I know from my own experience and from things said to me by accountants and lawyers during the past few days that many people are anxious to get this piece of legislation into law because it will be of very <Col N="113" /> great assistance to a considerable number of people in our community if they can have all the law governing income tax available to them in one modern statute.</P>
    <P>A difficulty has arisen and it is an understandable difficulty.  This provision which is in the Consolidation Bill, in section 483, was in the Income Tax Act of 1918.  Of course, we know that the situation was changed in this regard by the enactment of the Constitution. At the Committee, when the question of the constitutionality of section 483 was raised, I gave an assurance to the Chairman and the members that I was aware of their doubts about this section and their unhappiness about it but that I would avail of the first opportunity, namely, the forthcoming Finance Bill either to repeal this provision in its entirety, or to modify it in some way which would make it acceptable to Deputies and to the House as being in conformity with the Constitution and with, indeed, all our ideas as to how these matters should be conducted. I want to pay a tribute to the Committee and its members that they accepted that assurance on my part and agreed that this was a sensible parliamentary procedure; that the Consolidation Bill could be allowed to proceed as it stood on the basis of my assurance that this matter would be put right to everybody's satisfaction at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the Bill then went to the President for signature.  The President, of course, who exercises a different function in regard to legislation from the function we exercise, apparently had doubts as to the constitutionality of some of the provisions in the Bill and had to consider whether or not it was his duty to refer the measure to the Supreme Court for a decision.  In that situation, it seemed to me and to the Government that the sensible thing to do, at this stage, was to bring in this amending Bill to delete from the consolidation measure, when it becomes law, two provisions, to which exception might possibly be taken and which might cause difficulty as to their constitutionality.</P>
    <P>That is simply what we are doing here.  I am asking the House to pass <Col N="114" /> the Bill, the purpose of which is to remove from the consolidation measure section 483 in its entirety and section 480, subsections (2) and (3).  I am hoping the Bill will be passed by the Dáil today and by the Seanad tomorrow and will go to the President for signature tomorrow.  I think this is a sensible, practical parliamentary procedure for getting out of this difficulty which has arisen.  I again wish to emphasise that this House, this Oireachtas, is not here attempting to pass any new law.  If we were attempting to do that, I would suggest it would be the duty of the Government and the Opposition and everybody else to be vigilant that we did not attempt to pass legislation which would be unconstitutional or which could be held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I think that situation would apply to us if we were enacting some new provisions here; but as a House of Parliament, when we were consolidating a measure, a different obligation was placed on us.  We were setting out to consolidate all the statute law as it stood in the Statute Book, and therefore, as the Oireachtas, we could not have regard to whether particular provisions in a consolidation measure were constitutional or not, because all we could do in bringing in this consolidation measure was to ensure that the measure was in accordance with Standing Orders.  Despite the fact that the Select Committee in particular and the House also did not have to have regard to the constitutional provisions in regard to this measure, nevertheless they were sufficiently alert to advert to them as one can see from the Report which I have read.</P>
    <P>I again wish to say to the House that this is an important measure from my point of view.  I think it will be very useful, very helpful to many people.  If we are not able to adhere to our time schedule and have a Consolidation Bill passed by 6th April this year, the whole procedure will have to start all over again and that would be a very great waste from my point of view, from the point of view of many others, particularly here in the House, and to many members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the <Col N="115" /> Revenue Commissioners.  All the work would have gone to waste and would have to be started all over again.  In order to try to obviate that, I am adopting this procedure, which I admit is somewhat unusual, but is in accordance with our Standing Orders and rules, namely, excising from the consolidation measure these provisions which might lead to difficulty and excising them in advance so that when the Consolidation Bill becomes law, they will not ever come into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The solicitude being shown in certain quarters for the taxpayer in relation to section 483 is, to put it mildly, somewhat belated.  We must remember that that section has been in our statute law for 50 years and that during a very large part of that period, more than 20 years, that solicitude was not shown by a person who was then in a position to bring an Act to the House, if he so desired. The Minister has given an accurate description of what transpired in the Committee but I do not think he has given quite a full description.  I think there were added to the deliberations of the Committee two other things.  One is that the Minister would repeal the section by which there was susceptibility entertained and that the Minister would not act on the section until then. It seemed to me, therefore, that once the Committee had that express undertaking from the Minister in his position as a corporate sole, there was not anything more than mere technicality in dealing with the matter otherwise.  Two is that the Minister will remember that at the meeting of the Committee, I suggested to him that another way of dealing with the matter was to introduce a Revision Bill before the Consolidation Bill.  That, in fact, was the order adopted by Deputy Dillion when he introduced the Fisheries Statute Law (Revision) Bill and subsequently the Fisheries Consolidation Bill.  The Minister will agree that if similar procedure had been adopted in this case, the problem would not have arisen now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am fairly summarising the Minister's view when he said there was some doubt about whether the hen or <Col N="116" /> the egg came first but to suggest, as was suggested, that these matters were not considered by the Committee was irresponsible in the extreme.  It is extraordinary that when it is in the Report of the Committee, when many members were available to have inquiry made of them, the Report does not appear to have been read and apparently no inquiry was made of any Committee member because if any member of the Committee had been asked, I cannot see how he would forget the discussion we had on the matter.</P>
    <P>A consolidation measure re-enacts the statute law as it stands and the consolidation procedure does not permit the Committee or this House to make any variation in the statute law as it is.  It was therefore incumbent on all of us to include these sections. I am not, as I have said, impressed by the solicitude for the taxpayer at this late stage.  There are other problems far more pressing and to which attention could have been given with much better results for the community as a whole, particularly when the Minister very clearly not merely gave the Committee an undertaking that he would repeal the sections but in addition, that they would not be operated in the interim.  It would seem to me, for example, that the divisions there are in the agricultural community could be solved and they would be more pressing for solution than to bring in a technical Bill like this purely to cover something that has in fact already been covered by the Minister's undertaking.</P>
    <P>I do not know why those matters have to be dealt with in this way.  It is a mistake and a pity that this solicitude should not have been exercised at an earlier date when power was there to exercise it.  We should keep this matter in its proper perspective, that this section has been on the Statute Book for 50 years.  It was adopted by the Constitution&mdash;I think, in Article 50&mdash;and comes in here merely as a re-enactment of something which could not be altered at that stage.  Everybody concerned had indicated that they were going to alter it <Col N="117" /> at the first available date.  In those circumstances, the necessity for this Bill is not apparent to me, nor is the needless haste in relation to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my wish to hold up the House.  If this Bill was not brought in as an urgent measure, I would probably propose, on Committee Stage, an amendment on the same constitutionality, that is, that Chapter I, Part IX, of the Bill be taken out because Article 41 of the Constitution lays down that the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded.  In Part IX of this Bill, section 192, the position of the wife who happens to take up employment is seriously interfered with.  It starts off in section 192 by deeming that a wife's income be her husband's, if she is living with him, and if she is not living with him, or is not married to him, will be treated as separate.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention this about the Bill.  I was a little disappointed that Deputy Sweetman, being such a model Chairman of the Committee, could not resist bringing in a political angle at the moment.  I am sorry he did that.  However, <Col N="118" /> let us get down to this.  This is merely, and quite rightly, a technical amendment and it should not take up the time of the House, once we understand what we are doing.</P>
      <P>There were two simple issues in this. Many points were raised and as the Minister has given details in regard to them I shall not go into them.  A very important point in regard to a Consolidation Bill was whether the Committee could amend it or could not amend it.  I will not hold up the House by going into all the details.  The Committee, by its terms of reference, could not do other than it did.  The Minister gave the Committee his undertaking and the amendments were to take place simultaneously.  This amendment Bill is merely a procedural matter. We should confine ourselves to that alone.</P>

      <P>It would be more helpful if we tried to confine ourselves to this amending Bill rather than introducing irrelevancies such as Deputy Donegan has tried to introduce.  We have heard it said outside the House that this objectionable income tax provision has lain on the Statute Book for so long without anybody knowing anything about it.  Even Deputy Sweetman suggested it is entirely Fianna Fáil responsibility that it was not rejected many years ago.  He overlooked the fact that he had ample opportunity himself, as Minister for Finance, to do this, if he so wished.</P>

      <P>It should go on record that in fact the Revenue Commissioners did not exercise this power directly, but, to my mind, what is rather sinister is that they have always advised the Minister that it would be desirable to retain this power which they had <i>in terrorem</i>, as a threat against those who are alleged to be evading or avoiding the payment of tax.  I feel, at this stage, that we will save a great waste of time by putting this Bill through so that it shall not be necessary to go through the whole procedure of referring the Principal Bill for judgment by the Supreme Court.  I suppose it is more than likely that the Supreme Court would have ruled that those provisions were unconstitutional. No useful purpose will be served by asking the Supreme Court to go through all that when there is an easier way to do it.  We have power here to deal with this matter in this way.  It can be done very rapidly and will improve the law enormously. There is no Party advantage to be gained on either side.  This is something for which the whole House has a responsibility and the sooner and quicker we do it the better.</P>

      <P>What we are doing may be slightly peculiar but we can all value this as an experience and maybe a new lesson learned as to what our approach should be to Consolidation Bills.  I must frankly confess that I thought little about Consolidation Bills but I believe much more could be done.  From what has emerged here in the past few days, our whole approach in matters like this will have to be changed.  I do not know how that may be done but if there is to be consolidation of income tax law, or anything else, I believe the Committee appointed should have the power to make its own deletions and make necessary changes.  As Deputy Sweetman has said, the peculiar thing is that we have lived with this for the past 50 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This refers specifically to the Act of 1918.  How much more of our laws are unconstitutional? Under our present system of dealing with consolidation, are we going to find much more legislation unconstitutional? This is one of the first occasions &mdash;I do not remember any other&mdash;that a President, as distinct from Parliament, had an opportunity of deciding to challenge the constitutionality of a particular section.  In the meantime, as the Minister has said, we have been living with these two sections for the past 100 years.</P>
      <P>We have no objection to the terms of the Bill.  As far as we are concerned, we want to give it to the Minister as quickly as possible.  But it has taught us a good lesson with regard to consolidation and the examination of statutes enacted long before the present Constitution and long before the establishment of this House and of an Irish Government.  I therefore think the whole matter of the revision of our laws should be tackled and not alone in regard to this legislation, because I am sure every Deputy can mention some section of some Act which is contrary to the Constitution of 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued many times in this House that much of the British tax law which has operated in this country is completely unsuited to our conditions and requirements.  I believe this exercise which we are now engaging in very significantly proves my point, for we have had on our Statute Book for 50 years a tax law which, for most of those 50 years, has flagrantly violated the Constitution.  I want to point out to the House that this British tax law, section 165 of the British Income Tax Act of 1918, has long since been repealed in Britain.  It was repealed in Britain 20 years ago in section 26 of the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people concerned about income tax are very well aware that successive Ministers for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have almost invariably copied British law changes in respect of tax legislation. That was an essential corollary of the <Col N="121" /> operation of the British Income Tax Act of 1918.  I have said before in this House and I say again now, that we have copied the British when they plugged the loopholes, when they tightened the screw in respect of tax legislation, but failed to copy them in those cases where they lightened the legislative burden.  I have said before that successive Ministers for Finance in this country have been too readily prepared to live with the maxim that equity is a stranger to income tax.  It was open to any Minister over the past 50 years to bring in the required change in the annual Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Britain consolidated her tax law in 1952 and this offending provision was, of course, omitted from that British Consolidation Act, having been previously repealed in 1947 under the Crown Proceedings Act.  I believe that there has been a dead hand of conservatism dominating successive Ministers for Finance in respect of tax reform.  I believe that the exercise we are now engaging in proves that point. I believe that the people of this country have been badly served by successive Dála, by successive Governments and successive Ministers for Finance in respect of tax reform.</P>
    <P>Finally, I invite the Minister to do something which to date he has not yet done, though there was vague talk about it when the Consolidation Bill was going through, that is, to indicate that the enactment of the Consolidation Bill and of this Bill is a preliminary step to a decisive programme of reform of our tax laws, which are so unsuited to our country and many of which, not only the offensive sections we are dealing with now but other vast chunks, have been deleted from British law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is the easiest way out of the circumstances in which we find ourselves now.  Otherwise, as the Minister has pointed out, it would be necessary to do a great deal of recasting, or whatever the technical term is, of the Consolidation Bill.  I just want to mention one point.  Deputy Booth said that the particular section had never been invoked. I want to point out to the <Col N="122" /> House a very famous case where it was invoked.  This concerned a gentleman who had done a tax fraud between this country and England.  He had got English rebates on alleged payment of Irish income tax, which in fact had never been paid.  But, before he left the country, he boasted of the fact he had never paid any Irish income tax.  Apparently, as he went on the boat, he was seized under that section of the Act.  I point that out to Deputies to show that it was used once at least and may have been used&mdash;I am sure it was&mdash;on other occasions, though perhaps very seldom.</P>
      <P>What one wonders is: in very extreme cases&mdash;I would ask the Minister this&mdash;what would the procedure be now where somebody, we will say criminally-minded, was endeavouring to leave the country, having evaded his just obligations?  One can imagine that there are cases, although very rare, when the law would like to have certain powers.  In fact, a certain very famous case in this country comes to mind.  I will not go into any details, but it was a famous stamp case which is known to us all.  If some spectacular arrest could have been made on a boat or aeroplane, certainly many people in this country might be happier and, indeed, better off at this moment.  I would ask the Minister what steps, if any, have been taken to fill the lacuna caused by the excision of these sections of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall perhaps deal with this last point of Deputy Dockrell's first because I agree it is important.  I have already said that I gave the Select Committee a solemn undertaking that we would ensure that the Revenue Commissioners would not operate this particular offending section, pending its repeal or its modification in the forthcoming Finance Bill. Deputy Sweetman is quite right to remind me of that.  I am sorry I omitted to mention it in my opening remarks but it is perfectly true that it was given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The question posed by Deputy Dockrell must be answered in this way.  In the interim, the Revenue Commissioners would have recourse to the normal processes of the law.  They would have recourse to the courts and so on, if they wished to apprehend any defaulters.  The question of what procedure we might put into the new Finance Bill to replace this particular procedure is one to which we are giving a great deal of thought at the moment.  It was always in my mind that something should be substituted for this particular provision. I hope we may be able to hammer out a procedure which will commend itself to Deputies, in the first instance, and be acceptable to all concerned as constitutional, in the second.  This is a matter to which we are giving attention at the moment.  That is the reply to Deputy Dockrell.  First, this procedure will not be operated at all between now and the forthcoming Finance Bill and the Revenue Commissioners will have available to them only the normal processes of law.  We hope to devise some procedure instead of the procedure we are hoping to get rid of here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish is quite right when he says this does throw a spotlight on our methods of consolidation.  Part of the difficulty we are in arises from that very fact.  I doubt if anybody ever visualised that a consolidation measure would be the subject of reference to the Supreme Court.  I think most people would have thought that reference to the Supreme Court would be applicable to new legislation where this House was attempting to do something which might not be in accordance with the constitutional provisions. The constitutional provision in respect of reference to the Supreme Court would be clearly applicable to such a situation.  The difficulty that has arisen here is that on the one hand, we are governed by the requirement not to amend or change the law, and, on the other, the President has a duty to ensure that any Bill he signs conforms with the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman says, and he is perfectly entitled to argue, that he does not see any necessity for this piece of <Col N="124" /> legislation.  I suggest that if he does not see any necessity for it, perhaps he might go the step further and say: &ldquo;Even though I see no necessity for it, if the Government regard it as necessary, and in the interests of this excellent piece of legislation which we all hope to see enacted, I am prepared to accept the Government's proposal in regard to this Bill which is now before the House.&rdquo;  I urge Deputies to see this proposal in that way, that we are in this difficulty which has arisen through no fault of anybody's, a difficulty to which our various procedures have given rise and that we have here, I hope, a way out of the difficulty which should meet everybody's point of view.  I would again point out how necessary it is that we get this consolidation measure on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  It would be a very great pity if it had to be abandoned at this stage for many reasons but particularly I would say that because of all the valuable work that has gone into its preparation and getting it to this stage, it would be a tragedy to abandon it now.  For that reason, I urge Deputies to give me this measure and so enable the House to overcome these technical difficulties in which we find ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When I moved the adjournment of the debate, I was dealing with Part III of the Bill, with particular reference to section 22 which seeks to restore to the Minister for Justice the right to restore driving licences which have been taken away by the courts.  I pointed out that between 1933 and 1961, the Minister for Justice for the time being had the right to restore any driver's licence which was taken away by the courts. Experience in that period of 30 years demonstrated clearly that this was an unwise and even a dangerous power in the hands of a Minister for Justice.  It was apparently realised that pressure could be brought to bear on the strongest Minister for Justice to force him to restore a driving licence, which had properly been taken away by the court, when he was not happy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1961 Act&mdash;very wisely, in my opinion&mdash;took away from the Minister for Justice the right to restore <Col N="126" /> these drivers' licences.  In doing that, it restored confidence to the general public.  The general public became satisfied that, once a driver's licence had been taken away, it could be restored only in public court after an application had been made to the district justice after a period of six months or to the Circuit Court by way of appeal.  I think everybody was quite happy about that provision.  The experience of nearly 30 years demonstrated that the procedure whereby the Minister, by a stroke of his pen, could restore drivers' licences was quite unsatisfactory. We all remember the announcements in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> from time to time giving notice that the Minister had restored the following driving licences.  That became a source of minor scandal and led, in my opinion, to the abolition of the right by the Act of 1961.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that the Minister is not here seeking power to restore consequential disqualification orders. I know that.  I know that when a man is disqualified for drunken driving under the new measure, if it becomes law, the Minister will not have power to restore a licence.  I fully appreciate that.  The Minister would have the power to restore ancillary disqualification orders, that is, disqualification orders made for other reasons&mdash;in cases of dangerous driving, and I suppose, dangerous parking, and so on. I do not see why the Minister should seek this power.  The Minister seeks to justify this section by saying that if the Minister has not this power, an irreparable injustice may be done.  A man may be deprived of his driver's licence for a period of two months or three months by some unreasonable district justice.  He may be compelled to suffer that penalty and would have no redress.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that there are ways out of the difficulty other than the undesirable one of going back on a practice which was in operation here for 30 years and which the general public believe was abused.  The Minister says that a district justice might refuse to suspend the operation of an ancillary disqualification order pending an appeal and that, as a result of that refusal, an accused person <Col N="127" /> of my colleague, the Minister for Local would, in certain circumstances, suffer the full disqualification before his appeal came on for hearing in the Circuit Court.  The Minister knows perfectly well that there is a simple way of remedying that situation.  He can write into this Bill a section to the effect that, in the case of an ancillary disqualification by a district justice, a district justice shall, on request made to him, suspend the coming into operation of the ancillary disqualification order pending an appeal.  In that way, no injustice can be done.  Indeed, the Minister could say that the coming into operation of an ancillary order would automatically be suspended on the lodgment of notice of appeal.  I think the first method I have suggested is preferrable, that is, the one that the district justice would be obliged to suspend the ancillary disqualification order on request, pending appeal.  I think that is the simple way out of the difficulty to which the Minister referred. It is one which would be welcomed by the public and it is one which would take a bad appearance from this part of the Bill.  That is all I want to say about that section; I shall have more to say about it on Committee.  I shall certainly put down an amendment but it is clear, beyond doubt, that it is not necessary to restore to the Minister the power to revoke a court order in order to get over the difficulty of the short suspension of a driver's licence.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word or two in a general sort of way about section 19 of Part III.  This is a section which makes it obligatory on a person, on an application for a driver's licence, to undergo an eyesight test at the same time.  The section operates like all the other sections of the Act, partly through itself and partly through regulations which the Minister will make.  Reading between the lines in the section and the explanatory memorandum, I get the impression that it is the intention of the Minister that the driver-tester, a mechanic, skilled in the driving of a motor car, is the person who is going to carry out this eye test.  If it is, if that is the position, I think it is certainly going very far.  If it is not the position, I hope the Minister <Col N="128" /> will say so when replying to this debate.  I could not agree for one moment that a person should be refused a driver's licence on the ground that his eyesight is unsatisfactory on the word of a driver-tester, who, as I say, is a mechanic without any experience at all in the art of testing eyes and who has no medical qualification.</P>
    <P>Mark you, if I understand the section correctly a person who is refused a licence by a driver-tester will have to appeal to the District Court against the decision of the driver-tester that his eyesight is not good before he can get a licence.  I certainly think that a member of the public should not be put to that expense.  If he is to be refused a driving licence on the ground that his eyesight is bad it should only be done on the certificate of a properly qualified doctor.  It is rather difficult to follow what exactly is meant by section 19 because you are thrown back on these regulations but on referring to the explanatory memorandum, I gather that the person who will test the eyes of the applicant is the driver-tester.</P>
    <P>The controversial part of this Bill is Part V which deals with driving offences with particular reference to driving or attempting to drive or being in charge of a motor vehicle while impaired due to the consumption of alcohol or a drug.  I want to make it perfectly clear at this stage that I fully appreciate the seriousness of driving or attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle while a person is impaired due to the consumption of alcohol or the taking of a drug. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am prepared to give the Minister all reasonable powers to deal with the drunken driver and that I believe that the Minister should have such powers as are reasonably necessary to ensure that drunken driving is discouraged and that people who are guilty of that offence will be brought to justice and put off the roads.  At the same time, we could allow our concern for the harm that can be done to people and property by drunken driving to blind us to the necessity for safeguarding the liberty of the subject <Col N="129" /> and the rights of the individual.  That is the danger I see in dealing with something about which people can get so concerned and so &ldquo;het&rdquo; up as about the question of driving.</P>
    <P>I am prepared even to agree to break new ground with the Minister and to provide scientific tests, but in doing so, I believe that we should be careful to ensure that a person remains innocent until he is proved guilty, and I believe, too, that we should respect the code of criminal law that has been in operation here for many years and that we should not too easily or too readily go abroad to the Continent of Europe or elsewhere and take a part of a continental criminal court and bring it over here and put it into operation, without being sure that it is suited to our conditions here and without being sure that it is suited to our tradition.</P>
    <P>We had an example of that some very few years ago in another field of law reform when the Minister for Justice sought to transplant a continental form of succession law in this country.  A Succession Bill was introduced by the Minister&mdash;I fear without giving it very much thought&mdash;but it soon became apparent that it was quite unsuited to our conditions and that it would not have been accepted by the people as a proper system of succession, so much so that on Second Reading the Minister, who introduced the measure, or his successor, ran away from it.  Indeed, he did not even wait until the Second Reading speech because I think he held a press conference and disowned the whole thing. I shall not go into this in any further detail, beyond saying that when the Succession Bill became law, its own father would not know it.  It was a completely different measure and an infinitely better measure which by and large does its job and at the same time, respects the wishes of the people, respects the traditions of the country and respects the circumstances of Irish family life.</P>
    <P>I hope that when Part V of this Bill becomes law, it also will have been amended to such an extent that, while it will still give the Minister the authority he seeks to deal with the <Col N="130" /> drunken driver, it will still respect the liberty of the individual and will preserve the fundamental rights of accused persons.</P>
    <P>I agree with the introduction by the Minister of a breath, blood and/or urine test with qualifications, subject to what I will say afterwards.  I believe that these scientific tests, and the results of them properly placed before the courts as evidence, can be of considerable help.  Therefore, I am, broadly speaking, in agreement with the sections of this Part of the Bill which introduce for the first time in this country, in the detection of the offence commonly known as drunken driving, the breath test and the blood test with the alternative of a urine test.</P>
    <P>Where I differ from the Minister is in the weight the court is to attach to the result of these tests.  Experience in the courts in this country over the past 30 years or so shows that, where a person is accused of drunken driving and is acquitted, he is usually acquitted because a <i>prima facie</i> case has not been established against him and because he is not called upon to enter the witness box.</P>
    <P>One does not like speaking of one's personal experience in one's professional capacity, but I do not mind going on record as saying that I have represented in my professional capacity as a solicitor dozens, and I suppose, maybe many more than dozens, of persons charged with drunken driving, and I suppose I succeeded in having a percentage of those persons acquitted, but in nearly every case they were acquitted because a <i>prima facie</i> case was not established against them, and because it was not necessary for them to call a witness to rebut any evidence called by the State.  That is my personal experience and I feel it must be the experience of other advocates who have experience of this type of case.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a figure of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood as indicating that the person concerned is considerably impaired. As the Minister says, he could either have made the presence of that percentage or any given percentage of <Col N="131" /> alcohol evidence to be taken into consideration by the court in trying the person charged, or he could have made it <i>prima facie</i> evidence imposing on the accused person the onus of proof that he was fit to drive; or he could have made it absolute evidence that the person concerned was impaired to such an extent that he could not safely drive.  The last is what the Minister has done here.  He has made the presence of 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood conclusive evidence of unfitness to drive.  I say that that is going much too far.</P>
    <P>Our object and, I am sure, the Minister's object in introducing this Bill, is to put off the road people who are unable to drive due to the consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol.  That is what is behind this part of the Bill. The Minister has not made a good case for making 125 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood conclusive evidence.  The Minister in a few places in his opening speech used expressions like, &ldquo;the great majority of such people are unable to drive&rdquo;. He said:</P>
    <P>The Commission's own view that, at a blood-alcohol level of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, the driving ability of the great majority of persons will be seriously impaired would seem to justify a provision making that level proof of guilt rather than <i>prima facie</i> evidence as they recommended.</P>
    <P>I noted here and there through the Minister's opening speech that admission and I do not think the Minister is making the case to the House that everybody who has that percentage of alcohol in his blood is impaired or is unable safely to drive a car and on those facts the Minister's case must fall.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to accept that percentage if we agree to it later on in Committee&mdash;I am not binding myself here to agree to that percentage, but, whatever percentage is agreed to&mdash;I am quite prepared to accept that as <i>prima facie</i> evidence imposing on the accused person the obligation of going into the witness box or otherwise satisfying the court that at the material <Col N="132" /> time he was capable of driving the car, and that is what we are concerned with here.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in my views that the presence of a given quantity of alcohol should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence only, As the Minister has stated, the Commission on Driving While under the Influence of Drink or a Drug was set up to deal with this very subject.  That Commission consisted of a number of distinguished persons.  The Commission included Mr. Justice Cahir Davitt, President of the High Court, Professor Maurice Hickey, State Pathologist, Very Reverend D. P. Kennedy, S. J., President of the Safety First Association, Dr. Sean McCann, general practitioner, Superintendent McGonagle, Traffic Section, Garda Síochána, Dr. Desmond McGrath, Psychiatrist, Mr. Dermot O'Clery and Mr. R. O'Donohue, representing motoring associations, Mr. O'Donovan, Chief State Solicitor, District Justice Rochford, Mr. Sheehy, Department of Local Government, and Mr. Total of the Department of Justice.  Those gentlemen were asked by the Minister's predecessor to consider this whole question and report to him.  I want to take this opportunity of joining with the Minister in expressing the thanks of this House to the members of that Commission for the expenditious manner in which they dealt with the task entrusted to them and for the very considerable amount of work which they obviously put into it and the trouble they went to.</P>
    <P>That Commission unanimously supports the case I am making.  That Commission recommended to the Minister that 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres of alcohol in a person should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence and <i>prima facie</i> evidence only of an impairment.  What does the Minister do?  He takes the very same figures, 125 to 100, and seeks to make it conclusive evidence. If the Minister does that, he will not have the support of the country; he will not get public opinion fully to support him, and the Commission in their recommendations pointed out that it was necessary to have public opinion behind any proposals to deal with drunken driving.  The figure of 125 <Col N="133" /> milligrammes is represented apparently by anything more than four pints of stout consumed over two hours, under social conditions.  That means that as far as the law is concerned, if this Bill becomes law, if a person has consumed 4½ pints of stout socially over two hours, then he is drunk, and he will be convicted and his driver's licence will be taken away, and there is nothing he can do about it.</P>
    <P>I quite concede that a person might be drunk after the consumption of that amount of alcohol but it must also be conceded that very many people might not be drunk and would be quite capable of exercising proper control over a car.  I want to emphasise again that I am not making the case for the drunken driver.  I am making the case for the driver who is not drunk and who is capable of driving a motor vehicle but who is going to be caught up in this scientific test and is not going to be allowed to have any answer.  A sub-committee of this Commission travelled to Europe and visited a number of countries such as Norway, Sweden, Austria, perhaps Denmark, but certainly they visited five or six European countries in which this test is conclusive evidence.  In those countries they spoke to the police officers charged with the task of enforcing this legislation which we are now seeking to enact; they spoke to medical practitioners and they visited the courts and they came back and recommended against what the Minister is now seeking to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I had marked to read in full the very section which the Minister read in full, the section of the Commission's Report which recommended that the blood alcohol level should be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence only.  As I say, I am convinced that the making of this blood alcohol test <i>prima facie</i> evidence will achieve the Minister's very desirable objects and will at the same time preserve our standards and our tradition that a man is innocent until he has been proved guilty.  I will go further and invite the Minister to give it a trial and if he is satisfied after a number of years that it does not work out, then he can come back to the House with amending legislation going <Col N="134" /> the whole hog, if he can convince the House that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that something happened since the date of this Commission's report.  As far as I can ascertain, from public pronouncements, made from time to time, if this Commission were asked to recommend or advise today, they would recommend exactly as they have already recommended.  Speaking as recently as 28th November last at the presentation of safe driving awards to CIE drivers, Father Kennedy, S.J., who is president of the Safety First Association, and who was a member of this Commission, re-affirmed that the Commission had recommended that this blood test be made <i>prima facie</i> evidence only and he seemed to be rather alarmed that the Minister had not accepted the recommendation of the Commission.  I am sure that nobody can accuse Father Kennedy, S.J., of not being concerned for the safety of road users or of not being concerned to put the drunken driver off the road.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Minister has not made a strong case, or any case indeed, to justify making the presence of this amount of alcohol in the blood conclusive evidence.  I disagree entirely with the Minister when he seems to think that the implementation of the Commission's recommendation would not materially improve the position in relation to the detection and prosecution of offences involving drinking and driving.  Once you shift the onus to the accused person of proving that he is able to drive, once you shift the onus from the State to the accused, you make it much more difficult&mdash;and I have no hesitation in staking my reputation on this&mdash;for the accused person to get off.  You are putting a very substantial onus on him.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to distrust the courts and seems to think that because the penalties provided for drunken driving are heavy, the courts would lean over backwards in order to let the accused person off, and would be easily satisfied on the discharge of the onus of proof which he suggests should be imposed on the accused person. That is a very wrong approach on the <Col N="135" /> part of the Minister.  Over the past 50 years nearly the courts have proved that they accept their responsibilities seriously, and that they convict where they should convict in accordance with the law, and acquit where they should acquit in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge on the Minister to accept the recommendation of the Commission which his predecessor set up and which reported as comparatively recently as 15th May, 1963, and recommended without qualification and without any reservation that this evidence should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence and <i>prima facie</i> evidence only.  So far as one can know, the individual members of the Commission, so far as they have spoken, are still of the same opinion.</P>
    <P>The remaining controversial sections of this Bill also deal with offences of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol so as to impair the driver's judgment.  It is sought to make it an offence for such a person not to submit to a blood or urine test.  It is sought to make that an offence punishable by the same penalties as the actual offence of drunken driving, to use the expression broadly.  I think it is going too far to make it an offence for a person to say: &ldquo;I refuse to submit to a urine or blood test&rdquo;.  I say it is the right of an individual to refuse to submit himself to that test.</P>
    <P>He may have various reasons for doing so.  He may be doing it on principle, on the ground that he is not drunk.  He may be doing it for personal reasons.  It is wrong to impose on the accused person an absolute obligation to submit to a blood or urine test.  I know that the section of the Bill says that it is not an offence to refuse to submit to a blood test, if the person has a reasonable and substantial cause for refusing.  The onus is on the person concerned to establish that substantial cause.  It is wrong in principle to impose such a heavy obligation on a motorist.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to go a bit of the way with the Minister.  I am prepared, I think, to give the Minister sufficient powers to enable him to ensure that <Col N="136" /> if a person does not submit to a blood or urine test he will find himself in difficulties.  I believe it should be in order for the prosecution to tender in evidence the fact that the accused person refused to submit to a blood or urine test.  That should be acceptable evidence.  I will go further with the Minister.  I say it should be evidence sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of impairment on the part of the accused person, and that an accused person who has refused to submit himself to a blood or urine test shall have shifted on to him the onus of satisfying the courts that at the material time his judgment was not impaired due to the consumption of alcohol and that he was capable of driving within the meaning of the Act.  I say with all confidence that that is going as far as this House should be asked to go at this stage.  The Minister will have sufficient power to discourage drunken driving and to detect people who take the risk of driving with considerable quantities of alcohol in their blood.</P>
    <P>There are only a few points of principle in this Bill proper for discussion on Second Reading.  First, there is the suggestion that we should have a new Bill embodying the 1961 Act and this Bill.  Then there is this awful business of the regulations.  Everything is done by regulation.  I dealt with that.  There is the unsound proposal to confer on the Minister the right to restore driving licences.  That is a matter of principle to which we intend objecting very strongly.  There is the proposal to have people's eyes tested by people who are in no way qualified to test them.  Then there is this Part V dealing with serious offences of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</P>
    <P>My proposals are, to repeat them, that the given percentage of alcohol in a person's blood should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence only, shifting the onus from the prosecution to the accused to prove that he is capable.  Then there is the section making it an offence to refuse to submit to the tests.  I am against these provisions on principle, and in substitution for them, I am prepared to give the Minister a section which will make it <i>prima facie</i> evidence <Col N="137" /> if an accused person refuses to submit to the tests.  Once that evidence is given, the accused person will have to prove that he was not impaired, that he was sober within the meaning of the section.</P>
    <P>We propose to agree to the Second Reading of this Bill, but I do strongly urge on the Minister to consider seriously the points I have made on behalf of this Party in all good faith and in a serious effort to go far enough with the Minister to give him a useful measure that will serve its purpose and do the work he wants it to do, but at the same time, will respect the code of criminal law which has worked so well here since the foundation of the State, will respect the liberty of the individual.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not saying that if the Minister could not attain his desired objectives in this Bill without the sections to which I object he should not have it, but I am convinced that in order to make the roads safe, in order to put the drunken driver off the road, it is not necessary that the Minister should go to the Continent of Europe and come back with the sections which he has put into this Bill.  There are many sections in the Bill which will need attention in one way or another on Committee Stage.  I propose to reserve any further remarks in detail on the subject until that Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most Deputies here and most people outside, I do not hold that the only people involved in serious motor accidents are those who have drink taken.  I do not anticipate that the Bill being passed in the particular form in which it is presented, and with the penalties being brought into operation against those found to have drink taken, will in itself cure the growing slaughter on the roads. With each year that passes, the number of people killed or horribly injured is multiplying.  A big percentage of those accidents may occur in cases where no one has taken any drink.  They may occur because of the tendency of human beings, normally kindly people, who when walking along the street will step to one side rather than bump into <Col N="138" /> another person, almost to change their nature when they are behind the wheel of a motor car.  This can occur in the case of persons like myself who have never taken a drink in their lives.  It can affect teetotallers and other people who take only a very small amount of drink.  Therefore, this Bill should not be taken as a cure-all for this great problem.</P>
      <P>At the same time, this Bill is overdue. The evidence that it is overdue is that since 1960 statistics of the number of people involved in accidents in which drink was a factor have not been kept.  Part of the reason, I submit, is that the situation has developed over recent years to the point where it has been found almost impossible to secure conviction for drunken driving.  The prosecuting Garda superintendent would almost have to have the accused fall down flat in the court in the presence of the judge before he would be found guilty of driving under the influence of drink.</P>
      <P>How many cases are not taken because the guard in charge is satisfied that by the time the various methods of evasion that can be used are availed of, the person will almost have become sober?  The examination by a doctor in the barracks has, I think, with all due respect to my learned colleagues in the legal profession, become almost a joke because the accused invariably takes advantage of the situation by insisting on having his own doctor. Delay naturally ensues and sometimes hours may elapse before he is examined by his own doctor.  Time after time one reads cases in the paper in which the police doctor describes the accused as being under the influence of drink and incapable of controlling a mechanically propelled vehicle, to be followed immediately by a challenge which results in the evidence on the other side practically negativing that already given, and invariably the case is dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our primary concern is not with the procedures involved but with protecting our citizens on our public roads, whether they be car drivers, cyclists, pedestrians or passengers in cars. These should have a reasonable <Col N="139" /> guarantee of being able to proceed about their business with a reasonable degree of safety.  What is the main problem in all this?  The evidence adduced by the Commission, by international investigations, by the OECD, all goes to support the contention that the consumption of alcohol can have certain effects and that people who show a certain alcoholic content in their blood are not capable of exercising full control.  Their judgment is warped.  Their vision may be affected. The Minister described it in his rather lengthy speech as a &ldquo;position of critical impairment.&rdquo;  I do not think it is any harm for a person to know in advance that if he consumes a certain amount of alcohol, he is liable, if found driving a car, to be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick talked about tradition.  The tradition seems, unfortunately, to be one of encouraging drink.  No one objects to anyone drinking if he does not interfere with other people.  No one suggests anyone should not be allowed to drink within reasonable limits.  But, surely, no one should encourage a situation, one which has persisted here year after year, in which people coming out of publichouses and hotels, falsely believe, as a result of the consumption of alcohol, that not only are they able to drive but that they are even better drivers when they are half drunk than they are when they are sober.  Alcohol has the effect of creating the illusion that one is a better man drunk than one is sober. That is the condition in which the drunken driver takes control of a vehicle weighing anything from half a ton to a ton or a ton and a half.  His judgment is impaired; his vision is affected.  He is not able to exercise proper regard for the safety of other road users.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in fixing the level at 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres of blood, is not really improving the present situation because the Minister indicated in his speech that the Commission expressed the view that a person who had 125 milligrammes of alcohol in his blood will be critically impaired.  I take that to mean impaired <Col N="140" /> from the point of view of his judgment, his mental capacity, his vision and the speed at which he can react if an emergency arises.  This critical impairment affects apparently light drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers.  Determining whether a person is capable of driving a car by means of a breath test, a blood test or a urine test has been widely accepted, and some European countries in which the citizens, like so many Irish people, are fond of drink have established a very sound practice.  If they are going somewhere where they think they might be inclined to take a drink, they either leave the car at home or they make sure they have somebody who is not drinking on that occasion to drive home.  This occurs in places like Sweden because the punishment for driving under the influence of drink is swift and severe.</P>
    <P>In considering the Road Traffic Bill, we have to consider the increased number of accidents.  We have to consider the increased number of accidents in the hit and run category. People going about their business on the streets and roads of our country are being struck, knocked down and left lying on the side of the road.  It may not be correct to say that in all cases these unfortunates were the victims of people driving under the influence of drink, just as it would not be correct to say that every accident that occurs is a result of somebody being under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>The statistics quoted by the Minister show that of 40 per cent of all accidents where a fatality occurred from 1958-60, two per cent were cases in which drink was involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has pointed that out because of the fact that earlier the term &ldquo;known to be involved&rdquo; not only means that somebody knew but that it came out in evidence in court that drink was involved.  Out of a total of 294 accidents in the year 1960, 88 were cases in which drink was taken.  Since 1960, the statistics are not quite clear.  Some <Col N="141" /> time ago I endeavoured in this House to get information and I was given an answer which in general terms indicated that the Government had given up endeavouring to get reliable statistics.</P>
      <P>The question will naturally come up for discussion as to whether the tests &mdash;breath, blood and urine&mdash;should be used for the purpose of proving an offence or whether they should be used to support a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I feel the Minister's approach in the light of the desperate situation facing this country is the correct one.  It is essential that by every means we try to reduce the number of fatal and other accidents on our roads.  It is essential that the roads be properly engineered, that they be properly lighted, and that vehicles on the roads be kept in proper condition and inspected regularly.  One factor has been clearly demonstrated. In regard to drivers of vehicles who are under the influence of drink to the extent that their judgment is impaired, it is essential that action be taken to try to prevent that situation continuing.</P>
      <P>Much can be said about the rights of the individual.  He may be charged with being under the influence of drink when driving a car.  It is being accepted that if the blood test shows a certain level of alcohol, a person's judgement is deemed to be impaired. If the level reaches the point of 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres his judgment and capability to drive a motor car are critically impaired. Surely the proper thing to do is to take action at that stage because the rights of other individuals in the community are at stake, the rights of the innocent victims of drunken drivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I read in a digest that in Canada doctors in hospitals treating patients who are victims of road accidents decided, in co-operation with the authorities, to record on film the type of injuries suffered.  They took a number of these films in colour and showed them.  The injuries shown to be suffered by these victims were so terrible that persons in the audience who were looking at the pictures actually fainted.  It was decided, although originally the purpose envisaged in taking these films <Col N="142" /> was that they would be used as part of a campaign for road safety, that because the effect on the ordinary viewer was so devastating, to show only this type of film to persons who had been involved in a serious accident, or were in some way connected with the accident, or were held to be responsible for it.</P>
    <P>We know that the medical profession have in recent years been demanding, and rightly, that special arrangements should be made to deal with persons who have been involved in road accidents. At one time it was thought sufficient to have an ambulance out, have a doctor on the spot to give first aid, and have the patient removed to hospital.  With the development of the motor vehicle and the changes taking place as far as the nature of the injuries is concerned, the medical profession are now crying out for almost the highest skilled medical treatment to be available at the earliest moment.  Any of those interested who care to make any investigation will find that the injuries appear to be growing more serious and more complicated than ever before.  In fact, the person who is killed might be described, in certain circumstances, as being the lucky one, because there are increasing numbers of those who are crippled for life, of those who have been involved in road accidents who will go through the remainder of their lives handicapped in some way, many of them suffering pain.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will be doing a good job at least in one restricted field by the introduction of a test in an offence, as set out in this Bill.  It will not solve the problem on the roads but any effort to cut down the pain, suffering and loss should be welcomed. Consequently, while the Minister has, in his statement, a certain amount of needless repetition with regard to the question of the introduction of a new offence and tests, there are other matters which require comment.</P>
    <P>One of the things I should like to comment on&mdash;and with the same feeling of support as I have expressed with regard to this overdue provision dealing with drunken driving&mdash;is the provision in the Bill to restore to the <Col N="143" /> Minister for Justice the power which he lost at an earlier stage to restore licences.  The restoration of this power, in the eyes of the general public, can tend only to create a feeling that certain people who may have had their licences withdrawn may be able, by approaching the Minister for Justice, to have them restored, and any Minister for Justice may then be placed in a position of doing something which, in my view, he should not have the power to do.  If it were considered that the period for which the person was disqualified, six months, in certain circumstances should be altered, it can be altered and, if there is a view that an appeal can take too long, surely there could be provision for hearing it more speedily than is the normal procedure?</P>
    <P>But, if the courts are to operate and impose disqualifications, surely it should be left to the courts to determine that and to determine an appeal against a disqualification?  At least what the courts do can be seen.  I am afraid the same is not always true with regard to the Minister for Justice. I would suggest that the Minister should examine further this provision in the Bill and be very careful before he restores a position found to be unsatisfactory when operated previously, because whether or not the Minister likes it, the suggestion will be that those with certain political influence and contacts are those who will get the disqualification lifted by the Minister, just as I am sure Deputies will be aware that from time to time, in certain cases, the Garda have felt that to issue prosecutions was merely a waste of their time.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with speed limits.  I would suggest to the Minister that the time has come to impose an upper speed limit on every road in the country, irrespective of what it is. There was introduced last year in Britain, on roads like the M1, the 70 miles per hour speed limit.  There was a lot of controversy about it at the time, but I think it has been accepted as making some contribution towards safety.  There are certain stretches of the roads in this country which could <Col N="144" /> in the future&mdash;and the not too distant future&mdash;become equally dangerous, because, in times of reduced visibility &mdash;light mist or fog&mdash;dual carriageways are no safer than any other roads.  If one drives down the dualcarriageway to Naas, one will observe many cars exceeding 70 miles per hour. So far, there have not been too many crashes, but whatever the speed limit, be it 70 miles per hour, 65 miles per hour or any other speed, there should be an upper limit even on those fast trunk roads or dual-carriageways.  I ask the Minister, when he comes to deal with this, to consider the advisability of introducing such a general speed limit.  Speed limits in the city of Dublin and outside it have been imposed, but they should be tightened up in many cases.  In other cases, delays in getting speed limits imposed result in accidents occurring before the necessary regulations are made.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I cannot understand how it is possible to impose a sight test on a driving licence applicant unless the tester is a qualified person.  There is a very good case, therefore, for reconsideration of this very important matter.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's statement, a special staff will be recruited to relieve the Garda of the task of fining motorists who are guilty of technical offences such as overparking.  He indicated that the experiment will be carried out in Dublin for a start.  I agree with the Minister wholeheartedly that gardaí in the city appear to spend an inordinate amount of time chasing motorists from pillar to post, much to the neglect of their important duties in the protection of the lives and property of the citizens.  Perhaps the revenue from on-the-spot fines is of importance to the Government in their financial need at the moment.  I have on occasion, in a street like Abbey Street, very wide and with little traffic flowing through it, seen a garda concentrating on making sure he gets somebody for 10/- or a £1, while just around the corner at the same time somebody may be breaking into a shop or an office.</P>
    <P>I have no complaints about the <Col N="145" /> Garda and the manner in which they carry out their duties in regard to dangerous places like street corners, but they seem to be particularly active in places where there is no particular danger, such as one-way streets.  They seem to go along with their little books saying: &ldquo;That is 10/-; that is £1&rdquo;.  I do not know whether they are on bonus for it or something, but they seem particularly anxious to collect these fines, while at the same time other streets are jammed with traffic, with nobody appearing to care whether it is going backwards or forward.  One can read in the papers any day of places being broken into, property damaged, glass broken, with no garda around.  If they are there I do not know, but they seldom appear to be where they are wanted and they are always to be found on the spot when a motorist may park for half an hour to go into a shop.  They are there with their pencils and their books.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, is to have the Garda recruit special traffic personnel, I hope they will not imbue this special personnel with the idea that their only function is to collect the greatest number of fines possible from the greatest number of motorists.  I hope the Garda will not regard as their first line of duty the instruction of these people in how to get the most money from the motorists in this way.  The Minister said such special traffic personnel will be on a part-time basis and that their duties will be mainly concerned with peak-hour periods.  I wonder if he will be like some of his colleagues who talk about productivity, if he has the idea of putting these people on bonuses, payable for the largest amount of fines possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that legislation cannot solve all our traffic problems, as I agree with him that the Bill will not necessarily cure or prevent accidents due to drunken driving.  Possibly we should all consider more seriously the advice of the Reverend Denis Kennedy to the effect that what is required is that each person who drives a car should do so with care, thoughtfulness and realisation <Col N="146" /> that a mistake or an instance of bad judgment or selfishness on his part may involve an innocent person in death or in injury which will affect the victim for the remainder of his life.</P>
    <P>At the same time, as has been accepted time and time again, the level of alcohol in the blood impairs the judgment of an individual.  It is clearly time that we here took some steps to ensure that if individuals wish cold-bloodedly to continue with personal actions, which they know will impair their judgment to the point of their becoming a danger to themselves, members of their families and other human beings, if they persist in doing that, it is essential that the community as a whole take some steps to try to protect the innocent against them.  With that we are prepared, in general terms, to support the introduction of this measure and with the right to make amendments on Committee Stage which we feel are necessary to improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to refer very briefly to a few points which come to mind during this discussion. Something which interests me is that these tests will be conclusive with regard to guilt.  If may be that to a degree they could be conclusive.  As I see it, there could also be the case where you could prove a drunken man sober as well.  I would point that out as my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, who said he never took drink in his life, I can say the same.  Suppose the two of us were to go down and have two glasses of whiskey or a glass of rum, we would probably be seeing pink elephants, rats and everything else in the course of our driving.  We could be pulled in and put to a test.  It could be proved that we were sober by virtue of the fact that we had only one drink, whereas a man who had, say, six, and could be a lot more sober than we were after the amount of drink we had taken, would be charged and proved guilty.  This is the point I see in this.  It is quite unfortunate that either Deputy Larkin or I should get <Col N="147" /> away with it and the man who maybe took the extra drink is found guilty.</P>
    <P>Another thing which struck me is whether it is possible to test a man who is unconscious in an accident?  We come along and we find a man in his car who has had an accident.  That man is unconscious.  He could pretend he is unconscious and he could recover in an hour or two afterwards when the drink has worn off him. Could that man be put through a breathaliser test to see if he had such a content of alcohol in his system as would prove him conclusively drunk and to have been the cause of his own accident?  As I already said, Deputy Larkin and I could get away with murder.  We would be proved to be as sober as some of the judges and possibly we might be as drunk as some of the lords.  That is the side of this test I should like to have examined fully.</P>
    <P>I see reference here to speed limits. One thing which strikes me coming up here to Dublin is that one sees some of the speed limit signs overgrown with foliage.  Unless one knew where to expect some of those signs, one could run into them and get the ticket very easily.  I should like to know who is responsible for seeing that those signs are not covered up by foliage at times and that the driver is protected in so far as he sees where he is going to commit the offence.</P>
    <P>Another point is the importance of trying to ease this glare from, if I may say it, the flashing on of a light in country districts.  Rural electricity has come and these unshaded lights can cause quite a lot of blinding to a driver at night.  When a driver rounds a bend in the dark in the country, he suddenly finds lights flashing out of houses and there is no shade over them.  I should like the Minister to see if anything could be done to protect such drivers on the roads.  We are asked to dim our own lights when we are driving but those unshaded lights in houses can cause a lot of trouble.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to public service vehicles.  There has been reference to malicious damages and injury caused to public service transport. <Col N="148" /> This Bill refers to road traffic and I know it is another Minister who deals with CIE, but if there is a law for one, it should be for both.  It should be equally as grave an offence to damage the seats and carriages of a train as it is to damage road vehicles. There is a lot of that kind of blackguardism which should be stamped out.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether you can do anything about this under a Road Traffic Bill.  Something should be done about damage to railway carriages. This needs to be looked into very urgently.  That is all I intend to say but I would be very interested in knowing what would happen to Deputy Larkin and myself if we got just nicely drunk and knocked down Nelson Pillar again?  We would get away with it and the unfortunate man who might have just the half-one over the six would get himself into trouble.  I would like the Minister to look into those two points.</P>

      <P>It is some considerable time since I first mentioned in this House my conviction that if we were to make any real impression on our deplorable record of road accidents, we would have to deal with the problem of the drunken driver.  I venture the estimate, with no statistical basis other than my own observation of what is going on around us, that if we effectively control the drunken driver, it would not be unreasonable to hope that we could reduce road accidents by 50 per cent.  I remember the time I first submitted that view to this House.  It was regarded as a somewhat extravagant estimate.  As not infrequently happens, Dáil Éireann discovers ten years after I have told it something, that what I told it is true.  One of the regrettable results of that reluctance on the part of Dáil Éireann to face facts in good time is that when they are brought face to face with the truth of the situation, the tendency is, particularly when we are afflicted with a Fianna Fáil Government, for the Government and the Party supporting <Col N="149" /> them to get hysterical.  We are at present floundering about in a wild climax of hysteria in which the Black Maria is plying between every county in the country and Mountjoy Jail.</P>

      <P>He is paid for doing that, too.  So is the Deputy, although he is rarely present to discharge that duty.  I was speaking of the hysteria that underlies the Government's legislation when Fianna Fáil are in office. Fianna Fáil have suddenly awakened up to the fact that drunken driving is a serious problem in this country.  Of <Col N="150" /> course, it is.  But serious problems should not result in hysterical remedies. You were surprised, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to hear me refer to recent meetings of the Council of State and consequential legislation in this House. It is not so irrelevant as might first appear to your ears, because there is great danger of this Bill ending up in the Council of State.</P>
      <P>Mark you, this House should not get into the habit of passing legislation which is declared null and void, on the ground that it conflicts with fundamental provisions of the Constitution. Our purpose is effectively to keep the drunken driver off the roads.  But to do that effectively, we must pass law that will conform with the requirements of the Constitution.  We have to bear in mind that, for good or ill, this country enacted a Constitution.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, has the Clerk a copy of the Constitution on his desk? I think it is Article 40 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>No.  This document I have in my hand is not so dear to my heart that I know it off by heart. I have known people in this House who knew &ldquo;The Prince&rdquo; off by heart and could quote it from memory.  This is a document which I have had very recent occasion to consult but I had not occasion to commit it to memory. Article 40 deals with rights and subsection (3) 1º reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
      <P>2º The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice, done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear that provision of the Constitution in mind when we come to read section 29 of the Bill at present before us.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person (in this section referred to as the arrested person) <Col N="151" /> arrested under section 49 (4) of the Principal Act or section 27 (3) (a) of this Act has been brought to a Garda station....</P>
    <P>and it is important to note that it is to a Garda station</P>
    <P>the member of the Garda Síochána then in charge there may do either or both of the following&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  require the arrested person to provide in the prescribed manner a specimen of his breath by exhaling into an apparatus designed for showing the concentration of alcohol in the breath or blood or into a receptacle designed for preserving the specimen for subsequent analysis,</P>
    <P>(b)  require the arrested person either to permit a designated registered medical practitioner to take from the arrested person a specimen of his blood or, if the arrested person so opts, to provide for the designated registered medical practitioner a specimen of the arrested person's urine in accordance with the prescribed procedure.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) goes on to provide:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1), when an arrested person who opted to provide in accordance with the prescribed procedure a specimen of urine fails to do so, he may be required by the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station to permit the designated registered medical practitioner to take from the arrested person a specimen of his blood.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) says:</P>
    <P>An arrested person (other than a person who has provided a specimen of his urine in accordance with the prescribed procedure) who, following a requisition under this section, refuses or fails to permit a designated registered medical practitioner to take from the arrested person a specimen of his blood shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for any term not exceeding <Col N="152" /> six months or, at the discretion of the court, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to both such imprisonment and such fine.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>An arrested person who refuses or fails to comply with a requisition under subsection (1) (a) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, shall not apply to an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies do we consider it appropriate to enact a law which empowers a member of the Garda Síochána to take a person who has been involved in a car crash to the nearest Garda station and there require that person to provide a specimen of urine or submit to a doctor taking a blood sample. All these things sound relatively simple but I ask you to consider the position which this section could produce and to reconcile it with the section of the Constitution which I have just quoted.</P>
    <P>Take a young woman driving on a country road.  She is involved in a crash.  The member of the Garda Síochána comes on the scene and forms the opinion that the young woman is suffering from the effects of drink.  Remember we have defined statutory incapacity to drive a car as a result of the ingestion of alcohol which is something quite different from drunkenness.  I think we are right to define the maximum blood level content of alcohol which, for convenience sake, I shall refer to as the statutory definition of drunkenness for the purposes of this Act.  This young woman is brought by the garda, not to the nearest hospital, not to the nearest casualty department of a hospital, but to the Garda station and she is there required either to pass urine in a form prescribed by the Garda Síochána or to submit to having a blood sample taken by a registered medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>There are a great many, shall we say five per cent, of persons who, if they attend a hospital fully equipped <Col N="153" /> and have a blood sample taken under the most rigorous hospital conditions suffer considerably because they are a section of the population who find themselves gravely distressed by that experience.  I do not deny that I myself find, under the most rigorous hospital conditions that the taking of a blood sample from myself is a matter of the acutest personal distress.  I know people in whose case it involves fainting immediately.  Can you picture a person who may, in fact, be suffering from concussion and whose concussion contributes to the garda's belief that he is under the influence of drink as defined in this Bill, and who is in urgent need of medical attention being brought, not to the hospital but in a state of profound shock resulting from physical injury, to a Garda station where he is required either to submit to giving a blood sample or a urine sample and there told that if he refuses one or the other injunction, he has, by that refusal, committed a statutory <Col N="154" /> offence for which the penalty is six months in jail?</P>
    <P>Does any Deputy seek to reconcile that procedure with the appropriate section of the Constitution I have read out?  It is just possible to say that if they refuse to blow in a bag, it is reasonable to say they have gone beyond the limit of reasonable remonstrance but I think that such blowing in bags should be undertaken in the nearest hospital where the person under threat of charge is at least under competent medical observation so that a doctor can come along and say: &ldquo;Instead of having this person blowing into bags, you should have him in bed to protect him from the consequences of concussion after an accident.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
