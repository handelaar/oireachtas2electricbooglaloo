    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the political and economic implications for this country of EEC membership, the Government will publish a White Paper setting out in detail all aspects of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to keep the House and the country as fully informed as possible on the Common Market and its implications for Ireland.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government have recently issued a White Paper describing developments in the European Communities to date. Further information will be made available by way of Government statements or will be published in White Papers.  Deputies will, however, appreciate that the extent to which details of the implications for Ireland of EEC membership can be published must be governed by the necessity of not prejudicing our negotiating position.  Moreover, the implications cannot be precisely assessed in advance of settlement of the terms of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Taoiseach said about details of the negotiations not being settled in advance, I take it he will agree, in view of the fact that something like five years have elapsed since the application was last made on behalf of this country, that the Dáil should have a full debate on the possible implications <Col N="588" /> of membership before the application is formally made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be in touch with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish in the near future about a full debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also give consideration to the Private Members' Motion standing in my name on this subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of our arranging for a debate, it is possible that the Whips could arrange that the motion be taken in conjunction with whatever motion will be introduced in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say if he intends to visit the existing member countries before the application on behalf of this country is resubmitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The re-activation of our application will depend on when the British will make their application. As Deputies are aware, that will be decided tonight.  I said last week it was my intention that our application should be re-activated as soon as possible after the British.  I do not think that the lapse of time would permit me to visit the capitals of the Six before the application would have been re-activated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Dáil debate will precede the renewal of our application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That could hardly be possible, I think, in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach be any more specific in regard to the time of this debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to have it arranged during the course of the present session.  As the House is aware, even though our re-activation would be started soon, it would be some time before the Governments of the Six would decide in principle whether to open negotiations with us, or indeed with Britain.  Therefore, I anticipate some weeks will elapse before that decision <Col N="589" /> in principle will have been taken by the Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem important that the Dáil and the country should be fully informed on all aspects before the application is renewed and that therefore, in view of the inevitable lapse of time before the application will be actually discussed in Brussels, there is a very strong case for having a debate here in advance of the discussions in Brussels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, I regard the situation as being that we have a mandate from the Dáil to proceed with the application that has already been made.  It will be my intention to move from where consideration of our application was left off in 1962. That was the point of decision by the Council&mdash;the Government members of the Six&mdash;to fix a date for the opening of negotiations with us.  I think there will be plenty of time, assuming our application is made soon, to have a full debate before the decision in principle will have been reached by the Governments of the Six to resume negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach talks about negotiations with regard to our application, will he tell the Dáil whether or not the negotiations on our application will coincide with those of the British or will they come after the disposal of the British application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that our discussions would be concurrent with those of Britain, as far as possible, and certainly that our ultimate admission would coincide with that of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach says &ldquo;concurrent&rdquo;, does he mean that the negotiations will be separate or will go together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the previous discussions took place five years ago in different circumstances surely warrants a separate debate now?  Because of the fresh approach, <Col N="590" /> or, to use even the somewhat inelegant description, re-activation of our application, does it not seem appropriate that we should have a discussion in the light of present-day circumstances rather than base our application on the previous consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our application is there.  It never has been withdrawn. That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach advert to the problem that arises consequent on a publicised discussion in the British House of Commons which created the impression in the minds of many people in this country that the reaction of entry into the EEC would be to have an identical effect on the cost of living in the Republic of Ireland as that calculated to be likely in Great Britain, that this is a highly illusory belief, and that without either some authoritative publication by the Government or a debate here such illusions are liable to become fixed in the minds of our people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there cannot be any illusion in the minds of the people, having regard to what I said in reply to questions put to me in the course of a press conference last week. I freely admitted that I anticipated there would be some percentage increase in the cost of living index figures as far as food is concerned.  It might not be as high as that in Britain because of the deficiency payments system the British have in relation to agricultural produce.  Whatever increase there will be will, of course, be over a period, having regard to the transition arrangements that we can negotiate with the Six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it from what the Taoiseach had to say in the course of his press conference last week that, as he sees the situation, we will have to abandon our traditional neutral position as far as military alliances are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is enlarging the realm of the debate. That discussion is likely to take place elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="591" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has mentioned that it is hoped to have this matter discussed in the Dáil this session.  Does he not think there is great urgency about it and that it should in fact be discussed next week at the latest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said already, the Common Market is at the moment an instrument for economic unity leading to political unity.  We have at no time made any reservations about assuming the full obligations of the Common Market if we are admitted as full members.  Therefore, we have to accept whatever political unity that would involve for us, the same as France, Germany, Italy, Britain or any of the other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if he intends to publish a White Paper before the debate giving further information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to have that done but I could not promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil there is no question of military alliances in the Treaty of Rome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any arrangements have been made with the British Government regarding rights of access for Irish agricultural products to the UK market under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, in the event of Ireland being granted only associate membership of the European Economic Community and of Great Britain achieving full membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is no reason to expect that the eventuality envisaged by the Deputy will arise the answer to his question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not <Col N="592" /> visualise the situation where the British might get in and we would be refused? Has he any reason to believe that if Britain is admitted, we will be automatically admitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of being automatically admitted.  But having regard to the contacts already made and the manner in which our original application was received, I have every confidence our application will be accepted after due negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose we are not admitted?  Do the Taoiseach and the Government not contemplate negotiations for association with the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an eventuality which I said I do not expect will emerge and one I would not like to contemplate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power <Col N="593" /> when he anticipates the rural electrification drive will be back to pre-credit-restriction conditions; and if he can give an indication of the period it will take to clear the arrears caused by the credit squeeze.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount allocated for expenditure on rural electrification in 1967-68 is £1.98 million which compares with an expenditure of £1.4 million in 1966-67 and £1.89 million in 1965-66.  There was a slowing down in the rate of connections in the post-development programme in 1966-67 because of the general limitation on capital expenditure and the need to meet continuing commitments such as system improvements.</P>
      <P>As a result of an additional capital allocation of £300,000 made available for rural electrification in November last and the increased amount of capital allocated for this purpose in the current year all householders in areas already re-canvassed to whom a firm commitment had been made will have been connected by July, 1967.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that, at the present rate of progress, the post-development programme will be completed in about three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that when the credit restrictions were imposed, there was a considerable discharge of personnel and, as a result, the ESB have not got the personnel to meet their commitments?

      <P>The claim for plus rates was granted in July, 1966 with effect from 1st April, 1966.  Additional protective clothing on a pool basis has been supplied but it is not in accordance with outside trade practice to make individual issues.</P>
      <P>The question of additional holidays is being actively examined in line with the recent agreement between the Building Trades Federation and the unions.  Service pay is not a feature of the building industry and I am unable to introduce it for the staff in question at the airports.</P>

      <P>Ireland's contributions to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund would depend on <Col N="597" /> (i) the arrangements made during entry negotiations of Ireland and other applicants for membership, (ii) general revision of contributions to the Fund which is to be made by the Community in 1969 and (iii) the volume of Ireland's imports of agricultural products from non-member countries after entry to the Community.  Receipts from the Fund by this country would depend on (a) the volume of Ireland's agricultural exports to non-member countries and (b) improvements in regard to agricultural structure, etc. which would be eligible for financial assistance from the Fund.</P>
      <P>It seems a reasonable assumption in our circumstances that receipts from the Fund should exceed payments into it, but it would not be practicable at this stage to forecast the actual figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the virtual completion of EEC agricultural policy, he has analysed the effects which EEC membership would have on this country's agricultural structure; and what changes he foresees in farming patterns, particularly in relation to changes in output and farm size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of course an <Col N="598" /> objective of the common agricultural policy, as laid down in the Treaty of Rome, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community. The principles on which the Community system is based recognise the importance of family farms and stress that in order to preserve the family character every means should be used to strengthen the economic and competitive capacity of family undertakings.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my Department's publication &ldquo;Agriculture in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion&rdquo; there is &ldquo;no doubt that the application of the common agricultural policy to Ireland would lead to an acceleration of output and a substantial increase in agriculture's contribution to national economic development&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The prices to EEC producers for most agricultural commodities are higher than those obtaining in this country.  This applies particularly to cattle and to a less extent to products such as milk and barley.  On the other hand, Irish prices for wheat and sugar beet appear to be already at or above EEC levels.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government when it is expected that the North County Dublin water supply scheme will begin to service the areas of St. Margaret's, Rolestown, Donabate, Rush, Loughirry, Lusk, Ballyboughal, Oldtown, Garristown, Naul and Ring Commons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>Construction work on the North Dublin Regional water supply scheme was initiated in May, 1964.  Contract No. 12 (Strawberry Beds-Mulhuddart) has already been completed.  Contracts 1 to 4A which provide for the headworks at Leixlip, plant and rising mains, are nearing completion.  I understand that tenders for contract 5 which provides for the spinal trunk main from Ballycoolin to Hedgestown Reservoir near Balbriggan have been received by Dublin County Council, and are under consideration by the council's engineering advisers at present. Once contract No. 5, which is the main spinal trunk for the scheme gets under way, no undue delay should occur in the completion of the outstanding works but, as the remaining contracts are dependent on Contract 5 as far as a supply of water is concerned, it is not possible to state when the North Dublin regional water supply scheme will begin to service the areas referred to by the Deputy or when the entire scheme will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Barry, I am inquiring not about a scheme that is 24 months old but one that is a quarter of a century old.  I want to ask if it is reasonable that the Minister should make this repetitive reply every time this most important matter is raised in the House.  Is he not aware that his gracious colleague, who is also a colleague of mine, in County Dublin, won at least two elections by promising the advent of this scheme in days long before the present Minister graced these benches?  Would he not agree with me that it is most unreasonable and unjust to the many thousands of people throughout the length and breadth of North County Dublin, which he is alleged to represent <Col N="606" /> equally with me, that they should be continually long-fingered in this fashion in so far as water supplies are concerned? Might I draw his attention to the fact that he did not reply to that part of my question in which I asked if he would indicate to the local authority that they might proceed right away with building, pending the arrival of the water supply.</P>

      <P>This scheme, as Deputy Dunne may have discovered, is proceeding. Tenders for the spinal trunk main are being examined by the council's engineers.  Deputy Dunne might not appreciate the fact that before water can proceed along the other mains extending from the spinal trunk main, first of all, water must be flowing in the spinal trunk main.  Therefore, it would not be possible to supply water to the areas which he mentions without first completing this No. 5 contract. However, now that our gracious colleague has done so well out of the scheme, if Deputy Dunne feels that in the local elections, he can get some advantage out of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the building of urgently needed cottages is being delayed in a number of districts by Dublin County Council on the ground that such building must await the arrival of the North County Dublin regional water scheme in these districts; and if he will indicate his willingness to sanction immediate building in all such areas, pending the arrival of this water supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Dublin County Council that there is no question of the building of urgently needed cottages being delayed at present pending the availability of piped water from the North Dublin regional water supply scheme, and that <Col N="608" /> it is their policy, in cases where such a difficulty might arise, to acquire sites for which a temporary water supply can be obtained from local sources.</P>
      <P>As regards general policy in this matter, I have already indicated my willingness to sanction immediate building in such areas and last January I arranged a meeting between officers of the council and of my Department at which full agreement was reached on interim policies to be recommended in regard to the provision of cottages in areas where full services are not immediately available. I have since given approval to a number of schemes of potentially-serviceable cottages in the North County Dublin area and I will give sympathetic consideration to any further similar proposals which may be submitted by the council.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that, despite the fact that there were certain departures from specification and from normal building practice in the case of two houses (details supplied) at Boston Park, Cork, the full supplementary grant of £275 was paid by his Department and by Cork Corporation in respect of each of these houses; and that despite departures from specification and from normal building practice in respect of another two houses (details supplied) at Boston Park, a deduction of only £2 was made in the supplementary grants paid by his Department and Cork Corporation: and if, in view of a reply of 26th April, he will make a statement as to why such amounts were paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No defects were found in the houses at Nos. 201 and 203 Pouladuff Road and the full State grant was paid in each case.  Certain defects were found in the houses at Nos. 9 and 14 Boston Park and a reduction was made in the State grants.  The making of supplementary grants is a matter for Cork Corporation. I have nothing to add to the reply given by me on 26th April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what were the certain defects found in the two houses in respect of which a deduction of £2 was made in the grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I explained on 26th April last it would not be proper, I think, to give that information in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say why he is too embarrassed to admit that the foundations and the roofs in the four houses mentioned by Deputy Barrett were found to be grossly defective <Col N="610" /> and that the cost of putting the defects right runs into thousands of pounds; and, notwithstanding that, we now have a situation in which a public authority has given grants of the full amount on two houses and only £2 less on two others?  How can the Minister justify this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of any embarrassment in this matter. In fact, the opposite is the case.  This question was first raised by the Taoiseach in his capacity as Deputy for the area concerned and it was only after the matter had proceeded to its present stage of investigation that other Deputies apparently became aware of it. The State provides grants to facilitate people in providing themselves with housing accommodation, but it does not and could not undertake to provide a clerk of works on every building site in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, is it not the duty of the engineer to inspect the house to make sure that it is a sound structure before the State grant is paid and is it not clear that, in this case, if he passed two houses as being without defect and two others as being defective only in a minor way, the inspection was either not carried out at all or carried out in a negligent manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would not be possible to carry out an inspection in the manner in which the Deputy seems to think possible.  The State grants are payable by instalments at different stages of construction and, as I said, the State could not undertake to provide a permanent clerk of works on every house being built and it would not be possible for the inspector to investigate every stage and every detail of the construction of every house.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are certain delays in the payment of supplementary housing grants by Mayo County Council.  The administration of their grants is, however, by law a matter for the council.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, my Department on 31st March, 1967, notified the council of a capital allocation of £100,000 for 1967-68 for supplementary housing grants and house-purchase and reconstruction loans, based largely on an estimate furnished by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application was received from the council on 3rd May, 1967, for approval to a loan of this amount from the Local Loans Fund for the payment of supplementary housing grants. This application is being processed, and a decision on it will be issued as soon as possible.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will take steps to ensure that the public are made aware that they may make objections or representations for a period of three months in relation to all draft development plans, and that the simple procedures to be adopted in making such representations and objections are clearly understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, notice of the making of a draft development plan must be published by each planning authority in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least one newspaper circulating in the area.  The notice must say where and when, during a period of three months at least, a copy of the draft plan may be inspected, and that objections and representations made to the planning authority during that period will be considered before the plan is made.  The notice must also indicate that any ratepayer making objection to the draft plan may include in his objection a request to be afforded an opportunity to state his case before a person or <Col N="620" /> persons appointed by the planning authority.  The planning authority must make arrangements to hear the statements of such objectors and all representations, objections and statements duly made must be considered before the plan is actually made.</P>
      <P>As I have stressed on various public occasions, the provision for public participation in the process of making development plans is a key element in the planning legislation.  These are plans for community development and it is very important that the members of the community and development interests should avail of their rights to make known their views and objections and should suggest any changes which they think would make for a better plan.</P>
      <P>Any member of the public can have his views or objections taken into account simply by writing to the planning authority concerned while the draft plan is on public display.  A ratepayer expressing objection to a draft plan is entitled, if he wishes, to include in his letter of objection a request for an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>In addition to various public statements which my predecessor and I have made emphasising the rights of members of the public to make representations and objections, this matter has also been stressed in circular letters issued by my Department to local planning authorities and&mdash;most recently&mdash;in a letter with some accompanying notes for guidance addressed by me personally to each member of every planning authority.</P>

Would the Minister agree with me that where a public authority like Dublin Corporation proceeds to exercise powers of compulsory acquisition in order to collaborate with a property development association who have already acquired a large area in the total area under consideration, the public should be informed not only that the company consists of the &ldquo;Irish Greyhound, Round Tower, Shamrock Development Association&rdquo; but also of the directorships and membership of the property development association concerned, unless we are all reconciled to selling the whole city of Dublin and the country to anybody who has surplus money today that he wants for the moment to deposit here?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 9 (2) (a) gives the Minister power to make regulations prohibiting the importation either absolutely or save under licence which may contain conditions issued by the Minister, or by specified persons. The object of amendment No. 1 is to confine the Minister's power to making regulations prohibiting importation of these parts.  The Minister can achieve his object in preventing importation of faulty parts or parts which he considers unsafe and I do not consider it necessary that he should take power in the section to allow these parts to be imported under licence.  In my opinion, the parts are either faulty or safe; either they are of such a type as should be fitted to motor vehicles or they should not.  The object of the amendment is to give the Minister power to prohibit the importation of the parts but to take away from him the right to say that certain people may import these articles provided they secure a licence from him.  I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of this section is to give us an effective means of controlling the quality of certain articles, the quality of which it is felt necessary to control.  The power to confine importation and supply of certain vehicle parts to persons holding a licence is intended to deal only with exceptional items of equipment such as safety helmets and safety belts and recut tyres, where quality control at the point of origin is all-important and where subsequent assessment by everyday practical methods is valueless.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable amount of pressure for this form of control of these items.  The licensing procedure which is proposed is not intended to give any one person or class of persons a monopoly but simply to ensure that, when we are allowing items such as recut tyres to be imported and when we allow tyres to be recut here, there will be effective means of control so as to ensure that the items will comply with the appropriate standards and will be supplied for use only on vehicles that can use them safely. Licensing will be introduced only for exceptional items of equipment.  It is not intended to have licences for all items of equipment.  At the import stage, it is envisaged that this will enable control over standards and quality to be introduced while at the supply stage, it will enable standards to be prescribed for suppliers of recut and remoulded tyres.  In my opinion, it would not be wise to confine the powers to specific items for which it is known to be necessary to have these powers now because experience has shown that road traffic throws up new problems as time goes on.  In my opinion, this is the only practical way of ensuring that we will be able to control the quality of these items.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can appreciate the wisdom of not setting up an elaborate procedure for the multitude of parts that go into motor cars but from what the Minister says, it seems that he has in mind to deal only with a very I do not want to have a long discussion on this but I should like to know what <Col N="629" /> limited number of parts of motor cars, those which he thinks have a direct bearing upon the safety of the vehicle. It occurs to me that there are parts like door parts and window parts that may be affected.  There have been cases of people who spent a considerable amount of money in purchasing new cars finding, for months afterwards, that as they proceeded along the highway, doors flew open.  Notwithstanding repeated requests to the manufacturers to repair the doors, they still found the doors flying open as they were travelling. Apart from the fact that this might be dangerous to other users of the road, there is the danger of the driver or passengers falling out or the vexation involved might well cause the driver of the car to move erratically.</P>
      <P>I think the section as originally drafted is not such as to confine the Minister's power to what might be considered directly to be safety factors and I hope the Minister would use these powers in relation to all cases of parts of cars if they were likely to cause vexation to the driver or interfere with the movement of the vehicle.  It is not sufficient to say that we should confine the power to brakes and lights and tyres because there are a great many other things which go into cars and which can cause as much vexation and danger in driving.  If the Minister finds ground for complaint in relation to other parts of cars, I should hope he would control their importation also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand the object of this section. I understand that the Minister wants to maintain a high standard of safety in regard to motor vehicles.  With that object in view, he wants to ensure that only parts of a high standard are imported into this country for use in motorcars.  I am all with him there, but I think he can attain that object by taking in this section the power to prohibit the importation of these parts.  I am quite prepared to give him that power.  What I cannot understand is how importation under licence is going to help the matter.  The Minister has not told us in what circumstances he visualises it might be necessary to allow parts to be imported under <Col N="630" /> licence only.  I do not think he told us that when replying to my opening remarks.  He did not say it was intended to use the licence provisions of this section only on very rare occasions.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear from him what sort of occasion he has in mind for the use of this licensing section.  I am not at all happy about it: I do not think it is necessary.  It is part of a trend in legislation at present, and has been for some time past, once a Bill is passed, to make it wide enough to let the Minister and the Department virtually do what they like under it.  I do not think that is necessary.  If the object of this section, as I believe it to be, is to secure a high standard of safety in motor vehicles by ensuring that only parts of a high standard and parts which have been well and truly tested are used, the Minister can attain that by taking power to prohibit the importation of any undesirable parts. I think it should stop there unless the Minister has some very clear case in mind and some good reasons for supporting it.</P>

      <P>It might be desirable to allow the importation of certain items for very limited use: for instance, recut tyres.  It might be desirable to allow them in for certain use but possibly not for use on motor vehicles.  It also might be desirable to allow in certain items for test purposes and for use by the police: for instance, radar meters.  In regard to the fact that this may give scope for wider application, as I said, that may happen.  It may be as times goes on that the need for this provision in regard to items other than those we have in mind at present may arise.  I think it desirable to have that power in such an event.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 7, lines 19 and 20, to delete &ldquo;, either absolutely or save under a licence (which may contain conditions) issued by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this subsection the Minister seeks powers to prohibit &ldquo;either absolutely or save under a licence (which may contain conditions)&rdquo; persons from supplying or offering to supply specified goods and classes of goods.  This deals with the sale of motor parts within the country.  As I see it, under this provision the Minister is giving himself the right to say that firm A <Col N="632" /> may sell these parts but firm B may not.  These parts are already in the country at this stage.  The Minister is going to differentiate between one trader and another.</P>
    <P>There is a very big question of principle here.  It is very undesirable that any Minister of State should be able to say that a firm in the motor business is to be allowed sell a certain type of tyre but that their competitors in the same town will not be allowed to do so.  That type of legislation should not be passed by this House.  I suppose the Minister will again hang his hat on the words &ldquo;which may contain conditions&rdquo;.  In other words, certain persons may sell these goods for certain purposes.  If that is to be the case, the conditions should be attached to the importation of the goods, so that when they are in the country, they may be sold by anybody for certain purposes only.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to place in the hands of the Minister, and I do not think this House should be asked to do so, a section which will allow him&mdash; and I do not say this in any offensive way&mdash;to confer benefits on one trader as against another within the country. I do not think the argument the Minister made in regard to the previous subsection is valid at all.  I would like the Minister to tell the House what exactly he has in mind in this particular subsection and how he proposes to operate, and for what purpose, the powers which he is seeking.</P>

      <P>As I have explained to the Deputy, it is not intended to use this to provide any person or class of persons with a monopoly.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, this will only apply after the goods are imported but the point is that all these goods may not be imported and the section would not cover goods manufactured in the country.  It may be necessary to make a regulation that recut tyres only be used with a particular type of vehicle or that only safety belts sold with instructions as to their use and fitting will be allowed.  It is necessary to have the same powers with regard to the supply of goods as for the importation of goods.</P>

      <P>I must say that I would be worried if Deputy Fitzpatrick's fears were justified but it seems to me that these regulations are not intended to cover the issue of licences to specific firms.  As I read the section, there will be general regulations binding on everybody and everybody in the business will be bound by them. I do not see any danger of any preference being given.  There is a danger of goods coming on the market and being advertised as cut-price safety equipment and it would be far too expensive in human life if equipment, alleged to be safety equipment, were below standard. A licence would be a general licence to have for sale certain goods in certain conditions, not a licence to Messrs.  So-and-so to do it.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out that the intention is to issue the licences to everybody who would be dealing with the same type of article.  It may be necessary to specify certain firms.  I cannot see any other way in which it can be done except by the way proposed here.  It might be necessary that the licences for certain firms should be confined to certain goods or that conditions would be different for different firms providing the same article but of different standards.  In relation to recut tyres, for instance, it is necessary to have this type of control, to be able to specify on the licence conditions in regard to the use of it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is power in this section for a Minister to say that only A shall be at liberty to sell certain goods.  The argument in support of that might be that if too many firms were selling the goods, it would be difficult to check up on them and see that they were observing the terms of the licence. When the Bill leaves the Oireachtas, is signed by the President and becomes an Act, we have no further control over it and the courts will define it strictly within the terms of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any Minister acts as this Minister says he should not and his regulations are brought to court in order to have them set aside as <i>ultra vires</i> we may be told that the section enacted by the Oireachtas gives the Minister <Col N="635" /> power to do that and that there is nothing the court can do about it. The Minister should have another look at this subsection with a view to redrafting it in order to make sure that the licences will be general licences, as Deputy Booth thinks they will be.</P>

      <P>It is considered that they are safe in normal circumstances only for use off the road and on buses where the tyres are a special type which are specially treated.  This involves ensuring that the firm concerned is doing the job properly and also that it is controlling the sales of the recut tyres properly.  I do not mind undertaking to see if it is possible to put in any safeguards of the type Deputy Fitzpatrick is looking for.  Certainly, I would welcome such safeguards if it is possible to put them in but I cannot guarantee that I will find it possible to introduce any other safeguards.

For example, about the recut tyres, if they are only suitable for use on slow-moving vehicles, such as tractors or <Col N="636" /> vans or only suitable for use on land off the roads, surely it would be necessary then to make it illegal for anybody to use them on vehicles other than vehicles on which they are suitable?  It will not solve the difficulty to say that only a certain firm can sell them, because once they leave that firm, the man who buys them can use them for any purpose he likes, unless it is made illegal for him to do so.

      <P>Yes.  Section 9 was designed to deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with the importation, supply and fitting of devices which could be used to jam radar meters or to give warning of their operation.  The use of such meters by the Garda is sanctioned by section 105 (b) of the 1961 Act.  The most recent information available in relation to these devices suggests that some types of them cannot be made or adapted primarily for use on road vehicles and, of course, these would not then come within the definition of &ldquo;vehicle part&rdquo; in section 9, subsection (5).  In these circumstances, it is necessary to amend that definition so as to enable regulations under section 9 to control or prohibit the supply and fitting in road vehicles of such devices whether they are made or adapted for use in these vehicles or not.  That is in connection with amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>We are also dealing with amendment No. 29.  This amendment proposes to insert after the amendments to section 3 in page 35:</P>

    <P>Section 11 of the 1961 Act enables the Minister to make regulations in relation to the use of vehicles in public places and regulations under the section may make provision in relation to vehicle equipment, its use and misuse. Vehicle equipment is defined in subsection (6) of the section.  It may be considered necessary to make regulations banning the use in mechanically-propelled vehicles used on the roads of radar jamming or warning devices, that is, devices which either interfere with or give warning of <Col N="639" /> radar equipment used by the Garda in the enforcement of speed limits.  So as to ensure that regulations could be made under section 11 of the 1961 Act, it is necessary to amend the definition of &ldquo;vehicle equipment&rdquo; contained in that section.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is similar to the amendment we are making in section 9 of the Bill.  The section which it is proposed to amend by amendment No. 29 will then read:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;vehicle equipment&rdquo; includes all equipment, fittings and instruments fitted to a vehicle or carried on it and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, lights, reflectors and towing gear and any device which is capable of being used to indicate the existence of, or to frustrate the operation of, electronic or other apparatus being used to give indications from which the speed at which a person was driving can be inferred.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage, I expressed serious concern about the apparent doing away with the principle of being innocent until proven guilty, and I feel that it is in this section this objection arises in the first place. Subsection (5) of section 10 reads:</P>
      <P>In a prosecution for an offence under this section in which a licence under regulations under this section is material, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown by the defendant, that at the material time, such a licence, then having effect, was not held.</P>
      <P>It is my contention that it is up to the State to prove that such a licence was not held.  The machinery is there for it to do that.  It would not cause any great difficulty and it would help us to uphold this principle of being innocent until proven guilty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a ridiculous suggestion.  It has always been the case that a person was required to produce his driving licence. The effect of removing that requirement would be to make it very difficult indeed for the State to investigate whether or not a person had received a driving licence.

      <P>The Minister seems to be given power here to create offences by regulation. Apparently the Minister may make regulations which it will not be an offence to violate, but he may term some of them penal regulations.  If this is a new departure, it is an undesirable one.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is a section giving power to officers of the Department and the Garda, I think, to make special checks. Some motoring associations are worried about this section.  It is the intention to proceed with arrangements for regular vehicle checks and vehicle fitness certificates under section 18 of the 1961 Act.  In view of that, the powers proposed in this section are considered far too wide. Section 60 of the 1961 Act makes it clear that there must be some suspicion of a defect before a spot check is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a regular check is to be brought <Col N="643" /> into operation, then a spot check, without any reasonable grounds for suspecting a defect, seems to be unwarranted. It is for that reason the section is opposed.  I am, I think, correct in saying that it is the intention of the Minister to proceed in the not too distant future with regular checks of all motor vehicles and to make it necessary for owners of motor vehicles to obtain certificates of roadworthiness or fitness. If that is to be the position, it is difficult to see why we should have spot checks where there is no suspicion of vehicles being defective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reason for this.  It is necessary because of the purposes this section is meant to fulfil. One such purpose is to determine, by taking sample checks, the incidence of vehicle defects as a guide to the kind of testing scheme to be introduced under section 18 of the 1961 Act and as a check on the effectiveness of that scheme, when introduced, as well as on the operation of section 13 of the Bill.  Another purpose of the section would be to provide, in effect, an advisory service for drivers.  In the early stages, it is intended that the section will be implemented purely for the purpose of providing an advisory service. While, at a later stage, more rigid enforcement will be introduced, the advisory element will never completely disappear.  In other words, it is felt necessary to make these checks even where there is no reason to suspect defects in the cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope the Minister, in drafting regulations, would not be too influenced by questions of convenience of individual road users.  I know it could be very inconvenient and most frustrating to be stopped and to have one's vehicle tested.  I think the whole purpose of this section, in particular, is one of preservation of safety rather than preservation of convenience. If one is held up on a flight from Dublin to London, for instance, by the fact that certain checks have to be carried out on the plane before take-off, I should certainly much prefer to be delayed in the interests of safety than take a chance in the hope that I <Col N="646" /> shall get there on time.  I hope the Minister will not be unduly influenced by protests he may receive about the inconvenience of vehicle testing.  Possibly the best way of putting it is that it is better to arrive late than to arrive dead on time.  Safety is the prime object.  If we have to put up with a certain amount of inconvenience in isolated cases, it is well worth it.</P>
      <P>In subsection (4) (f), reference is made to &ldquo;the authorising of persons (whether officers of the Minister or not) to be authorised persons for the purposes of this section&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister to look into that very carefully. I certainly believe it would be most undesirable that persons should be authorised who are not officers of the Department properly appointed. There has been a practice in Great Britain of appointing garages to issue certificates of roadworthiness.  This has led to a lot of trouble because some garages have been found to have been issuing certificates improperly simply in order to cut the costs for a customer. There is an obvious temptation to do that.  I would hope that the only people who would be authorised persons to carry out inspections and testing would be officers of the Minister, as such.  It would be highly undesirable to put it in the hands of ordinary garages, however honest they may be&mdash;and most of them are, I am glad to say&mdash;because it is putting them in an impossible position. If they are too strict, they will arouse resentment amongst members of the public; if they are too lenient, they are not doing their job right.  It would be far better that this should be a civil servant, a person who has no vested interest one way or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to be misunderstood or misrepresented by Deputy Briscoe or Deputy Booth.  I am quite prepared to give the Minister and the Garda the right, if they have a suspicion that a vehicle is defective, to stop the vehicle and, if necessary, to prohibit the driver from continuing.  However, I think they have that power.  What we are giving them here is power to stop Deputy Briscoe, if he is driving down the street in his brand new Rolls Royce, and to look at the engine or to check it or to make an examination of it and to find out information about it for their own knowledge and for the purpose of drafting regulations.  I think that that would be going too far and I think Deputy Briscoe would agree that that is so.  I think we have the power within the 1961 Act to deal with vehicles which are suspected of being dangerously defective.  However, the Minister will implement sections of the 1961 Act which will require persons to produce their vehicles at stated intervals for examination and to make good such defects as are found and will make it obligatory on them, I think, to carry a certificate of fitness.  I agree with all that.</P>
      <P>I am not here as an advocate of the owners of defective vehicles.  I believe that people going about their ordinary business or their ordinary leisure in vehicles that are obviously roadworthy should not be held up for hours in order to get information for the Department or anybody else.  If a person could say: &ldquo;I am in a hurry now but if you want to see the car within a week or so...&rdquo;, I would be satisfied with acceptance of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the manner in which this would operate.  At the same time, I quite agree with Deputy Booth that we cannot take convenience completely <Col N="648" /> as an excuse to prevent a check. Obviously, in the case Deputy Fitzpatrick cited, of a doctor, a Deputy or anybody else like that in a hurry, I think it is quite reasonable, as is intended, to provide in a case of that kind to postpone the test to a more suitable time.  I cannot visualise gardaí or officers stopping cars that are in a hurry to race meetings, and so on, for this purpose.  I think that would create a hazard.  I think, also, with Deputy Booth, that, generally speaking, it is unsatisfactory that people who are not officers of the Minister should be authorised persons for the purpose of this section.  I can undertake that that will be utilised as sparingly as possible, and, in fact, may not be utilised at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree very largely with the sentiments of Deputy Fitzpatrick about the restrictions that can arise from the implementation of a section of this kind.  I should not like to think the Minister will apply this regulation very soon and that it would rather be a process of education.  It seems to me that the drivers of vehicles of all kinds in this country are in for a very great shock when they realise that, under this section, they may be stopped by an officer of the Minister or a member of the Garda and their vehicle subjected to a test.  That is something new, something radical, probably something very desirable also as we have too many inferior vehicles on our roads, which tends towards accidents.  At the same time, we are concerned about the rights of individual drivers.</P>
      <P>I was rather pleased to hear the Minister say that, in the initial stages, this would be for the purpose of assisting drivers of vehicles in locating defects in their vehicles rather than of penalising them under the law straight away.  It is desirable that over a gradual period of time we should educate the drivers of all vehicles that this is a kind of law they may expect in the future, but in the initial stages it should be by way of helping and aiding them in regard to eliminating any defects which their vehicles may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned that a responsible driver in a roadworthy vehicle <Col N="649" /> now stands the risk of being held up interminably by an officer of the Minister while the test is being carried out. This could not only cause inconvenience but could cause financial loss to many people.  We should be very slow to give such wide powers to the Garda or to anybody else who might apply this regulation in an indiscriminate manner.  Before an officer of the Minister stops anyone on the road and forces him to undergo the test, he should at least be able to prove reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was not roadworthy.  I am enamoured of the idea put forward here that where a driver feels he is suffering undue hardship by being stopped and asked to accept the test, if he indicates that his vehicle will be available for inspection within a reasonable time, that should be sufficient.  I appreciate that this is only a step forward towards the full implementation of section 18 of the 1961 Act.  Perhaps the Minister could say how long the process of being helpful will continue before the regulation will be enforced more rigidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of being helpful will be there all the time.  Of course this regulation will not apply on a widespread scale immediately, as Deputy Treacy fears.  It will come into operation gradually.  Similar fears were expressed about section 20 of the 1961 Act, but if anything, the complaint now is that there is not sufficient activity under that section.  I explained earlier why it is necessary that these spot checks be carried out without the official concerned necessarily having suspicions.  The need for the section is fairly obvious.  If defective vehicles of all classes are to be effectively dealt with, all possible methods will have to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that many accidents are caused by defective vehicles in one way or another and it is our duty to try to ensure that all vehicles using the roads will be roadworthy.  Most people can see even from casual observation that all vehicles are not entirely roadworthy.  In many cases we have other evidence available.  The Dublin Mobile Check Unit during the December, 1966 road safety campaign, <Col N="650" /> checked 724 cars and only 63 of these, or 8.7 per cent, were fully free of fault. These were cars which had been voluntarily presented for checking and we can assume that it was only the more responsible and conscientious type of owner who presented his car for such checking.  In Britain, where roadside checks have been in operation for a number of years, some 46 per cent of 139,000 goods vehicles examined in the 12 months to the 30th December, 1965, were found to be defective in some respect.  It is clear that there is a great need to do something effective to ensure that vehicles will be kept in a roadworthy condition. It is necessary in the interests of road safety and people driving vehicles will have to accept this responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are in a roadworthy condition before they take them on to the road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the problems commercial travellers experience on the road and one of the greatest hazards is defective lighting on motorcars.  While the bulk of commercial travellers will agree that it is necessary to toughen the legislation we have in this matter of checking defective cars, there is the problem of the commercial traveller who is working to a fixed set of calls which he must complete within a day.  It is unfair to hold up unduly a man who is going about his business in this way.  The solution is to bring in a provision whereby a certificate of roadworthiness would be recognised.  This should be done on a mileage basis, say, every 2,500 miles or after a maximum of 5,000 miles, a car should be checked and certified as roadworthy.  If this were done and if the man in a hurry were stopped, then he would be able to present his certificate and show that the car complied with the requirements of the legislation. Subsection (1) may be necessary in certain cases, as Deputy Treacy said, such as when a police officer sees a car which is obviously defective.  For that exceptional case subsection (1) has to remain in the Act.  I am glad the Minister says he intends to operate this in a more liberal way.  I should like to see him examining the possibility of <Col N="651" /> enabling drivers to secure from a recognised garage some form of certificate to show that their cars were roadworthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a conflict of opinion here.  Obviously some Deputies believe that a certificate of roadworthiness would not be sufficient and in all cases it may not be sufficient. This is an essential power to have.  As I told Deputy Treacy it is not likely that it will be utilised immediately on a widespread scale because we will not have the scope for doing so.  However, it is essential that the power to have these spot checks at any particular time should be there so that vehicle owners will know that they must keep their vehicles in a roadworthy condition.  I think we are all clear that there will be no question of holding up people for long periods but where people are in a hurry, arrangements can be made to carry out the check at a more convenient time.</P>

      <P>The requirements of the section are not necessarily intended to be in substitution for the testing under the regular testing scheme under section 18 of the 1961 Act.

Anybody reading this section would get the impression that large fleet owners will, under the regulations, be permitted to make their own examination and will have to keep records and make good any defects that are found, admittedly, but if it means anything, it means that if they do that, it is unlikely&mdash;to put it at the worst&mdash;that they will be subject to the other test.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 5:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a section dealing with heavy commercial vehicles having a weight of 17 tons unladen, and over.  It provides that in addition to certain penalties which may be imposed by the courts for carrying more than the prescribed tonnage, the owner may have to contribute, I think, to the road authority a sum of so much per ton in excess of the prescribed load.  I understand the Minister has already <Col N="654" /> received representations on this section and the object of my amendment is to increase the weight at which the section will come into operation from 17 tons laden to 20 tons laden.  Without going into technical matters with which Deputy Booth may be much better qualified to deal than I am, I understand that the requested weight of 20 tons is reasonable and that the weight of 17 tons in the section is unduly harsh and unnecessary.  I know that the Minister has already had representations either in writing or by deputation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fixing of the 16 tons limit was based on several factors, on road authority requirements, manufacturers' recommendations, on British and European standards, and this has been fixed by regulation under the 1961 Act.  It could also be altered by regulation although there is no intention of changing it in the light of current conditions, but if the limit of 16 tons is changed, then paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 15 will automatically ensure that only vehicles over the new limit will come within the section.  I do not see any reason for increasing this limit at present.  Of course, a tolerance of one ton is allowed.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am told that the present maximum weight regulations are based on the number of axles.  For one front axle and one rear axled lorry, 16 tons are allowed laden.  For two-axled lorries weighing five and a half tons unladen, such as a Dodge, Leyland, AEC or Guy, the weight is 14 tons.  Therefore, a two-axled lorry paying an annual road tax of not less than £120 should be permitted a weight of not less than 20 tons and <i>pro rata</i> for lorries with more than two axles.  However, these people would agree if the amendment I have requested, that the weight be increased to 20 tons, were accepted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister and his advisers have considered the technical arguments that have been put forward or whether he would be prepared further to consider them before the Bill leaves the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It was pointed out to this deputation that they were under a misapprehension regarding the terms of the section.  Firstly, offences under the 1961 Act, section 12, must be proved.  Then the penalty will operate according to the table set out in the section for excess weight carried above the permitted maximum laden weight; that is, in the case of a three axle truck with a permitted laden weight of 22 tons, the terms of section 15 would not apply unless the gross weight was 23 tons or more.  The 17 tons referred to in the section is the minimum weight at which the terms of the section would apply.  Therefore, in the case of a three axle truck which has a permitted laden weight of 22 tons, the terms of section 15 will not apply until the gross weight is one ton more.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 40, to add the following to subsection (6): &ldquo;unless the instructor is a parent, child, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, grandparent or grandchild of such holder&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As it stands, this subsection reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a person (in this subsection referred to as the instructor) is accompanying the holder of a provisional <Col N="657" /> licence (within the meaning of section 35 of the Principal Act) while such holder is driving a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, the instructor shall be deemed, in any prosecution for an offence under this section, to be giving for reward instruction in or in respect of the driving of that vehicle until the contrary is shown by the instructor.</P>
    <P>As that subsection stands at the moment, if a father is seated in a car with his son or daughter who is the holder of a provisional driving licence, the father will be deemed to be giving the child instruction for reward until he comes into court and proves the contrary.  He does not have to be a licensed instructor.  If anybody who is the holder of a full licence is seated in a motor car being driven by a person who is the holder of a provisional licence, then the former person is deemed to be giving instruction for reward.  I want to provide that that presumption will not apply where the instructor is a parent, child, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, grandparent or grandchild of the holder of the provisional licence.  I am sure it is not the intention of the Minister that a parent giving his child driving instruction should be presumed to be acting contrary to the law until he proves the contrary.  I would like to know if the Minister agrees with my interpretation and, if so, what he thinks of my statement.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy's interpretation of the subsection. It is not intended to prevent relatives such as the Deputy has specified from giving such instruction. It is not intended to question such people, but I think such people would not have any difficulty in showing they were not giving instruction for reward. At the same time, there could be cases of people in the categories mentioned who would in fact be giving instruction for reward.  It would be difficult to cover those cases except in the manner in which it is proposed here.  In practice, I am sure there would be no difficulty in the persons concerned <Col N="658" /> showing they were not giving instruction for reward.</P>

Against that, I am worried about this business of being deemed to be giving lessons for reward.  I am thinking of a 17-year-old lad getting his first provisional licence to drive a car.  His pal, six or seven months older, has a full licence. I am quite sure that no matter what parental instructions are given, one pal will start taking the other out to drive the car.  I think the subsection could be drafted in some other way and I would suggest that we add to it:</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I intend to hold to the amendment because the section is unreasonable. This is an onus of proof subsection which is necessary in a lot of Acts under which it is difficult to prove certain things.  The Legislature gets over that by throwing the onus of proof on the defendant.  Under this Bill it will still be permissible for any Tom, Dick and Harry to give driving lessons to any other Tom, Dick and Harry as long as he does not charge for it.  Under the subsection we are saying that the law presumes that a father who has given a driving lesson to his daughter is charging his daughter for that lesson. It is not reasonable or sensible that this should be written into the Act.</P>

I think there is a danger of young persons, having eventually got a licence, holding themselves out as driving instructors in an unofficial sort of way, even as a matter of convenience.  I can imagine a young lad who has got his licence taking out a friend who has got a provisional licence and who says: &ldquo;I want to go out tonight.  I cannot drive on my own.  Will you come with me.&rdquo; Whether money passes or not, such a situation would be dangerous.  It would mean the setting up of unofficial driving schools and the practice of youngsters going out with other youngsters would be highly undesirable.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am surprised at Deputy Booth because, to some extent, we should speak the same language.  I have no desire to encourage the illegal giving of instruction for reward.  If my amendment is accepted and a father takes his son for a driving lesson and charges the son, he will be guilty and can be convicted. It is unreasonable to presume that a father, giving his child a driving lesson, is charging that child but that is what we are doing in this section.  It is unreasonable to expose the father to the risk of being brought to court, put into the witness box and having to take the Testament to swear that he did not receive any money from his son for the driving lesson.  That is going much too far.  If the father takes money, he will still be guilty of an offence and all the talk about one young person taking another young person out and giving driving lessons for reward does not arise.  When this Bill becomes an Act, a young person of 18 will be at liberty to bring another young person of 18 out for a driving lesson, if he does not charge for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven subsections in section 18 and the comprehensive effect of all of them is to prohibit the giving of driving lessons by unlicensed instructors for reward.  I am with all that.  The sum total of my amendment is an amendment to what I would call the onus of proof section, section 6. I am asking the Minister to exclude <Col N="661" /> from that such relationships as father and child.  If the State want to bring a prosecution against a father for giving a driving lesson for reward to his child, it will have to prove that he got money but if the State want to take a prosecution against strangers in blood, the onus of proof will be on the instructor to prove that he was not paid.  I am prepared to go that far with the Minister because I concede that if that shifting of the onus of proof were not there, it would be impossible to get a conviction.  There is no use in saying that there would be all sorts of unofficial driving schools being set up.  There will be no such thing.  This is a very limited argument that I am putting up, confined to a very limited relationship.  I think it should go as far as parent and child, husband and wife, brother and sister, and a bit further, if you like.</P>

As far as I am concerned, it is purely and simply a question of the difficulty in doing what Deputy Fitzpatrick wants done.  It is practically inconceivable that persons such as he has specified here would be treated as giving instruction for reward.  However, it would be feasible to deal with this under regulations to be made under subsection (3) and I am prepared to consider doing that.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> There should not be, but this unnecessary presumtion should not be held over the head of a parent.  This shifting of the onus of proof is really an invasion of the rights of the individual but it is a necessary invasion in certain types of cases, such as the customs code&mdash;you would never get a prosecution otherwise&mdash;and the Road Transport Act.  I am prepared to give it there but I am against extending it indiscriminately into the homes of the people.  This is what you are doing here.  The Minister says it is inconceivable that a garda would think of <Col N="663" /> prosecuting a parent for giving a driving lesson to his son.  Then, why not simply write it in?  These few words I have suggested will make the position perfectly clear.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that when Deputies realise what is in this subsection and, certainly, when the people of the country realise it, they will be dead against it.  Furthermore, I am confident that if the Minister gives it a little thought between now and Report Stage, as I think he said he intends to do, he will probably come around to agreeing that my request is not unreasonable. I am against the argument that we get put up here in this House on Bill after Bill, that there is no danger of such and such a thing happening, that it will never be done. We should not legislate on that basis unless it is absolutely necessary, and it is not necessary here.  If the Minister tells me now that he is prepared to think about it, I will be satisfied for the time being.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to think about it, providing that Deputy Fitzpatrick sees the difficulty that by specifying certain classes of persons, you may be taken as automatically specifying that everybody else must be considered to be doing it for reward.

      <P>Yes, but at the same time, when you put in an exemption like this, it seems to be desirable to make it as comprehensive as possible and by leaving out certain categories, it may come to be the practice that it would be felt in all cases that persons who are not excluded should be assumed to be doing it for reward. However, I certainly agree that this type of person should not be treated as doing it for reward.  I am quite <Col N="664" /> satisfied that in practice that is what would happen but I agree to look into it between now and Report Stage.  I imagine that the best way to do it would be in the regulations which are provided for in subsection (3) rather than by an amendment of subsection (6).

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Section 22 of the Bill provides for the restoration to the Minister for Justice of the power to remit ancillary disqualifications.  Under the 1961 Act, these disqualifications may be imposed by a court, at its discretion, where a person is convicted of any offence under the Act, except, of course, those to which consequential disqualification applies, or a person who is convicted of any other offence in relation to a mechanically propelled vehicle or a crime or offence in the <Col N="666" /> commission of which such a vehicle was used.  It was considered necessary to give the courts this wide power because the circumstances of the case, however minor the charge, may indicate the wisdom of disqualifying the offender for a while.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, the courts have, on the whole, exercised sensibly the power to impose ancillary disqualification but there have been cases where a court has imposed disqualification for a very minor offence with no exacerbating circumstances; this can operate very harshly when the court also decided, as it is entitled to do under the present Act, not to suspend the operation of the disqualification order pending appeal and when the livelihood of the person concerned depends on his being permitted to drive.  Although the present law provides for an appeal to a higher court against an ancillary disqualification, whether or not the conviction is being appealed, the appeal can take a long time to come to hearing and the period of disqualification may well have been &ldquo;served&rdquo; before the appeal is heard. Again under section 29 of the 1961 Act the disqualified person can, after three months, go back to the court which made the disqualification order and seek to have the disqualification removed, but this provision does not apply to disqualifications for periods of less than six months and, in any event, the court has power to remove the disqualification only after it has operated for six months.</P>
      <P>It is important that there should be some machinery for dealing quickly with harsh court decisions, relatively rare though they may be and, when the present Bill was being framed, it was decided that the best course to follow would be to restore to the Minister for Justice the power to remit ancillary disqualifications which was provided for in section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 but which was completely abrogated by section 124 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the Deputies who spoke on the Second Stage of the Bill criticised the decision to restore the power to remit and, in replying to the debate, I undertook to reconsider the matter <Col N="667" /> before the Committee Stage.  I have given the matter a considerable amount of thought since then and have come to the conclusion that, despite the disadvantage involved, we should introduce alternative arrangements to what was proposed in section 22 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Two changes are proposed.  First, it is proposed to reduce from six months to three months, the minimum period to which an ancillary disqualification may be reduced on subsequent application under section 29 of the 1961 Act. The six months period is being retained for all consequential disqualifications. Acceptance of the amendment of section 29 of the 1961 Act will mean that a person in respect of whom an ancillary disqualification order, specifying a period of disqualification exceeding three months, is made will be free, two months after the beginning of the period of disqualification, to go back to the court and apply for the removal of the disqualification; the court, if it considers that circumstances exist which would justify such a course may remove the disqualification as from a date not earlier than three months after the beginning of the period.</P>
    <P>The second change, which will be effected by the amendment of section 30 of the 1961 Act, is that in future, the operation of a disqualification order will be suspended pending appeal.</P>

      <P>The operation of a disqualification order will be suspended pending appeal, but the suspension will be conditional on the convicted person entering into a recognisance to prosecute the appeal.  These two changes will provide adequate safeguards against harsh court decisions. To give effect to them, two new sections are being inserted in the Bill before section 19, and section 22 of the Bill is being deleted.  An amendment of section 29 of the 1961 Act, which <Col N="668" /> was provided for in the Schedule to the Bill, is now included in the first of the new sections and the amendment in the Schedule is, therefore, being dropped.  Section 21 of the Bill is also being dropped and, instead, its provisions are being inserted in the second of the new sections.  The second amendment of section 36 contained in the Schedule to the Bill is bound up with the restoration of the power to remit and is, therefore, also being dropped but a new amendment, which is consequential on the changes being made in section 30 of the 1961 Act, is being substituted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;to confer on the Minister for Justice the right to overrule the court in relation to ancillary disqualification orders, there was considerable disquiet in the country.  It was generally accepted, I think, that the 1961 Act, which provided that licences could only be restored by a court, was sound.  I put down an amendment for the deletion of the provision giving the Minister power to restore licences. That amendment provided that, in order to avoid hardship, service of notice of appeal would automatically lift the suspension.  The Minister's amendments meet my arguments substantially. I am glad the Minister has gone a bit further because, all down the years, when a district justice convicted a person of drunken driving, a consequential disqualification order was imposed and some district justices refused to suspend that consequential disqualification order, pending appeal to the Circuit Court.  In some cases the <Col N="669" /> conviction in the District Court was upset on appeal but, in the meantime, these people had been deprived of their driving licences for three or six months.  I am glad the Minister is now making it obligatory on a district justice to suspend disqualification, whether it be ancillary or consequential, once a <i>bona fide</i> notice of appeal has been lodged and proper recognisances have been entered into to prosecute the appeal.</P>
      <P>The 1961 Act, in my opinion, worked an injustice and I welcome the decision of the Minister to drop section 22 of the present Bill.  The argument in favour of the Minister having power to restore a licence was that a hardship could be imposed on a person convicted in the District Court because, before he could either appeal to the Circuit Court or go back to the District Court, his term of suspension might have been served.  I pointed out on that occasion that that danger could be overcome by lifting the ancillary disqualification on notice of appeal.  I am glad the Minister has accepted that suggestion now. This is something to be welcomed.  It is something of which we do not see enough in either House of the Oireachtas.  It is unfortunate that so many measures introduced here should be regarded as political measures: if a Minister yields on any matter of principle it is believed he is suffering a blow to his prestige.  Measures such as this are the concern of every Member of the Oireachtas and it is the desire of Deputies to produce the best possible legislation and to ensure that provisions made here are capable of implementation.  I trust this will be a precedent for other Ministers in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the deletion of section 22.  The section caused some anxiety to some of us here and also in the country generally.  To some extent it made a mockery of a Bill designed to make our roads safe and to keep death off them.  If we are serious about putting down drunken driving, for example, then the due process of the law should be allowed to take place without interference from any Minister. If that is not the case, then we can never hope to secure the respect and <Col N="670" /> co-operation of the people for legislation passed by this House.  We are glad the Minister has had second thoughts on this.  I agree with the Minister that some court decisions can be harsh; some can even be unfair.  There have been quite serious repercussions in the past because in some instances disqualification from driving has meant the denial of a livelihood.  Under the Minister's amendment the suspension order will be suspended in future, pending appeal.  That is only right and proper.  This will be done without recourse to the Minister, or anyone else, for the purpose of getting the order of the court set aside.  The lifting of the suspension will be automatic on notice of appeal.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his courage in deleting section 22.  Sometimes I prayed for such a section.  That may sound somewhat paradoxical but I have come across many cases in which a district justice has suspended a driver's licence and refused to refrain from imposing that suspension, pending the hearing of an appeal.  When I first read this section, I thought that now one could appeal to the Minister to remove the suspension but, on reconsideration, I found that would apply only when an appeal was pending.  The Minister has now abolished the necessity for this because he has provided for the automatic lifting of the suspension, pending the hearing of the appeal.  Under the 1961 Act a district justice might suspend the operation of an endorsement on a licence pending the hearing of an appeal.  In my practical experience&mdash;I have counted it up&mdash;out of 98 cases, in only two that I know of did a district justice exercise the discretion which he had under the 1961 Act and which, as I said before, was the wish of the legislature in passing the Act in giving the justice that discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many a time I have heard a district justice say, when one appealed to him to refrain from imposing suspension pending hearing of an appeal: &ldquo;I shall not allow the defendant to go around the country with a machine-gun in his hands pending an appeal.&rdquo; which was a ridiculous argument to put forward. <Col N="671" /> Under the amendment of the Bill, it is now obligatory on the district justice to refrain from suspending the licence until an appeal is heard.  The hearing of an appeal is a complete <i>de novo</i> hearing of the facts of a case.  I always thought it was an injustice and that no penalty should be inflicted pending the hearing of the entire facts by an appeal judge.</P>
    <P>I remember the case of a commercial traveller whose driving licence was suspended.  The district justice refused to remove the suspension pending the hearing of an appeal.  He had to employ a driver for almost ten weeks and, when the appeal was heard, it was allowed.  The summons against him was dismissed.  Naturally, there was no suspension of his driver's licence.  Observe, however, the penalty he suffered from the time of the original verdict to the time of the decision on appeal in having to employ a driver during all that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken his courage in his hands.  I think he has done a very democratic act.  He has upheld the rule of law&mdash;many of his colleagues could take a leaf out of his book in that respect&mdash;in that he is leaving entirely to the courts the discretion as to when an endorsement should be made.  If a Circuit Court judge, after hearing the facts, decides that the district justice should be upheld, I do not think any person could take exception to that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, again, on his upholding of the rule of law in so far as this is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I understand it, this section proposes to change the law regarding the carrying out of tests for driving licences.  Before the tester carries out the driving test, he must satisfy himself that the person's eyesight is reasonably good.  I cannot do better than quote the explanatory memorandum:</P>
      <P>Section 19 provides that, before a driving test under section 33 of the 1961 Act is carried out, the issuing authority (i.e., the driver tester to whom the functions of the Minister for Local Government as issuing authority have been delegated) must satisfy himself in the prescribed manner that the applicant's eyesight (with the aid of spectacles, if these are worn) complies with the prescribed standard.  The nature and scope of the eyesight test will be determined by regulations.  It is envisaged that, for the present, the test will be a simple acuity test, for example, by use of Snellen cards or by reading a number plate of normal size at a specified distance, but a more sophisticated and extensive test may be introduced later.  As in the case of the driving test itself, there will be a right of appeal to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposes to confer on the driver tester, who presumably is a mechanic or somebody qualified in the art of driving a motor car, an obligation to carry out something that is really a medical function, the duty of an eye specialist, and of deciding whether or not the applicant for the driving licence has proper eyesight.  This House should not agree to that.  This is why I oppose the section.  I do not think it is necessary either, because the 1961 Act provides that the driver tester may postpone the issue of a certificate until the applicant gets a certificate of fitness.  If the applicant has only one arm, or some other <Col N="675" /> infirmity, he may be called upon to have himself examined and to produce a certificate of fitness.  If the tester has any doubts about an applicant's eyesight, he should require that person to produce a certificate from a properly qualified medical practitioner to show that his eyesight is adequate.</P>
    <P>I am completely against the introduction of a system whereby unqualified persons will be entrusted with carrying out tests which come within the sphere of a specialist.  I oppose the section strongly on those grounds, and also because there is within the 1961 Act sufficient protective provisions to ensure in the case of a person about whose eyesight he is in doubt, the driver tester can call for a certificate of fitness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion were put into effect, it would cost the applicant undergoing a driving test a lot of money before he finally passed his test.  I underwent a driving test in England and one part of the test was an eyesight test.  The tester simply asked me to read the number of a car which was 25 feet away.  He just said: &ldquo;Read that number&rdquo;, and I did. I would imagine that this is simply what the Minister has in mind in regard to an eye test.  It is suggested in the explanatory memorandum that this is the type of thing which will be done.  If they can carry out these tests successfully in England without a problem, I do not see why we should create a problem here by putting people to the expense of going to eye specialists.  If anyone cannot read the number plate of a car which is 25 feet away, he should not be driving his car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible for a driver tester to have some training in simple acuity tests or the use of Snellen cards.  If an applicant is turned down on the ground that his eyesight is not up to standard, I presume that before his appeal in the District Court, he would get medical advice.  That matter might be decided in his favour but the point I want to make is that if it is not decided in his favour, he has no right of appeal from <Col N="676" /> the decision of the District Court which shall be final.  If a situation arises whereby as a result of new medical treatment such a person is able to have his eye condition treated within six or 12 months of being in the District Court, what is his position?  I feel that he should be given the opportunity of returning and having his application put before the court again.  I do not think it is the intention of the Bill to keep such people from driving in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>While the possibility of a full-scale eye test being introduced at some time in the future is not ruled out, that is not what is intended here. Such a full scale test would, as Deputy Briscoe said, involve the applicant in a certain amount of expense.  Our intention here is to have a simple acuity test carried out by reading a chart or a number plate at a certain distance. There is no reason why there should be any objection to this test being carried out by the driver tester as has been done in other countries for a number of years.  It will also be provided in the regulations, as an alternative, that the applicant may be free to submit a certificate from a doctor or an optician which would be acceptable. These regulations will be made only after consultation with all interested bodies, as has been the practice in regard to other regulations.  In the case of a person such as the one mentioned by Deputy Gibbons, who undergoes some treatment and has his eyesight improved, there is no need for him to go back to the court.  All he has to do is apply for another test.</P>

      <P>This convinces me of the importance of including a section of this kind.  In the initial stages, the eyesight test would be a rather simple one, I imagine, to ascertain whether one can see a number plate approximately 25 yards away or something like that.  This is reasonable.  If one's sight is impaired, one should not be entrusted with a vehicle of any kind. Good eyesight is a prerequisite for driving.  I understand it is envisaged that more rigid tests will apply in the long term in regard to eyesight.  I am glad the fears expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick have been somewhat allayed.  He was right in pointing out that the driver tester, who is basically a mechanic or mechanical engineer, is not a competent person to decide whether one's eyesight is good or bad. That is the function of a specialist in that field.</P>

That would be a relatively small defect whereas a man whose field of vision would be completely impaired might still read the number plate and get by. That might be a very serious defect from the driving point of view.  Therefore, I wonder whether a provision of this nature will be effective at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before section 21, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>(1)  A person who undergoes or attempts to undergo a test arranged under section 33 of the Principal Act in the name of some other person shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>(2)  A person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a certificate of competency is issued on completion of a test in relation to which an offence under this section has been committed, such certificate and any driving licence granted in pursuance of an application accompanied by such certificate shall be void and of no effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time I have had to consider the problem of persons seeking a driving test who do not, as required by law, make application themselves personally for the test.  In the great majority of cases, I am sure that nothing underhand is intended and I have, in fact, arranged that the administrative procedure will be such that where a genuine mistake like this is made, an applicant will be facilitated in making a proper application and not have to face applying for a further test.  I consider it is necessary, however, to deal firmly with any attempt to defeat a test by having a substitute attend for the applicant.  This amendment is accordingly designed.  Section 115 of the 1961 Act dealt generally with such matters as false declarations but is not wide enough to cover <Col N="679" /> specifically the case of substitution for a driving test.  The amendment proposes a specific statutory offence for a person who substitutes.  The law on aiding and abetting will deal with the applicant himself in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two very specific and limited objects.  First, it proposes to limit to 20 years the life of any prohibition order made on the ground that a book is indecent or obscene.  It preserves, however, the powers of the Censorship of Publications Board to make a fresh prohibition order in respect of any such book.  The second object is to remove the time-limit of one year on the right to take an appeal against any prohibition order in respect of a book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Indecency&rdquo;, &ldquo;obscenity&rdquo; and &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; are words that provide a perennial source of controversy, not only in this country but, either in relation to publications or films, in probably every country in the world.  Any proposals for the introduction or variation of controls on the media of communications are bound to be criticised from one point of view or another.  In general, I think that the censorship of publications system as operated in this country is supported <Col N="681" /> by the vast majority of the people and that no fundamental change in the system would find favour.  I am, however, fully aware that the operation of the system has its critics.</P>
    <P>Some people may think that the system is not strict enough and that many more books should be prohibited. As to that, I believe that the existence of the censorship system guarantees that persons in the book trade take adequate care in the selection of what they import.  I am convinced, on the other hand, that a genuine ground for criticism is that it is possible to produce a sizeable list of books that, as the law stands at present, are prohibited for all time and which have achieved recognition among responsible people here and abroad as being important works of literature.  It is no less true that a good proportion of those very books are by Irish authors, some of whom are regarded as being among the finest writers in any language.</P>
    <P>The instrument chosen to act as the community's watchdog in relation to publications, the Censorship of Publications Board, has one of the most difficult and unrewarding tasks of any voluntary body performing a public service.  Its members have to take decisions on behalf of the community at large on the basis of their own experience and outlook, in a field where subjective opinion rather than objective certainly prevails.  Their task, as I see it, is to try to bring to bear on each publication that comes before them what they conceive to be the judgment of the average mature and responsible adult of their time.  And that, I think, is the root of the problem, because the views of that character-type, the average man of sound judgment, on the subject of censorship do not necessarily remain the same from generation to generation.</P>
    <P>A decision that commanded pretty general approval in the 1930s to prohibit a particular book would not necessarily meet with the same measure of approval now.  Standards of what is permissible change.  The fantastic and unparalleled social and technological changes that have taken place in the last 40 odd years and, in particular, the <Col N="682" /> changes in the media of communications have in my opinion, led to a quite definite change in the general toleration of outspokenness in literary productions.  For example, the fact that television programmes from outside the State can be seen by viewers in many areas has helped to accustom the general public willy-nilly to franker treatment of many themes.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to speak on the moral problems associated with the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; generally exercised by writers nowadays, nor am I competent to do so, but I think it is startlingly clear that, under the law as it is, some books stand banned for all time that would not be banned nowadays.</P>
    <P>I think it is only fair that something should be done to remedy that situation. Having considered what should be done, I have come to the conclusion that the very simple and pragmatic solution of limiting the life of prohibition orders would be, in practice, the best.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of the books that have been banned down the years on the ground that they were indecent or obscene would have been banned by any of the Censorship of Publications Boards we have had, including the present one. Equally I have no doubt that they are of such limited merit as to be most unlikely to be found in circulation 20 years after publication.  The remainder, being books that have established themselves as having literary or other merit, deserve, in my opinion, to be given a fresh start after the lapse of a reasonable length of time. The period should, of course, be such as, given the experience of recent years, would be likely to allow of an appreciable change in the general outlook.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published it has been suggested that 20 years is too long and that a prohibition order should expire after a considerably shorter period so that the new provisions may be of some benefit to authors whose books may be out of print well before 20 years are up.  I can see the point of this argument, but I think that it is to a large extent misconceived.  If we have a Censorship Board, we must accept that its decisions, subject to those of <Col N="683" /> the Appeal Board, reflect the opinions of its day, and it would be a contradiction of that to have its decisions set aside after a relatively short interval. However, I have already indicated publicly that I could be persuaded to agree to a somewhat shorter period, but unless I am satisfied that there is general support for such a change, I do not propose to recommend it.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill does not in any way at all lessen the power of the Censorship Board for the time being in office.  They are free to prohibit again at any time any book that ceases to be prohibited after the 20-year interval.  This accords with what I have said earlier about the Board's function as reflecting as far as possible the informed public opinion of its day.</P>
    <P>The second proposal in the Bill will, I think, prove to be of some practical significance.  It must often happen that a book is prohibited and no appeal is taken within the 12 months allowed by the present law, but that after the lapse of a few years, it is, so to speak, discovered and at that stage the publisher or author or some other interested party might, for one reason or another, be glad of the opportunity to submit the book to the statutorily appointed Appeal Board.  I think it right that provision should be made enabling an appeal to be taken in such circumstances.  I do not consider that it is necessary to go further and allow, for example, a right to re-appeal after an interval of years, though I conceive that that might be desirable if the other proposal in the present Bill was not accepted.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of an omission from the Bill that may be criticised in some quarters.  The time-limit of 20 years is proposed to be limited to books banned on the ground that they are indecent or obscene and a book banned on the other statutory ground, namely, that it advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or procurement, is not to benefit from the operation of the time-limit.  There is, <Col N="684" /> of course, an obvious reason for this. The decision that a book is indecent or obscene is very much a subjective matter.  On the other hand, the other statutory ground involves, to a greater degree at any rate, the application of objective criteria.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it is important, I think, in this respect for us to bear in mind that the whole subject of contraception is very much a live issue at the moment and that Catholics are awaiting a definitive ruling on the subject. The problem, in any case, is not confined simply to prohibition orders. Section 16 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, contains a general prohibition on the printing, publishing, selling, etc., save under permit from the Minister for Justice, of any book, whether it is prohibited or not, which advocates or might reasonably be supposed to advocate the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or procurement.  The permit provision is designed, obviously, to enable scientific works to be imported and sold to scientific specialists and the like, but in fact it has rarely if ever been availed of. Section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, prohibits the sale or importation for sale, etc., of contraceptives and that is a provision that might possibly have to be reviewed also in connection with any revision of the provisions I have mentioned in the Censorship Acts.  I think it better to leave these matters aside, for the moment at any rate.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not propose any change in the law in relation to periodical publications, which include newspapers and magazines.  An appeal to the Appeal Board can be taken at any time in respect of any prohibited periodical publication provided three months have elapsed from the date of any previous decision of that Board in respect of that periodical.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked whether this Bill betokens the erosion of the censorship system.  The answer is, no. That system, reasonably administered, as I believe it is, is effective without <Col N="685" /> being oppressive.  Without the censorship system, public opinion would, I feel certain, require that criminal proceedings should be instituted in the case of many of the books and periodicals that are prohibited by the Board.  Booksellers would be the persons most directly affected by this and I think that they would prefer to see the censorship system continue rather than face the prospect of being brought into court to answer charges relating to books of the type that are now being prohibited.</P>
    <P>I do not expect that this Bill will be received without criticism, but I hope that the House will accept that it represents an honest attempt to deal with a particular and genuine problem.</P>
    <P>Before ending, I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to all those who, down the years, have given service to the community on either the Censorship Board or the Appeal Board.  Their task has never been a very pleasant one, but they have served the country well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine the Minister will get the type of consideration of this Bill that he asked for in his concluding remarks.  So far as this Party are concerned, Deputies who wish to address themselves to the Bill and to this particular problem will be absolutely free to express their views because we do not regard a Bill of this type as a Bill which should be debated from a purely Party or political point of view.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the proposals in this short amending Bill and has quite rightly pointed out that the objectives which he proposes to achieve by it are few and limited.  Possibly it is appropriate that the House should now after a lapse of something over 20 years consider again this question of censorship. My view is that the Minister is correct in his judgment that, by and large, the public in this country approve of the idea of a censorship code and, generally, have approved the operation of censorship here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, abundantly clear that the entire code, and certainly the administration of the code, have had <Col N="686" /> their critics, critics who have expressed their views quite frankly and fully on the whole idea of censorship.  There are really a number of things involved in a consideration of a Bill of this sort. We have had two Censorship of Publication Acts already, the Act of 1929 and the Act of 1946.  It is probably relevant also to point out that in relation to some of the matters dealt with in the Censorship Acts, there is also a constitutional provision.  In Article 40 of the Constitution, it is declared that the publication or utterances of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence punishable in accordance with law.  It would seem that if that Article of the Constitution were to be taken as a guideline in this matter, the guideline being thrown out is that the question of indecency or obsenity in publications should be dealt with by a process of law rather than by censorship.  But I do not think that was intended by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably right when he adverts to the difficulties that can be encountered if one endeavours to deal with a problem of this sort merely by legal process.  I am not an expert on this, but I think I am correct in saying that in some other countries that is the way in which they endeavour to deal with these problems.  They bring a prosecution which I assume is a criminal, or quasi-criminal prosecution, and it then becomes a matter for court determination as to whether an offence has been committed.  I do not know to what extent that procedure is successful.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of censorship, regarding it as censorship <i>simpliciter,</i> obviously it cannot be as effective as a censorship code, as is laid down in the legislation here.  The 1929 Act, produced in the comparatively early days of the State, provided for the establishment of a Censorship of Publications Board, which consisted of five persons appointed by the Minister. The powers of that Board did not enable the Board itself to ban any publication.  It did not enable the Board to impose a prohibition order but the Board in those days, especially under the 1929 Act, and this continued up to the 1946 Act, was enabled to make a <Col N="687" /> report to the Minister and the Minister then, acting on that report, brought in a prohibition order in respect of a particular book.</P>
    <P>The procedure under the 1929 Act was fairly drastically altered in 1946, because under the 1929 Act, as I say, the report was made by the Board to the Minister and the Minister then made the prohibition order but the Minister had the authority under that Act at any time to vary or to end the prohibition order.  In other words, a ban imposed under the 1929 Act was not a life sentence.  It could be varied at any time by the Minister in consultation with the Board.  That particular procedure went under the provisions of the 1946 Act.</P>
    <P>When the 1946 Act was enacted, the power of the Minister to make the prohibition order was taken from him. Instead of that, the prohibition order could henceforth be made by the Censorship Board itself.  While that position was altered, while that power was taken from the Minister and while the power of reviewing at any time was also taken from the Minister under the 1946 Act, the 1946 Act established also, in addition to the Censorship of Publications Board, which was, so to speak, reconstituted under the 1946 Act, the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board.</P>
    <P>Again, the Appeal Board was to have five members and it was provided in the Act that the chairman of the Board should be a judge, a barrister or a solicitor of, I think, at least seven years standing.  A further change, which I think on reflection the Minister will agree has possibly been a drastic one, was introduced by the 1946 Act&mdash;the vesting in customs and excise officers of authority to detain books and to refer books so detained to the Censorship Board.  Under the 1946 Act the new Board established by the Act were given power to make prohibition orders themselves; they were given the power to examine books on their own initiative, to examine books in respect of which a complaint had been made, or to examine books <Col N="688" /> referred to them by the customs and excise officials.</P>
    <P>There was also a further rather drastic restriction imposed in the 1946 Act, which had not been there in the 1929 Act.  As I mentioned, under the provisions of the 1929 Act, there was no such thing as a prohibition order necessarily continuing for ever because it was open to the Minister, under that Act, in consultation with the Board to review the matter, to modify the decision, to vary the order in any way at any time.  But, under the 1946 Act, when the Appeal Board was established, a right of appeal was given. That right of appeal had to be exercised within 12 months and it applied once only: once an appeal was heard, there could be no further appeal from the prohibition order.</P>
    <P>We are now, some 21 or 22 years later, coming to consider this procedure under the present Bill.  As the Minister has pointed out, the changes now proposed are of limited application. Firstly, the Bill is limited to dealing with the question of publications which heretofore were condemned on the basis of being indecent or obscene.  It does not deal with any of the other matters which were or could be prohibited under either the 1929 or 1946 Acts.  The second matter which comes within the scope of the Bill is the automatic expiration of a prohibition order after a lapse of 20 years.  The third matter is that a right of appeal at any time is being given but, again, that goes less far than one might assume first on reading it, in that the right of one appeal only remains and what is being done in that regard is that the time limit of 12 months for the bringing of an appeal is being removed but the restriction that only one appeal can be taken will remain.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this question of 20 years and says:</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published it has been suggested that 20 years is too long and that a prohibition order should expire after a considerably shorter period so that the new provisions may be of some benefit to authors whose books may be out of print well before 20 years are up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The Minister continues:</P>
    <P>I can see the point of this argument, but I think that it is to a large extent misconceived.  If we have a Censorship Board we must accept that its decisions, subject to those of the Appeal Board reflect the opinion of its day, and it would be a contradiction of that to have its decisions set aside after a relatively short interval.  I have already indicated publicly that I could be persuaded to agree to a somewhat shorter period, but unless I am satisfied that there is general support for such a change, I do not propose to recommend it.</P>
    <P>I think, subsequently, the Minister went on to deal with the possibility of allowing an appeal more frequently, allowing an appeal to be made, say, after a lapse of a number of years.  I would suggest to him he might consider the position because it is not at all clear to me, under this Bill, what is the position of books in respect of which a prohibition order has been made, in respect of which an appeal has been taken and rejected.  What is the position there?  Does the fact that one appeal has been made and rejected preclude the authors or writers, or others interested in those books, from a further right of appeal under this Bill, because, if it does, I would suggest to the Minister, at least in those cases&mdash; if there is this kind of freeing out&mdash;he might consider providing in this amending Bill that one appeal could be made.  I do not see that that would run in any serious way counter to the argument he was advancing.</P>
    <P>I propose to say a few words with regard to the question of the time limit of 20 years.  But, first, may I say, regarding appeals generally, that there still may be one appeal only and what the Minister is doing there, in effect, is providing that in places&mdash;I am talking about past prohibition orders&mdash;where no appeal has been made against the prohibition order, one appeal in respect of those books can now be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and under future prohibition orders, one appeal can be made at any time.  Therefore, I take it that so far as past prohibition orders are concerned, provided no appeal has been made already&mdash;an appeal can now be made under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It does seem to be arguable that the value of removing the 12 months time limit is, to some extent anyhow, negatived by continuing the provision that there can be one appeal only.  I think I am correct in this and I think the Minister's introductory speech bears out this interpretation.  I think the justification for the 20 year life of a prohibition order, which is now being introduced, is the changing community standards.  From that point of view also, it would seem there might be some merit in allowing more than one appeal. Indeed, I do appreciate the arguments the Minister made on this point but I think it would be at least worth considering the idea of allowing periodic appeals.  A period of 20 years is a long time, practically a quarter of a century. Possibly, when we think in terms of 20 years, we may be under-estimating the rate of change in community standards.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate that when a code such as this has been established, when by and large there is general public approval of it, Governments may not desire to bring in amending Bills to chop and change it from time to time. But, assuming that the general framework of the censorship code is to remain, assuming also that the changing community standards of which I speak are present and present to a fairly accelerating degree, it would seem to me that a possible method which at least deserves the consideration of the Minister is the idea, if he is keeping the period of 20 years, of allowing an appeal to be made periodically against a prohibition order possibly once every five years or something of that sort.  It is an idea which the Minister might consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said in his opening statement, and I also heard him say it in the course of a television interview, he seems to have an open mind on the length of the period proposed, <Col N="691" /> as to whether or not the 20 year period is too long.  I feel a case could be made even for a period as short as ten years.  An argument could be made both on moral and on literary and cultural grounds for a shorter period than the 20 year period proposed.  Certainly it seems to me that on literary and cultural grounds, it can be argued that ten years should show whether or not a book is significant and going to be of any significant value as literature and on cultural grounds.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that a ten year period would enable the ordinary Irish community to keep sufficiently in touch with contemporary currents of sensibility while at the same time allowing for that margin of difference in our way of life, which, whether we like it or not, does exist and which may need some form of cushioning from the Legislature in legislation of this type. I think the Minister might give serious consideration to the question of whether or not the 20 year period proposed in this Bill is not too long.</P>
    <P>With regard to the method of appeal under the 1946 Act and to some extent, possibly to a very large extent, this was a repetition of the provisions of the 1929 Act, the appeal may be made under the 1946 Act by the author or by the editor or by the publisher.  An appeal can also be made by any five TDs or Senators.  I was not here in 1946 so I do not know the reason for the second provision, why five TDs or Senators should be enabled to make an appeal.  It seems to me that a case can be made for some less cumbersome group than five TDs or Senators.  I feel also that when we are considering an amendment to the censorship code it would be reasonable to provide that in any appeal the author should always be admitted and be heard in relation to the appeal.  I would be interested to know why the present procedure is there, why a particular right should vest in a group consisting of five TDs or Senators.  In any event, it would be reasonable to suggest that whatever the method, whatever particular springboard the appeal comes from, whether it be the group of Deputies or Senators, whether <Col N="692" /> it be the publisher or the printer, or whoever it may be, the writer of the book should be heard in connection with the appeal.</P>
    <P>When I am talking about the position of the writer, let me say that I heard the Minister in the course of his television interview in relation to this Bill saying something to the effect that his concern was for and his responsibility to the public rather than the writers.  I feel that is a correct attitude for the Minister for Justice to adopt in relation to this matter.  With a system of a civil censorship code established, the function of the responsible Minister in relation to that code must be one of concern for the author or the publisher of the book.  At the same time, it is right that&mdash;and I do not intend to pun when I say&mdash;the writer should also get a fair hearing and a fair representation.</P>
    <P>It may be that in the composition of the successive censorship boards and appeal boards that were established efforts were made to ensure that that representation was given.  It would be worth considering that it should be written into the legislation that the writer&mdash;I am using the term generically &mdash;should be represented on the Board. I do not claim that it would be an easy task to select a representative of writers in general but the effort could be made. It might be possible to ensure that both the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board would always have within their membership, for example, some reputable critic or some publisher or literary journalist.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that if that kind of change could be made statutorily in relation to the composition of the Board much of the criticism that has been voiced might no longer be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that the Bill is limited in scope and in application.  There is a change which I feel the Minister might consider making.  It would be reverting to phraseology in the 1929 Act which was deleted in the 1946 Act.  I think it was section 6 of the 1929 Act which enabled the Censorship Board to make a report to the Minister which would be followed by a prohibition <Col N="693" /> order.  Subsection (6) of section 6 of the 1929 Act provided that the Board might make a report about a book which in its general tendency was indecent or obscene.  The requirement in subsection (6) of the 1929 Act, as I read it, was that one of the matters about which the Board required to be satisfied was not simply that there was something indecent or obscene in the book, but that the book was in its general tendency indecent or obscene.</P>
    <P>I suppose it could be said that from the point of view of the publishers and writers, there was a measure of protection for them in that phrase, but whatever measure of protection was there was removed in the 1946 Act, because that phrase was dropped completely from section 7 of the 1946 Act, which allows a prohibition order to be made if the Board are of opinion regarding a book that it is indecent or obscene.  That is not qualified in any way.  It is not now subject to being indecent or obscene in its general tendency.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the detailed question of definition.  I imagine that from every point of view it would be extremely difficult to get a satisfactory definition of the word &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; or the phrase &ldquo;indecent or obscene&rdquo;.  There has been a certain amount of criticism with regard to the definition contained in the 1929 Act which has been carried forward.  It is not one of the portions of the 1929 Act which was amended in the 1946 Act.</P>
    <P>The main criticism has been the inclusion in the definition section of the phrase &ldquo;suggestive of&rdquo;.  It is provided in the definition of the word &ldquo;indecent&rdquo; that it shall be construed as including suggestive of, or inciting, etc. As I say, I realise the difficulties which the Minister's Department must encounter in endeavouring to get any more precise definition, but when this question of the censorship code is being considered by the House, it seems to me that this is one of the points of criticism that has existed, and that it would be right for Deputies to suggest to the Minister that it is a matter which should concern him and his Department <Col N="694" /> to see if a more precise, more exact, more correct, if you like, definition could be worked out.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, in many ways this subject of censorship is a fairly vexed one.  It is one on which people are inclined to take strong views one way or the other.  Obviously there are dangers both in what you do and what you do not do in relation to censorship. There is the old argument as to the degree of interference with one's freedom, and one's freedom of expression, which is entailed in a censorship code.  On the other hand, there is obviously the question of allowing thrashy undesirable material to be available, particularly to young people. I should imagine that Deputies on all sides of the House, and people outside the House, would be at one in agreeing that whatever protection can reasonably be afforded against that type of material, and in the interests of young people, should be afforded.</P>
    <P>I should like, if I might, to refer to what I regard as a very informative and authoritative article on this question which appeared in the journal <i>Christus Rex</i> some years ago.  I want to quote from the July, 1959, edition which contains an article by the Reverend Peter R. Connolly on the subject.  On page 155 which deals with the &ldquo;Basis of State Censorship&rdquo;, this paragraph appears:</P>
    <P>In view, then, of her philosophy the Church exerts some legislative control over the reading of Catholics. It might be argued that in a Catholic country a further State control of books is superfluous.  But this is to assume that the inner sanction is quite sufficient, that Catholics are not to be corrupted and that public morals may never be affected by a Catholic writer or bookseller.  The argument also ignores those contemporary problems of the protection of youth in an age of mass communication and circulation&mdash;problems with which the Church law cannot and does not attempt to cope....  At the same time civil control of printed matter cannot be justified on the same basis nor modelled on quite the same lines as Church control. Ideally speaking it should complement <Col N="695" /> it rather than usurp its functions or cover the same ground.  As the respective areas are defined today the Church ought not compromise her moral authority with the compulsions of the civil law nor ought the State intrude into the private moral life unless &ldquo;public morality&rdquo; or &ldquo;the public order&rdquo; is being menaced.</P>
    <P>In that passage there is a good guideline as to what the approach should be in the case of State censorship.</P>
    <P>There is one other passage I should like to read in the following two pages of the same edition:</P>
    <P>In order to be a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; measure censorship, like any other law, must try to balance the claims of the common good against the claims of individual freedom, and try besides to balance the rival claims of various groups in the community. The State's function is continually to improve the conditions for the natural development of its citizens.  Its right to coerce is not unlimited: restriction merely for the sake of restriction is not justified morally or politically.  Therefore, in whatever way it protects public morality civil law should define as narrowly as possible the limits placed on individual freedom.  On the other hand, the individual must limit his rights at times for the sake of the common good; his rights in society are not absolute.  The writer's self-expression, for example, has social implications once it is directed at the reader and becomes communication. Freedom of expression cannot be understood as licence&mdash;as an absolute freedom without limits of any kind&mdash;but as one more rational freedom with respect to the life of the community.  In the abstract the reader's right to get what he wants (since it is less closely related to public order) is wider than the writer's right to spread his ideas; though, of course, the two are mutually dependent in practice.  Laws, therefore, about printed matter have always been aimed primarily at authors, publishers, booksellers and <Col N="696" /> editors so that a check be kept on indiscriminate sale or circulation.  As a result of any such law, however, the reader's freedom will be indirectly curtailed to some degree. More precisely still the law should combine the maximum amount of freedom for adult individuals with reasonable protection for the young, immature and defective.</P>
    <P>Thoughts of that kind on this subject are the types of guidelines we should adopt here.  I see the obvious danger. One of the arguments against any censorship code is that one may get the habit of adopting the point of view that once a censorship system exists, anything that gets through must be all right.  That, of course, would be very faulty reasoning.  The reason I am referring to this is that I think it essential in any discussion of a censorship code for books and publications which might be damaging to young people that we should constantly bear in mind, no matter what censorship code is established and no matter how well enforced it may be, it would be a mistake that censorship should be regarded as entirely protecting young people and young minds.  It cannot be regarded as removing the necessity for teachers and parents to impose their own restrictions on the reading of, in the case of parents and those <i>in loco parentis</i>, their children and, in the case of teachers, of those under their control.</P>
    <P>As far as it goes, the Bill does go some way towards remedying some of the grievances that have existed. As I pointed out, it is limited in scope. Certainly, there will be those who would like to see the Minister go very much further.  In relation to some of the matters proposed by this Bill&mdash; in relation to the 20 year period, for example&mdash;a reasonable argument can be made that the period proposed in that case is too long.  As I suggested in the course of my remarks, the Minister might well be advised also to consider the question of ensuring by legislation that the viewpoint of the writer will always be heard on appeals made to the Appeal Board and, if possible, that he will always be represented both on the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board.  The <Col N="697" /> Minister might also consider the suggestion of allowing periodic appeals. These are matters which occur to me, in any event.  As I said at the outset, as far as other Deputies of this Party are concerned, they will be absolutely free to express their own views and opinions on this measure and on the general subject under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that censorship has been lifted in the Fine Gael Party at least for this discussion. So far as the Bill is concerned, I want to congratulate the Minister on taking this step.  I appreciate very well that the temptation must have been very great for the practising politician to let this dog sleep on.  It is an area of political activity and of legislation in which one could easily revel in holier-than-thou exercises.  The Minister has tried a modern and progressive attitude to what has been over a long period the subject of much discussion in the public press&mdash;albeit a discussion occasioned, I would think, by a small minority of the population &mdash;and a subject of some considerable injustice to those who have brought credit to the country by their artistic endeavours in the field of literature.</P>
      <P>I am not claiming that all our writers have brought such credit, nor indeed all our artists.  I am not going to suggest to the House for one moment that there should be any general subscription to the notion, which was put forward, perhaps, more as an aphorism than as a serious statement by one who might have been described as an erstwhile neighbour of those who resided in this House at one time, one who was from Merrion Square.  I refer, of course, to Oscar Wilde when he made what was probably a flippant remark designed to impress a very impressionable London society, that there is no such thing as an immoral book, that a book is either well written or badly written.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That represents the extreme of literary arrogance which is unacceptable to any average person.  It is an arrogance which one meets with occasionally. It is commendable on the part of the Minister that he has not made any gesture towards that very unreasonable point of view.  There are <Col N="698" /> amongst our literateurs, if that is the group word to describe the people I mean, those who believe there should be complete and untrammelled freedom of expression.  I do not hold with that: I do not think any normal person would hold with it.  I am often inclined to the belief that the use of what might nowadays be described as &ldquo;picturesque language&rdquo;, but what those of us of middle age were brought up to regard as dirty words, is prompted not so much by a mistaken desire to be realistic or to use what these literary people might think was the language of the ordinary people&mdash;many of them have no contact whatever with the ordinary people&mdash;as mainly by the desire to achieve certain publicity.  It is a well known fact that one of the best methods of promoting the sale of a book is to procure its banning in the greatest number of countries.  The under-the-counter appeal of such books is very considerable.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would like to say that some of the greatest literary giants the world has seen have been banned from these shores and have produced materials which gained more credit for this country than any other material we have known of from the shores of another country. Shaw, Ó Faoláin and O'Connor are known and read in every part of the known world, even amongst people whose first introduction to the name of Ireland would be through the writings of those whom I have mentioned. It is a sad thing that our censorship code, operated in a puritan, rigid and Victorian manner has prevented some of the works of these men being available to our own people.</P>
    <P>Censorship is like any other form of law: it is repressive and coercive no matter how slight it may be.  All law is based on restraint and, in the final analysis, on restraint by the sanction of force.  To try to achieve a fair and reasonable level of censorship, to try to achieve a code of censorship which will be accepted by all, is trying to achieve a Solomon-like solution. It is just not possible to achieve such a situation.  There are areas in which I would like to see censorship <Col N="699" /> considerably expanded.  A couple of weeks ago there was a gentleman on television and the ideas he was putting across should have been dumped in the ocean before ever they reached this country.  His whole philosophy, in its content and expression, was adoration of the almighty dollar and his whole expression of this philosophy we have to accept them.</P>
    <P>Take these words, &ldquo;indecent and obscene.&rdquo; Is it not true that these words since 1929 and 1946 have come more and more to have a broader meaning than they were thought to have a quarter of a century ago? There are many things which might strike many of us as being indecent and obscene which would never have looked in that light to those who brought in the censorship code as we know it today.  The words &ldquo;indecent and obscene&rdquo;, in the sense we know them, have largely been applied to pornography.  There are political ideas which are not associated with matters erotic which I would regard as indecent and obscene but the use of the words themselves has become obsolete.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that it is good enough that 20 years must elapse before the ban imposed on a book dies.  We must be more realistic in this.  The previous speaker referred to the fact that we are living in an age of rapidly expanding techniques of all kinds and, more particularly, techniques of communication. When one thinks of books and the skills of writing in these days, one should think of them in connection with an element which was not there ten or 15 years ago.  There are matters now discussed on television which, if the censorship laws here could be made to apply to television, would never be seen by viewers.  That cannot be prevented because cross-Channel television programmes are seen here.  It is nonsense to say that we can stem discussion on any subject or that we can in any way retard the growth of communication.</P>
    <P>When we talk of 20 years, we talk, in conditions of present-day life, of half a lifetime, if not of a lifetime.  I would urge on the Minister that this term of 20 years should be reduced <Col N="700" /> very considerably, that it should be reduced to ten years.  Ten years is a long time.  If one looks back over the books and writings of ten years ago, one can see a tremendous difference in the standards which were not accepted then and which are now regarded as commonplace.  I do not know whether this is good or bad but I often think it is very bad that the public taste should become, to one like myself who might be regarded as a conservative in these matters, debased.  These are facts and we have to accept them.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in pursuance of his duty as guardian of the public good and as one charged with the duty of keeping an eye on these matters, should, I think, take another look at the question of this period of 20 years. I suggest ten.  There may be some intermediate period which would be acceptable to the Minister but certainly 20 years is far too long and, indeed, unjust to writers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins read from a publication which I think he said was <i>Christus Rex.</i> One sentence he quoted struck me as worthy of thought and perhaps comment.  The writer suggested that a greater right rested with the reader to get what he wanted than rested with the writer to write what he wanted to write.  I cannot see the logic of that.  That would seem to suggest that if there is a mass demand for a certain form of publication, the mass demand can be responded to with greater justice.  I do not know if I am correctly interpreting the quotation, which was somewhat abstract.</P>

      <P>An interesting point raised by Deputy O'Higgins was that under the Act of 1946 five Deputies or Senators could appeal against the banning of a book or publication.  I wonder did it ever happen.</P>

      <P>The question of what is literature and what is not literature will be argued to the end of time.  I read quite recently a contemporary critique of Shakespeare's works in which he was described as the greatest writing disaster since somebody who went before him.  I shall not quote the other bit.  There were various views held in regard to Shakespeare.  What then is literature?  Many people will tell you that this gentleman, Spillane, whom I referred to but not by name, writes literature.  Public taste is a peculiar thing.  One reads in a newspaper things that are described as poems but which to me read like <Col N="702" /> gibberish and we are told it is literature.</P>
      <P>It is fallacious to suggest that the sole result of censorship is to deprive a culture-hungry nation of great pieces of literature.  Indeed, in certain respects, it would be very beneficial if a great deal of the trash and muck and dirt&mdash;and I am not talking purely of the stuff which is erotic; I am talking of the sort of semi-literate ravings which we get in bulk form and newspaper form at times&mdash;were prevented from coming in and reaching people.  It would be a very good thing if the standard of public taste could be raised.  If one were to exclude such material, there might be a public outcry from huge numbers of people who find an escape therein from the harsh realities of existence under Fianna Fáil. I suppose to some of them it might very well represent what LSD represents to other gentlemen.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House. Generally speaking, we are in favour of this Bill but we would ask the Minister to think about reducing the time. There is no real argument for the arbitrary fixing of 20 years.  I am not saying that we should take Britain as an example but there have been revolutionary changes in Britain in the past five years as far as publications are concerned.  The thought occurs to me, what will our position be if and when we enter the Common Market?</P>

It may be a long time before that matter will have to concern us but it is one of the many thoughts that occur to me.  It is a big question and one in which I am very glad the Minister saw fit to interest himself.  There are not many who would have the moral courage to tackle this problem at all and for that reason alone, the enlightened of this country must be grateful to him for opening <Col N="703" /> the door and letting some little ray of light into this benighted situation which we have had to endure for the past 20 years.</P>

      <P>I appreciate such a lead at all times.  We have been told over the years that Ireland has been the laughing stock of the world in relation to censorship laws.  This may or may not be so, but certainly in the past five years, this criticism cannot be justifiably aimed at us.  In the past five years, there has been a tremendous improvement in our attitude to censorship in general.  We had become grouped with Australia as having the harshest censorship laws in the world, as is evidenced by the caption produced by the publishers on the cover of Brendan Behan's <i>Borstal Boy</i>&mdash;I was in England at the time&mdash;&ldquo;Banned in Eire and Australia&rdquo;, and of course read everywhere else in the world.  I should add at this stage that I think Brendan Behan's <i>Borstal Boy</i> was a good work and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, apart from the fact that Brendan Behan himself was a practising Christian and a charitable and humanitarian man.</P>
      <P>Censorship in this country had its flaws and it was bound to have a reaction.  In many cases, certainly in a case of recent memory, our censorship laws were used to advertise particular novels.  These novelists would come to Dublin Airport with their saucy publications under their arms, and a conveniently-placed photographer would take a snapshot which would appear in the various journals all over the world the following morning.  In that way the censorship code in this country rebounded on itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in this civilised debate, <Col N="704" /> there has been general agreement that we should at all times prohibit what I would describe as hard core pornography, which certainly has no literary merit and does not bear examination in any circumstances.  I have before me the register of prohibited publications up to April, 1961.  It is the biggest such publication available, I assume&mdash;it was the only one I could get of its size.  It contains some 7,500 volumes; it has 417 pages with 18 volumes listed per page, which would roughly work out at the figure I have already stated.  In my view, 97 or 98 per cent&mdash;and that is being fair&mdash;of the publications mentioned in this register deserve to be banned, but this lets in the two per cent we have been discussing here.</P>
    <P>There are in this register many well-known names, and I pick out the names of some Nobel prize winners: Hemingway, Steinbeck, Laxness, Par Lanquist, who, I believe, is an Icelandic author; I have not read any of his work, so I do not intend to comment on it.  I have read Hemingway and Steinbeck and I enjoyed reading them.  There is also included in this register the author of <i>And Quiet Flows the Don</i>, Michael Michaelov.  I am not sure whether Michaelov won the Nobel prize or not, but certainly I was very much surprised to see his book banned.  This is the tragedy, as I would describe it, of the situation, placing these Nobel prizewinners in the same category as the authors of the other books herein which consist of nothing but muck and trash. Take, for instance, the title of one of these books: <i>Hot Dames on Cold Slabs</i> which is by a man by the name of Michael Storme.  This is the sort of rubbish that the work of the Censorship Board ensures does not come into the country.  Also mentioned in this register are the works of people like Andre Maurois and indeed our own Seán Ó Faoláin, Austin Clarke and O'Flaherty.  The last speaker mentioned Shaw and Wilde.  I might mention O'Casey and Joyce.  These people went through the ignominy of being compared, in effect, with the trash-producing authors in this register, 98 per cent of the contents of which I would consider to be worthless nonsense.  This is the situation I believe every Deputy <Col N="705" /> would like to see ended once and for all.  We would like to ensure that the work of these people I have mentioned are not taken into the censorship net, that works of known literary merit will not be put in the same category as the muck with titles such as I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the present administrative tribunal set up under the Acts of 1929 and 1946 has worked well to control the flow of so-called literature into our country.  I would go further and say it is the only system for assessing this type of work, and that the Boards set up under these Acts are suitable for this purpose.  But for our Censorship and Appeal Boards every back alley in every city and town in this country would have pornographic peep shows selling the type of muck about which I am speaking.  I cannot over-emphasise, as the Minister has mentioned in his fairminded speech, the worth of the work done by the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board, and particularly within the past five years.</P>
    <P>The English system was mentioned. I believe ours is a better system than that which prevails in Britain under the Obscene Publications Act.  I do not think we should hesitate to proclaim this and to be proud of it.  In England, there is the hearing before the magistrate and the hearing before a judge and jury.  A hearing before a judge and jury is, in my opinion, the final absurdity.  Witness recent history: literary expert contradicting literary expert, in, for example, the case of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover.</i> There was a case in this country recently&mdash;I am thinking of the late Frank O'Connor's <i>Kings, Lords and Commons</i>&mdash;in which an appeal was successful and the present Minister for Justice was one of the chief protagonists in favour of removing the ban on this great author. In this type of legitimate literary case, there should be open to the author, or the publisher or the five Members of the Oireachtas an avenue of appeal to the courts.  On Committee Stage I may move an amendment to the effect that there should be an appeal to the High Court from the Appeal Board.  I have considered the matter <Col N="706" /> carefully and there are many safeguards in my amendment to ensure that, if an appeal does go from the Appeal Board to the High Court, it will be held <i>in camera;</i> it will be an expensive exercise for the author, or publisher, or the five Members of the Oireachtas to appeal from a decision of the Appeal Board.  That will obviate any danger of vexatious or frivolous litigation.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 2 of the 1967 Bill, the period of 20 years has been referred to; for the Committee Stage, I have already tabled an amendment reducing the period to ten years. The Minister has stated that he sees the point of this argument, but thinks it is to a large extent misconceived. I do not regard the proposed reduction from 20 years to ten years as misconceived.  Great technological changes are taking place and public attitudes and public posturings will change within a period of ten years. In my view, 20 years is too long.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the prohibition of a book in 1967; it will be reviewed in 1977.  It is unfair, I think, that the publisher and author should have to wait so long.  Books may go out of circulation.  That would be another problem.  A great deal of the ephemeral muck mentioned by the last speaker and by Deputy O'Higgins will go out of circulation anyway.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of the constitution of the Board.  The same personnel might not constitute the Board ten years hence.  There is that possibility.  I would urge the Minister to reduce the period from 20 to ten years.  Section 3 of the 1967 Bill is clearly a review section and the prohibition may be re-activated, if that is necessary.  It would not even be asking the Minister too much, I think, to reduce the period to five years.  However, we must be reasonable and, by reasonable, I mean giving the review at the end of ten years rather than at the end of 20 years.</P>
    <P>I believe that, if the amendment on the appeal to the High Court I propose on Committee Stage is accepted, it will once and for all take the controversy out of censorship.  Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, quite rightly, that we are <Col N="707" /> the guardians of the common good and, as such, we have an obligation to ensure that the type of publication in this register of prohibited publications I have before me does not in any circumstances get into the hands of our children.  That is our primary consideration. Adults should be in a position to make adequate judgments on their own account.  It is the children we must protect.  I believe the Censorship Board was, from that point of view, a good concept.  It is still a good concept and I hope it will always be there to prevent the free dissemination of salacious muck.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his very fair approach. He is making an honest attempt to deal with a particular problem, and a very real problem.  I should like to take this opportunity of once more paying tribute to the Censorship Board and the Appeal Board, and thanking them for the marvellous work they have been doing, and will, I know, continue to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad we had a constructive discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill.  As I said, my intention was that we should have a frank and fair discussion of the merits of our present censorship system and of the practical ways in which we could remove the anomalies which exist and, at the same time, retain the fundamental basis of the system, a system which, judging by the three speeches to which we have just listened, is generally accepted as being reasonable in principle.  My concern in this Bill has been to emphasise the validity of the basic principle of censorship and, at the same time, mitigate the obvious anomalies, making our system a reasonable one, which any sensible person could view as something both right and necessary, maintaining at all times a commonsense approach with regard to its functioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made certain points in regard to the definition of indecent, and the necessity, as he thought, of improving the definition. He made another point in regard to the change between the 1929 Act and the 1946 Act in regard to the deletion <Col N="708" /> of &ldquo;general tendency&rdquo; as a matter they might consider in assessing a book.  These matters are not strictly relevant to the Bill before us, which is limited to a narrow range of practical improvements.  Furthermore, I feel that the whole question of what guidelines or definitions should guide the members of the Board is very subsidiary to the main question of the composition of the Board and the carrying out by the Board of their duties in a commonsense way.  I do not think all the changes in the world of definitions and all the guidelines in the world that we might incorporate in a statute can really affect this basic matter.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the present Board is one with which I am fully satisfied.  I should like to pay a tribute to the Board, to Judge Conroy of the Circuit Court, who has been Chairman for the past ten years or so, and to the other members who have exercised discretion in a very commonsense manner.  I have figures which bear that out.  The number of books being banned is substantially on the decrease&mdash;1963, 442; 1964, 353; 1965, 288 and 1966, 158.  That shows that there is no excessive banning of books and that what is being banned is in the main useless trash of a clearly indecent or obscene nature.  I want to put this tribute to the Board on record because they are doing this service in a voluntary capacity and are giving much of their time to it.</P>
    <P>Basically, the main anomaly in the present code combining the 1929 Act and the 1946 Act is the perpetual nature of the prohibition orders.  The banning of books in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and, in fact, any book banned under the code at present and until this Bill becomes law, lasts forever.  There is no machinery whereby an order made a large number of years ago can be reviewed and there is no regard, therefore, to the inevitably changing standards of the community.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction here between what might be called basic morality and standards and attitudes.  While basic morality will always be unchanged, there are changing standards and attitudes on the part of the public, <Col N="709" /> and this is a continuing factor, so that it is wrong to have a situation where a book banned because of a certain attitude or standard in one particular year must remain banned forever, without any machinery for its review or for investigation of its merits in subsequent years, having regard to the standards of later years.</P>
    <P>Under this code, as has been said by various Deputies, many works of distinction by authors of distinction have been banned forever.  Indeed, Irish authors of world renown such as Seán Ó Faoláin, Frank O'Connor and Kate O'Brien, to name but a few, have suffered in this regard, as also have other noted authors.  This, I think, has tended to make us ridiculous, to make our system look ridiculous, when, in fact, this is a very practical commonsense system.  The fact that these books, banned long ago when different attitudes and standards prevailed, remain eternally banned under our present code has caused the system to look ridiculous and has brought a certain amount of odium on it.  I feel that that can be removed by introducing a definite time limit in regard to the duration of prohibition orders.</P>
    <P>The main provision of the Bill is that the life of a prohibition order, once made by the Board, shall be only 20 years but that the publication may be considered again, and may indeed be banned again, if that is thought desirable in the climate of the later period.  But, of course, none of the books of the distinguished authors I have mentioned, who suffered in the 1930s and 1940s, would, I am quite confident, in the climate of today's thinking, be prohibited by the Censorship Board of today.</P>
    <P>The matter that arises for consideration, in discussing the main aspects of the Bill, is the length of the limitation period.  I mentioned in my introductory speech and on television that I have an open mind on the matter.  Twenty years is an arbitrary figure but if one went too far in reducing the limitation period, then obviously too great a hole would be made in the censorship code itself.  The Board must be regarded as reflecting the current opinions of ordinary reasonable people towards the books and periodicals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> It would obviously make nonsense of the system&mdash;I referred to this in my opening speech&mdash;to have too short a limitation period.  One must acknowledge that a board, considering a matter today, would be likely to have the same opinion in five years' time.  If one allows five years, as was suggested here and outside by some people, one would be getting very near the situation where there would be no censorship system at all.  A board sitting now would hardly have a different opinion on a particular matter in five years' time.  I proposed 20 years in the Bill but I made it quite clear that I was open to suggestions to reduce that period to some degree but not to the radical extent of making the period one of five years.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Dunne and Deputy Andrews suggested ten years and Deputy Andrews also mentioned five years.  Somewhere between ten and 20 years, I will find a mean.  I appreciate the views expressed by the House that 20 years may be too long a period.  In a matter of this kind, one likes to get a general consensus of opinion.  In a matter of this kind, the opinion of the House reflects the general views of our society at present. As Minister for Justice, I have to protect the public interest in this regard.</P>
    <P>In view of what has been said here by various speakers, I think we might find a mean between ten and 20 years which might meet both points of view.  I shall consider what should be the mean between ten years and 20 years and, having arrived at a conclusion on it in the light of the views expressed, I shall probably have an amendment for Committee Stage.  Certainly, however, I shall not go too far in reducing it for the valid reasons I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also suggested the amendment of the appeal provision in the Bill.  This brings me to the other main principle in the Bill which, I think, also mitigates a hardship in the present code.  As the code now stands, the author, publisher, editor or any five Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who may decide to bring an appeal are circumscribed to the extent that the appeal must be brought <Col N="711" /> within 12 months of the making of the prohibition order.  Now, in many cases a book may become popular long after the 12 month period from the Censorship Board order.  Some books come and go; they have valley periods and they have periods of popularity, so that it is important to be reasonably flexible in a matter of this kind.  It has come to my notice that hardship has been caused because under the code as it stands if the appeal is not brought within 12 months, it is out.  It is proposed in the Bill to allow the people who have the statutory right to appeal to make an appeal at any stage without any time limit after the order has been made.  This is reasonable because a book which was banned 20 years ago may suddenly become popular and a publisher may, for example, decide to put it into paperback form and if an appeal has not been brought within 12 months, then there is no chance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins wanted to change it still further by giving extra rights of appeal.  He suggested that if an appeal has been brought, a second appeal should be allowed within a period of time.  I have considered this but I am satisfied that provided we reduce the 20 year prohibition period a bit, the argument for a second appeal loses any attractiveness it may have.  Deputy O'Higgins was mainly thinking of allowing for the second appeal in the context of the 20 year limitation.  He considered that the 20 year limitation was too rigid and that one way of mitigating that would be to allow for a second appeal.  If we reduce that limitation period, his argument loses its force.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Andrews commented&mdash;and naturally, I agree with them fully&mdash;on our system of censorship which is through a board which decides whether books should be banned.  They commented on our system and the system which operates in many countries of control through the courts.  Both systems operate in some countries.  We are not the only country which has a board.  Other countries prefer control by the courts, our neighbour, Britain, being the <Col N="712" /> obvious example.  In Britain, they are having difficulty in dealing with publications through the courts.  There has been much comment in informed British periodicals and newspapers recently about defects in the controls exercised through the courts.  This is causing concern not only in Britain but in other countries.  In matters of this kind, there can be so many variations of interpretations, so many opinions as to what is right and what is wrong, what is decent and what is indecent, that you can have a series of contradictory decisions.  One could see what would happen if we were to leave it to the various superintendents throughout the country to decide when to bring a prosecution and to the various views that would be held by various district justices as to what was decent and what was indecent. This happens in Britain, in both summary and indictable cases.</P>
    <P>On balance, our system works best. Provided you have a board which is a commonsense one, you can expect consistency in the assessment made of the merits of books and in the application of the standards set out in the Act.  The Board has the great merit of being consistent in regard to its decisions and this makes for greater certainty.  It is better than the court system, which allows great variation in interpretation as to what is obscene or indecent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned the question of providing for a further appeal to the High Court.  Deputy O'Higgins had a related point which would amend the existing code by giving the author, publisher or editor the right to attend the Board for a hearing.  Of course, the present Board has the right, if the members so wish, to call in the people I have mentioned. Deputy O'Higgins wants to give these persons the right to come in and be heard.  I will consider that between now and Committee Stage.  One obvious argument against doing what Deputy O'Higgins suggests is that it is not the intention behind the literature that they seek to investigate but rather its effect on ordinary reasonable people. In assessing the effect on ordinary <Col N="713" /> people, they must look at what is in the book and see how it strikes themselves as ordinary people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of criteria which they must take into account.  I dealt with this point earlier in regard to certain definitions and variations of definitions between the 1929 Act and the 1946 Act.  Broadly speaking, one can take it that this comes down to the commonsense interpretation of the individual members of the Board.  The only purpose in bringing in the author would be to enable him to explain his intentions behind a particular sentence or theme. Superficially, this has an attraction, but the obvious thing which occurs to me is that it would bring in a new element which should not necessarily be the concern of the members of the Board.  They are not concerned with the intention of the author; they are concerned with how a particular theme or particular wording may be read by commonsense people.  However, I will have a look at the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned an appeal to the High Court.  Again, there are arguments against that in that it brings in what I have just been talking about and objecting to, the whole question of dealing with this matter through the courts.  The courts in Britain have not been found to be a very good means of deciding these matters and informed comment in Britain of late is very critical of the way the system has operated because of variations of opinion that inevitably exist as between different judges and prosecutors.  Our system has the great merit of consistency. It would add a further degree of inconsistency if the High Court were brought into the picture and it would also bring in another appeal on top of an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> Another point is that the present Chairman of the Appeal Board is Mr. Justice Haugh of the Supreme Court who has been there for a considerable time and so you have a high judicial personage as Chairman of that Board. In addition, as Chairman of that Board itself, there is a high judicial personage, so that between Judge Conroy and Mr. Justice Haugh there is what one might call balanced chairmanship of legal or judicial people on both bodies. However, I shall have a look at Deputy Andrews's suggestion to see if there is anything in it.  It is an attractive idea, but I think it all comes back to the point I have made several times, that the important thing in this matter is to ensure that we have a commonsense Board.  I think we have achieved that in recent years under Judge Conroy and as long as that is so, along with the changes we are making here to remove the anomalies existing in the present code, I think we shall have a system that will command respect from people here and abroad.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the main change which I propose as a result of this debate will be in regard to the matter of reducing the limitation period in respect of prohibition orders.  I can assure the House that between now and Committee Stage.  I shall have an amendment drafted to reduce the period to somewhere between ten and 20 years. That, I think, represents the broad consensus of opinion.  The other matters that have been raised here may be considered in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
