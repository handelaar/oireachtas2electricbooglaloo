      <P>Under the shadow of the guillotine, we refuse to discuss the remaining amendments or sections or the remaining Stages of the Livestock Marts Bill which seeks to give absolute control by means of legislation over a trade which has been traditionally free from such control and which has grown to its present satisfactory position in the agricultural community without any such control or direction. The fact that it has achieved this has conferred very considerable benefits on the agricultural community.  In the shadow of the guillotine, which was introduced here last night, we are not <Col N="594" /> a position to continue to discuss in a rational and democratic way the remaining Stages of this Bill but we propose with remorseless exactitude to oppose every remaining section and amendment.</P>

      <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo;<Col N="598" /> means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction but does not include the sale otherwise than by auction of livestock the property of the proprietor of such a place.</P>
    <P>Now, I know it makes no sense, but I am very concerned to know what sense Fine Gael thought there was in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I suspect, but I would rather have heard from Fine Gael themselves, and I rather wonder at the fact that they are not discussing this amendment and are merely opposing it for opposition's sake &mdash; I forget the term used by the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; and whether it is that they now realise that this amendment is of a kind and kindred to those that have gone before and, indeed, will come after, that they never should have been put down, that they were never intended to be taken seriously or, if they were, their only purpose could be to nullify, or stultify, or make obscure, or confuse the definition section in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I should like to suggest to the Opposition and to the House that this amendment does bring to notice two, three, or four and, maybe five, six, or seven interpretations, all of which, if added to the section as it stands, would make a very poor job.  The words I am complaining about are those completely contained in the particular amendment and, if they were added, one interpretation I would put to the people who sponsored this amendment is that it would be impossible, if this were done, that the Bill could, in fact, be operated.  This again, of course, is presented in a most humble fashion to the legal luminaries on the Opposition benches as my interpretation, as I see it.  But, if the words were added, one interpretation I can see is that it would be impossible to operate the Bill as any livestock &mdash; any livestock &mdash; could become nominally the property of a proprietor of an unlicensed <Col N="599" /> mart while they are in the mart for sale.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the several interpretations that I feel are pretty obvious in regard to this amendment is that, if added, it would have the effect of nullifying the Bill, which may have been the intention, and, if it was not the intention, it would not do anything for the Bill other than to confuse and provide an escape for those who wish to run unlicensed marts as against those who are running licensed marts, who are doing the job properly today and will do it properly tomorrow. Fine Gael would be lending themselves, as their various confusing amendments have indicated, to encouragement of and provision for those who would evade the law to the detriment of those who observe it.</P>
      <P>Do Fine Gael realise that this is one of the very definite side effects that some of these confusing amendments would have?  They totally oppose the Bill &mdash; we can understand that.  They are now totally something else and something else in regard to all parts of it today, including their own amendments, because they are not moving them or talking for or against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>How will they oppose these things, if they will not oppose them?  Why will they not do the decent thing and withdraw them, as this amendment should be withdrawn, or do they want to make further upheaval in the House, in the order of the place, and try to nullify the whole institution here by their methods now being adopted.  This morning, they appear like spoiled children from whom the candy was taken last night, despite the fact that they knew the debate on this measure will end at 5 o'clock this afternoon.  I asked them, the day before yesterday, to get on with the Bill and to discuss it and to give us <Col N="600" /> the benefit of whatever they have to say which is worth hearing, but they are running away from it.  Today, they are running away not only from the Bill but from the amendments.  I am not surprised.  That interpretation which I have given is one thing.  There is an unlimited number of devices that, if these amendments were carried, could be used by those who wish to have unlicensed marts in the future, to evade licensing.</P>
      <P>The very serious point about this is not so much that these people without licences would get away with running a mart improperly or a badly-constructed mart, or poorly serving the people or charging exorbitant fees or battening on the farming community but, in addition, they could discriminate against whom they wish at any time whether it be the large farmer, the middle-sized farmer, the small farmer, the dealer, the tangler, the shipper, the exporter or the people from the dead meat trade either here or from abroad. These things could all be done and any one of them could be done.</P>
      <P>Are Fine Gael serious in their refusal to withdraw this amendment at this time?  Are they really seriously allowing this to stand in their name that will have the effect, if carried, of giving to those who wish to break the law not only the facility to do it but the important thing is to compete unfairly against those who will abide by the law, who are, in fact, today, in their operations in their marts, without practical exception throughout the country conforming to what is required in this Bill?  Are they to be thrown to the wolves by Fine Gael? Are they to be put in the position that unfair competition will be allowed to flourish by their side with the protection of a definition section rendered so abortive by this amendment?</P>

I should not mind letting them in without licences if that came to the point.  Even if they broke the law, it would not be very serious from the point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to point out that the seriousness of carrying an amendment such as this does not lie only in the facility with which the law might be broken by friends of those who put down the amendment, if needs be.  It is not that to which I should really seriously object but to the manner in which the efforts of those who have striven and put capital into building up marts, and taken quite a number of years to do it, would be frustrated and probably they would be put in jeopardy in so far as their into carry on against unfair discrimination is concerned.  That is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The breaking of the law, to anybody, must be serious, particularly to any of us here in the House, but it is only one point.  The second point is the unfair trading and discrimination and the advantage that it would give to those who would throw up any old structure anywhere and get in and carry on without a licence.  They could discriminate against those selling and against those buying; they could victimise people and not list them in the order in which they should be taken.  They might not like the fellow who is in first and put him at the end of the day, at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock in the evening, when whatever buyers were there had gone, when his particular type of animal, for various marketing reasons, would no longer be attractive from a sales point of view.  He would have missed the boat as well as missing the market.  In practice, this is what could <Col N="603" /> happen, and undoubtedly would happen, if this sort of person who would be induced by this sort of looseness were allowed to get into the business. We do not want these people and the marts already established, as well as any that may come into being, whether private or co-operative, obviously do not want any part of this sort of trick of the trade in which that type of character would engage.</P>
    <P>We have the further difficulty that without there being a requirement on these people who could evade a licence, they could evade all the requirements that may be necessary and that are already provided by the other marts. They could ignore these and from the point of view of veterinary operations, we as a Department could be in great difficulty and as a result our trade in cattle could be put in jeopardy, not at home but abroad.  We have this matter of blue cards to be dealt with, and we have brucellosis coming along, and this has to be tied in in some system.  We have had in operation the warble fly regulations and the certification of animals that were regarded as being clear.  These matters could not be seen to properly by the officers of my Department where they would need to be seen to most, in an unlicensed establishment, where, no doubt, any sort of mixing of cattle would be allowed, the mixing of bulls and heifers, to the detriment of the trade.  We would have no say in this sort of thing and we would just have to stand by and allow it.</P>
    <P>Those friends of Fine Gael who helped to get this amendment before the House could do as they wished, not just for their own pleasure and good but for their undue benefit, for undue discrimination, victimisation and intimidation together with the aborting of the veterinary regulations which are required to be put into operation by my Department and by a number of importing countries.  These requirements will be more onerous in the future and therefore will require to be better seen to and better regulated in the future.  Existing marts and those which will be licensed will facilitate us in doing these things and carrying out new regulations now emerging from European countries, and particularly <Col N="604" /> the Common Market.  We could not allow this thing, even if we were inclined to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not what Fine Gael are saying in this amendment. What they are saying is: &ldquo;Let us go ahead and have the Marts Bill; let us destroy it in every detail we can, but still let us have it.  Let us have as many loopholes as possible for the trick-of-the-loops.&rdquo; We do not want the trick-of-the loops.  I am pointing out to Deputy L'Estrange that this amendment would facilitate and ensure the entry into the marts business of trick-of-the-loops who would not have to conform to any regulations whatsoever because this sort of amendment would take them right out of the terms and duties imposed on them by regulations under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask Fine Gael would they not think again, liverish and all though they may be this morning, and not blindly follow the course of action announced already that they are going to oppose everything all day today again.  They are not going to discuss things but just oppose them.  What is the purpose of this?  Whom does it benefit?  I do not think it benefits Fine Gael, but that is their business.  I hate to see them really writing themselves off as an incompetent Opposition as well as a useless one, but it is not good for the standing of the House that an Opposition should behave, as they are behaving, like spoiled children from whom the candy has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their amendments are not going to be discussed and there is no discussion on the sections of the Bill or what is in the Bill, and this is confirming what I suspected, that Fine Gael do not want to have the terms of the Bill ventilated. They are afraid to ventilate their own amendments, and if possible, they do not want to have any discussion so that the terms of the Bill and the ministerial amendments will not be brought to light and will not be seen to contain the benefits they undoubtedly do contain.  I challenged <Col N="605" /> Fine Gael last night, and I begged them at least to use today to discuss the Bill but they have fallen down completely.  They have confirmed my worst fears that they do not want the public to know what is in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

This amendment, as other amendments, is held as being something useful and worthwhile, in an endeavour to show to the public a false picture in regard to what this section is intended to do.</P>

      <P>What I should like to say is, that when things are not going your way in debate, or otherwise, do not start dragging in things which have nothing to do with the debate.  This upsets the debate and makes for a longer discussion than is really necessary. I would appeal to the Deputy not to do that in the future.  It is not good for him, for me, for the House or for the country.  It certainly is no help to this Bill.  It tends to put me off what I was about to say in regard to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The devices I was talking about that could be used by the bright boys who would come into this are too numerous to mention, and probably not even all are known to me.  It will take time to find them all out.  One way we could find out would be to put this amendment through, or half a dozen of the Fine Gael amendments, and let the bright boys find their way through them, as they would.  They would find so many holes that it would be like a sieve.  Possibly this is now emerging as Fine Gael's real intention.  If these <Col N="606" /> words were added, it would read &ldquo;would not include the sale otherwise than by auction of livestock the property of the proprietor of such a place.&rdquo; It is confusing.  Its interpretation has the three disadvantages I have mentioned, the main one being the unfair competition that Fine Gael would bring about for the legitimate marts that will be licensed when this Bill goes through, the marts that have been doing such a good job, have invested so much capital and have been carrying out improvements over the years, as I am sure they will continue to do as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I consider that the scandalous feature of this amendment.  The Party regarded as the main Opposition Party have so little regard for the well-being of the marts, about which they have been shedding crocodile tears all these weeks, that they would deliberately&mdash; one might almost say, with malice aforethought &mdash; bring in an amendment that would put into competition with the legitimate marts that will be licensed in the future unlicensed trick-of-the-loops, who would not spend anything, not conform to anything, who would have advantages above and beyond the legitimate people doing their business properly, who would leave the Department and its regulations standing, who would ignore the local authorities in regard to hygiene and other regulations.</P>
    <P>It concerns all these things and many more that only the minds of these trick-of-the-loops seek to provide for here and to take advantage of, to the real detriment and loss of the legitimate marts operating to-day.  I believe they will continue to flourish, particularly with the help and assistance of this Bill, which will keep out of the business these people whom I am inclined to think of &mdash; perhaps I am being uncharitable at this hour of the morning &mdash; as the friends of the Fine Gael Party who cannot find a legitimate or useful way of life under present circumstances and who want to have a particular loop-hole through which they could work to their own advantage, and to hell with the country, the cattle and the farmers.</P>

They have an innocent appearance but they are very clever indeed because if either or any or all of them were adopted, the Bill would become useless because in other amendments we have seen the loopholes which they proposed to insert in the Bill.

      <P>If the words &ldquo;but does <Col N="614" /> not include the sale otherwise than by auction of livestock the property of the proprietor of such a place&rdquo; were added, it would be impossible to operate the Bill in regard to any livestock, because all livestock could nominally become the property of the proprietor. This may seem to be a gross exaggeration, but even though we assume that the majority of the people are basically honest, there are a certain percentage who make it incumbent on us and make it incumbent, indeed, on all Governments, to provide protection against those who are willing to take advantage by sleight-of-hand, or by play with words.  We see this operated in numerous cases, particularly where livestock itself is concerned.  We have licensed hauliers; we have people without licences who are also hauliers and who would be entitled to bring their own livestock to a mart or fair.  However, if they do so for hire or reward and if they are stopped by the gardaí, they first claim the cattle are theirs. Until such time as it goes to court and they are put under oath, they will remain adamant in this contention.</P>
      <P>A similar situation would undoubtedly arise in the livestock business if this amendment were added.  It would leave itself wide open to abuse, abuse that would be to the detriment of the entire Bill, might well undermine its effect, and certainly would make the operation of it nigh impossible.</P>

There is a number of amendments moved by members of the Fine Gael Party on which we require and, I think, are entitled to get a decision from the House.  In view of the fact that a guillotine motion was moved and closure of the guillotine accepted by the Chair last night after a discussion of approximately 1½ hours, I suggest it is only reasonable that the minority in the House be given an opportunity of getting decisions from the House on these amendments.  I suggest it is quite clear that in moving this motion there is no question that it is an infringement of the rights of the minority in the House because it is the Government majority that are endeavouring to prevent a decision being taken on these amendments.</P>

If the words &ldquo;but does not include the sale otherwise than by auction of livestock the property of the proprietor of such a place&rdquo; were inserted, it would be more than simple for the proprietor of an unlicensed mart to claim that the animals were his and, indeed, while an inspector or any member of the public or any person might be well satisfied that these cattle were not in fact the property of the proprietor, it could be difficult to prove this.  Therefore it would leave the entire business of licensed marts open to abuse unprecedented in this country.</P>

Surely, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are the person to rule on whether someone is reading or referring to notes and surely it is not the prerogative of any Deputy on the Opposition Benches to instruct you on your functions in this House?  We have seen how unworkable this amendment would make the entire Bill.  Indeed its principal purpose would be to make the Bill completely worthless.  If this amendment were accepted, the Bill might as well be rejected by the House immediately.</P>
      <P>I do not think any responsible person wants this Bill rejected, because everyone appreciates that the new regulations especially emanating from the EEC make it incumbent on us to build up a very high regard in all spheres of our livestock, as we have built up in our freedom from foot and mouth disease, as well as the value of a certificate from the Department of Agriculture in this respect.</P>
      <P>These are things we must guard jealously in this House and to ensure that any amendment, no matter how well intentioned&mdash;and I assume they were well intentioned&mdash;would not frustrate the overriding aim to bring about a proper and regularised method of sale.

      <P>There would be no limit to the number of devices which might be adopted to frustrate this Bill and its purpose if this amendment were included and, indeed, Deputies from rural Ireland know full well that the majority of the farming community and the majority of the people involved in the livestock industry one way or another are honest men, but unfortunately as in every walk of life, there is the small percentage who would queer the pitch for their own personal gain, on a short term basis only, with no reference to and no thought whatever for the overall position from the national point of view, or indeed, from the point of view of their neighbours or anyone else connected with the livestock trade.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this amendment.

      <P>Deputy, behave yourself, please.  We just want to say this about it.  What these two together would provide if they were both carried is that authorisation to carry on the business of livestock marts would be given to the district courts.  What I say to Deputy Dillon is this.  Why did he not give in his time under his Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures <Col N="625" /> Act of 1955 these things to the district court if he was so fond of them?  Why did he not think it was right then if it is so right now unless Deputy Dillon does not at all agree with the legal people in his Party who put down these amendments to refer these things, unnecessarily in my estimation and in Deputy Dillon's estimation, when he was Minister for Agriculture in 1955, to the district court?  Why should that go through now, particularly if Deputy Dillon is still against that as he obviously <Col N="626" /> displayed at that time?  We do not agree with that.  We do not agree with taking amendments which are consequential on amendments not yet reached and we are naturally opposing this.  In order to get on to some amendments that might at least even read sensibly, though they do not contain any sense, I do not propose to say any more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether, in view of the likelihood of a serious glut in the supply of small cattle next September and October, he <Col N="643" /> will at this stage initiate a vigorous campaign, especially in British agricultural journals, outlining this country's agricultural market objectives, as there appears to be widespread prejudice on this matter in British agricultural circles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already arranged for the engagement of the services of a publicity consultant in Britain to promote the interests of Irish store cattle there, and I intend to take any other measures that seem useful and advisable.</P>
      <P>There has been an ill-founded propaganda campaign against the Irish cattle trade in certain circles in Britain during the past year.  Unfortunately, some of the blame for starting this must be attributed to some ill-advised sectional interests here who for their own selfish ends did not hesitate to put out false and misleading statements, which, of course, were taken up with alacrity on the other side of the Channel.</P>
      <P>I think it appropriate also to refer to a statement issued yesterday in London by the National Farmers Union, which is most seriously misleading and greatly to be deplored. The fact of the matter is that the primary factor in the present British meat supply situation is the very big increase in British domestic production in recent years.  For example, cattle numbers in Britain increased by no less than 650,000 head in the past couple of years.  It is estimated in regard to British beef supplies in the second half of 1967 that there will be a fall in imports compared with the second half of 1966 but an increase in overall supplies due to the rise in British production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade in cattle and beef between Ireland and Britain is governed by the Free Trade Area Agreement of 1965. Under that Agreement British import restrictions cannot be applied to Irish fat cattle and beef except in the context of the International Commodity Arrangement which applies not only to all supplying countries but to British <Col N="644" /> home producers as well.  There is no such Arrangement in existence.  In fact, Nos. 14 and 15 of the Record of Understanding in connection with the Free Trade Area Agreement give British recognition to all exports of agricultural produce under the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and make special provision for maintaining access for them to that market.</P>
    <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement, of course, like all such Agreements, confers advantages on both sides.  The British National Farmers Union and other British interests in criticising the Agreement conveniently overlook the very substantial advantages accruing to British industrial exports under the Agreement.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that there is a familiar ring about the reply which he has given?  Is he aware that he conveyed the very same statement over his Private Secretary's name on 20th January last when he stated that an instalment of £230 is being paid in this case and that a further inspection will be arranged with a view to payment of the balance when the Department is notified that the house is completed? Is the Minister further aware that, notwithstanding the fact that he said on 20th January that an instalment of £230 was being paid, not one shilling has been paid, although apparently the grant was ready for payment on that date?  Is he still further aware that the public utility concerned wrote about this grant on 15th November, 1966, 28th November, 1966, 24th January, <Col N="647" /> 1967, 21st March, 1967, and 1st May, 1967, and that the unfortunate man has not got one shilling yet?

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is a familiar ring about my reply in this case, as the Deputy says.  In this case I started off by saying that there was some delay.  To my knowledge, this is the first such case that has come to my notice since I became Minister for Local Government in which there was delay on the part of the Department. Not all the delay was caused by the Department.  Some of the delay was due to the fact that on two occasions when it was reported that the roof of this house was ready for inspection it was found not to be complete.  I agree that delay was before the dates which Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> has mentioned.</P>
      <P>As I said, there was delay that should not have occurred since that. This delay was due to the fact that when the county council reported that they had no notification of the allocation of any land to the applicant, my Department mistakenly adopted the procedure that used to be there of waiting until such notification had been received, until the question of title was cleared up, although that procedure has not, in fact, been appropriate since February, 1966, and that should not have been done.  That is what caused the avoidable delay that should not have occurred in this case. This was a mistake, and mistakes do occur, which should not have occurred.</P>

I am pointing out to the Deputy and to the House that the Army and the State honour all who secured our independence on the one day, Easter Sunday, in each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be undesirable to ask the Industrial Development Authority, who have been entrusted with management of the pilot scheme for a small industries programme, to supply detailed particulars at this stage.  The Authority will furnish a report early next year of their experiences during the test period, together with their recommendations as to the eventual form of a programme for small industries.  At that stage I would propose to make a full statement to the house.  I may say, however, that the pilot scheme has revealed already a field of opportunity for development which is very encouraging. A number of projects have been approved and others are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there seems to be a lack of information regarding the facilities now available to the local development association and local enterprise, under the terms of this scheme, would the Minister consider issuing a special explanatory leaflet or brochure which would give information as to what facilities are available, what grants and so forth?  I found that the lack of understanding of the actual facilities was quite considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two difficulties in the way of the Deputy's suggestion. First of all, the Deputy will recall that this is a pilot scheme. Therefore, any arrangements in operation in respect of it are temporary and may well be changed, so the distribution <Col N="654" /> of a leaflet giving details of this nature&mdash;which might be changed, say, within 12 months&mdash;could lead to confusion.</P>
      <P>The second difficulty is to make contact with the people to whom this is of real interest, and we are endeavouring to cover that by the co-operation of the local authorities and various local voluntary organisations.  In the portions of the test areas which are counties which have development teams, an officer of the development team is the liaison officer for that county.  Where there is no county development team, the local authority have appointed one of its officers to act as liaison officer.  Therefore, in the case of the Deputy's county, Limerick County Council have appointed an officer to act for this purpose.  If the Deputy has contact with people who want to make inquiries locally and be dealt with locally, perhaps he would make contact with the county council and it can be dealt with in that way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after subsection (5), to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a)  Whenever the Minister proposes to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke a licence, because of a contravention of regulations under section 6 of this Act prescribing any matter specified in paragraphs (e) to (i) of section 6 (2) of this Act, he shall, before doing so, notify the holder of or the applicant for the licence of his intention and of the reasons therefor, and, if any representations are made to the Minister within seven days after the date of the giving of the notification by the holder or applicant, as the case may be, the Minister shall consider them.</P>
      <P>(b)  Whenever the Minister proposes to revoke a licence because of a contravention of regulations under section 6 of this Act prescribing any matter specified in paragraphs (e) to (i) of section 6 (2) of this Act, the Minister shall not do so until the expiration of one month after the date of the giving of the notification aforesaid, and, if, within seven days after the giving of the notification aforesaid, the holder of the licence makes a request to the Minister for the holding of an inquiry in relation to the matter, the Minister shall cause an inquiry to be held (unless, as a result of the consideration of representations made to him, the Minister has decided not to revoke the licence).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Where an inquiry is held under this subsection, the Minister shall not revoke the licence <Col N="667" /> until he has considered the report of the person holding the inquiry.</P>
    <P>(d)  The Minister shall appoint a person who is a practising barrister of at least ten years' standing to hold any inquiry under this subsection and the person so appointed shall have power to take evidence on oath which he is hereby authorised to administer and shall make a report to the Minister of his findings at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>(e)  The Minister shall give to the person who requested the holding of the inquiry notice of the time and place of the holding of the inquiry and the person shall be entitled to appear at the inquiry personally or by counsel or solicitor and to adduce evidence.</P>
    <P>(f)  There shall be paid to a person holding an inquiry under this subsection such remuneration as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may fix.</P>
    <P>( ) Whenever the Minister revokes a licence, he shall cause a statement of his reasons for doing so to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should say there is mention here of a paragraph (i), as being the only procedure available to us and one which has been practised on similar occasions in the past, in anticipation of the acceptance of amendment No. 22, which would add another paragraph to section 6 (2).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is threefold, namely, to provide that where it is proposed to refuse a marts licence this intention and the reasons for it will be notified to the applicant, who will have seven days within which to make representations to the Minister, who must&mdash;the Minister must&mdash; consider any such representations. Further, where it is proposed to revoke a licence for reasons related to structure, accommodation and standards, including hygienic and veterinary standards, similar notification <Col N="668" /> will be given.  Similar representations may be made and the applicant will also have the right to request an inquiry by an experienced barrister, whose report the Minister must consider before rejecting the licence. Where mart licences are revoked a statement of the reasons for doing so will be laid before the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>We have already dealt with amendment No. 10 which was to the effect that &ldquo;a decision refusing to grant a licence shall comprise a statement specifying the reasons for the refusal to grant the licence&rdquo;.  Despite the fact that this amendment No. 15 was doing the job asked for by the Opposition in amendment No. 10, and doing it very much better, we had a further indication from Fine Gael of their whole outlook in regard to procedure in this House, because they pressed amendment No. 10 to a division which was completely unnecessary and without any reason whatever.</P>

The throwing across of names now and for the past two or three weeks is of no consequence and certainly is no addition to the worth or otherwise of the Bill. Nor does it inhibit me from saying what I must and should say in regard to this measure in this House for the benefit of Deputies, and particularly for the benefit of the public outside who are being confused by the misstatements, misconceptions, myths and half-truths being perpetrated and circulated by Fine Gael for weeks on end.</P>

They just cannot accept the fact that people are intelligent in this country, both inside and outside this House, but particularly outside.</P>

They are the first to destroy them when they do not suit them, and they then start blaming somebody else. That is typical Fine Gael tactics as they have emerged not only in this debate but on every similar debate since I came into this House.  Deputy Dillon is a pastmaster at this business of lauding the procedures of this institution and at the same time, when it suits him and his Party and the politics of his Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is codding nobody and will not cod anybody in the future, least of all in respect of this Bill.  We had a vote on amendment No. 10.  We had Fine Gael pushing that, giving us an excellent description of what it would do.  They told us in detail how it would help the Bill, what it would add and they were most concise in their explanation because the only words uttered, as far as I <Col N="670" /> know, and I did not hear them, so inaudible were they, were spoken by Deputy Clinton who, I believe, said: &ldquo;I move&rdquo;.  That was his succinct, concise and convincing argument in favour of this amendment which they put the House to the trouble, expense and time of dividing on, when another amendment covering the matter much better was still to come and was not, obviously, being opposed by the Government, which the Government, in fact, had put down.  I take it now that Fine Gael will be consistent and, having voted for amendment No. 10, which has been beaten, and rightly so, will now vote against amendment No. 15&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They were hoping for amendment No. 10 and would not explain what it was about other than to say: &ldquo;I move&rdquo;.  At the same time, while behaving in this way in regard to their own amendment, on which there was lack of explanation, it is not beyond them, and has not been during these past few days, to charge the Minister with not giving explanations, with not telling the House what he is doing. We were given that very succinct and most concise explanation and argument in favour of his, according to them, very necessary amendment, No. 10, in words which, as I say, I did not hear but understand were: &ldquo;I move&rdquo;. This is Fine Gael at their very best, at their peak, in deception and hypocrisy, in which only they as a political Party can reach such heights or ever have in the past, or probably will in the future. I am delighted to hear that at least there is consistency in their madness. They looked for this matter in a small way in amendment No. 10 because it is their own and are now going to vote against it in amendment No. 15 because it is put forward by the Government.  Could anything be more <Col N="671" /> explicit, more clear, or could anything demonstrate more clearly to the public what a lot of humbugs they are in Fine Gael in regard to this matter and, indeed, to very many other matters, but never more clearly demonstrated than by their tactics and actions on this Bill and particularly on the two amendments I am talking about?

Squirm in your seat.  Laugh at what is being said because that is now the only thing you can do.  This thing has been made a joke of by Fine Gael, all in the interests of the farmers, on the one hand, and of the mart owners, on the other, of the co-operative movement of which they, apparently, are the guardians.  They and they alone have any interest in the co-operative movement; nobody else has any right even to think or talk about such.  They are going to guard that well, and the co-ops and the marts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment stinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it is not this amendment that stinks but the one emanating from over there.  In the Seed Production Act of 1955, there is no appeal on any matter to anybody, barristers or other persons.  This is another of the little gems that Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture in those days, sponsored and piloted through this House, supported by most of the people over there or whoever came before them.  The Seed Production Act of 1955 contains no appeal or inquiry provision such as I am providing here.  What I am proposing here does mean something and it is more than was given to the farmers by the Fine Gael Party in those days. Remember, it was largely the farmers that that Act covered, although there would have been dealers as well.  Here in this amendment we are dealing with mart owners and operators who are much fewer in number than the farmers.  There are far fewer participating in the marts business than there are farmers in the seed production business.  Yet Deputy Dillon, this guardian of all he regards as sacred for the benefit of our people, piloted the Seed Production Act through this House in 1955, and not as much as a line was there of redress or appeal being given to the farmers under this great man of those days who has just departed out the door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> Why have things changed so much since then?  Have we all become much less enlightened than the Members of this House in those days?  Is it to be expected that we would be treating our people worse in 1967 than they were treated in 1955?  This surely is not in keeping with the trend of things since those days.  It is a complete answer to Deputy Dillon and his colleagues who are looking for appeals on behalf of the mart owners in regard to the revocation or the granting of licences, that they themselves, and he, in particular, as Minister for Agriculture in the then Coalition Government, put through the Seed Production Act without making any provision whatsoever for appeal by farmers about whom he shed so many crocadile tears.</P>
    <P>Whom does he think he is codding? Does he believe he is codding the farmers in respect of his alleged regard for their wellbeing and the upholding of what he calls their inalienable rights?  Deputy Dillon is not codding me or anybody else on this side of the House, and I know from the fact that they threw him out some while ago that he is not codding Fine Gael. Nobody knows him better than they do.  They found him out, only it was a wee bit late.  The election was over and they had gone down the drain for another time.  It was not all his fault, but they did find him out.  He is not codding anybody and he is certainly not codding the farmers, big or small. With all his glib talk in the House, when we look back on the record, we find what he did in similar circumstances when he had the same opportunity as I have as Minister for Agriculture.  He put through the Seed Production Act, without a right of appeal provision.  In addition, there was the Fertilisers and Mineral Mixtures Act and it did not include anything he now says is so vital to this Bill.</P>
    <P>We want the House and the country to realise that this amendment, which is long and somewhat involved but, nevertheless, clear and precise, does confer benefits on those people who will come within the categories to be licensed under this measure, if <Col N="677" /> it becomes an Act, and that it has been put there by Fianna Fáil voluntarily and with the knowledge, and I hope&mdash; I would almost say absolutely&mdash;the agreement of the Marts Association. Or does somebody want to say he does not agree with this, that he is against it?  Do I hear a voice saying that some one or other of the associations are opposed to the amendment?  If there is such a voice, I should like to hear it.</P>
    <P>The NAC have considered and discussed this sort of an arrangement and they also agree that it is an addition that is well worth making to the Bill as originally drafted.  Fine Gael do not seem to want it; they want their own little niggling way of putting it in the amendment already defeated and which they cannot recall.  Surely, even at this late stage they will have the courage of their convictions if they have any&mdash;I should first have questioned if they have any courage&mdash;and support this amendment, even though supporting it will only lay them further open to the charge of duplicity, of not being logical or consistent within the last hour in this House.  But this inconsistency, this lack of logic that will be displayed if they support the amendment will be small in comparison with the good they will do themselves in the eyes of the public whom they are trying to cod but should be serving.</P>

      <P>Resuming where I left off in the hope of educating the Opposition as to the merits of this amendment, let me put it to them that here is what it will do.  Those who find themselves in the position that for one reason or another a licence is refused or revoked under subsection (a) and when the Minister proposes to refuse to grant or revoke a licence because of a contravention of the regulations under section 6 of the Act&mdash;section 6 is a governing section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was saying when the call for a house interrupted me was that section 6 of this Bill, as is indicated here in subparagraph (a) of the proposed amendment, is rather a governing section in regard to the matter of refusal to grant or to revoke a licence by the Minister.  It gives this right to those who find themselves, for these reasons under section 6, in the position that either a licence they hold is proposed to be revoked or where they are applying for a licence and because of some shortcomings under section 6, they did not qualify.  They are given a right in the first part of the amendment that the Minister must notify the holder of, or the applicant for, the licence of his intention and, furthermore, that he must in doing so, give his reasons for this proposed revocation or his proposed refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We go on from that, lest these applicants might in any way be taken short for time&mdash;if this had escaped them&mdash; and say to them: &ldquo;If by any chance you missed the reason why we are to revoke or refuse your licence, we want you to know that this is the reason specified and set out; we want you to <Col N="679" /> have seven days to consider this information, if it should be new to you, during which time you may, if you think fit, give notification&mdash;either the holder of a licence or the applicant for a licence&mdash;for consideration to the Minister, and the Minister will be obliged personally, as Minister for Agriculture, to examine these things that may be sent back at this very late stage.</P>
    <P>Again, where we have a revocation in prospect for contravention of the regulations under section 6, the same section, we are providing that the holder of a licence, within seven days after the giving of the notification telling them of the proposal to revoke his licence, may require the Minister to cause an inquiry to be held&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Dunne has given notice that he intends raising a matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the exodus now in progress from the House.  Of course, we are only going to talk now about something which really concerns the people vitally, that is, the condition of the old age pensioners.  We are not going to hear bells ringing all day for them.  We are not going to have a display of animus versus political spleen on behalf of the old pensioners. They do not matter.  They come at the end of the day when everybody is running for a train or a taxi and when everybody is too busy to bother.</P>
      <P>I gave notice that I would like to take up in the House with the Minister the fact that a majority of this Dáil approved of the proposal contained in the Budget statement of this year that arrangements should be made whereby old age pensioners and blind people might travel free on CIE services.  This may seem a matter of small consequence to those who are concerned about the transference of wealth in the rural towns of Ireland, whether it be by mart or otherwise, but it is of vital consequence and importance to the hundreds of thousands of old people throughout the length and breadth of this Republic who have lived, in the main, lives of hardship.</P>
      <P>It is probably true to say that the kind of lives they have had to live to get a living in this country in the past half century, the kind of difficulties they have had to endure in bringing families into the world, rearing and educating them, that kind of existence will not be seen again, because not just this country but the world has rejected the kind of economic slavery they had to undergo.  Let us try to look at this thing with the eye of humanity and with a feeling of obligation to those who have gone before us.  If we think of the debt owed to the generation being referred to here &mdash; leaving aside for the moment, the blind people&mdash; nobody in this House can say to himself that we have done what we should have done by them.</P>
      <P>Here there was a suggestion pressed by this Party over a long number of years that these people should at least be given the facility of travel on the public transport services without being charged.  Most of them are in what may be described as the autumn of their days.  Far from being economically independent, most of them suffer the difficulties which old people seem inevitably to suffer &mdash; the loneliness of old age and the shortage of money wherewith to make life more bearable. It seemed to most Deputies that at the end of all this agitation and effort, made mostly, if not exclusively, by the Labour Party, this simple concession of free travel should be made available to them.  There was a general feeling that whatever you might say about the Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie Haughey, at least he has done this. Knowing him personally my belief is that the Minister for Finance in making the proposal could not have had in mind the kind of end result which we see here in the conditions which have been drawn up obviously by the Civil Service.  I do not want to attack civil servants because they are not here.  Obviously, these conditions were drawn up by the Civil Service in consultation with CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at present is as follows: an old age pensioner will not be allowed to use the buses free, except at certain stated times.  These times, which were outlined to the Dáil yesterday by the <Col N="697" /> Minister for Social Welfare, are that from Monday to Friday inclusive, he will be forbidden to use the buses free from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, on long-distance bus services leaving Dublin, Cork and Limerick between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Fridays within a 20-mile radius of those cities; on long distance bus and rail services from noon on Friday to midnight on Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend and from 23rd to 27th December inclusive.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible for these gems of regulations but, whoever they are, I would like, through this House, it being the only method of expressing one's views I can find in matters of this kind, to have conveyed to him my conception of his mind.  It is the mind of a pauper: only a pauper mentality could have conceived this. Here we have CIE, well known to be running at a loss, not of thousands or of hundreds of thousands, but of millions. It is an accepted fact of the national economic set-up that CIE is running at a loss.  Many of us can see the buses half and threequarters empty most of the time, not alone during the so-called valley hours but at other times as well.  I must blame the Minister for Social Welfare, although I would think the blame can be ascribed more accurately to the Minister for Transport and Power more than anybody else, knowing his remoteness from the real problems of the Irish people.  But here we have the Minister for Social Welfare imagining throngs of old age pensioners and blind people storming the bus queues during the busy hours and depriving the rest of the population of their seats on the public transport service.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the workers of this city, for whom I have some title to speak&mdash; as was demonstrated in the very recent past &mdash; the people who use the buses and trains during the busy hours are most anxious that there should be absolute free and untrammelled right given to the old age pensioners and the blind to travel without any charge whatsoever on the transport services.</P>
    <P>These regulations &mdash; this is an actual <Col N="698" /> document which is pasted into the pension book of every old age pensioner and blind pensioner &mdash; provide amongst other things that pensioners getting on a bus may be required, if the conductor considers that he or she is not a person qualified under the regulations to be travelling on the bus, to show their pension books and to sign a document to prove that they are in fact the persons they claim to be.  The conductor may compare the signature with some other document he may have in his possession.</P>
    <P>Did you ever hear the like of it? First, they would have to take their pension books every time they went out, with the obvious danger of losing them and with the resultant inconvenience that might entail.  Then, if it is found necessary by any official to prove their identity, they must make a public demonstration of who they are, with all the embarrassment that will bring upon them.  It brings to mind in its stupidity and utter disregard for the feelings of the aged and the blind a similar case which happened in respect of another Department, to my knowledge, where a lady friend of mine applied for what were once called false teeth and are now known as dentures.  She was informed by the Department that she could only get them if she were pregnant.  She wrote back and asked how this could be arranged as she was over 80 years of age and had been a widow for a considerable number of years and that she would be obliged to the Department of Health if they could give her some information on that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did she get an answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think she got the false teeth though.  She should have, certainly.  I am not quite certain about what the end result was.  She told me that and that was in the reign of the former Minister for Health who, I am quite certain, would have been more than anxious to provide her with false teeth.  I just mention that as an example of what can happen &mdash; the stupidity of Departments in dealing with the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have what I regard as the <Col N="699" /> very quintessence of the kind of mind which cannot give anything graciously.  There is to be found within the make-up of this Government and, indeed, it seems, of most Governments and certainly within the organisation through which the Government operate a kind of mind which thinks that whatever is to be given must be cabined and confined and regulated in such a fashion that the good is taken out of it.  That is what is happening here.  On the one hand, we say we should make free travel available.  The Dáil is anxious to do it.  It does not represent any financial loss to the country whatsoever. Even if it did, of course, one could establish the case that it should be done.  But, the Dáil is completely anxious to do it and here we have the petty mind at work which ever seems to come to the surface in this country, an accursed thing.  I do not think it is because of our history or because of the British but it is an inherent thing that when the beggar gets on horseback he will ride to the devil.  That is what is happening in this case.  I want to say to the Minister, let us show a bit of consideration to these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to me yesterday on this question, said something to the effect that this was a concession.  What is a concession?  The word &ldquo;concession&rdquo; has about it the ring of meanness, that we are giving them something to which they are not entitled.  Are they not entitled to it? Are they not entitled to far more than this, to a decent living in their own country for what they have done to build up this country in so far as it can be said to have been built up?  Are they not entitled to a better way of life for what they have endured?  This small thing is vitiated and almost destroyed by the regulations to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to do the decent thing and cut out all this stuff and say that the aged and the blind can travel on the buses.  It will make no difference.  There will be no disruption of organisation.  The country will not lose by it and we will be paying back a little of what we owe to these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> I should like to know from the Minister what would be the position of persons in receipt of British old age pensions in this country.  Are they automatically entitled to the same conditions as will be made to apply to people receiving Irish pensions, both blind and old age?  This is a very important point and one that the Minister might clarify for us.  I appeal to those few who are in the House and by their presence are evidencing interest in the plight of these people &mdash; not to take me as claiming a corner in sympathy for these people.  I know that everybody here has as much sympathy for them and probably more than I have.  I know that the Minister, as a normal reasonable man, has sympathy for them but I want him to translate this sympathy into actual fact.  Words are lightly spoken and they are of little good to persons who are living on the very fringe, as it were, in the economic sense.  These people in large numbers have to depend on what they get from the State.  Too often are they neglected by their own, as we all well know. This small thing should not be dragged in the muck in which it has been dragged by trying to confine it in this ridiculous fashion.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday that under the present dispensation an old age pensioner on a Christmas day who has not got his fare to go to Mass will walk to Mass.  The Minister for Justice intervened: was it a matter of any importance?  It is a matter of great importance to the people concerned, particularly to the elderly.  As we well know, things of this kind have assumed for them an importance which, to young people with their lives before them, like the Minister for Justice, may not appear obvious.  That is one point. I take it out of the whole set of regulations to show to the Dáil the kind of mind behind these regulations, a mind which says that there would be a great many people looking to use the buses or trains on these days and, therefore, in case they might lose 2/- on the railway line or 10/- on the Ballyfermot line, they had better cut that out in view of the fact that they could get fares there during Christmas.  Is this in the spirit of Christmas?  I do not want <Col N="701" /> to go on with that because I would be entering into a realm which much more properly belongs to my learned and distinguished colleague from the same constituency.</P>
    <P>I want to say, though, that I am bringing it forward in the knowledge that CIE had a big hand in the making of these regulations.  All I ask is that these people be given a ticket similar to that given to some very highly paid people in CIE who give free travel to themselves, without any regulations or confinement, without any abbreviations of their rights and who use these free tickets only when their Mercedes or Rolls-Royces break down.  That is all I am asking.  It is not very much.  I would ask the Minister to look at it in that light and do away with this thing.  The gesture will cost nothing and will mean a lot to the people concerned.  I cannot visualise great numbers of this class going to use the buses during the busy hours anyway but, if they do infringe, surely they might be given that much grace?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must call on the Minister to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy answered the whole case in his last statement that he could not visualise great numbers of this class going to use the buses during the busy hours anyway.  That is exactly the position.  Everybody wants the peak hour transport to be left as far as possible to those who have to come into work, go home to lunch, return to their work and go home again at certain peak hours.  For that reason it was decided that people who can ordinarily do their journey at other times suitable should do so and the times which suit old people best are off-peak traffic times.  This is quite obvious.  Indeed, nobody would like to see old people being jostled out in peak travel hours because it is not very nice even for the hale and hearty to travel at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say that I had anything to do with bringing in something to the scheme which the Minister for Finance did not anticipate is quite wrong.  That would be obvious to the Deputy if he <Col N="702" /> would read the Minister's statement on two occasions, first on 11th April when, as we had agreed in the Government before the Budget, he said in his Budget Statement:</P>
    <P>A scheme is being worked out in consultation with CIE whereby old age and blind pensioners will be able to travel free of charge on CIE buses and trains during periods when traffic is not heavy,</P>
    <P>and on 2nd May when replying to the Debate on the Budget he said:</P>
    <P>The only restriction will be that the old people will be expected to use this facility in off-peak hours, and I think that is fairly reasonable There will be no great rigidity about this, but we would expect that the facilities will not be availed of in the rush hours when bus services, particularly, are heavily taxed.</P>
    <P>The exempted hours do not in any way inconvenience anybody.  Indeed, of the huge number of letters I got and verbal words of thanks in respect of this facility &mdash; and as far as I know, those which the Minister for Finance got, too &mdash; not one single person complained of not being allowed to travel during rush hours; in fact, many of them said that is the time they did not want to travel.  The Deputy did his best to capitalise by making the most dramatic statement possible about it, that these old people wanted to travel during the rush hours and that I was preventing them travelling.  They do not want to travel during rush hours.</P>
    <P>As regards the statement made yesterday about their not being allowed to travel to Mass on Christmas Day, I can assure him that any old people who want to travel on that day will have these facilities made available to them free, and that would apply where public transport is available and suitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister will have to change the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in the regulations required for that.  I shall examine this as it goes on from time to time, and if there is any undue hardship being imposed with regard to <Col N="703" /> free travel, we are always open to amend it where possible.  I would be very slow to recommend that old people should be taken out in the cities during the rush hours, and I do not think they want to go, as Deputy Dunne said in his winding-up statement. These facilities are a great boon to these old people.  In fact when it was being arranged I considered that it was even better to them than some money added to their pensions.  They can in the quiet of the day, when traffic is low, get out to visit their friends, go on long journeys, get away to places of pilgrimage, get away somewhere for the weekend, and give themselves a better life than they would otherwise have if they were confined to their homes.  This was better to them than extra money, as I considered was the case in regard to the ESB concession, when people living alone could have some pleasure and comfort by being able to make greater use of heat and lighting during the long evenings.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much one can say in relation to this except to refer to the extraordinary statement Deputy Dunne has made in regard to being an advocate of this for many years.  I wonder why Deputy Corish, when he was Minister for Social Welfare, did not do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>None of you up there was in the House at the time you are talking about, so you do not know. You are taking your instructions from the <i>Irish Press,</i> which is not a dependable organ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main fact is that we are not giving free travel to these people during the time that is least suitable, least desirable, and the time when everybody is advised not to use the service.  A Minister would be very remiss in his duty if he were to decide to send old people out during the rush periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the only country in which this service is available. It is available in other countries. I will not say every country, because I have not had time to go into it and I am not sufficiently aquainted with the conditions in some countries, but in any of the cases I have made inquiries regarding this, I find that our scheme has fewer conditions attached to it and is more generous.  In some places, they are asked to pay a nominal fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>British old age pensioners do not come under the scheme.  This is something we could consider, but it would have to be considered on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These people in receipt of Irish pension books enjoy the facility to use the service at the times specified.  As I already said to Deputy Dunne yesterday in answer to his question, this does not inflict any undue hardship on anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has changed his mind about Christmas Day.  It is in the regulations that they cannot get free travel on that day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no city buses available before 10.30 on Christmas Day, as far as I know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. The point is that you are ruling them out altogether for the whole four days of Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bus service would not be too suitable, and with regard to free travel in the winter time, I do not think there is any demand for it.  I find that old age pensioners are more than grateful for this concession, and I think I am in touch with as many as Deputy Dunne or anyone else.  This is one of the best concessions these people have got.  It is yet in its infancy, and the Deputy is premature in rushing in here and trying to make capital out of it at this stage.  I do not think it necessary to say anything further. We have as much sympathy with these people as with any other section, and at least we have done something concrete for them.</P>
