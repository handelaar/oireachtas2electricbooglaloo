      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparatory work on a third programme for economic expansion will proceed in association with the detailed assessment of the implications of membership of the European Economic Community and its effect on the economy.  It is too early yet to say when the programme will be published, as its timing will depend on the course of our negotiations with the EEC.  In the meantime, interim planning will proceed on the lines which I indicated on the 25th July last when speaking in this House on the motion seeking approval of the decision to reactivate Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Council of the European Economic Community at its meeting on the 10th July, 1967, decided, as a first step, to refer the applications of Ireland and of the other applicant countries to the Commission for an opinion.  In a comprehensive Report dated the 29th September the Commission unanimously recommended the opening of negotiations with the applicant States in order to examine thoroughly the problems raised by their applications and to see if solutions consistent with the need for maintenance of cohesion and dynamism in an enlarged Community are possible.  The Commission's Report is to come before the Council for further consideration at its meeting on the 23rd October.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have seen the communiqués issued and the statements I made at the close of my visits to the Governments of five of the six Member countries.  I was greatly encouraged by the warm support for Ireland's application which I received from all of these Governments.  In completion of this series of visits I am to have discussions in Paris on the 3rd November with the President of France and with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and other members of the French Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No definite date has been given.  The meeting on the 23rd October will be important in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, could the Taoiseach arrange to have copies of the Commission's report circulated?  There is a great deal of difficulty in getting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that they are circulated from Belgium in French and that translation has had to be made.  That will have to be checked, and that having been done, I certainly would make arrangements to have copies circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach make use of the services of our muchtravelled Minister for External Affairs in this matter?  Could he say whether the Departments of External Affairs have conveyed to him any intimation as to the possible attitude of General de Gaulle to this country in this whole situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The services of the Minister for External Affairs are available to me and have been usefully employed in the work as to our preliminary application.  As far as General de Gaulle is concerned, we get the same services from Paris as from the other members of the Diplomatic Services, and this is an excellent services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether membership of the EEC will, should it become a fact, mean that Irish control of this country's military commitments will disappear and be replaced by the overall authority of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome does not contain any provisions which require new members, on entry to the European Economic Community, to surrender in any way the control now exercised by them in regard to military commitments and the Council of Ministers have no function in the matter under the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it then that a recent speech by a former Minister of the present Government at Strasbourg&mdash;and I refer to the present Deputy MacEntee&mdash;which suggested that we were going in as a nation holusbolus, with the full military and other commitments that would be called for by the Six, has no foundation in fact, and that that is yet another excercise of Deputy MacEntee's imagination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that our application for membership has been made without reserve and so far political involvement or obligations have not been worked out.  When we become members of the EEC, we will have our say in these political obligations.  As of now there is nothing in the Rome Treaty obliging any member Government to undertake any political obligation.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government have yet conceived a clear picture of the probable economic consequences of Ireland's entry into the EEC, particularly as it will affect employment in industry and the cost of living; and, if so, when this information will be provided to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my comprehensive statement in this House on the 25th July last on the reactivation of this country's application for membership of the European Economic Community. In that statement I dealt with the question of the implications for this country of membership of the Community in so far as they could be assessed at that time.  This information will be supplemented as and when possible.  As I have already indicated to the House, the extent to which details of the implications for Ireland of EEC membership can be publicised must be governed by the necessity of not prejudicing our negotiating position. The implications in particular sectors will depend on the terms of entry negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach <Col N="1127" /> is aware that many thousands of workers in this country are concerned to know in simple terms what will happen to them and their jobs in the particular application involved?  He must be aware that the statement he refers to which he made previously offers nothing by way of solution to the very vital problem of these workers.  Is he not conscious of his responsibility to try everything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish or intention to make a speech of it.  I ask the Taoiseach when he will tell us, when he will explain to the people and the workers of the nation&mdash;the whole nation&mdash;the industrial and agricultural workers, what will happen to them in this situation?  It is not sufficient that we should have vague assessments made in Civil Service language which nobody can translate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were members of Deputy Dunne's own political organisation and the labour movement involved in the most detailed analysis yet made of our industrial work in the form of membership of the CIO.  These reports were made available, the prognostications as to redundancy were made available, the recommendations for preventing them were made and were and are being fully implemented in so far as it is possible to complete implementation of them by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy obviously has not read the report made by the CIO.  The figures given were that without any adaptation, it could be up to 20,000.  With adaptation, that figure could be reduced to one-quarter.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the <Col N="1132" /> figures of the total numbers of driver-accompanied and cars carried into the State by sea and air for the years 1964-1966 and for the nine months January-September, 1967.  These relate mainly to cars brought in by visitors to the country, but they also include cars belonging to Irish residents returning from visits outside the State, for which separate figures are not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tavistock Report was not submitted to the Government. The Report was the outcome of a socio-diagnostic study into the morale of Dublin busmen carried out by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and sponsored jointly by CIE, the trade unions concerned and the Human Sciences Committee of the Irish National Productivity Committee.  The main conclusion of the report was that the concern of management and the trade unions with the state of morale among the Dublin busmen was fully justified.  The Report did not make specific recommendations but indicated the areas in which remedial action could be taken and said that it has been the shared interest of management and trade unions in the Dublin busmen which made the study possible.</P>
      <P>Action arising from the Report was a matter for CIE and the trade unions. Discussions have taken place between CIE and the unions and a number of changes have already been effected by the Board.  Of the dozen changes made a considerable number were effected during the course of the inquiry indicating the interest of the CIE Board in the findings of the Committee.</P>

    <P>The Report did not suggest any <Col N="1135" /> general lack of leadership but referred to a certain ambiguity in organisation at lower management level which has since been eliminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>(a)  Pensioners in receipt of £1: 845.</P>
      <P>(b)  Pensioners in receipt of £1 2s 6d: 959.</P>
      <P>(c)  Pensioners in receipt of £2 11s 3d: 82.</P>
      <P>In addition to the CIE pension these pensioners are entitled on retirement to weekly social welfare benefit of £2 12s 6d for a single man or woman or £4 12s 6d for a married man between the ages of 65 and 70 years and from 70 years of age onwards pensioners receive the contributory old age pension of £3 per week for a single man or woman or £5 7s 6d for a marrised man.  Thus, at 70 years of age a single man would receive a weekly income of between £4 and £4 2s 6d and a married man between £6 7s 6d and £6 10s.  From January, 1968, the social welfare benefit will be increased by 5/- per week for a single man or woman and by 10/- for a married man.</P>
      <P>Unless the existing members of the CIE Wages Grade Pension scheme were prepared to agree to an amendment of the scheme to provide for an increase in the rates of pension payable to existing pensioners, the full cost of any such increase would fall to be borne by CIE on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.

Recently, Bord Fáilte announced a programme aimed at developing new business during the off-peak season.  The Deputy may be assured that the development of tourism has my close attention at all times and I have regular consultations with Bord Fáilte to ensure that measures are adopted as necessary to deal with any particular problems that may arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy at all.  One of the <Col N="1141" /> great difficulties is recognising the fact that as the years go by standards of accommodation are constantly increasing. The best answer I can give is that there has been a very large increase in accommodation through guest houses and the lower grades of hotels. In fact, bedroom accommodation, since 1958, has increased by 82 per cent in the less-expensive grades and by 72 per cent in the more expensive grades, and recently there has been a very considerable increase in supplementary accommodation in guest houses.  The figures will be supplied for the information of Deputies in advance of the Estimate.</P>

      <P>As recently as the last two years Bord Fáilte refused grants to hotel owners in Dún Laoghaire because the Bord Fáilte information was that the accommodation provided in Dún Laoghaire was more than adequate to cater for the tourist trade.  In the light of that, how do Bord Fáilte justify proceeding to allow a grant to CIE for an hotel in Dún Laoghaire?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>If there is a reassessment will not hotel owners in Dún Laoghaire be given grants?  Those people pioneered the work, they were refused grants and they now find a State company, which is entering into competition with them, receiving State finances while they have been refused. Surely that is not the way to develop the tourist trade.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my recent discussion with the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a number of matters of agricultural interest to both countries were reviewed, a particular attention being given to trade in cattle and beef.  The discussions are to be continued in London tomorrow and <Col N="1150" /> I shall make a statement on their outcome as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with the prospects for cattle prices and exports in a separate reply today.  With regard to pigs, there is every reason to expect that prices over the winter months will be maintained at their hitherto satisfactory level this year.  It seems unlikely that there will be any material change in poultry prices during the winter.</P>

I understand from today's newspapers that the Minister was trying to sell some cattle in Britain yesterday. What are the prospects for selling cattle at satisfactory prices?  The Minister will agree that the cattle sold in England in the not too distant past were sold at unsatisfactory prices and I should like to have some comment from him now and not have him sidetrack that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>Trade in cattle and beef with Britain this year has been at a much higher level than last year.  Exports of store cattle to the UK during the period January to September this year were approximately 130,000 head higher than in the corresponding period of 1966, and for the full year 1967 seem likely to reach about 600,000 head as compared with 391,000 head in 1966. Slaughterings of cattle for export to Britain in carcase form have been at a record high level this year.  While trade with the Continent remains difficult because of the prohibitive import levies in operation in the EEC area, our total exports of cattle, live and dead, to all destinations so far this year are about 300,000 head higher than in the first nine months of 1966.</P>
      <P>This greatly increased volume of exports has been reflected in the firmer market prices obtaining for cattle.  Prices have, of course, also been assisted by the support payments on good quality carcase beef exported to Britain.  The seasonal upturn in cattle prices normally occurs about the end of November and prices usually reach their seasonal peak in the late spring.  In view of this and having regard to the present situation of the trade, it is not unreasonable to expect that cattle prices generally will be fairly firm over the next six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

That was the figure mentioned as our quota and are we to assume from the Minister's reply that last year we failed to meet this minimum target by almost 250,000 and that this year we are still falling short of it to the extent of 38,000?</P>

      <P>The reason for the decline in bacon exports this year is that pig production has been passing through the downward phase of one of the cyclical movements which characterise the pig industry.  The June livestock census and a limited census carried out in September both show a significant and continuing increase in the number of sows and gilts-in-pig, and this suggests that an expansion in production can be expected in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Unavoidable delays in the intake of wheat occurred in the Midlands, Dublin and Louth areas.  These were caused by a number of factors including the overlapping, to some extent, of the wheat harvest by the barley harvest, the increase in bulk deliveries which put still greater strain on drying facilities, and also the increased volume of wheat with a high moisture content.</P>
      <P>With a view to relieving the position in the difficult areas I arranged with the Irish Flour Millers Association for the use of all available drying points, and I am satisfied that every effort was made by all concerned to overcome such difficulties as arose.</P>
      <P>In the five weeks ended 14th October about 200,000 tons of green wheat was delivered to the intake points.  Half of this quantity or 100,000 tons was delivered in the last two weeks of September.  Wheat never before came in at this rate.  In the light of this experience, I propose to examine the marketing arrangements for grain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would like to ensure is that nothing gets out from this House that would cause any lack of confidence on the part of farmers. There is no reason why there should be any lack of confidence when we realise that at this particular time 221,000 tons of wheat have been taken in through the drying points, that this is 100,000 tons greater than ever was handled by our mills in previous years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is 100,000 tons of wheat more gone through our mills at this point of time in this year, 1967, than ever went through at the same point of time any other year.  This year is truly comparable with 1965 because a similar acreage was grown in that year.  We took 120,000 tons through the mills at this point of time in 1965 with a similar acreage.  This year we have taken through 221,000 tons.  That accounts for 94 per cent of our wheat crop; this 94 per cent has been paid for at millable prices and there is 13,000 tons, or 6 per cent of that 221,000 tons, paid for at unmillable prices.  Surely the disaster and the chaos the Deputies over there are talking about does not exist?  There may be a few farmers who have, unfortunately, lost, due to weather conditions and the type of land they have, but this is the record of the national wheat crop, and neither Fine Gael nor anybody else can contradict that.</P>

      <P>In south-west Cork, the operative date is 1st October, and I take it the same date applies in other areas.  It would be very unfair to farmers who are carrying out work which would qualify for increased grants and that, where the work has been started on 1st April, they should be deprived of the additional grants which are provided for progressive farmers.  Would the Minister consider agreeing to the recommendation implied in the question of giving the benefit of the increased grants where the farmers are so qualified in respect of work carried out in the current year?  The Minister will appreciate that the man who was approved for a farm building grant last April and who has not commenced work so far can qualify for the increased grant, but the man who has completed the job will not qualify.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why a person (name supplied) who did the skipper course in Galway has not been supplied with a boat by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, although the seven others who did the course have been supplied with boats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara that in addition to the person named by the Deputy, three others of the nine who attended the course in Galway in the same year have not since been supplied with boats by the Board.</P>
      <P>The Board explained to the fisherman named by the Deputy who wished to obtain facilities for the purchase of a new 65 foot fishing boat, that they did not regard his present experience as adequate for the control and management of a new boat having regard to its very high cost, but that they were prepared to arrange to provide him with a secondhand boat which would be far less costly.  At one stage he had, in fact, made full arrangements with the Board to purchase such a vessel, but he subsequently withdrew from the arrangement.  As recently as last month he agreed with the Board that what would suit him best would be a secondhand boat in good condition.  The Board assured him that every effort would be made to provide him with a suitable boat with the least possible delay, and he was at the same time offered the use of another secondhand boat until a fully suitable one should be located.  He has now sought once more to be supplied with a new vessel.</P>

      <P>During the Recess, Members of the House learned with deep regret of the death, on September 1st last, of Deputy James J. Collins&mdash; ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins first stood as a candidate for Dáil Éireann in 1948.  The fact that he successfully contested each successive general election since then, on five occasions being returned at the head of the poll, was not only a measure of the high regard in which he was held by his constituents, but a mark also of the clear recognition by them of his untiring labours in their interests as a Member of the Dáil and also of Limerick County Council over which he presided for 12 years and of which he was Vice-Chairman at the time of his death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While still a boy Jimmy Collins was <Col N="1175" /> active in the fight for Independence. A member of West Limerick Flying Column, he subsequently became Adjutant of the West Limerick Brigade, IRA, taking a prominent part in many engagements and suffering terms of imprisonment.  During the Emergency years, he was a District Leader in the Local Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Apart from membership of Dáil Éireann and of Limerick County Council, he was an active member of the General Council of County Councils and of many other representative bodies.  He was a delegate of Ireland on the Council of Europe. Truly it can be said of him that he devoted himself completely to the service of the people, especially the people of his own native county.</P>
    <P>He was a regular and obviously well-informed contributor to our deliberations here and his views, especially on local government and agricultural affairs, were highly valued and commanded general respect.</P>
    <P>Good-humoured, generous and warmhearted, none of us could wish for a more loyal colleague or more genial companion.  His loss will surely be felt not alone by those of us who were his colleagues in the Party which he helped to found but on all sides of this House of which Deputy Collins was such a popular and highly esteemed member.</P>
    <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to the late Deputy's widow and family our deepest sympathy.  Déanaimid cómhbhrón ó chroí leo ina mbris.  Go dtuga Dia gach sólás dóibh agus go dtuga Sé ionad imeasc na bhfíréan d'anam uasal an té atá imithe uainn.</P>

However, section 4 subsection (1) refers to &ldquo;employees&rdquo;, not &ldquo;persons&rdquo;, and there is a doubt as to whether the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in the Bill covers all persons who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  The definition, on a strict reading, might be taken as referring to persons employed under a contract of service only and not to a person employed under any other type of contract.  This amendment will remove that doubt and ensure that so long as a person is insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts he will come within the scope of the scheme, provided, of course, he is not a person excluded specifically under the terms of section 4, subsection (2).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Board&rsquo; means the Redundancy Appeals Board established under section &mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to refer to the Second Reading of the Bill during which this side of the House voiced the grave doubts which we had in regard to the proposed procedure laid out at that stage.  We felt that the question of appeals was very relevant in this piece of legislation. Deputy O'Leary mentioned that this is something which the Minister considered during the interval because in his amendment he is bringing in a new section to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is important that instead of having appeals officers as we know them, we should have a board to deal with these matters.  That is why we feel there should be a redundancy appeals board.  Many times during the progress through the House of the Planning Bill, we tried to get the Minister to safeguard the rights of individuals in <Col N="1181" /> regard to appeals.  At that time the matter was argued very often from this side of the House but, I must say, without avail.  Since then on many occasions the lack of an appeals board as such has been felt by many people, and for that reason we think it expedient that there should be this kind of appeals board in this legislation.</P>
    <P>During the Second Reading debate, I voiced my doubts on the question of the Minister parting with his responsibility in regard to appeals and allowing this to pass from his hands.  A redundancy appeals board connotes something much better than an appeals tribunal.  I am sure the Minister will agree that in a piece of legislation like this anything which savours of something objectionable should be avoided. The word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; had not a happy connotation in the distant past.  In any case the word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; is not of itself the happiest type of word in regard to this matter.  The people who may have to appeal to such a body would naturally be under a certain amount of stress, and for that reason it is important that they should feel they were not being over-awed by appearing before what is mentioned at a later stage as a tribunal.</P>
    <P>May I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, have your advice at this stage as to whether or not I may go on to discuss the board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; the Deputy would be entitled to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the composition of the board, we envisage a chairman who shall be a barrister or a solicitor of at least ten years standing.  We believe the chairman should be engaged in actual practice for not less than ten years.  That is a valid argument because I am sure the Minister will agree that a barrister or a solicitor could be regarded as being seven years qualified in his profession if he had been called to that profession seven years previously; but we believe that the appointee should be a person who has been practising at the Bar for at least seven years and who has gained experience in the <Col N="1182" /> course of that practice.  It is a good thing to know that we are agreed that training as a barrister or a solicitor renders people competent to evaluate the kind of evidence given before a board such as that envisaged here.  For that reason I believe our amendment is superior to the suggestion made by the Minister with regard to the chairman of the board.  The tribunal is very much in line with a tribunal this Party seeks to set up in relation to another matter, the Planning Act appeals, and I am glad the Minister has considered this particular aspect since the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>Again, I would suggest that the Minister should consult with the Chief Justice in the making of this appointment. The Chief Justice is the head of the legal system and he is surely the person best qualified and equipped to advise the Minister.  I hope the Minister will consult with the Chief Justice with regard to the appointment of the chairman.  What is most desirable here is quality in the individual appointee. Quality should be the hallmark in this appointment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the vice-chairman&mdash; I am sure the Minister has this in mind, but I think it is worth mentioning all the same&mdash;it must be remembered that the vice-chairman of such a board could find himself acting as chairman of sub-boards and it is imperative that such a vice-chairman should not be deemed to be in any way on one side or the other in relation to matters which fall for determination.  In other words, he must not be held to be either on the employers' or the employees' side in the matters over which he may preside.</P>
      <P>Subsection 5 (a) of amendment No. 34 reads:</P>
      <P>(a) The period of office of a member of the Board shall be fixed by the Minister when appointing him and shall not exceed three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something new.  It is a new approach to a problem.  It is important that the appointees should be appointed for a sufficient period to enable them to put this legislation into effect.  At the same time, there must be a limit since, at a later stage, it might be considered desirable to review the <Col N="1183" /> legislation.  It should, therefore, be within the competence of the Minister to appoint the board for a specific period, giving the board long enough to ensure the implementation of the Act.  A specific period will have to be laid down so that the Minister will not be hampered if he wishes to review the whole situation.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of subsection 4 reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order remove an ordinary member of the Board from office for stated misconduct or incapacity and shall lay any such order before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure the highest quality in the people appointed to a board such as this.  One of the basic essentials is high quality with regard to the performance of the duties attaching to the board.  Consequently, in the removal of a member from the board the Minister should be in a position to tell the House, through the medium of an Order laid before the House, the reason for the removal of such member. No one need be squeamish about this.  The appointees will subscribe to certain conditions of appointment.  If the performance of an individual falls short in quality and quantity then the Minister should be in a position to remove that individual from the board.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) reads:</P>
    <P>The remuneration, terms of appointment and conditions of service of an ordinary member of the Board may be fixed by contract entered into with him by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a principle involved here.  The Minister will make appointments from both employers and employees.  There may be employers able and willing to serve on the board without much remuneration, or even without any remuneration, but it is desirable that the representative of the workers on such a board should be in a position to negotiate the kind of conditions under which he is prepared to operate.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) (c) of amendment No. 34 reads:</P>
    <P>the making of a report and the form <Col N="1184" /> of the report of its proceedings annually to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that such a report should be made to the Oireachtas.  The progress of the board which it is proposed to set up under this legislation is something which the House naturally will be interested in.  They will be interested in knowing how it is dealing with any problems which may fall to be dealt with in the kind of conditions we are now facing, the kind of conditions in which redundancy is occurring or may occur, and particularly in the conditions of our entry into the EEC.  We are faced with problems in this country of a nature which require a good deal of work from such a board.  I feel it is very desirable that the Oireachtas should have before it from such a board a report as to its activities and as to how the situation is developing and what the trends are and what success the board has had in regard to the many matters which may come before it.</P>
    <P>The amendment, which is in line with the Minister's thinking in this matter, except in so far as I think the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; is much better than the word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo;, is a very desirable type of amendment, and I believe that if it is accepted it will provide the kind of machinery which will be helpful in relieving the kind of problems which will face such a board.  I know that the Minister's amendment deals with much the same matter in the same fashion.  There are variations which I have mentioned which occurred to me in regard to those matters and particularly in regard to the word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; as against the word &ldquo;board&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Let us get the record straight on one matter.  Admittedly, the Minister's original legislation does not involve any material on this appeals section.  Deputy Jones ascribes the inclusion of this to his own efforts on the last reading but the Labour Party put down an amendment on this matter as far back as June of this year. Deputy Jones put down an amendment on it immediately after the Minister had included something that arose from our original amendment.  I am not claiming authorship but let us get the <Col N="1185" /> record straight about this appeal section. The Labour Party put down an amendment during the summer on this matter; the Minister came next; and Deputy Jones came third with his proposals on what the Minister had said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but let us get the specific order clear.  We have been talking about the composition of the board and we on this side would say that it is going to be rather difficult to get legal people who are neutral as between labour and employers.  To get such people is a question which would test the wisdom of Job or Solomon.  On many of the joint industrial councils of the Labour Court at present we have legal people who are very far, indeed, from being neutral, so I do not know what the best procedure would be.  Our experience in the legal branches is on the whole rather unfortunate when it comes to labour matters.  Knowledge of industrial relations does not come with legal training.  In fact, legal training may be the very worst approach to industrial relations because they are two different concepts and one begins from two different points of departure.</P>
      <P>We will be accepting the Minister's amendment No. 33 because it covers what the Labour Party put down during the summer.  Subsection 4 (a) of this amendment reads:</P>
      <P>As to one-half of those members, from among persons nominated for that purpose by a body or bodies representative of employees, and...</P>
      <P>He is talking about the proportion of employees' representatives and the proportion of employer representatives. We would ask him to consider inserting after &ldquo;as to one-half of those members&rdquo;, deleting the rest of that subsection (a), &ldquo;on the nomination of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&rdquo;. In other words, we wish to cover the fact that the nominating body for the employees would be the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This is the point I would like to put to the Minister if he would consider it.</P>

      <P>During the Second Stage there was quite a lot of criticism of my proposal to utilise the existing appeals machinery of the Department of Social Welfare to deal with disputes arising out of the operation of the redundancy payments scheme.  In replying to that I pointed out that we had to recognise that here we had appeals machinery already in existence and because of the tie-in between redundancy payments, unemployment and the normal benefits under the social insurance scheme difficulties could arise if you had two separate appeal bodies for the two schemes.  I gave as an example a worker who might lose his employment and so have his eligibility or entitlement to redundancy and to unemployment benefit questioned and in dispute.  In such a situation if <Col N="1187" /> separate appeals machinery dealt with the case they might come out with different results which would not be desirable.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been the practice with any body so set up.  I undertook to consider this matter before Committee Stage and this consideration has led me to believe that where you have a separate appeals tribunal for the operation of the redundancy scheme, this should have an independent chairman and representatives of employers' and employees' interests.  I think in all the circumstances this is the best arrangement we could have and the one that is most calculated to give satisfaction to the employer and the worker alike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing to deal with my main amendment for the setting up of the tribunal and the difference between us.  All the others would be consequential on or related <Col N="1188" /> to the main one.  They would not give rise in themselves to substantial disagreement. The decision to propose the setting up of this tribunal was prompted mainly by consideration of the types of disputes which would arise under redundancy payments schemes.  The vast majority coming to be considered by way of appeal would be differences between employers and workers and would probably relate to such questions as to whether the dismissal was due to redundancy, whether in fact there was a dismissal, the length of continuous service of the employee, calculation of week's pay, the amount of lump-sum payable, whether the lay-off was reasonable, whether alternative employment offered by the employer was suitable and whether proper notice of lay-off and so forth was given.</P>
      <P>The experience of the operation of somewhat similar redundancy payments schemes elsewhere suggests that these are the type of problems which will come before the appeals body for decision.  As I have said, it would seem preferable that disputes of this kind should be adjudicated on by an appeals tribunal of the kind envisaged in the amendment.  You could have this to an appeals board, which is what you want.  I do not mind which it is.</P>
      <P>There is another factor which weighed with me in reaching this decision and that is that in many cases the facts may not be readily ascertainable and the tribunal rather than a single appeals officer, would probably provide the more satisfactory means of adjudication in such instances.  I imagine that adjudication by a board or tribunal would be more preferable in such a case.</P>
      <P>There is a further important consideration and that is that the parties concerned in some cases may wish to be represented by legal people and decisions may turn on legal arguments concerning interpretation.  It would, I think, be desirable, though perhaps not essential, that the person conducting such hearings should possess legal qualifications and experience.</P>

      <P>This tribunal would have three vice-chairmen and I presume it will be possible to have nonlegal people.  In fact, it is more than likely that you will have four rather than one so it will be possible to have non-legal chairmen in the other three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail.  The amendment <Col N="1190" /> itself is sufficiently detailed to provide Deputies with a comprehensive picture of the composition, powers and terms of reference of the proposed appeals tribunal.  The idea of a tribunal consisting of an independent chairman and one representative of employer interests and one representative of employee interests should, I feel, find general favour.  It is proposed to appoint three vice-chairmen and eight ordinary members.  This membership means that you could have four boards within the board which would act by division.  This should ensure that there will be no delays.  We are dealing with completely new legislation and I am not sure how much activity there will be within the appeals board.  One important thing is that there should be no delay.</P>

      <P>Both the workers and the employers will have the right of appeal to the tribunal.  It will be observed from subsection (15) of the proposed new section that there is very little restriction on the type of question relating to the scheme which may be brought to the tribunal for decision. One important exception in relation to the powers of the tribunal that I should mention is that any question concerning the insurability under the social welfare Acts of any particular employment will not be a matter for the tribunal.  Those questions are, initially or on appeal, matters for decision within the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new section contains the usual provisions concerning powers to take evidence on oath, to require <Col N="1191" /> persons to attend hearings to give evidence and to produce documents.  It makes provision also for offences and penalties.  Those are the normal provisions in an appeal system of this kind and they do not call for any special comment from me.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power under the section to make regulations on minor matters of detail such as procedure, publication of decisions, cost, expenses and so on.  I hope in exercising this power I will be able to provide for the smooth and efficient operation of the system.  As Deputy Jones said, his amendment is generally in line with the broad principle of the published official amendment No. 33 and I think I can confine myself to commenting on the differences in the details of the two amendments.</P>
    <P>Firstly, Deputy Jones's amendment proposes that the chairman of the appeals tribunal should be a barrister or solicitor with a minimum of ten years practice as compared with seven years practical experience provided for in the official amendment.  I think the Deputy read into my amendment that it was seven years qualified, but what I intended was that the person would be seven years in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree they should have a good deal of practical experience. If it is possible to get a person with a higher number of years, it would be better, but I would not like to limit it unduly by making ten years necessary.  I might limit the field available to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know how much work there will be for those people.  A lot of discretion will have to be left to the Minister in making regulations. Another difference between the two amendments is that the official one provides that a member of the tribunal may be removed from office by the Minister at his discretion.  Deputy Jones proposes to limit the right to cases of stated misconduct or incapacity, exercised by order which shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The implication is that a Minister would act irresponsibly and that implication is not acceptable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I had another objection to the limit in relation to misconduct or incapacity.  Other things which you do not see now might arise.  If you have it tied up in the Act, you may find yourself with somebody you cannot remove.  The Minister should have discretion as to the right of removal and if Deputy Jones thinks it over, he will see it is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones's amendment No. 34 provides for the making of regulations in connection with the submission of an annual report to the Oireachtas <Col N="1193" /> from the tribunal or board.  I am not averse to the idea of the tribunal issuing a report at certain intervals and I shall give this consideration when the regulations are being drafted.  I am in sympathy with that idea.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the period of appointment should be limited to three years is again made by Deputy Jones.  I shall leave the matter open.  It may well be that members will not be appointed for longer than three years. In the circumstances of the time and with experience the Minister should be given a free hand to appoint for three years or five years, or whatever he will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be three years originally and the Minister would then re-appoint if he felt like it and the appointees would know that they have three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be said that the Minister given discretion probably will appoint them for such time, but I would not like to tie it down in the Act that he will have to do this every time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have answered the suggestion by Deputy Jones that the terms of appointment be fixed on the contract and that members devote themselves whole-time to their duties.  I think it would not be necessary to incorporate this in the Bill.  When the appointments are being made the Minister will have to clearly define the conditions of appointment prescribed.  At that time the question of whether they will be whole-time or part-time can be included. I do not know how much work there will be but I am not sure the appointment of a whole-time tribunal is necessary or desirable.  In the light of experience we can improve the tribunal and make decisions about what is the best way of doing it.  I put in a number of matters in my proposals that are not covered by the Fine Gael amendments. For example, Deputy Jones did not indicate the matters which will come within the scope of the board or tribunal or the parties who may have recourse to appeals machinery.  Having considered the written proposals of Deputy Jones, I still think the provisions in my amendment provide the <Col N="1194" /> best arrangement that can be made at this time in this matter.  I think most of the purposes of the Labour Party amendment have been met by my proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the Minister has met the Labour Party in relation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions being a body representative of Irish workers.  I am concerned with what is being advocated by the Minister in relation to the introduction of the legal profession in this matter, which Deputy Jones has also advocated. I think this is wrong.  It indicates that we can get no better than a barrister or a solicitor to do an important job of this kind.  Experience in labour relations has proved the contrary. There is no denying the fact that intervention by the legal profession in matters affecting industrial relations has not been successful.  Ask any trade union official you like or any employer who wants to tell the truth and he will tell you that more often than not you have to educate a solicitor and explain to him what industrial relations mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly do not believe that a barrister or a solicitor is a competent person to be the chairman of an appeals board or an appeals tribunal. We should have regard to what has been the situation up to now.  I am not aware, for example, that since the introduction of the Labour Court we have had a chairman who has been a barrister or a solicitor.  I am not aware, for example, that in relation to appeals in the labour exchange you had to have a chairman who was a barrister or a solicitor.  I am conscious of the various instances where of necessity we have to have a barrister or a solicitor.  One day you find him defending in common <Col N="1195" /> law and another day you find him a defending lawyer resisting the evidence of an employee.  I do not regard these people&mdash;they are entitled to earn their living&mdash;as being in this very elevated station as the be-all and end-all of this important matter.  I hold this is not a job for a barrister or solicitor, but there should be a sufficient number of well-intentioned people, independent chairmen.  There are various joint industrial councils and committees.  Do not insist that he must be a barrister or solicitor.  What you should do is try to get a person who is capable of bringing both sides together, getting the job done and who can be described by both sides as being fair and absolutely impartial.</P>
    <P>I regard this effort of introducing a barrister or solicitor as something done to ensure that the solicitors or barristers are looked after.  I would hate to think that a welcome Bill of this kind will be persecuted by legal procedures. I make this point particularly having regard to something the Minister said. He said there may be occasions when people can have themselves legally represented at an appeal.  This type of thing was tried in the early days in the Labour Court and the people who came along representing the legal profession went a great way towards upsetting things because they were talking from briefs and did not know what they were talking about in the final analysis.  As far as the Minister and the Fine Gael Party are concerned it is a matter of how many years standing a member of the legal profession should have.  I hold that it should not be a member of the legal profession who should be the chairman of an appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>What are we setting out to do?  We are setting out to try to ensure that people who have appealed can come along and that the appeal is heard by representatives of both sides.  I should imagine that the representatives of both sides would have sufficient regard for humanity to approach the problem in a fair way.  I do not think you need a chairman who will have regard to the legal procedures about whether or not a person is entitled to have his appeal heard.  The Minister ought have <Col N="1196" /> another look at this matter.  I say that purposely, because it has been said by the Minister, in answering a question across the floor, that if and when a chairman is appointed who is a member of the legal profession, he will cease to practise.  We all know very well what happens in cases of that kind; cousins, pals, or somebody else carry on the practice that person has left.  It is a bad thing to create a situation in which the only person in whom we appear to have confidence in exercising the role of chairman is a person of the legal profession.  Surely to heavens there are other professions equally noble; capable of applying their minds to the situation.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to think in terms of the many people who have been asked to come into disputes who have not been of the legal fraternity, who have acted as arbitrators.  In some cases, I admit, they made a mess of things because I see a colleague pointing to another colleague, but that is not the type of chairman I have in mind at all.  I have in mind a chairman who knows and applies his mind to the situation.  I have had experience of this thing.  As a representative of workers, I have had to go to meetings of this kind, where you make an appeal or a demand.  Some wellintentioned fellow comes in and adopts the role of mediator and causes more confusion than anything else but the fact that he has or has not legal knowledge does not excuse him.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make here is that you do not have to be a barrister or a solicitor to do a job correctly or otherwise. I am not trying to make&mdash;and I sincerely mean this&mdash;political capital out of this point.  It is very wrong for us to have one profession only.  I do not accept that at all.  We have good and bad solicitors, good and bad barristers.  God knows, I have known of cases where they have made a complete hames of things.  Of course, this can happen with ordinary people but I would entreat the Minister not to be too wrapped up in this legal idea.  I had hoped the Minister would look around him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He can talk as much as he likes about what he professes to know and he can quote all the law imaginable.  Surely the simple way out of this morass is to make this Bill as simple as possible. You do not want a fellow to say: &ldquo;This is what the Minister meant,&rdquo; or &ldquo;That is what the Minister meant.&rdquo;  I hold that the onus is on the Minister to ensure that his intentions are clear. I know it is very difficult with regard to use of Civil Service jargon, but the fact remains that this is a highly desirable Bill.  Nobody will object to its introduction.  Where it can be improved we will all advocate it but I would urge the Minister to beware of the lawyers and solicitors because, God knows, their interference in many things in this country is very much resented by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The only case I can think of quickly would be that of a worker who is dismissed.  Say the employer dismisses him for misconduct and, being dismissed for such, he could not get a redundancy payment.  He would have a case in common law for wrongful dismissal and an appeal to the tribunal on the basis of having been done out of his redundancy payment by this device.  That is the only thing I can think of quickly.  You could get conflicting reports in that situation; in common law the law courts can decide he was wrongfully dismissed.</P>

Indeed anybody listening to Deputy Mullen would say: &ldquo;There is the best possible case for a lawyer, trained and practised during seven or ten years, as chairman.&rdquo;  Deputy Cluskey said the chairman must be flexible.  I agree he must be flexible. Deputy Mullen said you could have a lawyer one day standing up for the rights of the employers and the following day coming into court and standing up for the rights of the employees.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the profession that gives to this country the judiciary of this country, which has been so satisfactory, no matter by what Government it was appointed, is the natural source from which one might expect to get an independent person, capable of applying his mind to both sides, bearing in mind that the person appointed will, as has been stated here, have to deal with technical procedure, will have to apply his mind to regulations, will have to interpret those regulations.</P>

    <P>I repeat that I do not think that anybody is better qualified to do that than a member of the legal profession.

      <P>It is not our purpose to overheat Fine Gael on the question of whether or not the chairman should have ten years experience, and so on.  We want a man with a knowledge of industrial relations.  The Minister says that this will not be absolutely essential because it does not deal with industrial problems.  Many cases coming for interpretation will have their origin in relations between employer and employee.  We must not think that a barrister or a legal man is the automatic and the only choice for such a post.  In the first place, he should have some knowledge of industrial relations.  We pointed to the unhappy experience of many of the joint committees under the Labour Court which in some cases have been presided over by legal people who had little knowledge of industrial relations and perhaps some of these problems have arisen because of this steering by a man not acquainted with industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The make-up of industrial relations is absolutely different and is not susceptible to understanding by a man full of rigid conceptions and trained in legal thought.  We offer this caution when thinking of who shall be chairman of this committee that it is necessary to realise that he should be a man with a global knowledge of industrial relations.  If it is necessary to have somebody, as I suppose it would be argued, who has legal training, why can an adviser not be appointed to the board to advise on legal problems <Col N="1204" /> rather than a chairman who must be a barrister of seven years standing? We do not intend to hold up the Bill on this basis but we would point out that the Minister's criteria are not how many years the individual has been in the practice of the law but what knowledge or understanding he has of industrial relations in general, always ensuring that, industrial relations, what is most necessary in the provision of a chairman is a balanced outlook.</P>

I have had a good deal of experience of industrial negotiations.  When industrial negotiations call for a certain type of mind, that may not necessarily be found in the legal profession.  There are other people whom the Minister might be very sorry he had excluded from the possibility of being chairman.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather disappointed when the Minister introduced his Estimate in July last that he did not seem to appreciate the urgency of implementing as soon as possible the report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure dealing with the jury system.  The Minister told us on 5th of July last that he had three reports on the jury system before him and he used terms which to the ordinary person, have a rather sinister meaning.  He said that he had at present these reports under consideration and he went on to say: &ldquo;I shall in due course be introducing legislative proposals to deal with all these matters.&rdquo;  When you are dealing with a Department of State and they tell you they have something under consideration and that something is going to be done in due course, you have a fair suspicion that there is going to be a long delay before the thing which is to be done in due course will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an urgency about this matter which I think does not entirely escape the Minister.  He will recall that one of the reports of the Committee advocated the extension of the classes from which juries are drawn.  It is a fact that more citizens are exempt from jury service than are liable for it and this has resulted in dreadful hardship on those who are liable for jury service.  In Cork in the last year, almost 600 jurors were summoned from a small area immediately surrounding the city and they were held at the Cork Courthouse &mdash; despite every effort of the presiding judge to facilitate them in every way &mdash; over a long period.  These people were largely drawn from shopkeepers, farmers, self-employed people and people who would lose a day's pay if they were away from work, but they did not include categories which the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure suggest should be brought <Col N="1207" /> within the ambit of jury service, namely, civil servants and local government employees.  The fact that a man who is self-employed may be called for jury service over a long period could be a very crippling blow to him.  I know of men who were called for jury service and had to appear at the courthouse each morning and suffered grave financial hardship as a result.  This could not be said about the civil servant or local government officer who no doubt would be left off in his employer's time and who would be able to relieve from jury service those sections and categories to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The hardships involved for jurors could be ameliorated if the suggestions of the Committee that they should be given reasonable remuneration for the time they spent on jury service were adopted.  The figure of £2 was suggested in one of the reports.  The unfortunate situation of the juryman who is summoned at the moment to serve on a criminal jury is that no matter how long he may serve, he gets not one brass farthing for giving his services to his fellow citizens.  The position of the man who is called for a civil jury is not much better.  No matter how long he may sit, at the end of the case the jury are given in silver 60 shillings to distribute between the 12 of them, that is, 5/- a man.  In one civil case in Dublin not so long ago, which lasted for 21 days, the jurors were remunerated for their 21 days by getting 5/-each. These are grave and immediate problems and the fact that nothing has been done in regard to them over the years does not mean that the Minister should tarry over them.</P>
    <P>I trust that he may be able to explain his reference to having at present under consideration the contents of the reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and that he may be able to tell us what &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; means in regard to the introduction of legislation.  The Minister will understand that anything I say is not capricious or anything like that.  It is a matter of serious import to a considerable section of the community <Col N="1208" /> and I am sure they would like to know the Minister's mind on this matter.</P>
    <P>Whilst on court problems, there is another matter which I should like to draw to the Minister's attention and which does not appear to have commanded the attention either of the Minister or any of his predecessors in any Government.  I refer to the growing practice of manufacturers to give with their goods an alleged warranty or guarantee which almost completely nullifies the sections of the Sale of Goods Act which were enacted many years ago to give assistance to the purchaser of goods which were not of a merchantable quality or not fit for the purpose for which they were purchased. As the Minister knows, the old common law was <i>caveat emptor,</i> let the purchaser beware.  The Sale of Goods Act nullified that in many ways. Now when people buy something which is the output of a highly technical process, such as a motor car, an electric iron, a television set, a washing machine, or one of the many expensive things that people bring into their houses nowadays&mdash;some of those people, indeed, not being in a position to afford bringing them in but nevertheless they bring them in &mdash; they are given a most impressive document which indicates that they will be given certain things if the machine does not work; if they return parts at their own expense, they will be given new parts, but they have to put them in at their own expense.  What a man does by accepting that is that he does away with the Sale of Goods Act rights.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for a person who buys one of the articles I refer to, to know, without technical knowledge, whether the thing is fitted for the purpose for which it is purchased or if it is of merchantable quality.  Indeed, I understate it when I say it is difficult; it is well-nigh impossible.  These goods are produced by firms with much expertise and technical knowledge at their disposal. It would be equitable, right and fair &mdash; it certainly would be highly popular and very welcome &mdash; if some legislation were introduced to nullify in turn the alleged warranties and guarantees given by the manufacturers <Col N="1209" /> or the sellers of these goods when they hand them on to the unfortunate purchaser.  It is a thought I would like the Minister to keep in mind.</P>
    <P>I have for some time been questioning the Minister here on a local matter regarding pound fees in Cork city.  The matter has a serious local import at the moment inasmuch as the people of the constituency I represent, Cork city, particularly in the north central section of it, suffer greatly from the depredations of wandering horses allowed to roam at will day and night by itinerants One young man has already been killed without any hope for his relatives of recovering any damages from the owners of the horse; first, because it is hard to know who was the owner and secondly, even if you did, you would find he was not a man of substance.  In addition, gardens are destroyed and children menaced by these wandering horses.  At the moment the situation is that, apart from any action taken by way of summons by the local authority or the gardaí, the horse is taken and put into the local pound.  By the simple expedient of going up the next morning and offering 6/- the itinerant can recover his horse.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister on a number of occasions that he might consider increasing that pound fee to, say, £2 in the hope that it would discourage the itinerant class from allowing their horses to wander in this way and doing damage not alone to personal property but to life and limb in the manner in which they have done on previous occasions.  In reply to a question of mine, the Minister did undertake to consult with the interests concerned. I think that in the press of official business, he must have overlooked doing this.  I asked the City Manager at the Corporation last week if the Minister had yet consulted with him and I was told he has not done so. I agree this is purely a local parish pump matter, but it is an important matter to a large section of the community in Cork city to the extent of maybe 12,000 persons, young and old. It is a matter of growing urgency because tempers are rising among those who suffer from the depredations of these horses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> While on the Garda Vote, I am sorry the Minister could not afford the sum of about £5,000 requested of him by some of the Garda pensioners in respect of their pensions.  I understand his predecessor informed the Garda pensioners &mdash;the Minister will find the reference in an editorial in the <i>Garda Review</i> in either this or last month &mdash; that the State at the moment could not afford £5,000 to meet the rather reasonable requests of the pensioners.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to deal with which I meant to deal with when the Minister's previous Estimate was before the House, but owing to circumstances outside my control, I had to leave the House.  I was requested to do so by you, Sir, before I could participate in the debate.  The Minister had stated he had under consideration the setting up of eight new district probate registries in this State.  I want to say to him: &ldquo;I do not think it is worth while; I do not think the expense involved will give the value that it should give.&rdquo;  Due to the circumstances I mentioned, I could not deal with it then; and what I say now may lead to recrimination.  It arose out of the remark made by the Minister introducing his Estimate in which he said that the setting up of these new registries would provide a convenient local service throughout the country for persons wishing to take out grants of representation in respect of the estates of deceased persons.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much convenience will be effected by the setting up of these new district probate registries. I do know that the Minister at some stage estimated it would cost about £6,500 per annum to keep these registries going.  I do not know whether that includes the allowances made to the county registrars in the areas concerned. I know that the six county registrars who at the moment act as district probate registrars get between them over £750 a year.  Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the extra eight will cost about £1,000 a year, but whether that is included in the £6,500 to which the Minister referred, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The new district probate registries were established in Clonmel, Donegal, <Col N="1211" /> Dundalk, Galway, Mullingar, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford.  They were added to those already existing in Castlebar, Cavan, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford and, of course, the principal probate registry in Dublin.  Is the expenditure in question worth the money? If it did provide what the Minister says &mdash;a more convenient local service &mdash; I would welcome its introduction into the House.  There are two sections of the community involved in this. There is the person who wants personally to take out a grant of representation to a deceased.  Then there is the solicitor who on behalf of his client wants to take out a grant of representation. Let us take the case of the person who wants to take out the grant himself.  A few years ago, up to the passing of the Succession Act, in the case of small estates up to £500 or £600, he could go to the local customs and excise officer in the area and he could do the work for him.  This was a very easy way in which a person taking out a personal grant of a small estate could get the work done.  This was taken away by the Succession Act.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's proposal, which came into force on 1st January last, to introduce eight new district probate registries, it does not assist much in the case of the person who wishes to take out a grant to a small estate and who wants to take out a personal grant.  Take the person in Castle-townbere in Cork.  Up to the passing of the Succession Act, he could go to the nearest town, Bantry, to the local customs officer and get his work done. Under the new provision he has to go up to the district probate registry in Cork.  Take his counterpart in Kerry, somewhere down in the Dingle peninsula. Instead of going to the local customs officer as in the past, that person would now have to come as far as Tralee to the local district registry if he wanted to do the work himself. I do not see how the Minister can possibly suggest that it is a more convenient means of obtaining grants of representation than what previously existed.</P>
    <P>Take even the case of solicitors.  The <Col N="1212" /> only people who will possibly find their business made easier in this respect are the practitioners in the towns in which the new registries have been set up. Take the case of the practitioners in Kerry.  Up to now they were served by district probate registries in Cork and Limerick.  They posted their business to these places and got their business back in due time.  What happens now is that the local practitioner in Kerry, outside Tralee, has to post his business to Tralee instead of Cork and Limerick, which costs him the same postage, and therefore there is no advantage whatsoever unless he is going to drive from the town in which he practises into Tralee to carry out his business.  The provisions to which the Minister referred have not in any way produced a system which is as cheap or as expeditious as the system, especially in respect of small grants, which existed in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to keep the House much longer except to point out one little thing, that since the free and convenient service given by the custom and excise officers is gone, now when a person applies to a district registry, the State charges fees over and above the probate fees they would have to pay if they employed a solicitor.  I understand the fees paid to the State are much higher than if they employed a solicitor.  The value of the service given by the customs and excise officers, whose function in this matter was abolished by the Minister and replaced evidently by this £6,500 scheme, is shown by some of the statistics for 1965.  The year 1965 shows that only 64 personal applications for grants of representation were made, and that the services of the customs and excise officers were availed of on 88 occasions.  As regards the person who makes a personal application for a grant, the statistics to which the Minister had access prior to introducing the system do not show that there was any need, much less an immediate need, for the provisions which he has now made.</P>
    <P>Over the three years prior to 1965, there was no personal application for a grant made in Kerry.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Yes, but now that the new <Col N="1213" /> local residence has been set up, they will always be dashing in to get their personal grant.&rdquo;  I do not think this will be so, because the person who wishes to make a personal application will still have to travel to Tralee from the borders of Kerry, wherever he may exist, instead of, as in the past, getting, free, gratis and for nothing, the assistance of the customs and excise officer.  In Sligo-Leitrim the system was always the same; there was one application in the three years prior to 1965.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the Minister was quite wrong when he tried to suggest to the House &mdash; and I am sorry I have to say this after rather than before he brought this scheme into operation &mdash;that this was a more convenient system.  It may be a convenient system but it is certainly not more convenient than the system that was available to practitioners and to other persons.  It is neither more convenient nor as cheap as the system operated before 1965 when the Minister's Department started messing around with the provisions relating to the taking out of grants.  In fact it has been, in many cases, made more difficult and more expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I just want to deal with a few points arising out of this Estimate.  The first concerns a comparatively small section of the members of the Garda Síochána. By and large, we are all proud of the police force of this country, the Garda Síochána.  All down the years, they have given good service and discharged their duties as policemen impartially and with great satisfaction.  I think it no harm to put on record again that that is probably due to the men who founded the Force and the tradition built up by them and handed on down the years to the younger men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to deal with here concerns the pension rights of a small section of the Force.  In 1925, the first pension order came in and that simply provided that a member of the Force on retirement, having served the required number of years, qualified for a pension of two-thirds of his salary at the date of retirement.  That, as far as I know, was the position up to 1951. <Col N="1214" /> Then in 1951 a new order came in and under that order members of the Force were given certain options.  They could adhere to the old system or the old pension rights of two-thirds of salary on retirement or could opt to take half of their pension on retirement and a gratuity up to one and a half years pay at the date of retirement.  This order also entitled the widow of a serving member of the Force to one years salary which her husband was receiving at the date of his death.</P>
    <P>The members of the Force within certain categories &mdash; I think, those of the rank of superintendent who had not attained the age of 60 years, those of the rank of chief superintendent who had not attained the age of 63, and those above that rank who had not attained the age of 65 &mdash; were given six months in which to opt for the new system of pension.  A great many of those opted for the new system and are very glad they did so.  In 1951, the members of the Garda Síochána were receiving much smaller salaries than they are now receiving.  The Force was much less attractive to members of the Force when compared with other comparable occupations.  The result was that some members of the Force in 1951 decided: &ldquo;We will stay on until we are 50 years of age and retire then.&rdquo; as they could do under the old system; when they had served 30 years in the Force and reached the age of 50, they were entitled to go out under two-thirds, and they were then comparatively young.</P>
    <P>A number of members of the Force decided they would not opt for the new pension scheme, that they would continue on until 50 and go out on a pension of two-thirds of their salary, and that they then would be quite able to take on other employment for the rest of their working lives.  However, as I say, the position has changed, and the Garda Síochána are now receiving considerably higher salaries than they were receiving at that time.  The result is that those who did not opt within the six months provided now find that they made a mistake, that it would have been much more in their interest to have opted for the new scheme.  Most of these men are now in the older age group.  Many of them came into the <Col N="1215" /> Force when it was badly paid and gave service when it was more difficult and perhaps more dangerous to serve than at present.  I urge that these men should be given a chance to have second thoughts about the scheme and should be given a further period of three to six months, or a short time from now on, to change their minds and opt for the new scheme, which would mean that, when going out, they could have a pension of half their salary and a gratuity of up to one-and-a-half years salary and &mdash; perhaps more important&mdash; if they die in service their widows qualify for a year's salary.</P>
    <P>I understand there is not much involved.  In 1965, I understand there were only five superintendents, seven inspectors, eight sergeants and 160 gardaí involved.  It is reasonable to assume that the number has decreased or been reduced since then.  I do not know how much money is involved but I think it is not much.  The numbers are small.  This is an appeal on behalf of a category of State servants, an unarmed police force, who certainly deserve well of the State.  Circumstances have changed considerably since the period within which they were entitled to opt expired.  These men could not have been expected to foresee the change in conditions and therefore I appeal on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The second matter I wish to raise also relates to the Garda Síochána.  I sincerely hope the Minister will not have the bad taste of his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and accuse me of cashing in on something when I refer to the tragedies of the last week or so on the Naas Road.  It is a matter that has caused great concern throughout the country.  National newspapers have taken it up and everybody who listened to the radio for the past week or ten days has been struck by the appalling death rate on this stretch of road.  I know the Minister for Justice is not concerned with the construction of the Naas Road or with making the road traffic regulations but he is responsible for the enforcement of these regulations and the control of traffic. It is now abundantly clear that this stretch of road provides facilities for <Col N="1216" /> extraordinary speed, for very fast driving, but that when the road was being constructed, no adequate safeguards by way of entries or exits were provided.  It is as simple as that.  We have provided the means to travel at excessive rates of speed and we have not taken the ordinary elementary precautions for safety on an autobahn of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has said that he is having inquiries made at the moment and that he will consider the results.  I am sure he will implement them.  The matter is extremely urgent.  We see how urgent it is when we realise that the week before last two people were killed on this road and in a matter of days, the country was shocked to hear that a further four people were killed there. It is a matter which calls, therefore, for urgent attention and which should be dealt with as an emergency.  It was suggested to the Minister for Local Government today that an immediate speed limit should be imposed.  That is not within the sphere of the Minister for Justice, but I suggest to him that until such time as permanent remedies in the form of proper entries and exits are provided to this road, a special Garda patrol should be provided which could assist people who must enter or leave this road.  The consequences of the inadequacy of the safety provisions on this road are so far-reaching and appalling as to justify the request I make that extra gardaí be provided at these points at times when traffic is heavy and I realise that is practically all day.  Desperate diseases require desperate remedies and the consequences, God knows, have been dreadful enough to call for anything that will prevent a repetition in future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say a word about the hearing of jury actions in the High Court where litigants and their advisers from remote parts of the country, or parts of the country at a considerable distance from Dublin, are concerned. As is known, we have no system of legal aid on the civil side of the courts and that means that many litigants who can ill afford it must travel long distances to Dublin to have their cases heard.  They must arrange for their <Col N="1217" /> expert witnesses, medical men, engineers and others, to come to Dublin and it often happens that they travel to Dublin on a Monday &mdash; their case is listed and they must be there &mdash; but the case is not heard and they may have to go home, if it is not too far, and travel back on Tuesday.  Their case may not be heard until Wednesday. That is not an extravagant statement but one that can be borne out by experience.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we realise that many cases are settled on the morning of the hearing and for that reason, it is necessary, if the courts are not to be idle, to list more cases than are certain to be heard; but, at the present time, cases are listed for hearing in the numerical order in which they are set down for hearing and no regard is had to the distance which people have to travel.  We will say there are four courts available and perhaps six or eight cases are listed.  It is then problematical whether the last two or four cases, as the case may be, will be heard.  They can only be heard if they are settled.  If there are four courts, four cases are certain to be heard.  If there are six cases listed it should be possible to try to arrange that the fifth and sixth cases would be cases where the plaintiff came from within a reasonable distance of Dublin city or, if there were cases in the list in Dublin city where the doctors and experts are on tap and where it would be necessary only for the plaintiff and one or two witnesses to come in in the morning, those cases could be listed and they could take their chance instead of, perhaps, taking the cases in strict listing order and listing fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth, a case perhaps from Cavan or Wexford or Donegal or any other part of the country a long distance from Dublin which would involve persons coming up on the chance of being heard and not being heard.</P>
    <P>If that suggestion were adopted, it might mean a little bit more trouble but it is a service that the citizens and the taxpayers are entitled to, especially when we have not got free legal aid on that side of the court.  It probably could be arranged by looking at the <Col N="1218" /> pleadings to see where the plaintiff comes from.  I can justify my suggestion that regard should primarily be had to the residence of the plaintiff. First of all, defendants are usually financed by insurance companies and their expenses are sure to be paid. Secondly, it is not essential that the defence be in court at 11 o'clock on the morning on which the case opens because if the plaintiff is there ready to go on it is almost certain that he will take the first day and the defence has an opportunity of looking around and seeing where it stands and it certainly will not be necessary for the defence to have all its witnesses there on the first day.</P>
    <P>This is something that would greatly convenience citizens and it is something that would probably increase respect for our courts and for the administration of justice.  People get very annoyed and frustrated when they come up and have to hang around for a couple of days until the case is heard.</P>
    <P>These are all the points I want to make on this Estimate and I strongly suggest that all three of them should be attended to by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is concerned with a number of details that interest Deputies but right through there has been the question of policing the highways and the problems of road traffic.  Since the matter was split up between local government and the Department of Justice it is difficult to deal with this problem as a whole and inevitably one must make remarks touching on aspects for which this Minister has no responsibility.  It is only natural that on this Estimate, as was done by Deputy Fitzpatrick, the tragedies on the one strip of motorway which we have in this country, the Naas strip, should come for notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own personal view is that this is not so much a matter of policing as a matter of construction, that it is more a question for the Minister for Local Government than for the Minister for Justice, but it so happens that it is the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice that is before us now and the matter comes up in his bailiewick before we can deal with it <Col N="1219" /> with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is one question, however, which I should like to ask before we come to the question of policing and it concerns both Departments because we are dealing with a matter of fact.  It used to seem to some people before our Naas stretch was constructed that there was a rather higher incidence of road fatalities in the North of Ireland than we had in the South.  I remember when this was first remarked to me that it seemed to be in the area where the speedway was first erected in the North. I would ask the Minister, as a matter of fact-finding first, to see if there is any correlation between the building of these big stretches of road and the increase in fatalities.  What I have said is based more on a hunch or a memory of the day to day reporting of casualties. I should like to know whether a proper study in this country as in England would reveal anything of that nature.</P>
    <P>I do know that in England there has been trouble on the big speedways and there has been talk about restrictive speed limits.  As I say, in the North there was a period when, on a superficial day to day reckoning &mdash; it may not be true in fact if one looked at it in detail, so I am merely submitting it as an impression ready for correction &mdash; it did seem that when the roads were straightened out and greater speed was allowed for and attained, the number of fatal casualties increased.  Is this a phenomenon of which we are getting a touch?</P>
    <P>This question of speed as the cause is something that must vitally affect both the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government.  I will confess that in former days I would have been inclined to think that speed in itself was not the important thing in motor accidents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, but speeds have greatly increased and as speeds increase for motor vehicles, two things happen.  The possibility of avoiding an impending accident becomes <Col N="1220" /> very much less as speed increases and, secondly, the damage done in the impact of an accident is likely to be very much greater.  This is a vitally important question from the point of view of speed on the roads.  There is a great deal of talk about drink and the drunken driver.  There is no doubt that the drunken driver or the driver influenced by drink is a menace but what is the important cause in a case like this?  It is significant, to me at any rate, that although there is plenty of evidence of the contribution of the person who is rendered incapable, in small or greater degree, through the consumption of alcohol, there are very few cases where this is traced home in a serious accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is usually evidence in such a case.  On the other hand, is there evidence that mere speed increases the accident rate?  I do not expect an off-the-cuff reply from the Minister to that.  I would be prepared to await the actual factual reply that emerges from the facts.</P>
      <P>I am prompted now to make a remark about Dublin traffic.  There has been a great deal of talk recently&mdash; some of it, I am afraid, rather uninformed &mdash; about Dublin traffic and Dublin traffic problems and what should be done about them.  When traffic becomes as dense as it is in the city, the problem becomes more a physical one.  It is like a situation that should be investigated in a physical laboratory or a chemical laboratory rather than one that can be adjusted by psychological or social means.  The only people who can give the answer to the problem of Dublin's traffic are the people who have actually studied it and made experimental studies of it. That goes for the traffic in any city where it is very dense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went off at a tangent on that for a moment but I should like to make this remark.  The time has passed when everyone can give his opinions about traffic, can be an expert, or can be confident of his own reactions in a particular situation.  This is a matter for very expert study indeed, and the <Col N="1221" /> problems posed can be solved only by experts in the same way as engineering and other problems can be solved only by trained personnel.  For that reason, I do not think it is helpful to offer solutions for the problems involved in traffic.  It is a matter for safe planning and the answers will emerge from the facts and not from the opinions of people who comment on them.</P>
    <P>To get back to the question of speed on the roads, if this is a question of speed, it is a police problem and a question of controlling speed.  Controlling speed is a question of controlling the speed limits.  The Minister may say that the only function of the police is to enforce the speed limits laid down. With regard to that kind of police enforcement, I wonder how much of it is a question of discipline on the part of the motorists and the people on the roads.  We cannot have a policeman at every corner.  The Garda are already overworked in regard to numbers. How much of the responsibility for some of the traffic problems is the responsibility of the citizens?  I wonder do other Deputies find this.  I personally have seen far too many cases of people crashing the lights to feel safe passing through crossings, especially at certain times.  It has become a little too common and it indicates a certain carelessness on the part of the public. It is not the fault of any authority in any shape or form.  We come here and our function is to comment on authority on behalf of the people.  It is equally important that we should face facts of this nature.  There is a growing tendency in the city of Dublin to crash lights and to indiscipline of that nature.</P>
    <P>On the question of speed limits, although I am not for a moment going to suggest that it might not be wise to put speed limits on these long stretches &mdash; although Deputy Tully accuses me of getting old&mdash;once you go beyond 60 or 70 miles an hour, there is a great risk even with the most careful arrangements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not blame me. It is happening to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Once you go beyond that speed, there is a certain inherent risk in the speed itself.  no <Col N="1222" /> matter how good the road is and no matter how the exits are arranged. There is not much point in unrealistic speed limits.  I have in mind one stretch of road and I might as well mention it.  It is the stretch from Irish-town to Sandymount on the coast road. For a while there was a 30 mph limit. During that time no one observed the speed limit.  Then it was put up to 40 mph.  Obviously that was reasonable and cars travelled at 40 mph.  If you travelled at 30 mph, either you blocked the traffic or everyone flew past. Possibly because of the summer problem on that stretch of road, the speed limit was put back to 30 mph.  I have an instance in mind of a car proudly displaying the insignia of a motor school which was to teach everyone how to drive and on three consecutive evenings that car passed me quite rapidly when my needle was at 30 mph.  That kind of thing is reprehensible from the point of view of a driver.  It is not a recognised legal maxim but it is a good maxim not to lead anyone into temptation.  A certain amount of realism is called for in regard to speed limits.</P>
      <P>On the question of discipline, some pedestrian crossings are a real hazard for the pedestrians because a real danger arises when one motorist, when properly warned by the pedestrian, pulls up and if there is a gap on the inside or on the outside, another car will whip right across.  These are matters of discipline for the public. There is another matter which is hardly a matter for this Minister, unless the Garda are involved in detection.  I wonder is there a valid excuse in all cases where bollards are knocked down.  Bollards which are erected at pedestrian crossings for the protection of pedestrians are knocked down.  I cannot recollect a case at the moment where a pedestrian was hit, but too many bollards are being knocked down regularly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  These are instances of what I describe as indiscipline.  If we cannot get people to co-operate in road discipline, then the gardaí have to step in.  This is where the Minister is vitally concerned. As I said on the Estimate last year, one has the greatest sympathy with the gardaí in all this.  They have a multitude of traffic problems with which to deal, to say nothing of parking problems, and it is physically impossible to have gardaí always there to maintain discipline.  I should like to point out to the Minister the necessity there is for keeping the gardaí free for important police duties and relieving them from unimportant duties as far as possible.</P>
      <P>Parking is a problem.  Where parking is allowed, it has now become quite common to have double parking.  I passed through certain streets on my way here and I saw a garda putting labels on cars parked outside other cars.  There were two rows of cars on the side of the street, and that not very far from here.  That particular duty is not a very good one where the gardaí are concerned because it brings them into unnecessarily unpleasant conflict with the motoring public.  Surely auxiliaries could be recruited, wardens of some kind, to deal with parking problems?  It is from that point of view, too, that I am apprehensive as to what will happen if we introduce the breathaliser test.  I asked at the outset if our priorities are in the proper order.  However, I can deal with that matter on the Bill itself.  From the point of view of the Garda, if the Bill is to be made effective, it will mean a great deal of administrative work and it will cast a heavy administrative burden on the Garda.  I would ask the Minister to examine it very carefully from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When all is said and done, the mobile gardaí are needed to keep traffic moving on the roads in an orderly fashion, and subsidiary activities, such as those involved in a test of <Col N="1224" /> the kind to which I have referred, in parking problems and so on, should, if possible, be hived off somewhere else. The police have their hands more than full with road traffic problems.  I mentioned the question of discipline.  A great deal of discipline could be secured automatically if there were more mobile gardaí on the roads and fewer of them tied up with other duties.</P>
    <P>With regard to traffic control, there are, I suppose, areas in which such control will continue to be necessary. Where mechanical means of traffic control can be provided, they should be provided without delay.  Such control would leave the gardaí mobile to control a stretch instead of pinning them down at one particular point.  The answer here will depend largely, of course, on the Department of Local Government, since the whole matter is basically a question of engineering. Take the congestion at O'Connell Bridge, right in the heart of the city. I am sure traffic control there imposes a heavy burden on the gardaí.  Sometimes the number pinned down there would seem to be excessive, not excessive for the task but excessive from the point of view of tying men down to a particular point.  When they are not there, there is chaos.  Would it not be possible to provide subways at both sides of the bridge?  That might be costly but it would ensure fluidity of traffic.  Traffic would not be held up by pedestrians.  A traffic policeman on a motor-bicycle could do a great deal of valuable work ensuring mobility of transport if sufficient mechanical men, if I may put it that way, were erected to take over the duties so many gardaí are called upon to perform at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to entries and exits some people were very critical of the changes made in the city of Dublin but, by and large we must all admit now that a good job was done in the centre of the city.  It may not have been the job some of us thought it should be, but the fact is it has borne fruit.  There was an interesting demonstration to show that in the past week. Suffolk Street was closed for resurfacing and traffic was diverted down the lower part of Grafton Street.  Anyone <Col N="1225" /> who watched there had a salutary lesson and an excellent demonstration of how effective the planning had been in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to speedways, such as the Naas Road, all of us travel them at some time or another.  If we do not provide for crossings, we are bound to have trouble.  Uncontrolled level crossings are absolutely wrong on such speedways.  Level crossings on railways were controlled and traffic frequency was nothing like as great on the railway as it is now on the roads.  Yet level crossings are left uncontrolled on speedways.  There is a very serious engineering question involved here.  If it is meant to be a straight facility, there must be a properly enforced speed limit to prevent it becoming a speedway.  Everyone must realise that a car travelling at 60, 70, 80 and even 90 miles an hour &mdash; and it is no trouble to travel at those speeds on those stretches &mdash; takes quite a time to pull up and that another car behaving even slightly erratically can put the driver in a position where he has not time to cope.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of what I call the level crossing and the entries and exits from the side, there is the question of whether to stop.  Can you stop on those or not?  On some of the English ones I have seen, you simply cannot stop on certain stretches.  That seems silly at first sight but it is extremely important.  If you are travelling at those speeds, you want a clear-way, and apart from the question of a clearway, the actual process of stopping can be a serious hazard.  If a car is going along in front, even with a fair gap, on a long stretch, there is a certain tendency for the driver following to condition himself to the speed of the motorist ahead and if the motorist ahead decides inconsiderately to slow down, the man behind may be right on top of him before he realises it.  There are risks on a road like that from the point of view of stopping.</P>
    <P>Lastly there is the traditional risk on our roads which has caused accidents in the past.  I am afraid that there is a possibility that it will happen on those roads, too.  I refer to the risk of animals wandering along the road.  I understand <Col N="1226" /> that the legal position is that if I wish to drive cattle along the Naas Road, I may do so.  That may be my right but in the nature of things, it would not be a very safe thing to do at night-time.</P>
    <P>Therefore there is the whole question of the structure of roads of this nature and after that has been put right, there will be a necessity for police patrols on such areas.  That brings me to the question of times.  Naturally the Garda have to concentrate on peak periods and peak problems but they need more gardaí on this job because after certain hours of the night, it is very unusual to meet patrols, either cars or motor cycles.  I realise that the gardaí must have rest.  It is not their fault.  The best distribution they can make is being made but the fact remains that there is room for distributing the policing over hours that are not covered, hours that can be dangerous enough to warrant attention.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, what I am saying is that if we are to develop our roads in this way so that they are capable of speed, then all the ancillary services and amenities must be added, the cross-over and cross-under, the coming in from one side and all the rest of it and that is a big, expensive engineering problem.  However, if we are not prepared to do that, we should think twice about how far we will go in the development of this type of highway and as the only expedient to control it, one needs to put on a speed limit on such a highway and that means continuous policing of it.  There is also the question of discipline of motorists so that they will observe the regulations and rules but the motorist will not conform to anything that is not reasonable.  Therefore, a certain amount of thought is needed to see that the system is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Some things one could say would involve one in particular cases and naturally in this House, one does not want to get involved in particular cases that are being considered in any way.  There is a matter touching on policing which I think I can mention, that is, the question of the guards' function in regard to crime.  I have been concerned on other Estimates as to whether the Garda are being backed <Col N="1227" /> up sufficiently on this question of crime, whether sentences are sufficient and whether our approach to this matter is correct at all in some regards.  I am not talking about the young offender, the first offender, the person you want to reclaim.  I am saving myself from being accused of anything like that but there is a hard core of other things.  Such persons as malicious criminals exist in all communities.  We have been lucky enough, but modern communication and the ease with which people are now contacting one another and the growth of our cities do not leave us in a position in which we can be complacent about these things.</P>
    <P>I am old-fashioned enough to think that punishment and detection are deterrents and that when there is detection, a conviction properly backed by a sentence is the old way and the best way of keeping order in a community. A judge in the North of Ireland yesterday made a remark to the effect that he thought detection and a conviction were the best safeguards.  I would like to add to his remark, &ldquo;Yes, and a suitable consequence to conviction&rdquo;.  I mean by a suitable consequence &mdash; I see Deputy Dunne looking at me and I think he will agree that you cannot say in advance how a particular case should be dealt with.  Each individual case is still an individual case but if the Garda are to function and to detect &mdash;I am speaking generally about a police force &mdash; and bring to conviction, it is necessary that the conviction will have an adequate consequence.  I am not at all convinced &mdash; and I would abide by an experiment in a laboratory and take the answer whatever it may be &mdash; that the answer is extreme leniency and failure to back the forces of law and order or that will in the long term be beneficial to the community.</P>
    <P>People will argue as to the value of punishment as a deterrent and the value of something else as an encouragement but the long term way to learn the lesson is by experience.  I said it before and I say it again.  We have heard an awful lot about the unfortunate offender, about his problems and all that kind of thing.  I know we <Col N="1228" /> should not be unsympathetic, that we should be understanding, but we have not heard enough at all about the rights and the safety of the majority of the citizens who live in proper social relationship with the rest of the community and who are good law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>Certain homicide used to be a capital crime.  It might be interesting to know what exactly a life sentence means. How long does it mean?  That would be an interesting thing to find out.  There are specific cases, which for obvious reasons I do not want to go into, but I recommend this to the Minister for his attention.  Would the Minister examine this matter and see how many convictions for crimes that brought a sentence of life or a sentence in excess of 20 years there were and see how long was actually served or, in other words, what in fact is the deterrent here.  I am saying those things because of what is being done in other places.  One has seen the way things are going in England.  I am not talking about things here at all.  I am referring to experience in other countries.  I for one would like to see the answer.  We will all know the answer in due course.  I wonder if our experience will not be the same as across the water during the past ten years or so, whether all this liberalisation of legislation in regard to the enforcement of the law has been a social advantage and has resulted in social improvement.</P>
    <P>There are very good reasons for questioning whether it has, particularly in regard to crimes of violence, murders and all that kind of thing.  We have been singularly free of them here, thank God.  The important thing here is that the Garda and the prison warders should get the full support of the whole community and the practical support of the community.  Lastly, I am going to make a plea that people like teachers, gardaí and warders who give such good and important service to the community &mdash; in fact more than any other branch of the State service &mdash; should be given every possible support by the community.</P>
    <P>I believe the time has come for a re-assessment of our traditional values by which we put people in certain <Col N="1229" /> administrative jobs, with greater status and greater remuneration than people such as law enforcement officers, prison warders and teachers who possibly are the most important in the whole team from a certain point of view.  In so far as this Minister is concerned, I believe one way we can improve all the problems we have been talking about is further still to enhance prestige.  Prestige is measured largely by remuneration of our police force.  Our gardaí should be more in the nature, especially in the officer class, of professional men commanding great respect both in their duties and from the community because of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>This may seem a revolutionary thing to suggest but when all is said and done, everybody depends in the last analysis on those people in the executive arm.  The whole structure of the community in the last analysis depends on those people.  That is a plea I would like to make in general terms again, as I have done on previous occasions in regard to our police force.</P>
    <P>The question of juries, to come away from the police force, has been mentioned here.  I expressed my opinion before but it is no harm to repeat it again.  Do we need juries in civil cases? I completely agree with what has been said about the difficulties that are experienced by men called for jury duties.  I do not know that the matter will be changed by extending the range and the liability for service.  It may, but not in reality, having regard to a modern judiciary and a modern world. I do not believe that there is really any case for retaining civil juries.</P>
    <P>I know that in certain quarters disagreement will be expressed in regard to this but I for my part feel that a judge, properly informed, is in as good a position to make an assessment as 12 men locked away in a room arguing among themselves.  I have no knowledge of what goes on in such a place because I have never been there.</P>
    <P>There are reasons for keeping a jury in the case of crimes, but I need not go into them.  I will content myself with saying that perhaps it would be better to keep juries for criminal <Col N="1230" /> matters but I do not consider that in civil cases it is a good thing to continue with juries.  One Deputy opposite instanced at some length what jury men have to contend with.  Twenty-one days was mentioned and 5/- is donated to each man who has served as a juror.  That does not seem to be good enough.  On the other hand, it has certain disadvantages if you pay a person for duty of this nature.  If you were to make it a paid job, then there would be so many objections to it that I for one would strongly oppose such a suggestion.  The simplest thing the Minister could do would be to do away with the jury system in civil cases.</P>
    <P>I do not want to come back to the question of police duty but I want to come back to the question of traffic wardens, auxiliaries and such people. I would like to know from the Minister whether a realistic scheme of this nature can be considered and whether costs would rule it out.  I would also like to ask the Minister, following on what I said earlier, both in connection with the police force and jury service, because the police have a function in that, too, if there is any way of minimising, or has this been done as far as possible now, or removing from the gardaí, especially metropolitan gardaí, the administrative duties, the form-filling and all that sort of thing.  I have not kept up-to-date with this but I have heard it argued that if you did not do it in certain country districts, the gardaí would have nothing at all to do.  That is a very happy state to be in.</P>

      <P>That is one of the difficulties of the modern age, too. In the cities and in the towns where there are concentrated populations, is this a matter worth talking about at all?  It possibly is not, but if it is, I think the Garda should be relieved of this responsibility as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, how about our equipment? We are living in an age of technical <Col N="1231" /> development.  Have our Department of Justice and all the services of justice been able to equip us for the needs of a modern age and modern cities? This will become more and more important.  The Garda have been equipped in certain cases with intercontrol radio sets and that kind of thing.  There is inter-communication even between individual gardaí, but have we enough of this type of equipment? Have we the proper type of transport to cope with these problems? These are all things that are important in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I think I have wandered over a number of points, many of which, as I said in the beginning, will come up on Local Government and especially on the new Road Traffic Bill before us. In the meantime, I would ask the Minister to advert to some of the headings which we will bring up here with a view to their impact on the Bill which will come before us.  Many of us have experienced, on the Second Stage, concern with policing problems which will arise.  Now is the time for the Department of Justice to vigorously put their point of view in those matters, and I would suggest that the Minister in closing this debate might let us have his considered opinion and that of his advisers as to the situation in regard to all the problems that will come up on the Bill to be piloted through this House by one of his colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy de Valera, I feel that the matters which fall to be dealt with under this Estimate are vital to society generally. Indeed it has struck me that the attitude of the House to discussion of matters relevant to the Department of Justice has been far too often not sufficiently serious and I have often considered that much more time should be given to consideration of the various items which are the responsibility of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say at the outset that I think the Minister has discharged his responsibilities in this Department admirably.  Any contact I have had with him, as we all must have from time to time, in matters concerning my <Col N="1232" /> constituents have been met with expedition and courtesy.  I wish I could say the same of all the Heads of Departments.</P>
    <P>To begin with &mdash; one of the matters which has agitated the public mind very considerably &mdash; I would refer to district justices.  DJs are very important men and, invariably, men of high intelligence.  I often think that they are not adequately recompensed for the difficult job they do.  It is a job which in a way sets them apart from the rest of their fellows in society, and on that ground alone, it appears to me that they are a group that might well be given serious consideration by the Minister.  However, that is something to which I am sure he will advert in his own time.  But there are some DJs who are successful in raising the hackles of every reasonable citizen and they do this by taking it on themselves to deliver lectures of one kind or another from the Bench.  That is not their function.  Their function is, as we all know, to apply the law as written by Dáil Éireann and to apply it with as much reason, justice and mercy as seems to them appropriate.</P>
    <P>There is nothing which annoys the citizen, and justifiably annoys him, than reading in an evening paper, or in any paper, a generalisation concerning, we shall say, a particular area or neighbourhood couched in terms of condemnation, or condemnation by inference, by DJs.  This has been the subject of some comment recently.  It would, therefore, be undesirable to identify any particular individual with it.  I think the Minister might address a few words to the DJs on the undesirability of that kind of lecture, and the need for them, as well, to have regard to the spirit of the law.</P>
    <P>I, like Deputy de Valera, am not one who would be found in the ranks of those who advocate recourse to physical punishment as a complete remedy for legal infractions or crime. It has its place.  I think it would be impossible to contemplate any kind of settled existence without the final sanction of some physical deprivation, be it of liberty, or some other thing, to ensure that the individual who is intent upon defying the law will be <Col N="1233" /> brought to heel.  But, on the other hand, much has been discovered within the past limited number of years in regard to causes of crime and the probable reasons why people take to a life of illegal activity and to the probability that in many cases such causes are matters over which they themselves have absolutely no control.  They may be based on hereditary influences, lack of home influences, or the detrimental influences which flow from extreme hardships experienced by young people; or the lack of natural affection which can be disastrous to young people.  All these things in an enlightened country, as I hope we can consider ours to be, must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We cannot just accept this, although it is a tempting thing to do; it is very tempting and easy to fall into the temptation of saying: &ldquo;There is only one thing for the lawbreaker and that is to punish him.&rdquo;  We all feel like that by times; I certainly do.  I have had occasion to feel like that because I have suffered burglary and all that kind of thing &mdash; the culprits never having been found.  At the same time, a thorough consideration of the whole problem is incumbent on us all, consideration of the facts and of the probable reasons and causes which lie behind crime itself.  That is not to say there is not a place for Mountjoy, or indeed Maryborough, though I am somewhat doubtful about Daingean because, apart from anything else, it seems to be the easiest joint in Europe to crack.</P>
    <P>But DJs, before I leave them, have been condemned, too, for overdue leniency and I must sympathise with this.  On many occasions we have seen such cases reported.  On the other hand, we might see what one would regard as an accidental legal infraction by an ordinary citizen being heavily punished by way of fine or imprisonment, or possibly both.  You can see, too, deliberate lawbreaking, with robbery or, perhaps, robbery with violence being given kid glove treatment from the Benches and naturally the public will say: &ldquo;What kind of carry-on is this; surely there is no justice in it?&rdquo; I raised this matter before, <Col N="1234" /> and I think the Minister, in replying, said he had drawn the attention of DJs generally to the need for some kind of uniform approach in matters of this kind.  I do think it is time to raise this matter again, keeping in mind at all times the need for protecting the ordinary inoffensive citizen going about his business, the need to see that the blackguard and the thug will not be dealt with leniently by the courts, and that if he is known to be a person who has broken the law not once but several times, he will not walk out of court free but will be punished, as he should, for what he is &mdash;an incorrigible case.</P>
    <P>Of course, these incorrigibles are in the minority but they should be investigated in regard to the need for consideration of all the other background aspects which call for the attention of psychiatrists, psychologists and so on, which must be applied to the full, explored, and used to the very utmost limits in so far as is possible in order to reform the person concerned, if reformation is possible.  If there is a want in the individual, a psychological or mental want, then some means must be found to keep such a person under restraint for his own good and for the good of everyone else.  As we know, there are many such borderline cases.</P>
    <P>I want to mention here again the excellence of the gardaí in Dublin city and county in the dealings they are compelled to have in many difficult cases.  I want to mention especially&mdash; I do not think it can be mentioned often enough &mdash; the tremendous services rendered to the people of Dublin by one man in particular &mdash; Detective Sergeant Brannigan &mdash; whose name is known to every person throughout the length and breadth of the city because, of course, Sergeant Brannigan was a sportsman.  But it is a fact that he has rendered signal service to the whole community and has undertaken dangerous and difficult tasks for which this city owes him a debt of gratitude. I hope the Minister will lose no opportunity &mdash; because I am certain he appreciates this as much as I do&mdash;of having this expression and, perhaps, some more tangible expression of the feelings of everybody towards this excellent <Col N="1235" /> officer conveyed where it will do most good.</P>
    <P>I read in a paper today &mdash; or it might have been yesterday &mdash; remarks of an American said to be an authority on drug traffic, in which he indicated that, in his view, this country was the centre of some element of drug operations.  I suppose the thing is inescapable, that we might expect this dreadful contagion, which has galloped throughout the world, especially through the adolescent world, over the last decade and which has wrought such havoc, which causes such awful problems, would eventually reach our shores.  I do not know to what extent it is a problem, as yet, but I do know it does exist here because I have discussed it with people who are in a position to see the sad end effects of drug addiction in Dublin.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us how far the disease has penetrated here and whether we are equipped, whether our police force in the city and country are equipped to discover this kind of criminality and to take remedial steps about it with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me that there are drug-pushers in Dublin.  Surely there is no punishment man could conceive which would be too bad for the person who pushes drugs.  We have all read of the terrible effects of drug addiction, the fact that it amounts to worse than the taking of life in that it destroys the human mind as well as the body.  Before people die it drives them mad; they go through agonies which are unimaginable by all the literature which deals with this particular problem.  We have seen it referred to on television, and there is some knowledge of what it means.  If there are drug pushers in this country &mdash;I do not know; I merely repeat what has been said to me by those who claim they know&mdash;and if it becomes necessary to bring in legislation to deal with them, I urge the Minister to consider doing so because this is a vicious viper and it must be stamped on, if it is there, immediately and without hesitation.</P>
    <P>A great compliment is due to that <Col N="1236" /> section of the Garda Síochána who are responsible for &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; on Telefís Éireann.  Again, I probably repeat myself, but I do not think one can compliment good men often enough because good men are not all that numerous and when they are observed, they should be seen to be observed, certainly by us.  This programme is excellently done, with a professional flair by the gardaí who appear on it and I am sure it has a very beneficial effect on the enforcement of law.</P>
    <P>Later tonight on the Adjournment, I shall be dealing, I hope in some detail, with the question of the traffic danger constituted by the Naas Road. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me now on one point.  I put a question to the Minister for Local Government in which I asked him if he had consulted with the Minister for Justice and the relevant two county councils in connection with the need for having this traffic murder &mdash; it is nothing less than that &mdash; eliminated from the Naas Road.  The Minister for Local Government, in an unsatisfactory reply, indicated this consultation was under way. I assume he has had consultations with the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions have already taken place between the Minister for Local Government and myself and the responsible officials of both Departments and the Garda, and I am sure the Minister for Local Government will be making a statement on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some suggestions to the Minister for Justice in regard to this matter, and I hope I shall not be repeating what has been said by other speakers because I do not want to weary or bore the House, or make statements now which I shall have to repeat later.  It seems to me that one of the great dangers as far as that road is concerned, or, indeed, any road of its kind, is the constant use of it by vehicles which are either unlighted at the rear or ill-lighted.  At the present time, if any person is driving on the Naas Road at night and sees in the distance ahead a red light &mdash; in some cases, the red lights may be so bad on heavy <Col N="1237" /> trucks covered by mud that they may not be visible at all&mdash;there is no way whereby the driver of the following car can tell whether that red light is stationary or moving unless it disappears round a corner.  If it is stationary, there is no way whereby he can determine whether it is or not.  At the same time, the driver of the rear car is subject to the continuous blinding flow of traffic coming against him, dazzling him constantly, and it is the easiest thing in the world in that situation for even the most careful driver to find himself stuck into the back of a lorry or into another car that has been stalled because of an accident or for any other reason.</P>
      <P>Something must be done about it because the most awful accidents have been occurring with too great frequency during the past few years in this way: vehicles crashing into the rear of stationary vehicles on fast traffic roads.  I suggest to the Minister that if it lies within his power, he should do something more than the present regulation whereby if a lorry breaks down, gets a puncture or something of that nature, a triangle of reflectors is placed behind the lorry so that traffic from the rear will know there is something stalled.  That is not good enough, because for one reason or another traffic coming from behind can overrun that, which may not be as visible as it ought to be or, perhaps, one car behind has come to a stop but the cars behind that may not and the result may be a crash pile-up with the terrible tragedies that follow from it.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there should be some more effective source of warning by means of a flashing light.  It need not be expensive; it is not a technologically impossible thing to design.  Indeed, it is in many shops. Some county councils have been using it.  Such a devise should be left at a fixed distance behind the stationary vehicle.  This should be a requirement by law and its lack should be direly punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is just one thought I have in connection with the general question of traffic control.  I urge the Minister to give it what support he can.  I am sure he is anxious we should all do <Col N="1238" /> our utmost to try to reduce the accident rate.  All of us feel it deeply when we hear of unfortunate relatives in some cases learning of the deaths of young people in their prime when they read it in the newspapers.  We must adopt the most constructive methods we can to ensure that there will be a minimum of accidents.  We shall never eliminate accidents, any more than we shall ever attain human perfection in any phase of activity, but we must strive in all the ways that are open to us.</P>
    <P>Speed itself is something which has to be controlled by means of imposing speed limits.  Why is there not an upper speed limit? Why should there be any sections of the country where the motorist&mdash;any motorist&mdash;can put down his boot and think himself a Malcolm Campbell, a John Surtees, a Stirling Moss, a Seagrave or what have you, and build up speed to any level he likes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is, Sir.  I believe this new section has been introduced by the Minister as a result of objections made in particular from this <Col N="1239" /> side of the House in respect of the administration of this measure being handed over to deciding officers of the Department of Social Welfare.  We are very pleased the Minister has had second thoughts and has introduced this new section which is a clear departure from the point of view expressed by the Minister in this House on the 30th May last.  As reported at column 1614 of the Official Report, Volume 228, No. 13, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>If a worker is dissatisfied with an employer's decision regarding a lump sum payment, he may ask to have the question resolved by the appeals machinery of the Department of Social Welfare.  A worker may also avail of the same appeals machinery if he is dissatisfied with a decision of a deciding officer.  Likewise, an employer may appeal against the decision of a deciding officer on matters relating to scope and contributions. Reference to the High Court may be made where a question of law is involved.</P>
      <P>I could go on indicating clearly that the administration of this redundancy pay was in very large measure tied up with the Department of Social Welfare.  We were perturbed about this divided responsibility between these two Departments. We wanted the Minister for Labour to be in sole control of this matter.  We were particularly concerned about the Department of Social Welfare deciding matters of this kind by reason of the tradition and the background of the administrators of that Department.</P>
      <P>In our opinion, the appeals officers of the Department of Social Welfare are unfit by training, background and outlook to administer this scheme and no good could come from it.  They are actuated by a niggardly, conservative, out-moded and archaic social welfare code, by niggardly means tests and the conception of the dole.  All that is completely removed from our ideas on the dignity of labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this new concept whereby workers would be entitled to reasonable recompense when they become disemployed due to redundancy until such time as they are trained and replaced <Col N="1240" /> in suitable employment.  On the other hand, we have this code, riddled with the conception of means tests, doles, and so on, and the people who administer it are totally unsuited to administer this new scheme.  One has only to look at the code of social welfare in respect of unemployment benefit to realise that these people would still be looking with a jaundiced eye at this matter.  Their whole approach to the administration of social welfare, as we have known it in respect of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, in particular, was such as to deprive the applicant of benefit rather than to help him to secure it.  All kinds of tricks and devices are included in that code to trick the applicant out of his benefit.  I want the Minister to state categorically that the Department of Social Welfare and its administrators are now completely and utterly divorced from the administration of the Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>In section 39 there is still reference to deciding officers.  What kind of person will a deciding officer be?  Will he be appointed by the Minister for Labour or will he be a person in the Department of Social Welfare?  If the deciding officer or the appeals officer has the mentality of a type which we have had to contend with at appeal boards in respect, for example, of unemployment benefit, then this scheme will be maladministered and social justice cannot be done.  They will still be prejudiced by the code they are at present administering in respect of a person who loses his employment by reason of alleged misconduct, as a result of a trade dispute, a strike or lockout or by reason of refusing employment. A very important factor under this Bill is the question of an offer of alternative employment, that is, whether the wishes of the employee will be met, whether the employment offered is suitable, of a kind to which the person was used and in keeping with that person's training and talents.</P>
    <P>Where any employment is offered, however menial, irrespective of the rotten conditions or the low wages prevailing for the job, the person is automatically disqualified from unemployment benefit if he or she does not take <Col N="1241" /> up the job.  This invariably happens. We do not want that kind of mentality directed towards workers who become redundant.  We sincerely welcome this change of heart, the fact that the Minister is taking these functions unto himself and separating this measure from the Department of Social Welfare.  However, we have to be satisfied that the break is clean and that these people will have no hand, act or part in administering this legislation.  If they have they will do untold damage and cause unnecessary disputes.  The opening sentence of the new section deals with the creation of a tribunal which is to be known as the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal.  It sets out the composition of that Tribunal, a chairman who shall be a practising barrister or a solicitor of seven years' standing, not more than three vice-chairmen, and not more than eight ordinary members.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Jones and others in expressing the view that the Minister has chosen the wrong word in &ldquo;tribunal.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; has a sorry connotation in the minds of our people, particularly in the minds of the working classes.  We immediately conjure up visions of an army tribunal before which an unfortunate person is arraigned, charged with a political crime, in circumstances in which he is condemned before he is actually tried, and the question of his innocence is of little consequence.  The word &ldquo;board&rdquo; would be far more appropriate.  The Minister in his brief remarks this evening, seemed to indicate that he was not too enamoured of the word &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; and that he might be favourably disposed towards accepting the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; instead.  It would be a far more appropriate word.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen vociferously opposed the appointment as chairman of a practising barrister, lawyer or solicitor. With his close association with the trade union movement, he set out clearly his reasons for objecting to the appointment of a lawyer.  He pointed out that a lawyer, as such, does not necessarily have a better knowledge or understanding of affairs than what we call a layman, in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have regard to the fact that up to now negotiations <Col N="1242" /> between employers and employees have been carried out by direct negotiation, to the complete exclusion of lawyers, except when they were called in to interpret a point of law.</P>
    <P>It would be far better if this board or tribunal were allowed to appoint its own chairman and vice-chairman rather than have the Minister foist a lawyer on it.  There is an old and true saying that the people who pay the piper are entitled to call the tune.  It is fair to point out that in this proposed legislation the State is contributing nothing to the funds.  The fund will be made up of subscriptions from workers and employers.  Employers will contribute 8d per male operative and 6d per female operative, and the male workers will contribute 4d and the female worker 3d.  We are therefore entitled to challenge the State's right to foist a lawyer or a barrister on this board or tribunal, without regard to the wishes of those who are contributing to the fund.  Those who are paying the piper are entitled to say who is best suited to preside over their functions in a fair and impartial manner.  We question the wisdom of appointing a barrister as chairman and I submit that there are very many people, in the Minister's Department in particular, who are far better qualified to preside over this board than a lawyer.</P>
    <P>We have very many boards and committees, very many joint industrial councils and trade boards, with highly skilled officers who are thoroughly conversant with the problems of employer-employee relations.  We have our Labour Court and in this regard it is significant to point out that there is no lawyer in the Labour Court.  We have three layman administering the affairs of industrial relations.  With the exception of 1965&mdash;when we had a very high incidence of strikes, mainly attributable to the action of the Government of the day in opposing the trade unions' legitimate demands for a fair increase in wages and pinning them down to the ridiculous suggestion of a three per cent increase&mdash;the Labour Court has had a very honourable and very successful record in the field of industrial relations.  It would <Col N="1243" /> take quite a yardstick to measure the good which it has achieved, the goodwill it has built up and its success in avoiding strikes, lock-outs and industrial unrest due to the capable manner in which the members discharged their duties.  The law did not come into it.</P>
    <P>Only in exceptional cases is the law brought into industrial relations.  The trade union movement regards with suspicion and distrust the appointment of a high-ranking barrister of this kind to such a position.  On behalf of my Party, I want to say that this is not unreasonable.  This is probably traditional in our movement because these right honourable gentlemen have rarely been found on the side of the working classes.  They invariably take their stand with the bosses.  We see them usually on the side of capital and rarely on the side of labour.  Therefore, the Minister will understand our feelings of disquiet and distrust when we see an important position of this kind being doled out to the lawyers.</P>
    <P>Looking briefly at this measure, it would be evident to anyone that the chairman of the tribunal will be dealing with essentially industrial relations, not points of law as the Minister would seek to infer.  This measure deals with the problem of redundancy.  &ldquo;Redundancy&rdquo; is merely a sophisticated word to cover up the nakedness of the sack, dismissal, unemployment&mdash;the problem of people being thrown ignominiously on the unemployment scrapheap. That is what this Bill is about. The fancy word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; is not going to cover up the human problem with which so many of us are conversant. This Bill will be dealing with such things as the years of service an employee gave with his employer. There will have to be arbitration on whether or not years of service with a previous employer shall be taken into account.  This will be important.  If we are going to confine workers to the employment they had with their last employer, to our minds that would be patently unfair.  However, I do not want to go into the details of these matters now as we will have ample opportunity when we come to the appropriate section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> I want to point out briefly how much this Bill concerns industrial relations and how important it is that the people administering it and resolving these disputes should be conversant with industrial human problems.  The interpretation of the word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; is bound to arise from time to time.  The period of employment involved, periods of illness, time lost due to strikes or lock-outs, time lost due to intermittent employment, to slackness of trade, acts of God such as fire and floods, power breakdowns and the like&mdash;whether all this will be taken into account.  The calculation of the lump sums involved can prove very vexatious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely seeking to dissuade the Minister or anyone else in this House from the foolish notion that the chairman of this tribunal should be a barrister.  I contend that he ought to be someone thoroughly conversant with the problems of industry in this country, particularly the problems of labour-employer relations.  I sought to show some of the problems that could arise in order to indicate how important it was that this chairman should know exactly what the problems were.  If the Chair feels that this is not relevant, I shall have to accept the ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the section, I trust the Minister will do some rethinking in regard to the appointment of the lawyers.  We also have the proposals to appoint three vice-chairmen.  For a moment I wondered why three vice-chairmen should be necessary.  But, reading through the section, I find there are good reasons for it, reasons I personally accept, in that it is desirable that the tribunal should be readily available and, if required, should be able to meet quickly and conveniently in different parts of the country in order <Col N="1245" /> to deal with disputes arising from time to time.  Here there is scope for the vice-chairmen to be in different places and to have with them some members of the board in order to resolve these problems.  This is a good thing and will, I hope, make for speedy decisions. I trust that is what the Minister has in mind.  If I am under a misapprehension, I should be glad if he would tell me so.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister where, if at all, in this Bill it is spelled out precisely how an aggrieved person can set about making his appeal, whether we will have a suitable form for such an appeal and to whom the appeal will be made.  Everyone now knows my scepticism in regard to the part which the Department of Social Welfare may play in this matter.  Are we to take it that the appeal will be made, in the first instance, to the local employment exchange? Are we to take it that payment will be made in the local employment exchange?  Who then will deal with the appeal?  The Minister's name may be mentioned but the Minister will be delegating his powers to some other person.  I would like him to say who these deciding officers or appeals officers will be, whether, as I have already said, they will be these types of preachers, these faceless officials we have had to contend with and have had experience of in the Department of Social Welfare, or whether they will be persons suitably trained for dealing with this new problem of redundancy and the appropriate compensation involved.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that the day is gone when we can relate the situation to the outlook enshrined in the social welfare code.  This Bill, as I see it, is designed to ennoble labour somewhat in this country, to provide a decent standard of living for workers in the intervening period between unemployment, training and replacement. In that regard we must get away altogether from the concept in the mind of some people in this country of planning down these unfortunates and thinking of them on a subsistence level of existence rather than the reasonably high standards we seek for these people in this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the amendments, by the Minister and Deputy Jones, that the chairman and three deputy chairmen of the tribunal be drawn from the legal profession.  If you want to operate on the theory that the chairman be from the legal profession and he proceeds to introduce into this tribunal legal practices, and then sectional tribunals are set up within the scope of that, it is almost inevitable that the deputy chairmen will also be drawn from the legal profession.</P>
      <P>I would not wish to cast any reflection on the legal profession, even though we see some of its exponents in this House make damn fools of themselves, if you do not mind my using that expression.  We see the position very frequently in regard to the interpretation of Acts passed through this House, that they are given one interpretation by the legal adviser to the Minister responsible and a completely different interpretation by the legal adviser to a local authority, and this is common practice.  What we in the Labour Party are concerned with is to secure, first of all, that this Bill be not delayed, and, secondly, that the people whom the Bill is designed to benefit will not find themselves tangled up in a whole series of legal processes.</P>
      <P>There are various arbitration councils which are presided over excellently by barristers and solicitors.  There are other arbitration tribunals that operate in much the same way and that are presided over excellently by people from other professions.  There have been tribunals set up with employers and workers' organisations, including some important public concerns, and they have agreed that the chairman of the tribunal would not be a lawyer, practising or otherwise.  It is wrong to suggest that only those who are trained in law can interpret facts and, to my mind, the bulk of the appeals will not be questions of law but questions of facts.  Possibly an industrial consultant, possibly a professor of economics or a student of economics, a secondary teacher or anyone else with the necessary knowledge, should be able to preside excellently over this type of tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also makes reference to <Col N="1247" /> the introduction of legal representation. It is now generally accepted that had the trade union movement in 1946 accepted the pressure at that stage to introduce legal practices in the Labour Court, that body would not have functioned as well as it has functioned. The machinery of that body has its faults but efforts have been made to cure those faults.  There are objections to the way appeals are dealt with in the Department of Social Welfare. Those objections may be well founded, but the proposed system would make the situation more difficult.  I wish to quote subsection (17) (a):</P>
    <P>The Tribunal shall, on the hearing of any matter referred to it under this section, have power to take evidence on oath and for that purpose may cause to be administered oaths to persons attending as witnesses at such hearing.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that this tribunal needs this section would appear to indicate that most of the appeals will be dealt with by way of legal process.  One wonders whether an appellant should be put to the expense of having to employ counsel in order to have his appeal heard by the tribunal.  The danger is that once you enter on this path of legal appeal, the employers, if they want to resist it, will be quite willing to employ senior counsel.  Then you may well have a situation in which the tribunal will set up a history of case law in respect of a tribunal which basically will be required to deal with matters of fact.  I submit, with all due respect to the legal profession, that they are not always the best judges of matters of fact.  There are people in many other professions who are equally good, if not better, judges of matters of fact.  For instance, the question whether a person has continuous service for the purposes of the Bill would not require determination by a lawyer.  Any good accountant could do that and do it better than most lawyers because that is their particular field.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this tribunal, to my mind, is to secure that the appellant will, if, in his opinion, the decision of <Col N="1248" /> the deciding officer has been unfair, have some other avenue open to him. If there is clearly a question of law involved, there is a section in the Bill which provides for recourse to the courts, but there is no reason whatsoever why the selection of the chairman should be confined to the legal profession. When I say that I do not want to denigrate the legal profession.  I have known cases in which the union of which I am a member have been very satisfied to have a dispute determined, with the consent of their members and the consent of the employers, by somebody from the legal profession acting in the capacity of arbitrator. We knew who the individual was and he had a reputation and ability.  On the other hand, we have had people not of the legal profession, economists, teachers, prominent people in vocational schools, professors and so on.  I submit it would be a serious mistake to think of this tribunal as being merely a happy hunting ground for legal cases. We must ensure that those who become redundant have their cases dealt with fairly and speedily.  The legal profession are not the only people who can judge what is just and fair.</P>

      <P>We do not have any real difference with the amendment that the Minister has now added.  We have made our point about the legal profession and he has taken note of our representations in that regard.  I suggest that in view of the amendment which we put down earlier this year and which the Minister has seen fit to embody to some extent in his own amendment, we have no real disagreement with this amendment.  There are other more important differences that arise on this Bill.  We have urged that this Bill be implemented as rapidly as possible and certainly we do not want to be chasing red herrings here all night.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should push this matter to a decision very rapidly as the issue seems to be only the infinitesimal difference between what Deputy Jones has down and what the Minister has down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise again only because of something Deputy Fitzpatrick of Fine Gael said in relation to <Col N="1249" /> what I had to say about this section.  I want to make it perfectly clear that my objection to it is the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, in relation to having a chairman &ldquo;who shall be a practising barrister.&rdquo;  I understand well that you can get a good practising barrister or solicitor; there are good and bad in every avocation but it is wrong to single out the legal profession as the only people who can do that very necessary job.  I have looked through the English and the Six Counties Acts and I have not found such a condition in either of them.  I submit the Minister is putting an unnecessary spancel on himself because I noticed in this section that there is provision for the vice-chairman to act in the absence of the chairman but it is not laid down that any of the three vice-chairmen must be a barrister or solicitor.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is replying, I should like him to indicate the salary of the chairman.  I make this point because in answer to either Deputy Jones or Deputy Fitzpatrick, I heard the Minister saying that the practising barrister or solicitor who would become chairman would cease to practise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes it more interesting because he can have his finger in a number of pies, and this is my main objection because he will not be entirely free.  Finally, when Deputy Fitzpatrick who naturally set out to defend his fraternity, was speaking about the legal profession, he referred to judges, barristers and solicitors.  We all know that there have been peculiar decisions by judges and good decisions by judges, but bearing in mind that Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to workmen's compensation, it is only right that it should go on record here when the opportunity presents itself that it has very often happened that were it not for the intervention of the county registrar who has recently resigned, some of the awards made by judges in connection with workmen's compensation would be found by the workers to be most unsatisfactory.  That is an instance of how people can differ.  I ask <Col N="1250" /> the Minister to reconsider this matter and take out the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and not make it compulsory that the chairman should be a barrister or solicitor.</P>

      <P>It is rather unfortunate that such an amount of time should be devoted to this particular matter in the case of such an important measure as this.  We in Fianna Fáil are anxious that this Bill should go through as soon as possible so that its benefits will be passed on to the workers with the minimum delay.  The appointment of the chairman seems to be the important issue to which exception is taken.  The question is one of securing impartiality and efficiency in a chairman, whether he be a lawyer or a trade union official or anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is the point that the employers' representatives may be all barristers or solicitors.  The trade union representatives can be barristers and solicitors, if Congress decides to select them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It could happen that they would and it could happen that the position would be loaded.  It seems the Trade Union Congress will not select any barristers or solicitors while the employers could do so, and probably will, and that would mean, if there was no one with legal knowledge in control, that things could go very much against a man whose appeal was before the tribunal.  For that reason, there is great substance in the Minister's amendment and it should be implemented to ensure that the dice will not be loaded against the worker by a number of barristers or solicitors who may be selected by one side.  It is important to have someone in control who would be well versed in law and could guide the tribunal in the right direction.  However, there are three vice-chairmen and it might well be that at some stage the chair would be taken by people other than barristers or solicitors.  I am sure there would be little difference if a particular line were set but it is important that the Minister's amendment which, <Col N="1251" /> I think, is loaded in favour of the worker, be accepted.</P>
      <P>The employers are likely to employ legal representatives.  It is important that a man should have the right to be legally represented.  This ties in with the question of a legal mind.  If a man desires to be represented by a lawyer, certainly the chairman will add some weight to the tribunal in so far as another legal representative will be in the chair.  I have no doubt that a suitable chairman could be obtained from among journalists or trade union officials, employers or other sections of the community, even among Deputies&mdash;there are probably some who are suitable&mdash;but I think the Minister's amendment is important as it provides that the chairman should be someone with legal training.  I think the Labour Party have indicated that Congress will not appoint members of the legal profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister deals with that point, I want to refer to a matter which the Minister mentioned in connection with the amendment I have down as to the matters which will be referred to such an appeals board.  The matters referred to the board would be the matters which in the original legislation would be referred to the appeals officer and we will be substituting the board for that. These matters are dealt with in section 38:</P>
      <P>(a)  in relation to a claim for a weekly payment,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> (b)  as to whether a person is disqualified for a weekly payment,</P>
    <P>(c)  as to the period of any disqualification for a weekly payment,</P>
    <P>(d)  as to whether, or at what rate, a redundancy contribution is or was payable by an employer in respect of an employee,</P>
    <P>(e)  as to who is the employer of an employee, or</P>
    <P>(f)  on any such other matter relating to this Act as may be prescribed,</P>
    <P>These are the matters which would be referred to this appeal board.</P>
    <P>In regard to the objection which is being made to a legal person being chairman of the board, I think I made it clear that the reason why a legal person should be appointed is that there may be disputes on matters of fact and there may be persons giving evidence and there may be matters to be examined.  For that reason a person trained in the examination of evidence would be a person who might be of assistance to the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised a question in regard to the appeals that there would be.  A later section deals with that in regard to questions that can be referred to the High Court.  Our only interest in this respect was to ensure that you would get as chairman of the board someone in whom everybody could have the greatest confidence.  I even mentioned to the Minister that before appointing such a chairman from the people he might consider as appointees, he might go to the fountainhead of the law, the Chief Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary has indicated the willingness of his Party to accept my main amendment, which would mean accepting the consequential amendments also and the withdrawal of their amendments which they had down before I brought in this amendment.  He said that they expressed an opinion about the appointment of a legal person.  I still feel that this is a rights tribunal rather than an interests tribunal and there will be <Col N="1253" /> cases of individual interpretation of the law as applied to particular cases and I think that one person on the tribunal should have legal experience. There will be other people on the tribunal, people recommended to the Minister by the Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' bodies, so it will not be one person making a decision.  I do feel that experience will prove that I am right in saying that we should have somebody experienced in the law.  I see this tribunal as being nearer to the administration of justice than, say, to the Labour Court.  I do not agree with Deputy Jones about going to the Chief Justice.  In making the appointment, the Minister, having the basic qualifications in law established, should have regard to the fitness of the person to deal with this type of case and I should hope that the workers will have the confidence they would have in going to the ordinary courts in this country in going to a tribunal which would have one person capable in the law if the House would accept this tribunal as proposed by me.</P>

      <P>The Minister is overlooking one thing.  He is assuming that if he appoints a legal adviser, that legal adviser will be in a judicial position and will have the rights of a judge to decide on certain things.  We know, and the Minister knows, that there are quite a number of these people that the Minister would not like to have defending him or representing him. There could be people who were not doing well in their profession and who would grab this, and we could finish up with a group of half-baked people who would do a lot of harm to the confidence of the people in the court. Some of these people might have legal experience and very little else.  We all know that there are a number of very good people in that field, and that there are a number of very poor people in that field&mdash;poor in both senses of the word because they are not finding it easy to make a living.  They will be prepared to perch on the Minister's fence.</P>

If I had a grievance and if I thought that my rights were being infringed in some way, the person I would go to, naturally, to find out if I had a case, would be a lawyer.  If it is a vice-chairman who is the lawyer, you could have a situation where the chairman was turning to a vice-chairman every five minutes on a point of law.  We should realise that the main function of the tribunal will be to see that a man's rights are not infringed.  I believe that a lawyer is the best qualified person to know whether or not that is occurring.</P>

When this Bill becomes law, it will be a matter of interpreting it, and it will be a matter of justice between the worker and the employer. If he is unfairly dealt with, the representatives will be there to maintain justice within the Act.  I do not think that great use will be made of this tribunal.  I think there will be only the odd case, and I hope there is.  I should like to feel that we will get this legislation through quickly this evening so that those who will benefit from it will benefit as quickly as possible. Deputy Larkin mentioned a legal assessor but in the case of a legal assessor, you either abide by his decision or you do not.  I hope this tribunal will have an arbitrary function.

You said earlier that you considered that since there was no <Col N="1258" /> requirement in the case of the vice-chairmen, it could happen that we would have barristers and these other occupations; but, thinking it over now, the Minister thinks that all three vice-chairmen may have to be barristers or solicitors.  Why not simply say: &ldquo;The tribunal shall consist of the following members; (a) a chairman&mdash;full stop; (b) not more than three vice-chairmen; (c)  not more than three ordinary members.&rdquo;</P>

All Parties are agreed that this Bill is vitally essential.  I do not care whom the Minister appoints; all I want is that we should make progress here.  There might be four tribunals sitting in different parts of the country and, as the Bill stands, only one would be a lawyer.  The whole importance of his position is lessened if we do not insist that the three vice-chairmen must also be lawyers.</P>

Our function is to examine critically and ensure that the maximum benefit will be conferred on the workers concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  We will not accept the unfair inference that, because we examine the measure critically, we are holding up the legislation. I personally would love to see this Bill applying to my fellow workers in Dundalk, in Electra here in Dublin and in other areas throughout the country. The workers in Dundalk have been thrown on the scrapheap through no fault of their own and, if there is any humanity on the Government side of the House, they will adopt the suggestion made by Deputy Corish prior to the recess that the Bill should be implemented as and from 1st January, 1967, instead of coming into force, as the Minister proposes, on 1st January, 1968.  The adoption of Deputy Corish's suggestion would benefit the unfortunate people to whom I have referred.</P>
      <P>The Minister has created the impression that this Bill is not introduced because of fear of widespread redundancy or unemployment.  He seems to be very confident that he is containing the situation.  Deputy Moore is of the same opinion.  I rejoice that there is even a slim hope, therefore, of taking in under this measure these small pockets of workers to whom I have referred.</P>
      <P>I am on record already as opposing the terminology.  I do not retract any of the arguments I made in support of my opposition.  I still believe the appointment of legal men to chair this tribunal is wrong.  It may have serious reprecussions.  It now transpires that not only will we have a barrister as chairman but the three vice-chairmen will also be lawyers.</P>

      <P>I accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, but if he had been here today when we were discussing this matter, he would know that there was wide scope and that there was reference to the matters which I would wish to advert to now.  However, if the Minister is going to give us three lawyers to control this board or tribunal, what he is clearly seeking to do is to constitute it a court of law. This is now emerging&mdash;a court of law whose decisions would be final and binding and the only appeal would be appeal to the High Court.  I pose the question: what chance has the average operative in this country, especially an operative who might be a member of a trade union, of gaining access to the High Court?  Indeed, even a strong union would think twice <Col N="1262" /> about taking an issue to the High Court, having regard to the delay, having regard to the cost and having regard to the risk involved.  Therefore in all the circumstances, what we are seeking to do here is to create a court of law and you cannot blame any of us if we look at that situation with the utmost suspicion and distrust.  It may well transpire that such a tribunal would not be availed of by the working class people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points.  I should like to make it clear to Deputy Treacy and the Socialist Party that it was Deputy Molloy who asked for this measure to be hastened and the Minister has explained why it has not been hastened.  Deputy Treacy and the Socialist Party, and indeed Deputy M. O'Leary, are trying to make out in this House that all the lawyers are ogres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Some lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very far from the truth.  The traditions of the Bar are there and it is a well settled tradition that when poor people come to lawyers and cannot afford to litigate, the lawyers will do it for them for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the main traditions of the Bar.  Deputy Treacy always aligns himself with the workers but if he goes down to any docker in the city of Dublin who cannot afford to litigate, he will find that he can go to any solicitor or barrister and he will take up his case without any question of fee.  This is the situation and this is a great tradition of the Irish Bar and of the Irish legal profession.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it very clear that he is not going to give in to the semantics of the Socialist Party or the Labour Party&mdash;I do not know what to call them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We will discuss that later.  The Minister is not going to take <Col N="1263" /> any Tom, Dick or Harry from the Bar or the solicitors.  He is going to get an intelligent man, a man who knows what he is talking about, who knows something about industrial relations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy talks about erecting this tribunal or board&mdash;another question of semantics&mdash;into a court.  The only function of the chairman, vicechairmen and eight ordinary members is an interpretation of rights.  It is quite as simple as that and there is no question of erecting this tribunal into a court.  You can also, of course, follow that up and if, as I read it, the appellant is not satisfied with the decision of the board, he has his right in common law. Is that not the size of it?</P>
      <P>I should certainly like to make it very clear that lawyers, no matter what the Labour Party say about them, are notorious for their fairness and I think Deputy Treacy is being unfair to the legal profession in the manner in which he is attacking them here this evening. Many members of the trade unions are very glad from time to time to come to the legal profession.  Let us be fair about it and let us get the thing into perspective.  Deputy M. O'Leary, as far as my information goes, was not above intending at one time pursuing a legal career and fair play to him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 41 and 42, to delete &ldquo;for all benefits&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the social welfare code, as it is, there are provisions to exclude from benefit certain people, for instance, one class of menial employees.  It is logic, I think, to ensure that if people are insurable under the social welfare code for any benefits they ought to be able to qualify for benefits under this Bill.  I would like the Minister to tell me why those people should be excluded from benefit.  If people can be excluded under the social welfare code from benefit, it is reasonable to assume that they should be covered in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to find out more about those people.  The cases which I have excluded are the vast majority of people who have protection against redundancy in their own employment. The Bill covers all workers who are covered for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts and that covers the great bulk of manual workers and clerical workers earning under £1,200 a year.  I have said before that this is largely experimental, as we are breaking new ground, and I would be open to changing the provisions of the legislation in the light of experience.  As of now I do not think we should widen the scope beyond what I have said, that is people insured for all benefits under the social welfare Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand that this particular section applies only to clerical workers under £1,200 a year? Does the Minister not consider he should go higher than that?  Surely he realises in the matter of redundancy it could be found that people with £1,500 and £1,800 a year would be affected and could be very badly off.  Why is there £1,200 a year?  What is the case for that?</P>

      <P>I am only making the point that I understood the Minister to say that payments under this Bill cannot be applied to clerical workers who are in receipt of more than £1,200 a year.  Is this so?  Surely this calls for something to be done.  Money values are depreciating.  Wage increases are being given and surely it will not mean that when this Bill becomes law that a lot of people will be excluded from it.  The Minister should go into this and give it further consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister means when he says that we should have a look at it in the light of experience.  If this Bill becomes law and the situation comes about where a clerical worker with £1,200 is declared redundant and it is brought to his notice, will he have some power under this Bill.  How does the Minister propose to do it?  Has he to wait until a number of cases are built up and then decide?  I know a host of clerical workers who are not regarded as well off with £1,250 per year and they could very easily be caught up in this.  I should like to know at what stage the Minister will give it consideration.  Will this become automatic or will it be necessary to have it examined?  This is too old-fashioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In protecting people against redundancy, we have to select the people first of all who are likely to suffer redundancy, people who are not protected in their employment.  The people I have excluded are, in general, those whom we do not expect to suffer from redundancy as far as we can foresee.  Not everybody is covered I agree, but to get the scheme going we have picked the groups of workers who are likely to need the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister appreciates that there are all types of workers in industry, some of whom are paid more than others.  I can tell the Minister that quite recently in a certain establishment people were declared redundant. Some of the people concerned <Col N="1270" /> had £12 a week, others had £13 and some had £30 but they were declared redundant and got nothing at all. It transpired that their employer was taking example from what happened around him.  My point is why stop at £1,200.  I regard this as another way of hammering clerical workers.  It is extremely unfair.  I do not think it is intentional on the Minister's part, and I would ask him to have his advisers look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain categories of workers, travellers, for instance, who may not come within the scope of the Social Welfare Acts.  That means that they might be employed over a period of years and their firm is affected by economic circumstances and other employees in the same firm are let go.  Because they are not insurable they will not get any benefit. I make this particular point because a case came to my mind of a person who was a traveller who had been drawing a contributory pension for a number of years and the employer appealed to the courts and got a decision in his favour.  A person who had been drawing a contributory pension for something like ten years could then be told that he was not entitled to benefit because he was not insurable.  There must be many cases in which employees will not come under the scope of the Social Welfare Acts for benefit and they will be excluded although they might be just in as great a need for protection as anyone working in any undertaking. There is also the case of people in employment in which, because of certain conditions of employment, they have not for a long time stamped insurance cards and are covered for certain limited purposes only.  Will they be excluded?  I am not quite sure about that but I should like to raise it with a mark of interrogation at this moment.</P>

      <P>In regard to the matter mentioned by the Minister with reference to, say, teachers, at this stage, I think he must be aware that when teachers' salaries were raised some years ago, even women teachers were excluded from the benefits of social welfare but were allowed to contribute in a voluntary fashion.  By regulation of the Minister, they were cut out from these benefits.  The same applies to secondary teachers.  By regulation made by the Minister, they are cut out from benefiting in this fashion, except in so far as a widow's pension is concerned.</P>
      <P>During the Second Reading debate, I mentioned technicians and the clerical worker earning, say, £1,201.  I gave that as a notional figure.  At present we have technical people in industry. They would be earning something in that region of wages and would be excluded if the industry goes out of operation, if redundancy occurs and, as Deputy Mullen says, all other people are protected while these are not.</P>

      <P>There is a case to be made also for travellers, insurance agents and such people who are not in insurable employment, and yet many of them would earn less than £1,200. Under this Bill there is no protection for such people.  Surely the whole purpose of the Bill is to provide some redundancy compensation for people who become redundant.  Take people engaged in the drapery trade.  You can have a situation there in which the people in the shops are covered.  You can have porters, packaging workers or travellers who may not be covered for insurance, particularly those who travel on a credit system; yet they can fall the victim to redundancy.  I suggest the Minister might look at this to see if they can be covered under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Obviously, there is some ambiguity or doubt as to the various categories of workers who are covered by this Bill.  I should be grateful to the Minister if he would clarify the situation.  On reading the Bill, my impression is that all those in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts would be covered by this Bill with, obviously, certain exceptions&mdash;workers who are under the age of 18 or over 65 years, and certain other categories. But I was rather perturbed when the Minister intimated at one stage in the debate that employees of local authorities would not be covered by this <Col N="1275" /> measure.  Perhaps he was referring to pensionable and permanent officers of local authorities only.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that employees of local authorities&mdash; machinery men and roadworkers generally&mdash;are covered by this measure, even though they do enjoy a superannuation scheme, a pension scheme as such.  They are obviously subject to terrible insecurity of employment. They have no guarantee of continuity of employment and redundancy takes place from time to time in respect of road workers; indeed with the steep reduction in the road grants this year, many of us fear there will be unemployment for many men in the respective county council areas.  I hope the Minister will satisfy me that such road workers and other council employees affected will be covered by the redundancy scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy sits down, I will give him the answer.  This scheme, when brought in under this legislation, if we get it through, will cover farm workers and other workers for whom there may be special schemes; but until such time as the special schemes have been worked out, this scheme will apply.  I have attempted to get discussions going on an employer-employee representative basis for the purpose of working out a scheme for farm labourers.  I have invited the Congress of Trade Unions to take the workers' advice and in <Col N="1276" /> Press advertisements I have invited people who consider themselves to be representative of employers for discussions like we have had in the building industry.  I have had some response but it has not been total. Until such time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the farm workers are covered, pending special arrangements.  Another point I should like to make is in respect of the people covered by the Bill.  The wording is chosen very carefully&mdash;they should be insurable for all benefits, and I emphasise &ldquo;all&rdquo;, under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1966.  We know of certain categories of workers who are insured under the Social Welfare Acts but not comprehensively insured for all benefits.  I have in mind particularly psychiatric nurses, male and female, attached to our mental health institutions. They are covered by the Social Welfare Acts, mainly for widows and orphans benefits only.  In the circumstances, I should be grateful if the Minister would give us an assurance that such people will not be debarred from benefits under this Bill.  They are not comprehensively insured.  He will find certain categories of that kind in respect of whom I should like to be satisfied that they will be covered for benefit.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  A qualification for redundancy payment is that a person should have been an employed contributor in employment which was insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts immediately before the date of the termination of his employment.

I suppose one might say that a person in such employment would hardly continue in it for four years or more to qualify for redundancy, that is, a person with less than 25 hours a week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself has the answer.  He was talking earlier about Social Welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare produced the evidence the Minister asks for.  If a person is in employment of 17 hours or over per week, such person is insurable under the regulations of the Department of Social Welfare and it is not considered part-time employment. If it is under 17 hours per week, it is considered part-time and need not be insurable.  If the Department of Social Welfare accept that 17 hours per week is sufficient for a person who is depending on it for a livelihood, then surely it would be accepted by the Minister for Labour as the slide rule?</P>

    <P>This is an important point.  There may be a worker at the age of 20 who will not qualify for cover under this Act for any redundancy payment because he has not four years' service with the same employer.  If he is excluded under 18 years and if it begins at 18 and if he is rendered redundant at 20 then he is outside the scope of this Bill when enacted.  Therefore, he should commence at the age of 16, so that, if declared redundant at the age of 20, he would come within the terms of this measure.  The age for starting should be 16 and not 18.</P>

If any chap has been working with the same employer from the age of 16 to 20, then he merits some redundancy payment. Even though he may have been an apprentice, he has been working with the same employer.  After a certain period of working with the same employer, we assume the worker has a certain ownership right in his job, even if he had been an apprentice.</P>

      <P>Again, the question of the age at which insurable employment commences arises.  The worker is insured at 16.  Why should the Minister, then, have considered the age 18?  The worker pays full rates at 16.  If he must pay insurance from the age of 16 then should he not be entitled to have the benefit applied to him from that age and to have that age considered as the starting age?  There does not seem to be any reason for 18 except that you put up your hand and say &ldquo;18&rdquo;.  In modern times, lots of young men of 18 get married.  We see them around this city.  If we do not start it at the insurable age, which is 16, we shall exclude a number of married people who have families to support even at as early an age as 20. If the Minister will look at the Department of Social Welfare arrangement I am sure he will agree that 16 is the age and not 18.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to take into account the fact that people, especially those who are forced to go into manual work, particularly industrial work of one kind or another, are inclined to go into it immediately after school, usually at 14 years of age. This is particularly true of industry where boys and girls who cannot pursue higher education enter it at the age of 14.  The Minister will agree that it would be unfair to deny them four years work in industry before they could qualify, at 18 years, for redundancy pay benefits.  When a recession occurs and when dismissals are pending, <Col N="1283" /> it invariably happens&mdash;and trade unionists take care of this&mdash;that the rule of seniority applies.  Last in, first out is a dictum which is rather sacred to many of us in the trade union movement. There will be a large group of young people, therefore, in dire need of coverage under this Bill and who are being excluded if we stick rigidly to the age limit of 18.  A worker is obliged by law to be insured under the Social Welfare Acts at 16.  That being the case, he should be covered by this Bill.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I hope the Minister will realise the importance of this amendment. When redundancy occurs these younger people, who may be 18 years of age, and who are not now covered by this Bill, will have already given four years of their young lives to an industry and who, as the Minister said, will have a stake in that industry, and will have created a fundamental right to recognition for the part they played in building up that industry.  It will be through no fault of their own that they will become disemployed.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to amend the age from 18 to 16.  The age 16 is reasonable and just and we have the precedent for it under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary or desirable that anybody at 20 years of age should have redundancy payment.  I will go some of the way.  I would be willing to bring the age to 16 for benefit purposes but not to benefit before the age 22.  This would mean that the man would get the benefit of the two years extra service if he is redundant after 22.</P>

      <P>That is obviously unfair.  If a married man of 20 who has four years is declared redundant it is no comfort to him to be told: &ldquo;It is a pity you were not born two years earlier&rdquo;.  There is no point in starting at 16 and making the benefits payable at 22.  It amounts to the same thing.</P>

      <P>How many of Rawsons employees were only 20 years of age with family commitments? There is no point in saying: &ldquo;You are not old enough to get it&rdquo; if they have family commitments and are out of a job after four years.  The Minister should go the whole hog and say: &ldquo;All right, they would be entitled to benefit&rdquo;. I would understand his idea better if there was not this problem of so many people aged 20 years and upwards who have family commitments.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the whole point in the Redundancy Payments Bill is to help workers to rehabilitate themselves over periods when they are laid off from what to them was a permanent job?  Is that not the whole basis of it? If somebody starts working, perhaps, under the age of 16 years, and stamps insurance cards from 16 on and becomes redundant at 20, if he has family commitments, is he not as much entitled to get some sort of assistance as people who are a year or two years older?  Natural justice enters into it.</P>
