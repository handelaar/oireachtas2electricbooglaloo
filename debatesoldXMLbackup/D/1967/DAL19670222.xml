      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any information has yet been received by the Government on the probable results of the latest British initiative in regard to entry to the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated by the British Prime Minister in Parliament on the 10th November, the purpose of the discussions which he and the Foreign Secretary are having with the Governments of the Member countries is &ldquo;to see whether the conditions exist &mdash;or do not exist&mdash;for fruitful negotiations and the basis on which such negotiations could take place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Whether or not the British application will be revived will no doubt depend on the British Government's assessment of the situation following the conclusion of Mr. Wilson's series of visits to the capitals of the Six.  As already announced, I expect to have a further meeting with Mr. Wilson about that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to what appears to be the lack of results from the British initiative, is it now the Minister's opinion that the application of this country will be delayed, that the question of our entry is postponed at this period of time?  Is this the Taoiseach's opinion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy bases his supplementary question on a premise <Col N="1580" /> on which I do not think he is entitled to base it.  I do not know whether these talks have been a success or not, but that is for the British Government to determine in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of days lost through industrial disputes in all sectors of the economy is estimated at 808 days per 1,000 of total employees in 1964 and 811 in 1965.  The corresponding preliminary estimate for 1966 is 1,150 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the figure he now furnishes provides us with the doubtful distinction of the triple crown of heading all countries in Europe for days lost in industrial disputes per thousand of the employed population, according to the International Labour Office Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for 1966 are preliminary estimates.  When we have the complete figures for the other countries, I hope to be able to give the answer with regard to the triple crown.</P>

The statement does not refer to nurses nor to nursing students in general but refers only to one category of entrants into training, namely, those condidates who achieved the minimum pass marks at the entrance examination.</P>

      <P>The pay of a temporary full-time postman ranges from £7 8s. 3d a week, at 18 years of age, to £12 11s. 3d a week at a small office, and from £7 13s. 11d at 18 years of age, to £13 0s. 9d a week at the largest office.  Normally the rates of pay would substantially exceed unemployment benefit payable.</P>
      <P>Part-time (auxiliary) postmen are paid at hourly rates and their total earnings are therefore related to the actual hours worked.  In individual cases, the wages payable for a part-time post may, therefore, be less than the unemployment benefit to which a married man with several dependants might be entitled.</P>

      <P>I have seen a press report in this matter and I have also had a report from a livestock and a veterinary officer of my Department who visited Italy towards the end of January and saw the cattle which had been purchased here, including those purchased by the particular importer referred to in the press report.  The Departmental officers' report indicated that the Irish cattle generally were progressing satisfactorily.  In the case of the particular lot referred to in the press report, the officers stated that the animals were not in bad condition in relation to the ration they were getting, that there was no evidence of external parasites but that there was some evidence of possible fluke infestation. The cattle in question were selected in this country by the Italian purchaser as the type which he considered commercially most suitable for his requirements.  I understand that this particular importer, unlike other Italian importers, did not arrange to have <Col N="1598" /> the cattle treated for fluke.  I should add that all future shipments of such cattle to Italy will be treated for fluke.</P>

      <P>In a recent case at Bailieboro court regarding an unlicensed bull the defendant did not appear and was not represented.  As my Department was not informed in advance that the case would not be <Col N="1601" /> defended, the inspector's attendance was necessary.

      <P>Could the Minister say if a helicopter was used by the inspector to come back, because otherwise I do not see any way in which he could have incurred £14 expenses?

It is premature as yet to indicate the routes being considered or to indicate an exact date for their coming into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking in a general way at the problems presented by increasing traffic in Dublin city, it is clear that in the short-term the most effective measures <Col N="1614" /> will result from the maximum use of modern traffic management techniques in order to get the optimum use from the existing street system; indeed such measures will always play a significant part in dealing with the traffic problems of a city like Dublin. A number of interests are involved in the preparation and operation of traffic management measures and to ensure co-ordination a standing committee representing these interests keeps all proposals to improve traffic flow in the city under constant review.  Proposals being implemented or considered include, in addition to the extension of the clearway system to all radial routes, extensions and modifications of oneway street systems, the provision of integrated systems of traffic signals in the central city area, the provision of further off-street parking facilities, and the introduction of new forms of parking control.</P>
    <P>A long-term solution, based on the provision of a modern, efficient street network, must largely await the completion and consideration of studies at present on hands and the settlement by the corporation of their planning objectives in their development plan. In the meantime a limited number of useful street reconstructions and improvements are in hands or planned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last Thursday, I was referring to the situation which faces the Minister for Labour when there are throughout the country, in rural areas and country towns, large numbers on the labour exchanges who are, and have been, seeking work for quite a long time.  I asked the Minister to let the House know what plans or proposals he has to deal with this situation. <Col N="1647" /> I mentioned that this was an increasing number so far as rural areas were concerned.  In larger centres of population and industry, complaints are always made in respect of a matter such as this.  I cannot understand how it is that there is this disparity between the country towns which have industry and those which have not.  This situation has been highlighted at the present time&mdash; indeed, even to-day&mdash;in the agricultural sector because an increasing number of people are seeking work other than in agriculture which is not able to maintain them.  This is a problem which the Minister must tackle.  We see it against the background of the larger industrial areas but it is becoming more apparent that it is a much larger problem than that.</P>
      <P>In the past day or two, the Minister for Transport and Power spoke of the conditions which he feels will create a problem for the national transport company.  The attempt to palm off responsibility on either one or other section for a matter such as this is simply not facing up to reality.  It must be recognised that the situation which is developing in the country does not stem merely from present conditions but has a background in Government action deliberately taken a couple of years ago in the political situation then existing.  There is not much use in saying that this is the responsibility of labour or of management.  The Government must bear some responsibility in this matter.  When making statements in regard to the economy, Ministers should have regard to what happened in the recent past which was a contributing factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister intends to bring a scheme before the Dáil in regard to redundancy payments.  I understand that negotiations have been taking place but have not reached the stage of agreement, not to speak of finality. Does the Minister intend, in the intervening period, to make the legislation retrospective in regard to people who will lose employment between now and then?  This will certainly agitate the minds of people particularly if there is any basis for the suggestion <Col N="1648" /> that there is a danger, through force of economic circumstances in industry or agriculture or in relation to our entry into the EEC, that employment may be lost.</P>
    <P>The placement service seems to apply to people who are drawing unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  There is great need for an extension of the placement service.  It is perhaps more necessary outside the larger centres of population.  In the larger centres of population, the larger industries are located.  There is an industrial estate in Dublin and at Shannon.  It is proposed to have an industrial estate in Waterford and Galway, and possibly one at Limerick also, but on that I am not quite clear. Apart from those areas, there are people in the country who have failed to find employment and there will be an increasing number of young people coming forward from the schools so that the necessity for an effective placement service will be very great.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Minister hopes to achieve through the services of an industrial psychologist?  Perhaps he can tell us whether the employment exchanges are listing the skills of people registered there and what this registration shows.  Has he any idea, as a result of information from these exchanges on the skills of those registering, of the magnitude of the problem to be faced?  Would it be possible, in the rural parts, to use the talents and capabilities of the people there?  Deputy M. O'Leary referred to an industry and mentioned that the workers there had acquired a skill and that, with the turn of events, these people will suffer hardship or perhaps even dispersal from where they now live.  Perhaps the Minister would avail of the services of the IDA and other Government agencies in this connection, bearing in mind, in particular, the idea of locating small industry, based on the native products of the place, in country towns or areas contiguous to them.  It might be possible to imitate the example of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann who proposed the setting up of industries in various parts of the country to deal with the processing of fruits and vegetables.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> We seem to be quite prepared to make grants available to non-nationals for the establishment of industry within the country but unwilling to give grants to nationals for the promotion of industry here.  We should contemplate the issue of industrial grants to nationals who are prepared to set up the smaller type of industry in rural parts which may provide the answer to some of our problems.</P>
    <P>When one talks of employment and unemployment, one generally thinks in terms of the figures on the unemployment register each week.  The important thing to remember is that for any small community in the country the fact that there are nine or ten wage earners there means quite a bit to the economy of the area.  I was glad to hear Deputy Andrews saying last week that the important thing at the present time for the persons concerned is security of employment.  If a person can be sure that his employment will continue and that he will not find himself faced with a week's notice, that means a great deal at local level and eventually at national level. That is one feature that should be stressed when the Minister is speaking to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, I suppose will have responsibility in regard to the question of smaller industries.  The provision of secure employment should be stressed as a measure of alleviation for those seeking employment in the smaller towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The situation has been aggravated, as the statistics show, by the fact that the building industry, particularly in rural areas, in regard to local authority housing, and so on, has slumped and a number of persons who used to obtain employment on that kind of work now find themselves seeking such work in vain.  This is a matter over which they have no control.  The answer would seem to be the location of more industry, even of the smaller type, in these areas and it would be well worth while making the effort.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Minister's statement dealt with contemplated legislation.  I regret that the Minister found himself in the position that he had to give warning of a type of <Col N="1650" /> legislation which he might find himself having to bring before the House for enactment.  I said here on the last occasion the Estimate was being discussed that we can never legislate for industrial harmony.  No matter how much we may discuss the matter here, the fact remains that we will never be able to do that.  To take the old phrase and tear it about a bit: you may take the horse to the water but you cannot make him drink; it is not much use taking the horse to the water and sticking his head in it because in that case all you will do is to drown him.</P>
    <P>We must accept the fact that the workingman has got to where he is today either by the use or the threatened use of the strike weapon.  Inevitably he will continue to use strike action as his most potent weapon.  It is right that management and unions should haggle over wages or the establishment of industry or the conditions that will apply.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  That such haggling should occur at intervals is a healthy sign.  It is not right that the haggling should result in the necessity for strike action.  On the last occasion I suggested that if we could arrive at a situation where there was arbitration and both sides, before going to arbitration, would enunicate their differences and lay down maximum concessions and minimum demands, it would be possible to reach the situation, perhaps, where a sitting of the Labour Court would resolve the differences.</P>
    <P>I was rather alarmed on reading Deputy M. O'Leary's contribution last week by the suggestion that where the Labour Court had arrived at a conclusion and issued a recommendation, that would be regarded more or less as a jumping-off point for subsequent negotiations as a result of which a solution would be arrived at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested that this was a possibility at the present time; I did not suggest that I approved of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that because in the type of Labour Court envisaged at the present time and which will be established, I hope, as a result <Col N="1651" /> of discussions between both sides, we ought to have acceptance of the fact that when both sides attend at the court and declare their views there, there would be a very reasonable chance that in a very high proportion of cases we would have a solution at that stage.  If minimum demands and maximum concessions were stipulated beforehand, each side would think deeply before registering disagreement.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made also to the fact that there is to be some provision in regard to trade union law brought before the House.  This, again, is the subject of discussion at the present time as between unions and the Minister. I am sure that in this case, as with any body which purports to speak for any organised body of opinion, there would be a discipline in these matters and that the unions would find themselves in the position of being able to get this type of discipline from their members.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned here in regard, for instance, to Córas Iompair Éireann, that there is difficulty on account of there being a complexity of views within the industry.  I do not think that is altogether valid.  It was suggested that in Córas Iompair Éireann there are 33 or 35 unions.  That, I think, is an over-statement and a generalisation which would create a wrong impression in regard to the situation there.  One thing that would strike one is that if there is a small number of workers within a large community of workers in an industry who feel that their conditions of employment or rates of pay are not satisfactory and feel so aggrieved that they believe they should take strike action, I would respectfully suggest that pending a decision at arbitration the union executive should consult its members in the industry and where the majority decide that they do not wish at that stage to cease work, the union should restrain or ask for restraint from the section within the industry so as to prevent the disemployment of the larger number.  If that could be done by the union executive, work would continue until such time as a decision has been given in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear. Is the Deputy suggesting that unions do not ask members whether they will strike or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I am suggesting is that where the majority of the members working in an industry feel there should not be a stoppage of work, their views ought to be respected by the smaller number and there ought not to be a stoppage until the issue has been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with a situation in which there is another union catering for a smaller number of employees in the same job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It may seem as if I am speaking against the interests of the unions in the matter.  However, everybody recognises that the unions are a powerful force and that they can and do use their influence for the public good.  It can also be to their own good to use their influence.  They certainly are able to put the case for their members and it is desirable that, having this power, they should use it responsibly.</P>
      <P>Something that is equally true&mdash;and this applies to management&mdash;is that younger management who seek better relationships with their opposite numbers, labour, find themselves coming up against the old guard within industry, people who over the years have felt they have got to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; at all stages, whereas the younger management are prepared to sit down and reason these matters.  This is something which from the employers' side should certainly be examined critically.  Younger management, if they are to meet this constantly entrenched attitude, will certainly feel frustrated in their attempts to have greater harmony in industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not going to be easy to achieve harmony.  It will take long years to overcome this inheritance which has come down on both sides of industry, neither side wishing to meet the other side.  The situation is like a delicately poised see-saw and the slightest thing can set the movement off again.  I should certainly like management, particularly <Col N="1653" /> younger management, to have a freer hand in negotiating with their opposite numbers in the trade unions.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the drawing up of management-labour agreements.  It is a complex business involving many aspects.  There are the matters of basic wages, shift allowances, overtime rates, specification of duties and so on.  Very often when an agreement is made something arises which was not envisaged.  If it favours the workers, naturally they will not object, but if it does not favour them, they will want the agreement repealed. Therefore agreements ought to be revised continually to keep pace with changing techniques in factories, changing techniques in processing, changing techniques in industrial output itself.  These are matters which would constantly need to be dealt with by agreement between labour and management.  However tedious it may be, all the aspects, conditions of work and so on should be clearly defined, and any alteration that has to be made should lead clearly from the previous agreement.  Quite a lot of time is lost by management and unions in debating the interpretation of agreements.  That is what happened in connection with the last National Wage Agreement, on the interpretation of which there was not unanimity.  This created a big problem for the unions and the employers.</P>
    <P>In making these agreements, demarcation lines should not be left hazy. Two opposing points of view in regard to some basic facts often pose an insoluble problem.  Whatever can be said for an agreement on a national basis, there is quite an amount of advantage to be gained from an agreement which caters even for a small industry.  You cannot impose the same type of conditions, wages, overtime rates or anything else, on varying industries. It should be possible for labour and management to evolve, say, one hundred points to be covered in an agreement and then within that framework, specify conditions for a particular industry, no matter how small. This would be a charter for both sides, clearly written and incapable of misinterpretation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> There is the problem of the older industries which will face the kind of competition which the 1970s hold for them.  They will have to modernise, even though they, perhaps, can legitimately say that the only way they can achieve modernisation is by the reduction of labour personnel.  This is something on which labour will not agree, of course, and I think it would be a mistake for management to think they could get agreement to such action.  There would have to be talks which are a necessary corollary to any proposal to change the industrial pattern in an industry which would lead to redundancy.</P>
    <P>On the question of redundancy and retraining, it would be helpful if the unions and management sat down together and if management would not alone invite the comment of the union representatives but would seek their co-operation in putting forward schemes, and perhaps the unions might even contribute to retraining schemes which were being devised to help members in a particular industry.  One of the factors which is there, and perhaps is not often admitted, is that labour feel that if they do not ask for it, then they will get nothing.  Management, on its side, is inclined to say: &ldquo;Don't give the so-and-so's anything; it is soon enough they will look for it&rdquo;.  As long as this attitude lasts, we will not get the type of relationships for which the Minister is hoping.</P>
    <P>Labour is in a position to demand its rights and it does not fail to do so. That is most laudable but, in doing so, labour must understand that such an approach will not have all the sympathy of management.  On the other side, there was a time when management gave concessions without demand, concessions such as pension rights and Christmas presents, but, under the new regime, management feel that they should not give these concessions any more, that such concessions should go and go for all time.</P>
    <P>The agreement in depth which I have mentioned could be a solution of these matters but one of the things felt by management about such agreements <Col N="1655" /> in depth is that the unions may take advantage of some point in them, a point that a particular industry may not be prepared to concede.  These agreements should be written to suit the particular industry at the very start, a specific agreement for a specific industry, and then they would not be capable of the interpretation of which management complain.</P>
    <P>In this regard, if things are bad with a particular industry, the workers are entitled to know it, to know the exact situation.  Their co-operation and assistance should be invited for the improvement of the industry or they should be consulted as to the steps that might have to be taken to prevent the liquidation of such an industry. Management, in such cases, should be entitled to put their problems to the unions and get from them this co-operation.  This equally imposes on management the obligation to ensure that when things are good with the industry, the people who work in it are told how good things are, what the outlook is and are also entitled to share in the enlarged cake produced by their efforts.</P>
    <P>If we are to make progress in this matter, there must be honesty and sincerity on both sides.  There must be the realisation that each is partner in a livelihood: on the one side, those who provide the capital and manage it and, on the other, those who by their skill and toil produce the greater wealth.  They are partners, immutably wed, and if we get that approach from both sides, things would improve.</P>
    <P>One of the things that strikes me in this regard has to do with a small industry of which I know where there has never been any trouble and where the most harmonious relations exist. From the very beginning, there has been give and take within that industry and there has been this form of consultation I have suggested.  As things improve with the industry, there has been the conferring of benefits on the workers, a sharing of profitability.  Productivity has been increased by the use of production bonuses and a certain amount of the firm's profits have been used to provide <Col N="1656" /> for the workers a share of the increased wealth.</P>
    <P>The welfare of workers in industry should be the concern of management. It should not be left as the task of labour representatives.  Management must regard their labour personnel as part of the assets of their industry and they should realise that if these assets are not cared for properly, the return will not be as good as they might hope for.  In the small industry I have mentioned, I have never yet heard of a strike.  They operate on the principle that if there is some transgression by a worker, if there is a transgression of the safety regulations or if there is culpable negligence, a man is not dismissed. He is suspended from work and his suspension is measured according to the transgression.  I recall an occasion on which such negligence led to a loss of property.  It was accepted by both sides that the man responsible should be retained at work, having lost his seniority, and that portion of his wages should be used to make good the damage caused by his negligence.</P>
    <P>The Minister should avoid inaugurating industrial relations in this country on the basis of industrial relations as they exist in Britain or other places where you have had a large industrial process for a long time. If we attempt to deal with the matter in that fashion, we will not have the success for which we hope.  We have had cleavages in industry in Britain, cleavages which have been deepset for many years.  The legislation there is based on that experience but we should try to approach the matter from our own point of view, approach it from the point of view of two sides which should be working in harmony, each with an interest in the industry.</P>
    <P>The directors recognise that their capital earns its profits through the efforts of the workers.  Now, in many cases, management is still constituted of employees of the directors.  The success which comes to industry comes through the capital invested really in the activities of the workers. The workers should recognise that their livelihood depends on profitable production, the production of goods that can be sold.  There is not much <Col N="1657" /> use producing goods if they cannot be sold, if, in other words, they are not able to complete with goods manufactured elsewhere.  We shall be faced with that situation when the agreement with Britain comes fully into operation and when we enter Common Market conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have an onerous task, one which is not confined merely to this labour problem.  The Department reaches out much further than that to industry and commerce, to the location of industry, and even to the Ministry of Finance because the State must provide assistance to enable the schemes the Minister is devising to work and provide solutions, solutions desired by both management and the unions. For that reason, the Minister would be well advised not to allow himself to be pushed too far forward from the original idea of labour-management relations.  We cannot legislate for harmony in industry.  Guide lines, however, can be laid down.  Solutions can be put forward for acceptance. We will never reach a stage at which it will be possible to pass a law to do this or that in order to solve labour problems.  Basically, the inalienable right of the worker to refuse his labour will still remain.  We sincerely hope the Minister and his Department will provide a leaven as between both sides in order to work good for both. Again, we hope the Minister will act as a buffer in situations in which head-on clashes should be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Department was set up quite recently, and we welcomed its setting up to deal with the many problems confronting workers and, in particular, to anticipate and cater for the needs of the workers in relation to the problems they may face in the immediate future because of our pending entry into the Common Market. We have been somewhat disappointed at this early stage by the Minister's vicious attack in the House last week when introducing his Estimate on one section of the community.  I shall say more about that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak first about some of the areas in which the Minister could help to engender greater harmony in <Col N="1658" /> industry.  The Minister will have responsibility for many areas&mdash;factory inspectors, unemployment services, training and retraining, redundancy payments, the training of skilled workers, technological changes.  I want to comment on some of these and on the approach the Minister might have in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about factory inspectors.  He said he intended to increase the number from 22 to 28.  I am not satisfied that 28 is an adequate number but, even if it were, the way in which inspectors carry out their functions does not tend to inspire confidence in the workers or encourage the workers to set up factory safety committees, to which the Minister also referred: he mentioned that the number of safety committees had increased quite substantially.  I can assure the Minister that, if the inspectors were carrying out their functions in a different way, the increase in the number of safety committees would be more substantial still.</P>
    <P>I have had many complaints from workers.  The system is that the inspector arrives at a factory and contacts management.  Management deputes some other member of management to escort the inspector around the factory, to guide him through the parts of the factory he wants to see.  In the factory there may be a group of workers who have gone to the trouble of establishing a safety committee and appointing a safety delegate.  This man, the representative of the workers, is completely ignored. I am sure the Minister will admit this is not very encouraging.</P>
    <P>After the inspection the inspector departs and is not seen any more by the workers.  Nothing more is heard of him.  He may present a report to the Minister's Department, or to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and some improvements may be carried out as a result of his inspection, but as far as the workers are concerned, all that has happened is that this man has had a chat with management and has gone about his business.  Surely if a safety committee is operating and a delegate <Col N="1659" /> has been appointed by the workers, the inspector should at least consult with him?  I can assure the House that no one is in a better position to show the inspector where safety regulations are not being observed than the safety committee delegate.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcomes the transfer of the employment exchanges from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Labour.  This is a very desirable and necessary step and at least it is taking the initial step of getting away from the concept that a man who is on the dole is on charity and has some sort of social stigma attached to him because he is unemployed. I do not know whether the Minister has ever been unemployed or has had the experience of going either to Gardiner Street or Werburgh Street in Dublin, standing in a queue, walking up to a hatch clerk signing his name and walking away again. When a man is walking away, he is overcome by a horrible depression, with the feeling that he is useless, that there is something wrong with him because he is not working.  There is an atmosphere about the labour exchange which defies expression; I could not possibly put into words the effect unemployment over a long period has on a man who has to go down to the labour exchange and sign on for three days a week, in the knowledge that there is no prospect in the immediate future of his being usefully or gainfully employed in his own country.  It is bad enough to have to face that reality without having to face it in the bleak and miserable atmosphere of the present unemployment exchanges.  The Minister has given verbal indication that he is aware of this and that he intends to try to create not only a better atmosphere but a better service.</P>
    <P>This is very desirable because the concept of an unemployment service should not be one in which a man goes down to sign his name and be told that there is nothing there today or that there is a job in such a place.  That is not sufficient for an employment service. Such a service can fulfil a very useful and necessary function, particularly today when we face the prospect <Col N="1660" /> of changes by our entry into the Common Market.  Even if that were not the case, it should be a place to which not only those who are unemployed can go to register but where people can seek advice regarding the type of employment in which they are.  They may find that they are not suitable for that employment, that it does not suit their temperament, or they may feel frustrated in so far as the type of employment in which they are is a dead end. The service which should be provided is one that will ensure, as far as humanly possible, that round pegs are in round holes and square pegs are in square holes.</P>
    <P>Training, retraining, redundancy payments and replacement schemes are also included in the Minister's Department, but to my mind, these are just new ways of describing unemployment. It is necessary for us to realise how rapidly things are changing and to have the sense of urgency that is needed in order to meet many of the problems which will face workers in the immediate future.  It should be common knowledge at this stage that the day of the unskilled worker is rapidly coming to an end and that a man, if he hopes to continue in employment in the years ahead, must have some skill.  It is the duty and responsibility of the Department of Labour to ensure that people who will be displaced through the policy being pursued by the Government in regard to the Common Market will be given every opportunity to acquire the necessary skills.  Not only unskilled workers but skilled workers also should be given the opportunity of acquiring the technological knowledge and skill which will be needed in the changes that will occur in industry.</P>
    <P>Vocational guidance and career guidance are also included in the work of the Minister's Department and in regard to vocational guidance, the Department are preparing 100 leaflets for distribution.  That is a very laudable thing but a lot more is needed. It is not just sufficient to rattle off 100 leaflets, distribute them and decide that we have discharged this aspect of our responsibility.  Parents of children who are about to leave school are <Col N="1661" /> extremely worried about this matter. Parents of boys of 14, 15 or 16 years of age are faced with the great uncertainty of today in regard to the effects of our pending entry into the Common Market and they are looking around desperately for a solution in regard to what their children should do, what occupation should they encourage them to pursue and, more important, what occupation they are suitable for and which will suit their talents.  This is a service which should be provided in an adequate way by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>These are just a few comments on some of the fields covered by this new Department, but I think the most controversial of all is the field of industrial relations.  That field is not being left entirely to the Minister so far as his colleagues are concerned.  At every dinner or supper to which Fianna Fáil Ministers are invited, they take advantage of it to hammer at one section of the community.  The Minister has a very important role to play in industrial relations.  It is not only the one of being critical of either side, but also the role of giving the lead&mdash;and, heaven knows, there is plenty of room for improvement in the Government service so far as wages and conditions of employment are concerned.  I think it would be fair to say that some of the worst paid workers and some of the worst conditions of employment are to be found within the Government service. Question No. 23 on today's Order Paper concerned an auxiliary postman. From the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary, it emerged that this man would have had more money if he were unemployed than when he was being paid by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That alone is sufficient comment on the conditions prevailing within the Government service.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister if he regarded it as his duty to give a lead, as an employer, in such things as sickness payment for the lower paid workers and pensions.  The Minister said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He did not feel it was his duty to give such a lead.  I might be prepared to accept that, but surely it is not too much to expect that the <Col N="1662" /> Government, in their treatment of their own employees, would at least match what has been granted to workers in the better employments outside?  Surely it is not too much to expect that such categories as road workers and auxiliary postmen would have sickness payment and pension rights?

      <P>I entirely agree with those sentiments, but, as the Minister probably knows, I meet workers in the course of my trade union work who want to formulate claims, possibly for three weeks holidays or for some adjustment in wages.  The Minister could help me by answering the following questions.  When I quote for those workers what I have just read from the Minister's speech and tell them that, as they probably read in the papers the Minister has warned them that if they persist in seeking any improvement in their conditions, he will recommend the introduction of legislation to suspend the system of free collective bargaining, what will the Minister say if one of the members replies: &ldquo;That is fine and grand but tell us what has the Minister to say about prices?  We are supposed to have price control but it has recently come to light that prices have been increased and the fact has not been made public. Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible, issue a list telling us what prices have increased? Will you also tell us what steps the Minister is taking to restrain people who are speculating?&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is concerned about industrial relations: so am I, but if he thinks the ordinary workers are fools, that they cannot read or reason or think, he is making a big mistake. They want to know what happened when they restrained themselves and agreed to the National Wage Agreement which gave them 12 per cent. Were they not the only section to restrain themselves and accept an increase of 20/- last May when very many of them&mdash;the Minister knows this&mdash;could have, by their industrial strength, secured far more than 20/-? The section of the community the Minister is threatening with legislation <Col N="1666" /> to stop them from exercising their democratic rights is the only section to have shown in a practical way that they are prepared to discharge their responsibilities to the nation.  If the Minister wants co-operation from the trade union movement and individual workers, let the Minister and the Government tell us what restrictions will be placed on the gangsters speculating in land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we cannot continue asking one section to restrain themselves?  When the Minister and the Government give satisfactory answers to these questions I have asked, I have no doubt the workers will be only too glad to co-operate in the matter of restraint.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that the Minister, when approaching this question of industrial relations, which is a very delicate and complex one, would tread carefully.  Everybody appreciates that, as the Press said at the time, the Minister got the &ldquo;hot seat.&rdquo;  That was true.  The Minister took over a Ministry against a background that could not mean he would be overjoyed about his position.  We had a certain amount, even a good deal, of hope that he would be able to inject a little sense and reason into the situation but his actions last week were, to say the least, most inadvisable.  He had a working party still meeting, as far as I know, comprising members of Congress, the FUE and, I think, officials of his Department, trying to find areas of agreement for pending legislation and, out of the blue, the Minister, speaking on the first real Estimate for his Department, completely ignores the fact that these people were making a <i>bona fide</i> effort to find acceptable legislation, or proposals for legislation, and he lashes out once again at the workers and threatens them, as he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister was very well advised in what he did.  If the Minister thinks he can legislate against <Col N="1667" /> strikes or can enforce settlements, he is far more foolish that I ever through he was.  This business of industrial relations is very difficult.  We see people like Deputy Booth getting up and saying: &ldquo;Sure, we are all together, boys; we all have this common aim.&rdquo;</P>

This business of going around and saying there is no conflict is a mistake.  There is a conflict.  We have to recognise the fact that there is a conflict.  We have to try to minimise the results of any clash of interests between workers and management.  To judge by the way the Minister behaved last week, I do not think he has done a lot towards minimising that clash of interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Together with my trade union colleagues on this side of the House, I want to recall that quite a number of factors were mentioned in the Minister's speech which indicate a very comprehensive range of thinking over a very wide range of problems. As in the past, the various Conditions of Employment Acts, Holidays Acts, Industrial Relations Acts, Apprenticeship Acts, and all the other Acts that brought benefit to the workers, are now being examined together with the training and retraining schemes which the Government think it necessary and desirable to introduce. <Col N="1669" /> The redundancy scheme, the resettlement scheme, the placement facilities, the careers information service and the research work are matters of great importance in addition to the great range of problems considered and dealt with in the past by Fianna Fáil Governments and Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Department of Labour is the Government's expression in concrete terms of their desire to meet this new situation.  As reported in the Official Report of Thursday, 16th February, 1967, Volume 226, the Minister for Labour said:</P>
      <P>It is clear that the country's first economic priority must be to raise production and increase employment. As our goods must sell, at home and abroad, with the products of other countries, they must be fully competitive.  If this is not achieved, we face the certainty of loss of production and loss of employment.</P>
      <P>This clearly shows the comprehensive thinking&mdash;not one-sided thinking&mdash;of the Government in relation to loss of employment and loss of production. Loss of production can be brought about by many factors with a consequential loss of employment.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>Attempts to generate a higher level of production and employment, or even to retain the existing level, will be frustrated if we have to suffer the interruptions of strikes like those of the past few years.  Stoppages because of strikes are also a deterrent to investment in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was explained by many speakers, the stoppages and strikes that have taken place have been a deterrent to investment in Ireland and have retarded the development of our country.  Surely, in this day and age, it should not be beyond the capacity of the trade union organisations and the employers to get together and to evolve some system whereby a settlement might be reached today and not tomorrow; it has to be reached at some stage.  We have this hazy thinking of the survival of the fittest and that somebody will emerge after the conflict&mdash;some prophet, whether it be the management or the <Col N="1670" /> worker&mdash;without giving comprehensive examination to the problem.  Without a positive and constructive approach by management and labour, I am quite sure that the desires and the anxiety of the Government in the creation of further employment will suffer and the worker and the employer will receive no substantial incentive either to increase production or to go ahead.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>Resumption of the programmed rate of economic growth will be seriously retarded if money incomes race ahead of economic growth, as took place in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy in 1966.</P>
    <P>This was explained by the Minister and it has been misquoted on many occasions in this House.  In the tensions and uncertainties of conditions in the modern world we can no longer afford to continue as we have been doing if we are to preserve the best of what is common cause.  Our common interest requires that we make common cause.  The establishment of the Department of Labour is the expression of the desire of the Government to do this.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems is the establishment of sound industrial relations. In the past 12 months or so we have seen how bad industrial relations can really be.  Each section concerned has endeavoured to shift responsibility to the other but no section has accepted blame.  In any event, blame-placing can be no solution to the problem.  During this period of rapid technical change, if our industrial relations are not the best, whom are we to blame?  Are we to blame the Government or the worker or the trade unionist or the employer?</P>

      <P>The workers who are interested in their crafts and callings and who care to contribute to the national wealth and to industrial harmony and efficiency can remove many of the obstacles at ground floor level. It is desirable that the workers should play their part.  Sometimes they are confused by the confused thinking of some of their own trade union leaders. The workers themselves on many occasions have taken it upon themselves to adjust situations within their own industry and to bring about a level of understanding.  For instance, there are the collective agreements that we hear so much about these days.  There is no doubt that in the case of the agreements in Aer Lingus and elsewhere some of the matters were repudiated by the trade union leaders and eventually, by the constructive desire of the workers to bring about harmony in their places of employment, agreement was reached.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus and Roadstone are not the only places where harmony exists. There are other sections where agreements covering two or three year periods have been in existence for quite a number of years.  It is desirable that this development should continue and be allowed to continue.  The type of agreement that has been formulated for a large number of workers should be extended to other workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions have an important part to play.  I feel that the trade union movement as such has lost out.  The trade union movement has not adjusted itself to present-day conditions.  To <Col N="1672" /> some extent it is still living in the twenties.  The system of operation is still that of the 1920s.  Today it has a more complex and more involved role to play in communicating to its members.  Many members of trade unions are not aware of the problems that exist at a given time or of discussions that may be taking place.  They are not fully informed.  Each union member must have a complete understanding of the economic situation in which he and his union and the nation move.  Such understanding does not exist.  Apart from the ordinary worker, the trade union can play a very important role in this connection.</P>
    <P>Management has its part to play and must adjust to the new situation.  In some cases management has adjusted itself.  Managements have accepted the necessary aids and financial incentives to equip industries to meet the new situation.  If each side plays its part, we can arrive at a situation where there will be harmony in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Conflict and suspicion have been injected into the debate by some of the speakers.  The Minister has been misquoted. I followed some of the quotations that were made and they did not tally with what the Minister had said. We cannot allow the situation to deteriorate further due to lack of ideas or lack of plans or programming.  We must get together at this stage and hammer out some sort of solution.</P>

      <P>typically, has tried to inject an air of suspicion into the discussion.  I, and all of us, believe that free collective bargaining should remain the cornerstone of our industrial relations.  The opportunity for labour and management to work out their problems and arrive at voluntary agreements is something we all favour.  Collective bargaining should also constitute procedure whereby terms and conditions</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of free collective bargaining has been raised by Deputy Cluskey.  Deputy Cluskey, of employment would be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> There are many factors other than wage rates that cause industrial unrest. It would appear from some of the speakers from the Labour Party that the only factor is the question of adjustment of wages.  There is a substantial number of factors which bring unrest and which cause economic loss or loss of production or loss of employment. I would appeal to the members of the Labour Party who claim to represent the trade union movement to examine this situation in a realistic manner in relation to the long-term provisions made by the Minister for the purpose of stabilising or increasing production and thereby increasing the number of jobs available. This is of the utmost importance.  It is important to us all that jobs become available so that we may arrive at the period of full employment that we all strive for and hope to see.</P>
    <P>One of the matters mentioned in the Minister's speech was that of the factory inspectors.  I, too, feel there are deficiencies in this sector.  I know from experience the manner in which factory inspectors approach a factory. They are probably shown through one side of it by the employers, and machines that are dangerous are generally not operating when the factory inspector is passing through. I have had experience of working a machine which was dangerous and when the factory inspector approached, the machine was cut off so that nobody could work it.  When the inspector inquires about such a machine, he is told it is not being operated.</P>
    <P>The Minister might recognise in this regard that there are defects and they are not all on the one side.  There are employers who are reluctant to meet safety requirements.  The factory inspectors should ensure that the problems that exist are examined comprehensively. I know of one instance where an inspector had been visiting a factory for seven years, and in the seventh year, a major defect which had been in existence for the previous seven years was discovered, which showed that the previous inspections were of little significance.</P>
    <P>When we say that safety committees <Col N="1675" /> should be developed on a voluntary basis, I do not think that we are going to get the co-operation that is necessary and desirable.  Whether we like it or not, the ordinary individual in the workshop cannot go to the management and say: &ldquo;I am anxious that a safety committee should be set up&rdquo;.  He is told to go back to his shop steward or his trade union. Therefore, it devolves completely on the trade unions to ensure that safety committees are set up in all concerns. The worker himself has little communication with top management.</P>
    <P>Labour leaders themselves can do much to ensure that there is an extension of these safety committees by ensuring that the shop steward is fully informed and fully educated in regard to his Job.  The unions should take that to heart and thereby eliminate the distress that is generally caused to people who are well meaning but who do not happen to have a job that would give them that access to management.</P>
    <P>In connection with fringe benefits, the Minister said the Labour Court recommended that claims for service pay, reduced working hours and extra holidays should be deferred and that claims for other improvements should be left for discussion within each industry. That is a bit farcical because I have known cases where the employer will sit down and talk to workshop committees on the question of concessions; when he feels like it, he agrees to something but suggests that it is a concession and that he is under no obligation to continue it, and then later on he will withdraw it when he feels it is opportune for him to do so. Comprehensive working agreements with all sectors of industry are very necessary, and concessions as such should not be something that the employer can give and withdraw as he sees fit.  I wonder are they the other improvements that should be left for discussion within the industry.  If they are, I think it undesirable that agreement should be reached on this basis.</P>
    <P>It can be said that everybody&mdash; factory workers, civil servants, members of the Labour Party, all of us&mdash;<Col N="1676" /> wants more money.  However, it can only be got in certain ways, by collective effort on the part of the community. We must consider the consequences the acceptance of more money will have on the purse of the housewife, whether it will mean a reduction of her purchasing power. This is a matter which should get comprehensive and serious consideration before it is pursued to finality.</P>
    <P>There is no question that lower paid workers need an increase in pay.  Then there is the question of closing the gap between the skilled and the clerical grades about which we hear so much talk.  I am quite sure no member of the trade union movement will indicate he is prepared to see the gap closed between any particular sectors. It is a question of one chasing the other.  We must realise that higher education and adaptability to the mechanical field require higher skill and greater knowledge, and also require higher payment.  In any event I hope the lower paid workers will get a substantial increase, an increase which they deserve and need.  Other sections can wait, but the closing of the gap between certain sections is absolutely essential in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I trust now that the various sections of industry will get together and examine the problems before them and that there will not be this breakdown in negotiations we hear about from time to time.  Deputy Cluskey says the Minister should give a lead.  Every time the Minister gives a lead very few heed him.  They accept it as a lead to proceed to a higher rate or to reach a certain target.  I am quite sure that if the Labour Party, the unions and the employers were prepared to accept the Minister's lead, we would have industrial harmony, but at the moment the question of leads must be written off to a great degree.</P>
    <P>I believe there is enough intelligence among trade union leaders and officials to enable them to work out some type of agreement that will inspire workers with confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I indicated that we are in support of the principle of the motion that a Select Committee of the House be set up to examine the capital expenditure of State boards and companies and to consider their future capital programme. The motion has one or two defects in it.  There has been a growing tendency in recent years to think in terms of State boards and companies which have proved to be successful. That success should contribute to a reduction in the cost of the services supplied or to the general economic progress of the country, but the suggestion <Col N="1678" /> has been that they should be brought into private enterprise and the inducement to private enterprise is that these are operations from which financial benefits could be derived.</P>
      <P>There is an aspect of some of these State companies which requires examination and which is not referred to in the motion, an aspect which has been repeatedly and justifiably raised in this House, that is, the failure of some of them to deal with their staffs in a responsible way and to introduce into their structures adequate and efficient personnel.  The effect of that failure has resulted on a number of occasions in disputes, causing loss and serious inconvenience to, and, on one occasion, possible danger to the community as a whole.  Attempts have been made from time to time to ascribe breakdowns in industrial relations to the workers employed in these State bodies.  Yet, when a thorough examination has been made, it has been reveled that such breakdowns were because of prolonged vexation to which the workers had been exposed, because of the deliberate policy of negation in negotiations leading up to situations in which industrial disputes have taken place.  In these instances, the failure of those in authority has led to serious results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years attempts have been made in this House to obtain information regarding the operations of some of these State bodies.  On some occasions the Ministers concerned, and the Minister for Transport and Power in particular, have given long and prolonged explanations but on other occasions the reply has been that the Minister has no function in the matter. It would be interesting, in relation to an examination of State boards and companies, if some information could be obtained as to the basis on which appointments are made to positions of power in these companies.  We are presumed to be a democratic country, to go through the democratic processes. Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann are supposed to operate according to democratic principles but where some of these State companies are concerned, the process in operation is much closer to dictatorship.  These matters, while <Col N="1679" /> not referred to in the motion, are matters of some concern and would justify examination.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I mentioned that I did not support the general tenor of the remarks made by Deputy Donegan, following the moving of the motion by Deputy Sweetman on behalf of Fine Gael.  It appeared to me that the sense of some of his remarks was that there should be an attempt to limit, in the interests of private enterprise and in the interest of people concerned with the making of profits, the operation of these State companies which are providing a service to the community.  I referred to the fact that a number of these State companies have been established because private enterprise had failed to do its duty and to make its proper contribution to our economy. We should not think in terms of just an examination of these State companies but we should take steps to ensure that they continue to operate efficiently from the point of view of the community as a whole and that they take into account the rights, responsibilities, needs and problems of those in their employment.</P>
    <P>The main thing is to discover whether or not these State companies are providing a service that might be taken back now into the hands of private enterprise and run for purely profit motives: so spoke Deputy Donegan, if I heard him correctly.  I do not agree with Deputy Donegan.</P>
    <P>Where citizens feel they have been aggrieved by State bodies there should be some process to enable them to have their legitimate complaints and grievances rectified.  Up to the present that has proved almost impossible because of the nature of the machinery and because the Minister disclaims responsibility.  There is a need here.</P>
    <P>The motion suggests the committee should examine the extent to which proper and adequate liaison either exists or should exist between the public and these State bodies.  There is need for such an examination because, from time to time, there does appear to be a contradiction in policy and a contradiction in approach.</P>
    <P>The method of appointment and the <Col N="1680" /> powers of those appointed should be examined very carefully indeed.  Certain of these appointees seem to feel they have unlimited authority.  They do not subscribe to any accepted pattern or system.  The position of employees in some of these State bodies is not at all satisfactory and that is a matter that should be examined into by the suggested Select Committee.</P>
    <P>This House and the community in general owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to a number of these State bodies.  Some failings have been mentioned by me, and possibly by others, too, in the course of the debate and on other occasions, but, apart from a breakdown in industrial relations, which is to be deplored and which ought to be corrected, one can list a number of these State bodies which have proved most successful in advancing the general interests of the community.  I mention here Aer Lingus, the ESB and the Sugar Company. Many others have made a substantial contribution to development here. Some of these State bodies have made history.  However, no matter how excellent they may be, the day always comes when a situation calls for re-examination and re-assessment and the most efficient body may fail, for some reason or another, to move with the times.  The appointment of a Select Committee would permit of an examination of the various State bodies and might afford an opportunity for a mature assessment not only of the services rendered but of the desirability of extending these State companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to this debate so far because I was sincerely anxious to understand as clearly as I could what the proposers of this motion intended precisely and, indeed, what those who support the motion wish to achieve by doing so.  The first thing I want to point out is that this motion is framed in the widest possible terms and because it is so framed, it raises a host of questions which, to my mind at any rate, have not so far been answered by either the proposer or the seconder of the motion, or indeed by any of the Deputies who have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> The first question that poses itself to my mind in regard to the intention of the framers of the motion is whether or not they intend this Select Committee to be a once and for all operation.  It would seem, from reading the motion at first glance, that that was the idea, that this Select Committee would examine the situation and perhaps make recommendations for some other type of mechanism to be established&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;because as the motion is framed, the sheer wording of it, the Committee could also be a continuing Select Committee making reports of the widest possible nature, presumably to the Dáil and also to the general public.</P>
    <P>The motion also clearly envisages this Select Committee as being concerned with the State bodies in all their aspects.  First of all, it would require the Select Committee to examine the fundamental basis of their existence, their capitalisation and long term plans and also it would be concerned with their day-to-day operations. That is quite clear from the wording where among other things the motion indicates that the Select Committee would be concerned with the service which these State bodies give to the public.  Indeed, that was confirmed in the remarks of Deputy Dockrell apropos CIE.  As the motion stands, this Select Committee would be concerned with every single aspect of the State bodies, their organisation, their set up, their capitalisation, their future plans and their day-to-day operations.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest seriously to the House that that would be an impossible task for any Committee of this House to undertake.  Apart altogether from the impossibility of performing it, it would be totally undesirable that any Committee of this House should be given these far-reaching powers because they would almost certainly trespass to a very considerable extent on ministerial responsibility.  If we take firstly heading (a) &ldquo;to examine the capital expenditure of State Boards and Companies, and to consider the future capital programme and plans of such Boards and Companies&rdquo; that is <Col N="1682" /> clearly an executive responsibility&mdash;the future capitalisation of the State Companies and their future plans.  In undertaking that, the Select Committee would almost certainly find itself trespassing to a great extent in a province which is solely the responsibility of the appropriate Minister and the Government. I also find myself concerned very much about heading (b)  which suggests that the Select Committee would consider &ldquo;whether any changes are needed in the organisation of such bodies.&rdquo;  Again, this is a matter which goes to the fundamental basis of the existence of these organisations.  Their basic structure, and perhaps even the necessity for them, would apparently come within the ambit of this Committee. Again this is something which is strictly a Government and ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any great evidence that would indicate that a Select Committee should have the power set out under heading (c) &mdash;&ldquo;to consider whether there is proper and adequate liaison between such bodies and Government Departments, and private interests affected by their activity, and between the bodies themselves in matters of common interest.&rdquo; Surely in regard to the liaison between the bodies themselves this is clearly a matter for the Ministers responsible for the particular bodies to see to it that the Boards act in unison and in conformity with the broad principles of Government policy.  I suggest we have no evidence to suggest that they do not do so, nor indeed, have we any significant volume of evidence to suggest that they do not have proper regard to the private interests affected by their activities.</P>
    <P>In this House we very quickly hear of any case in which there is a suggestion that they do not do so.  Apart from these particular comments on heading (c)  I would like to mention that we have established a group which is looking into and examining the whole structure of our public services with a view to making recommendations and it is certain that that group will examine the relationship which exists between the State Companies and the appropriate Government Departments <Col N="1683" /> with which they are concerned. I am quite certain it will give consideration also to the relationship of State bodies with one another so that it would be unnecessary duplication if we were to give this similar type of function to this Select Committee, if we decided to establish it.  Under heading (d)  it is suggested that the Select Committee should examine &ldquo;whether the private citizen or other body obtains reasonable service from such semi-State bodies and in case of dissatisfaction has a reasonable means of securing redress from any such body.&rdquo; Again I think that the Select Committee would be venturing into dangerous territory there.  I cannot see how it could go into this aspect of the affairs of State bodies without positively getting involved in their day-to-day operations.  I believe that in the membership of this House, we have perhaps the best sounding board in this country and I feel sure that in so far as members of the public have complaints about the conduct, lack of service, or anything of that nature of the State bodies, we very quickly hear about them and they are very readily and very fully ventilated here.</P>
    <P>These are some comments I should like to make on the motion as it is framed and the particular functions it is proposed to allocate to this Select Committee.  However, for a moment I should like to go just a bit beyond the technicalities of the motion and have a look at this matter of the supervision of State bodies in the round, as it were. The first thing I want to say is that we must always keep in mind the purpose for which these State bodies were established.  Mark you, there is a great variety in the form and structure and purpose of the State bodies as a whole, of which there are roughly 44 altogether.  You could describe 30 of them as trading and 14 as perhaps non-trading.  They vary a great deal in their organisation, structure, methods and purposes.  The majority were established either to do a commercial job which nobody was doing or capable of doing or else they were established as a means of bringing people with special skills and knowledge into the <Col N="1684" /> public administration.  In that connection I am thinking of bodies like An Chomhairle Ealaíon where we appoint to a particular body people who have very special qualifications which would not be available to the public service otherwise.</P>
    <P>The main purpose, however, in establishing most of these bodies was to promote economic development.  In approaching this matter we should keep that purpose very much in the front of our minds.  That task of promoting economic development and expansion is as urgent in practically every sphere of activity today as it was when many of these bodies were founded.  Indeed, it could be argued that, with the developments of recent times, the new sort of situation we are facing in free trade conditions and the necessity to gear our economy to meet all sorts of challenges, it is possibly true that the position is more urgent today than it was at any time before.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am far more interested in production, employment, development and expansion than any other factor involved in this situation. I put that as a top priority.  I would say the first task of these various State bodies is to ensure that.  I would like to see them, so far as their particular purpose and structure allows, being in a real sense of the word development corporations.  I would certainly like to see them forging ahead rather than standing still.  I prefer to see State bodies being a nuisance to their responsible Ministers in continually putting forward plans or ideas for progress and development, rather than the other way about with the responsible Minister having to prod the bodies for which he is responsible into activity of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>We have got to allow these bodies to take calculated risks.  Given first class management, capable of weighing the pros and cons of any particular project or idea, I would like to see them so minded that they are prepared to take calculated commercial risks.  I would be very loath to be responsible for anything that would help, on the one hand, to kill their initiative or, on the other, to reduce their competitiveness. <Col N="1685" /> We could get into the situation where their managements and top executives would be much more concerned with keeping the files right and being in a position to go before some Select Committee and prove that they did not make any mistakes than they would be in getting on with the job and the fundamental purpose for which they were established.  That is a very real danger which I think exists in the establishment of such a Committee as is envisaged here.  I feel Deputies on both sides are just as much aware of that as I am.</P>
    <P>We must be very objective about this matter.  I know, as a Deputy myself and talking to my colleagues, that very often these State bodies and semi-State organisations do generate feelings of frustration amongst us.  We must not let our personal feelings in regard to any particular one of them weigh unduly with us, if at all.  I will be the first to admit candidly to the House that some of these bodies do succeed in annoying us very much and that there are&mdash;let us face it&mdash;people involved in them who seem to be much more concerned with projecting their own personal images and their own public images than with anything else. There are people in them who do not seem to understand that these are public institutions, that the people employed by them are in the public service and that these bodies, no matter how powerful they may be, are still subordinate to this Parliament and must always be so subordinate.  There are people in the State companies who do not seem to appreciate that&mdash;I hesitate to use the phrase &ldquo;the most humble Deputy in the House&rdquo; because I do not think there are any humble Deputies in the House; I will use the phrase &ldquo;even the newest Deputy in the House&rdquo;, represents the people and, as such, is entitled to the greatest respect and consideration from any of these bodies.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit all that.  It exists and, in common with all the Deputies, I deplore it.  But, as I think Deputy Sweetman adverted to in his opening remarks, these people, such as they are, are far outweighed by the great corps of dedicated and devoted <Col N="1686" /> people who give their services to these organisations.  We have been very fortunate that that is so.  I would hope we would be objective about this and not let the odd irritant weigh too much with us.  We would hope that in due course those who have not a proper appreciation of what the role of a State-sponsored body should be would learn from those who have&mdash;that great body of dedicated people who have done so much to develop these bodies to the point where today they are able to make such a magnificent contribution to our total national effort.</P>
    <P>The question we must ask ourselves is: is the State-sponsored body doing a good job?  Is it, by and large, getting on with the job the Oireachtas gave it to do?  If it is doing that, I would be inclined to overlook a great deal. All Deputies admit that the technical auditing of these State-sponsored bodies leaves nothing to be desired. As the proposer pointed out, they are scrupulously audited from the point of view of financial control and the elimination of fraud.  But, once you get outside that sphere of auditing, it is very difficult indeed not to trespass into the realm of policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this point with regard to that sort of division of functions.  If we were to give a Select Committee the sort of global powers envisaged in this motion a particular organisation would be accountable twice, on the one hand, to the Minister and, on the other, to the Select Committee, both, perhaps, applying different standards and both asking the body to be accountable for different purposes.  That would place a State-sponsored body in an impossible position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any particular State company <Col N="1687" /> the Minister in pursuance of general Government economic or financial policy, might be urging the State body to restrict services, whereas the Select Committee, under its terms, might be suggesting that the State body was not giving reasonable services to the general public, and might criticise it on that account.  This would make for very great difficulty for the management and boards of these companies.</P>
    <P>By and large the control, management and operation of these companies must be an executive function and must be left with the Minister or Government of the day.  I do not think this House or any Committee of it such as is envisaged here could ever be expected to take over that function.  This is a deliberative, legislative Assembly and we have delegated to the Executive, the Government, these executive functions.  This applies, I think, as much in regard to State-sponsored bodies as it does to any other form of our activities and Ministers and the Government have a very great deal of control over all these organisations. Certainly any particular Minister has far more control, and access to far more information about the affairs of the State companies for which he is responsible than any ordinary shareholder in an ordinary outside commercial organisation has.  He appoints the board.  He decides what capital they will get.  He subjects their activities to review from time to time in great detail.  He gets reports from them and generally he exercises very real and very close control over their activities.</P>
    <P>I also want to suggest that the ordinary Deputy has a great deal of access to information about these bodies and their activities.  First, he has the process of the Dáil question which as I have seen it in my time in the House, is very effective.  More often than not the affairs of the particular company in which a Deputy is interested may be discussed on the Estimate for the appropriate Department.  Most Ministers in their Estimates give fairly long and detailed expositions of the affairs of the bodies for which they are responsible.  Deputies have the annual <Col N="1688" /> reports of these bodies and I am not sure that it is not open to any Deputy, if he wishes to do so at any time, to put down a motion seeking to have the affairs of any particular State-sponsored organisation discussed in the House.</P>
    <P>I think this motion is particularly off the rails in regard to its capital aspects.  In recent years, as Deputies know, we introduced a system whereby the total programme of public capital expenditure is brought before the House for discussion.  We shall be bringing before the House very shortly now, the capital programme for the coming year.  That programme will set out clearly the full capital expenditure proposed by every public body and organisation; Government Departments and all State bodies.  There will be set out the full details, with appropriate comments.  It will be available to all Deputies for discussion both as to the total amount and its adequacy, and as to its constituent parts.  On the capital side, the House gets very adequate information about all these bodies.  I should be very favourably disposed, however, to listen to any Deputy who has any suggestions as to what further information about our capital programme might be made available to the House.</P>
    <P>I want to add also that if we were to accept this motion, we would find that a Minister would be in a tighter strait-jacket in regard to capital expenditure than he is in regard to current expenditure. We would find that the capital expenditure programmes of these State-bodies would be subjected to scrutiny and examination by a Committee with power to send for persons and documents.  The Minister is not subject to any such group in regard to current expenditure which I suggest is, perhaps, in the ultimate, of much greater importance than the capital.  I should be very intimidated by the extent of the task this Select Committee would take upon itself.  I spoke already of the great variety of these State bodies.  Let me briefly mention two of them that come to mind.  I have already mentioned An Chomhairle Ealaoín.  This Committee would perhaps <Col N="1689" /> find itself called on to criticise an expertly qualified council such as An Chomhairle Ealaoín in a very abstruse area dealing with works of art, music and so on.  Going to the other end of the scale, the Select Committee would presumably investigate such things as the future capital programme of Aer Lingus and whether it should embark on a programme of buying particular aircraft or not.  It is very difficult to see how any one body could be equipped to deal with such a wide range of subjects.  Furthermore, I cannot see how the Select Committee could possibly go into the affairs of a body like Aer Lingus, its future planning and purchase of aircraft, without disclosing information which would be advantageous to its competitors.  I see many other difficulties also in this matter which I have not time to deal with now.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude my general remarks by saying that it is a very difficult and complex problem.  I should find it very difficult to suggest precisely how it should be tackled but I am asking the House to reject this particular solution.  In doing so, I do not want to dismiss the possibility that we may be able to devise some additional form of Parliamentary review of the activities of these bodies.  I do not suggest that at all.  I am asking the House to reject this particular mechanism because I do not think it is suitable.  First, I do not think a Select Committee could do the job which the motion assigns to it. Secondly, if it were to do the job as set out in the motion, it would almost certainly interfere with Government responsibility and I believe there would also be a very real danger that a Committee with the sweeping powers set out in this motion would undoubtedly run the risk of interfering with the freedom of action and competitiveness of the State bodies they would be investigating. For these reasons, I ask the House to reject the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to what the Minister has said.  In a way I am sorry to have to oppose this motion because I am far from satisfied with the present situation but I agree with the Minister that this <Col N="1690" /> Select Committee is an unduly cumbersome body, with terms of reference which are far too wide.  I feel there is a lot in the Minister's statement that the boards of these State companies should constantly be reminded that they are acting under this House, and not over it.  It is difficult to find some mechanism whereby this point can properly be put over.</P>
      <P>We must devise some method whereby current questions relating to general policy can be discussed with the board and management of these various companies for public information. I can see that a Select Committee could get itself completely gummed up by discussing with the board of CIE whether a certain railway station should be kept open or whether certain trains should be speeded up or abandoned, and so on. We should look at this in the way an ordinary commercial company acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An ordinary limited company has its annual general meeting which is attended by its shareholders, if they wish to come, and, on the report of the directors for the year, shareholders have a fairly wide scope of general comment.  They may, and in many cases do, ask questions which appear to them to be relevant.  It is always possible for the chairman of the board or for any member of the board to claim that an answer to a specific question, if given in public, would be detrimental to the best interests of the company by reason of the fact that it might give information to a competitor. I should be the last to deny that right to a director because I think that can be a dangerous practice.  At the same time, it is very valuable that these boards of directors should be made more conscious of the fact that they have shareholders.  The best way in which this can be done is by having an annual general meeting which is attended by some people, as well as a representative of the Minister for Finance, acting in the capacity of shareholders.  I believe the Minister must have the final say on matters of appointment, and so on, and also on matters of capital formation and major matters of policy of that sort <Col N="1691" /> which impinge on Government policy generally but I do not think it would be improper to suggest that the Minister might consider setting up some committee of this House which might join him or his representative at the shareholders' annual general meeting of a State company.</P>
    <P>There are various matters which I think could properly be raised and which it is very cumbersome to raise in any other way.  Take, for example, criticism of the form of report issued by these companies.  In many cases, I think these reports are far too long and far too complicated.  They seem designed more to confuse than to educate the people to whom they are issued.  In any case, too, I think the form of the report is far too grandiose. They include beautifully coloured binders, coloured photographs, and so on.  This is all very well for a commercial company which is trying to build up its image in the eyes of its shareholders and potential shareholders but a State company does not need to do that.  I do not know any other way in which this sort of question could be raised.  Even without the Members of this House, as a Committee, having any vote, I think they could ask, as members of the public, a number of very relevant questions to which answers should clearly and freely be given by the board of directors of the company concerned.  I do not think it would be too hard a job.  After all, the reports are given in great detail.</P>
    <P>It would be a small matter for the members of the Committee to peruse these reports and then to meet the members of the board at the annual general meeting and discuss a number of relevant questions at that time.  At most, it would be a matter of only a couple of hours.  It would be good for the morale of the public to know that there was someone who could speak directly to a member of the board of CIE, Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus or any other State-sponsored body.  Some members of the public seem to feel that these individuals are completely ungetatable, that they are living in a sort of ivory tower and that nobody <Col N="1692" /> can ever even speak to them.  Some people wonder whether they really exist.  There are matters which could be discussed at such a meeting, matters such as the general policy on personnel management.  This would be a relevant matter, particularly if the company has had a bad record of industrial disputes. I cannot produce a cut and dried solution to this problem but I believe there is a problem which, even when this motion is rejected, will still be with us.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in Deputy Sweetman's remarks about the type of audit carried out by commercial concerns as compared with that laid out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I thoroughly agree with him that we should try to work out some form of audit and report which would include the best points of both types. I would hope that the auditors would give some advice to the directors as to their findings.  I think the advice of an outside commercial firm of auditors could be very helpful.  It need not necessarily be binding.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  That is why it is vital that you should have a firm of auditors who could advise the directors that a certain course of action is unwise or that a certain result is due, in their opinion, to the taking of a certain decision.  Outside criticism from a highly technical body is absolutely essential from the point of view of the shareholders who are members of the public.  It may also be necessary to have the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General, though, to be perfectly frank, I am not nearly so worried about that.  I think we could get ourselves unduly gummed up on technicalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry this motion has been put down in its present form.  I am far from satisfied with the control of State companies.  There is no evidence whatever that parliamentary control is being exercised at all.  It would be well worth the Minister's while to devise some way by which a link could be forged <Col N="1693" /> between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the companies.  It would do us good and it would do the boards of the companies good, and it would give much greater public confidence which, at the moment, is lacking in certain cases.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the personal tribute he paid to me, although it was quite unwitting, when he was talking of the excellence of the idea of submitting a Capital Budget to this House.

      <P>How they ever expected to manage without it, I do not know.  I am grateful also to the Minister for the strictures he passed on what I will agree with him are a small number of the personnel of these State-sponsored bodies, who think that they are not merely above themselves but also above the public interest, and I hope he will take steps to ensure that his remarks, suitably underlined, are sent to the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann whose grossly offensive remarks about the Members of this House before Christmas were condemned then and should always be condemned when the matter comes for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is not the only one although he was the only one who came out at that time in the terms and in the extravagant, offensive phrase he used.  I saw on one occasion a letter from the principal executive of one State-sponsored company to a member of the Oireachtas in which he criticised, fairly offensively, the remarks that that member of the Oireachtas had made about the work of the State-sponsored body and saying that it was all wrong.  The member of the Oireachtas concerned wrote back to him.  I saw the letter&mdash;a nice quiet letter&mdash;turning the other cheek much more than I would have done&mdash; saying: &ldquo;I spoke from the only information <Col N="1694" /> that you make available and if my information is wrong, then you make available to me the true information and I will certainly correct what I have said.&rdquo;  The answer he got from the chief executive officer was: &ldquo;If you did not know what you were talking about, why did you say anything at all?&rdquo;  That type of mentality in a State-sponsored body ruins the public image.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense, too, for the Minister&mdash; and here I want to take the Minister and his predecessor seriously to task &mdash;to suggest that these organisations, even the manufacturing ones, are run entirely on commercial lines.</P>

It was more than I was able to do on Telefís Éireann last week when we could not have a single representative of a State-sponsored body to attend before the television camera to defend the principle on which State-sponsored bodies were run when it was being criticised by me.  I am glad that Deputy Dillon reminded me by his interjection. I am glad to say that this motion, at any rate, has brought the Minister here to this House.  They were not prepared to face the music and face their criticism.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not draw the nice distinction the Minister draws as to whether they were prepared to enter into a confrontation with a Deputy. They are certainly prepared to speak in public, when not confronted, in the most offensive way of Deputies, as the <Col N="1695" /> Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann did.  He would have been better advised to defend the principle rather than be offensive in that way, or as the other chief executive, to whose correspondence I have referred, was when he was asked.</P>
      <P>There is no use saying that these are entirely commercial operations, when I mention, for example, the extraordinary way in which the Minister for Finance for the time being operated in relation to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta. The sum of £3,829,000 was advanced by the Minister for Finance to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta before 30th June, 1964&mdash;I have examined the balance sheet of that date&mdash;£5,649,000 was advanced before 30th June, 1965 and on 30th June, 1966, the Minister for Finance of the day&mdash;the Fianna Fáil predecessor of the present Minister&mdash; after millions and millions had been outstanding for two years calmly announced that he had not yet fixed the rate of interest which was to be charged for that money.  Can anybody, outside a madhouse, see any board of directors going along to their shareholders and saying: &ldquo;We have borrowed in the first year £3,800,000; in the second year, £5,600,000; and now, a year after all that, we have not even arranged the rate of interest, much less the terms of repayment&rdquo;?  How can anyone suggest, when that is done, that it is a commercial operation and that the concern is to be treated as a commercial transaction?</P>
      <P>The plain fact of the matter is that in relation to this motion the Minister has adopted the line that has been adopted by Fianna Fáil down through the years, that they wish nobody to have a look inside the curtain.  In consequence, there has been the grossest suspicion caused, in cases, let me add where no suspicion was deserved&mdash;and in other cases where, indeed, suspicion was proved, as in the case of one company about which the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance had to set up an inquiry, only as a result of a great deal of battling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth, when referring to the position of the auditors, omitted to draw attention to one vital thing.  The <Col N="1696" /> auditor of a commercial company is, as Deputy Dillon reminded him, the servant of the shareholders and is appointed by the shareholders, but in this particular case it is the nominees of the Minister, not the public, who are appointing the auditors and it is the same person, in effect, who is appointing the auditor as is appointing the directors.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is clear evidence that either I have been told untruths in relation to the replies that I got to many of the questions that I put down last week or that Ministers have completely abdicated from their duties.  In many of the cases where I asked questions last week the Minister replied to me that he had no information about the terms of remuneration of the five principal executive officers other than the first.  Surely, on the case made by the Minister for Finance today, a Minister has the obligation to get information in relation to the relativity of employment and remuneration and terms of employment between one aspect of the public service and another?</P>
    <P>The Minister made the case that these State-sponsored bodies were a segment of the public service.  Yet we have a situation in which Ministers of State have come in here, put down replies to questions and said they have no function in regard to this aspect. Others of them have said they did not want to give it.  At least that is honest, but to suggest that they have no information means that they have not taken the trouble, perhaps, to look at the advertisements in the papers; they have not taken the trouble, perhaps, to inquire from the State-sponsored bodies.  Or else they had the information and preferred to tell an untruth of that sort.  I have not seen the files concerned, and I am not in a position to know whether it was that the Ministers involved had not done their job, or whether they were not being properly frank in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance often made a point that he could see this Committee getting into difficulties because the Committee might want a State-sponsored body to take an expansionist role while the Government of the <Col N="1697" /> day might consider a restrictionist role the proper one in the national interest. Let me say at once that, in my view, the Government of the day must be entitled to judge the overall effect on the national interest as opposed to the particular interest, and impose the national interest on the body concerned. It is exactly because of the case made by the Minister that I think this Committee is necessary in the public interest.  We very often see here that when Ministers are criticised or questioned on the policy of the State-sponsored body, they indicate that they have said it should follow a restrictionist policy, and they allow the blame to fall on the State-sponsored body, whereas it should fall on the Minister concerned.  At least this Committee would make it clear where the blame for that rested, while the effect of having the responsibility brought home to the person concerned would be a very salutary lesson not merely for the past but as to how that person should operate in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not agree at all with the Minister for Finance that the effect of this motion would be to fetter or impede the day-to-day working of State-sponsored bodies.  Rather we believe that the effect of the existence of a committee such as this would be that State enterprises would be able, unimpeded by public hostility and by avoidable resentment from the private sector, to go very much more efficiently about their work.  I do not think the terms of reference of many State-sponsored bodies have been at all proper or clearly enough defined.  I do not think their purpose has been defined as it should be.  The effect of that must inevitably be to cause confusion between the Government, between boards, between managements, on the one hand, and this House, on the other.  A clearer definition of their purpose such as would be brought out by this Committee would be something that would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>Nobody will disagree, I think, with the fact in regard to certain of these State-sponsored bodies, there has been an appalling record on industrial relations, and a little breath of fresh air <Col N="1698" /> such as this Committee would bring, would be of great assistance in that connection.  The supervision of State-sponsored bodies has been&mdash;and I think it is fair to say this&mdash;systematically eroded and impeded by the Fianna Fáil Governments over the past few years, in particular.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have come in here and put down an amendment specifying that he wanted the Committee not exactly under clause A but under clause A (1), then there might have been some case for it, but he did not; he threw that out.  This type of Committee operates in every parliamentary country that I can ascertain, and I offered the Minister last week the opportunity of checking the only authority that there is on that.  He did not realise it, but he was being walked into it when I said I wanted to find out if he had it, because if he had not got it, I was going to give him the book. He will find in that book that in every single country from Britain to America, to the countries of the Common Market, there is something on the lines of a court audit or something on the lines of a court reporting to congress. It is not much good having it if the Minister did not read it.</P>

But, of course, good tactician that he is, the Minister did not produce the book until after he knew that under Standing Orders, he would not be allowed to speak again because he was afraid that otherwise he might be crossexamined on certain pages of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to ensure that these concerns that are dealing with public money spend it with the greatest efficiency and economy of operation. We are entitled to ensure that the enterprise carries through the clearly defined objectives with which it has <Col N="1699" /> been entrusted.  I referred last week to the reprehensible practice of certain State companies&mdash;no doubt, aided and abetted by Fianna Fáil Governments &mdash;having got authority from this House to be set up, then proceeding to set up a subsidiary company without any authority from this House.  We accept without question, as I have said, that these companies or bodies must not be impeded in their commercial activities, that they must be allowed reasonable commercial freedom, that they must, at the same time, conform to the high standards of integrity the public service requires, for instance, in relation to the acceptance of substantial contracts by tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily at all.  Only if, as the Minister knows very well, there was a question of contracting and tendering with some connection of the directors concerned.  One of the difficulties in relation to State-sponsored bodies is the interlocking there is by means of the nomination by Ministers of directors and because of the fact that the executives choose to interlock without having the same standards imposed on them as are imposed on civil servants.  While saying that, I also want to say that I still think the majority of them are dedicated public servants.  However, there are some far from it and it is to those I address my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> This Committee would ensure that all State enterprises would provide fully informative reports.  I agree with Deputy Booth that they ought to stop the practice of presenting illustrated, coloured photographs of themselves which do not add to the public image of the body concerned, whatever it may add to the public image of the people themselves.  The use of the standard form of accounts would be far better and these would show the return earned on the State's capital investment in the enterprise.  I do not mind a decision being made in the public interest that a certain job has to be done, that it cannot be done commercially and that therefore it requires a certain subsidy, but I resent very much that a hidden subsidy should be provided by virtue of which the uninformed consumer is being mulcted by a monopoly the Government have not the courage to defend in the Dáil and Seanad.  A Committee such as that suggested in the motion would stop that practice.</P>
    <P>The statement cannot be too often repeated that you can have public enterprises with clearly defined purposes working side by side with private, free, competitive enterprise. But you can only have that if the purpose of the public enterprise is clearly established and it is understood by everybody that it is open to the ever-present examination and standards of the public service.  Otherwise the private sector of the economy is always going to resent it and resent it very properly.  There is already one clear cause of resentment as to why it is that a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance has refused or neglected to determine the rate of interest at which £6 million of public money is being advanced to a State enterprise.  That Minister, by failing to fix the rate and determine the conditions of that advance of public money, has been completely failing in his duty.  For that, and for no other reason, I press this motion to a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme for redundancy payments was outlined in the Minister's brief.  For quite a considerable time, this word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; has been used as a whipping post to terrify workers, just as the word &ldquo;automation&rdquo; was similarly used some time ago.  It is an unfortunate situation when there is a constructive approach to deal with a situation that may exist in the future.  The resettlement and retraining proposals are all intended to benefit workers and to protect them, and references to redundancy are used in order to try to create in the minds of workers the idea that in years to come there must be wholesale redundancy.  It is a very serious matter and it should be treated in a very serious manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the retraining of workers and the upgrading of workers has become a burning question and I hope that those who are now vocal in the matter of whipping up interest in this particular matter in order to <Col N="1704" /> disturb the minds of the workers will fall into line with schemes for upgrading skills.  The upgrading of skills, from unskilled to semi-skilled, would not seem to involve any great problem but there may be problems in regard to upgrading the semi-skilled. There may be a need for some flexibility in regard to the demarcation line and that may become an important issue in the future.  It will be up to the trade union movement to ensure that this matter is solved to the benefit of the workers and to ensure that there will be no lack of effort on their part to meet the situation by having this flexibility. I have grave doubts that this question of demarcation will not become a factor because I have heard it said that in the upgrading of skills, from the semi-skilled to the skilled, there will be serious disruption.  That has been threatened by a person of no small standing in the industrial world.</P>
    <P>I trust that this position will be examined in a realistic manner so that this disruption will not take place. There is no doubt that the need in the future will be for skilled labour and this in itself means that this upgrading may cause some disruption. As I said, it is unfortunate that the term should be used as a whipping post and I hope that as time goes on, we will realise the seriousness of the situation and the efforts which are being made to protect the workers through retraining schemes for people who become redundant for one reason or another.  The matter is being tackled in a very serious way by the Minister and his Department.  As we know, free trade will expose us to severe industrial competition and in order to succeed, we must have greater and better production.  This cannot be produced by additional effort alone, but by greater skill.</P>
    <P>Another term which has been used is &ldquo;greater productive effort&rdquo; and the workers are led to believe that they must work harder in order to get more.  That is not so.  If the industrialists equip themselves to meet the new and pressing needs with such things as better equipment and <Col N="1705" /> machinery and if the workers equip themselves with new and better &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;, the situation can be met and we can produce more without greater effort on the part of the individual.  Many men at present are working to their capacity and they cannot make a greater effort, certainly in a manual job.</P>
    <P>The question of training is an important one and one on which we must have complete agreement.  We must develop our resources as fully as does any other country.  Our workers are just as competent as those in Britain, America or elsewhere and they are sought after by other countries.  We should protect them and ensure that they get the same opportunities here and that no obstacles are placed in their way.  The question of co-operation rests here to a great degree with management.  There is need for a greater effort because many managements have failed to avail of the State services which are available in order to equip themselves to meet the new developing situation.  They like to weep instead but they will have to equip themselves for the future.  In many spheres, management has not been too effective in the past and in the industrial field, many people were put in merely to soak up profits.  We must ensure that the best possible personnel are available for the job in order to ensure that industry will move in the direction in which we want it to move, to meet outside competition.</P>
    <P>The question of skilled personnel managers is one that must receive serious consideration.  Skilled personnel managers are required to deal with labour problems.  As we know, good relations are a keynote today and a first necessity if we are to meet outside competition, increase the number of jobs available and improve the effectiveness of our productive effort and of our industries.  In the Minister's statement, Government policy is clearly laid down, that we must raise production and increase employment.  These ends can be achieved only by proper co-operation between the trade unions, workers and management.  We may fail from time to time in some sectors <Col N="1706" /> but we have a collective responsibility, and we as public representatives have also responsibility, to mould the minds of the people in a true and honest way and not to try to terrify them as some Members of this House have done in the not too distant past and probably continue to do.</P>
    <P>Listening here today to one or two of them, one can see that the trend is still there.  It is unfortunate that it is there and the sooner we get down to working as one unit for the good of the nation rather than for sectional interests the better, because only by doing that can we bring about a solution to the problem and bring about the goodwill which is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Government and the nation, that is, to raise production and increase employment.</P>
    <P>The day is now gone when the big boss could say: &ldquo;I am the boss; I hire and fire.&rdquo;  If that is the only way management can bring it home to the men that they are in charge, it means management are ineffective.  I am sure we can and will develop the brains of our people to meet this new and everincreasing need.  The welfare of the workers will always be in the forefront of the minds of the Minister for Labour and the Government.  We have always paid attention to the problems and needs of the workers.  This is proved by all the aids we have provided for them.  I can understand the disappointment of some members of the Opposition that, in addition to all the aids of the past, such as holidays with pay, proper conditions of employment, industrial relations Acts and so on to give the workers the conditions they deserve, this Government are now setting out in clear terms their desire to see training and retraining schemes to meet the new situation.</P>
    <P>Earlier today there were one or two interruptions about automation and redundancy which I should like to answer.  It did not take automation to cause redundancy when some of the people who interrupted were in power. The workers can be assured that on no occasion will we cause redundancy by selling the various means to keep people in employment.</P>
    <P>The question of trade unions has <Col N="1707" /> often been mentioned here.  I am a trade unionist.  I was a shop steward for 15 years and a member of the executive council of a union.  I understand the workings of unions, their desires, needs and defects.  We all have our defects.  Listening to some of their spokesmen, one would think unions had no defects, that all their defects had been eliminated.  There are many efficient trade union leaders who down through the years have tackled problems with commonsense and understanding. The prolonged period of industrial stability is an indication of the excellence of their work.  But, like every other sector of the community, a union has its weak points.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the union members who have spoken to set their own house in order.  I want to see that done in order to ensure that the workers will have sound representation in discussions with employers.  In the past, some of the industrial unrest here was caused because the union representatives were inefficient, and the slick employers' representatives were able to get an agreement which, when analysed later, showed the workers to be losing instead of gaining.  Some unions have established colleges to equip their leaders to meet this new situation in which the employer puts everything into the field to ensure his point gets across in an effective manner. My hope is that we will have properly trained union representatives to meet this situation.</P>
    <P>Sometimes strikes are called as a vote of no confidence in trade union leaders who have discussed a problem and brought it to what they believe is an agreed settlement.  From time to time, a trade union official and a politician are the most hated people in the country by the public and even by their own members when there is a big issue at stake.  Sometimes the worker is unsympathetic towards a conscientious trade union official doing his job in a realistic way and endeavouring to give good advice.  The public are also unsympathetic to a Government meeting their responsibilities in full in order to ensure the common good and not just a sectional good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> I am glad to see the unions moving in this direction and having these seminars, condemned by Deputy M. O'Leary.  Valuable information is imparted at these seminars.  Union officials have there the benefit of the experience of older officials who have met and dealt with the slick employers' representatives.  These seminars have been very successful and will continue to be.  Many unions have not the resources to establish colleges such as those established by one or two unions.  The seminar is the next best thing.  I am told by trade union officials that those who attend them get a comprehensive picture of how the employers' representatives operate.</P>
    <P>The question of strikes was mentioned. We all condemn wildcat unofficial strikes.  Nevertheless, there are occasions when they must be treated with understanding.  Generally speaking, this type of strike starts on the spur of the moment for some given reason.  It is not like the case where prolonged negotiations break down. Usually it is a question of ineffective control by unions or management. Often it is a question of a shop steward assuming responsibilities he has not got.  Unions should educate shop stewards into some uniformity of thinking.  It varies from union to union. Sometimes they think they are the general secretary rather than the shop steward.  On many occasions they have put higher union officials into deep water and much time is lost trying to eliminate the problem.  Sometimes this type of strike is condemned out of hand without any assessment of the situation.</P>
    <P>On one or two occasions I was concerned with stoppages of this nature. After careful examination it became clear that they were being hoodwinked or that there was a grave injustice that could only be brought to light by an immediate stoppage.  We hope these stoppages will not happen and that the development of worker-management relations will continue to the point of eliminating them.  These things never occur on major wage problems which are negotiated at a higher level.  It is <Col N="1709" /> generally on a question of concessions and even where the term is written into an agreement, these concessions may be withdrawn at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>The treatment of workers as digits in any large industrial concern should be examined.  It is a necessary first step that a man should be regarded as a man.  It is very depressing for a man to hear called out: &ldquo;No. 40, report to the office&rdquo;; or &ldquo;No. 35, come for your pay now.&rdquo;  That is very degrading and the sooner we get away from it the better.  It may have been all right in the past but we have now reached the stage when the dignity of man should be fully recognised by the management.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the right to strike as a right that must be qualified by such factors as family and personal necessity and duty to the community. Any withdrawal of labour must be conditioned by social principles.  If that is done and all factors taken into consideration before arriving at a decision to strike, we shall have fully complied with our responsibilities.  Many strikes have been unnecessary and unjustified and have brought nothing but misery and poverty to the lower-paid workers. As in many other cases the lower-paid worker is used as a catspaw.  Those who really suffer by a strike are those who can least afford it.</P>
    <P>It has been said that managing directors do not suffer financially as a result of a strike.  That is quite right.  We look forward to the day when we can eliminate all strikes and still meet justifiable claims.  In this enlightened age, with more enlightened managements and unions, we should be able to reach that situation, especially when statistics, progress reports and planning programmes are available to both employers and workers.  Nevertheless, the right to strike exists and we recognise it, and all the consequences of a strike, just as we recognise collective bargaining which is the keystone of our industrial relations and must so remain.  If there is a failure to reach agreement between managements and unions to eliminate stoppages or major disruptions in industrial output and if a solution can be found, we shall have gone <Col N="1710" /> a long way towards meeting everybody's desires.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that strikes me as a trade unionist, that is, the question of workers' councils.  These are a very good institution and should be developed but they are often very cumbersome with quite a number of unions, anything from four to ten or even 21, whatever number is in CIE. Before the small grievance of the workers can be rectified, a very long period must elapse.  This causes dissatisfaction not only to the workers concerned but to other workers where a number of unions are involved.  It may help in some cases to have members of a number of unions acting together but generally it is the smaller problems that it is necessary to eliminate. If we can succeed in eliminating these smaller grievances, we shall have different personnel dealing with the bigger problems on a wider basis and these will be met with greater understanding.</P>
    <P>Once again, I should like to assure the Minister that his efforts are being noted by responsible people, as also are the efforts of the Government, to meet the present situation with new services such as replacement service and guidance facilities that will be available to the schools.  It is of great importance that we should start at that level.  That will represent a realistic approach in catering for the future of our young people and solving some of their problems.  At present people are left very much on their own in making up their minds and as a result those with special aptitudes, capable of reaching great heights, are unable to realise their potentialities for want of these services.  These guidance facilities should be examined in great detail.</P>
    <P>The manpower forecasting service and the other services available are being appreciated as an addition to the already long line of aids to workers and measures to ensure that workers get necessary protection.  I ask the trade union movement to examine carefully the question of flexibility.  This is something that is desirable and necessary and something that should <Col N="1711" /> be paid for as it is in some cases where a flexibility allowance is made because of the overlapping of work, rather than have this very strict line of demarcation.</P>
    <P>Trainee systems have been introduced very effectively at the Verolme works in Cork and these are very satisfactory and work with the blessing of the unions.  In the many new industries that I hope will be established in different fields from those already existing, I trust that trainee systems will be developed so that the question of demarcation with the skilled crafts may be averted.  It was recently said that any suggestion of upgrading semi-skilled to skilled, or indeed any upgrading which will bring such workers within reasonable distance of skilled workers, will meet serious opposition.  It will be a bad day if we do not work out a system of flexibility or demarcation allowances, or whatever type of payment will be given for this type of infringement.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that, where there is flexibility, where a number of unions or crafts are concerned, perhaps ten or 15, the bigger crafts tend to obliterate the smaller groups in a matter of time.  I know their survival is at stake and both sides should get down to devising a system which would absorb both classes into a unit and which would give proper compensation for any infringement of rights.</P>
    <P>Many other factors have been mentioned in the debate and in the discussions and many people have been misquoted.  I sympathise with the Minister when I hear many members of the Opposition misquote him and use various terms in order to try to terrify others.  I do not believe they will fool the great majority of the people but they will certainly fool some of them, as they did before.  I would appeal to Deputies not to inject any cloud of suspicion into this discussion such as has already been injected into it.  By so doing, they have done a bad day's work for themselves. I am quite sure that, in a few months' time or maybe in a year's time, they will come back here and probably be <Col N="1712" /> very sorry for some of the contributions that have been made.</P>
    <P>Once again, the trade unionists, at large, welcome any type of legislation that will protect them in their hour of need, in redundancy or in unemployment. They welcome facilities for the attainment of skills they had not before.  The placement service will assist them in moving from job to job and to get other employment.  These are all steps forward in addition to a very large line of protections and aids that have been given to workers by Fianna Fáil throughout the years.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Dowling should shoot his speech writer because the bit he read to us at the beginning of his performance was wretched, but the treacle barrel technique he employed for the rest of the evening was most effective.  He reminded me of a barrel of treacle with the tap turned on and the treacle flooding out.  Everybody listening to him gets into a state of mind of bemused confusion.  It is very effective and Deputy Dowling must be most useful to his Party.  He should shoot his speech writer because what he wrote and read out to us today does not suit his style.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that it is necessary to suggest to the Minister for Labour that if he is to get an opportunity to promote stability&mdash;which, I take it, is to be his primary task&mdash;his greatest enemy is not the Federated Union of Employers nor the Trade Union Congress nor shop walkers nor anybody else, but the dragon of inflation.  You cannot slay that dragon.  It does not matter what the Minister does or what the Trade Union Congress tries to do or what the Federated Union of Employers attempt, the hateful, all devouring spiral will go on.  I do not think I exaggerate when I say that inflation is the Prince of Thieves, robbing the defenceless and passing by the experts in the manipulation of money.  It is the broad high road so pleasant to travel until it reaches its destination of anarchy, begotten of the collapse of money as a store of value.  Then, indeed, Fisher's equation operates to destroy the foundations of <Col N="1713" /> a free society, until in the ensuing anarchy people turn to authoritarian forms of Government to arrest the breaking up of society; and all too often society discovers too late that inflation has destroyed freedom, and that the price paid politically to restore stability has been the surrender by freemen of their birthright of freedom, with the prospect of generations of struggle and perhaps bloodshed to get it back.  I think that proposition is incontrovertible, but I can look back with a clear conscience on having stated that dilemma to our people over a long time.  But, when Deputy Childers, the Minister for Transport and Power, casts himself in the role of Lady Godiva to ride naked on a white horse through his constituency, really, the soul of man must revolt.  Can you imagine Deputy Childers, carried away by the intoxicating atmosphere of the Dublin Society of Incorporated Secretaries in the Central Hotel, delivering himself of the following, no later than Saturday night last, when he stated that the country was suffering from an increase in the cost of living, half of which was caused by completely reckless inflation in 1964, 1965 and 1966?  May I ask Lady Godiva Childers where he was in 1964, 1965, and 1966?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to him. Seeing that he is not present, I could scarcely address him.  He was riding high in those days and offering all and sundry a larger share of the growing cake.  Anyone who then suggested that he was, in fact, seducing our people down the broad highway&mdash; what Deputy Dowling calls redundancy and about which I shall have a word to say in a moment&mdash;was remonstrated with by Lady Godiva that they were misrepresenting the noble aspirations of a generous soul who asked of the country nothing more than to &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On.&rdquo; Now, the Minister for Labour is here before us.  Where was he in 1964, 1965 and 1966?  Godiva says he was leading the people into an inflationary <Col N="1714" /> situation the fruits of which are now being visited upon us.</P>
      <P>I have not finished with Lady Godiva.  Stripped, and on her white horse, she had this to add:</P>
      <P>The crazy rush for higher living standards which had not been earned had not brought the economy crashing down because the British, living on borrowed money, had gone on inflating and their people were still able to buy more Irish goods.  Now the British people have been brought to their senses and Irish exported goods will have to be sold in a Britain where the boom has ended.</P>
      <P>When I think of the shocked dismay of Godiva when I was telling this House four and five years ago that the Government, either through ignorance or irresponsibility&mdash;and I now believe the latter was the real cause&mdash; were plunging our people into the grave crisis in which we at present are, it makes me quite sick to realise that there are still men left in the public life of this country who are prepared so recklessly to deceive in order to purchase votes with lies.</P>
      <P>I would have more respect, I think, for persons who caparison themselves in lies and make their foul bargain to sell their souls for votes and who keep their disreputable rags about them but there is something utterly revolting when they shed the rags which cover their nakedness.  They seek to cover their persons with their inadequate locks and to ride on milk-white chargers of probity, proclaiming they are not as other men.</P>
      <P>Who is speaking for the Government? Are we in a state of crisis owing to the reckless inflation precipitated by the Government in 1964, 1965 and 1966?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He speaks of stability as the primary essential for progress and says his function is to persuade, and if he should fail to persuade, then to compel, stability.  I warn him that his persuasion and his legislation can have no effect if what his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, says is true, that the Government to which he and that Minister belong have been following a policy of reckless inflation which drives men to seek higher wages, forces up costs and ultimately brings the whole structure of the economy down around their ears.</P>
      <P>We are talking about stability. Deputy Dowling was talking about how it shocked his tender ears to hear people speak of redundancy.  I agree with him.  I think the good old term, crude &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo;, is the true term.  There are 75,000 people unemployed in this country today after we have shipped 300,000 to Great Britain in the course of the past ten years and there is a new element entering in that none of you seems to have awakened up to.  There are coming into the unskilled labour market today bankrupt farmers of substantial holdings.  I want to warn this House that at the present time there are working on the streets of Dublin and on building sites and the roads of Meath and Westmeath relatively substantial farmers who are no longer able to earn a livelihood for their families on their own holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling you that these people have been driven out of agriculture.  They ought not to be his responsibility but they are being made his responsibility.  They are becoming unskilled workers.</P>
      <P>Is it his problem or does he care about the problem that confronts him of the adverse trade balance in January? Is he concerned about the fact that there are certain signs of a sustained inflation in an adverse trade balance, a rising cost of living and a rise in the balance of payments?  Does he agree with me that nothing he can do can correct the situation if these things are suffered to go on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to submit to the House that all the blatherskite about the trivia of the administration as to whether we are going to have various alterations in the procedures in the labour exchange, and so forth, is irrelevant to the real issues that are here joined. The purpose, I understand, of a Minister for Labour is to help the Government to secure full employment in an <Col N="1717" /> economically viable economy.  Is that not the purpose for which the Minister was appointed?</P>
    <P>I have tried to bring to his mind the fundamental problems that must be resolved if the job committed to his care is to be done.  I say the cost of living is rising.  I say the adverse trade balance is rising.  I say the adverse balance of payments is rising, although that is in some measure concealed by the continuing sale of our assets to foreign interests but that should not deceive the Minister for Labour or should not persuade him that the fundamental problem is not still there.</P>
    <P>If we are to escape from this spiral which will destroy us all if it is allowed to proceed unhindered, every section of the community has to lend a hand. I remember being asked in Ballina during the general election, when I said I believed in an incomes policy, what I proposed to do if the employers or the trade unions refused to help.  I said: &ldquo;If that situation arises I fail.  That is all.&rdquo;  I believe they can be got to help. If people make up their minds that they are going to rush to destruction in a free society there is nothing you can do about it.  But I do not believe our people will make up their minds to rush to destruction, and I do not want to live in a society based on the kind of coercion which is dear to the socialist heart and to the totalitarian head.</P>
    <P>If we are to get the kind of co-operation that a Minister for Labour or any Government elected by this House requires to preserve the economic foundations of our society, one of the first requisites is that those who understand the problems will be prepared to set a good example.  Advice without example is no good.  The advice that is tendered that ought to be listened to by everybody is that until we have attained stability and restored our capacity to compete abroad in foreign markets everyone should restrain, as far as is humanly possible, the natural desire for an increased income.  I think that applies from the richest man in Ireland to the lowest paid worker, but you have got to say <Col N="1718" /> quite deliberately if we do accept that principle: let us now examine the wage structure, and where we find some low paid workers living at a wage level which we consider to be inadequate for the maintenance of human dignity, adjustments could and should be made in their regard while maintaining an over-all forbearance by the rest.</P>
    <P>If that advice is to be listened to, how are we to reconcile it with the action of the directors of the Government banks?  If the Bank of Ireland and the other banks which it controls earned in the past financial year an entirely fortuitous profit as a result of the bank rate rising to unprecedented heights and to the economies of operation effected by them as a result of the protracted strike in their own service, they then start this year by distributing a two per cent increase in the dividend of every shareholder and announcing that as far as their employees are concerned there is going to be a preferential system of purchasing shares at substantial discount over and above whatever wage and salary agreements they have already made with their employees, how can you expect a man working with a shovel and spade for a relatively few pounds a week to hear sympathetically from his trade union an exhortation to exercise restraint?</P>
    <P>I believe in free enterprise.  I believe that profits are the hallmark of success, but I do not believe in uncontrolled distribution of dividends if at the same time you are asking everybody else in society to exercise restraint.  This interesting fact emerges, that there are relatively few people in the public life of the country who are in a position to criticise the banks because the vast majority of us owe them money.  Well be damned to them. Here is the place to speak the truth about them.  Whether they are banks or whatever else they are, to distribute increased dividends to their shareholders at the beginning of such a year as we are now in represents for me the very apotheosis of irresponsibility.  I want to say quite deliberately I fully understand the immense exacerbation of a trade union leader who is asked to urge restraint upon his own members <Col N="1719" /> when action of that kind is taken by bank directors.</P>
    <P>The second thing I want to say is this.  Deputy Jones, in opening for the Fine Gael Party on this Estimate, spoke about the very special problem of agricultural workers who withdraw from the agricultural industry and move into other industries, leaving the area in which they had got employment to take up employment, if it were available, in another area.  Surely at the very heart of this problem must lie housing.  One of the great difficulties of a man who proposes to leave a job in one place and take up a job in another is to find a place to put his family.  One of the greatest hardships on a man taking up a new job is the necessity to maintain two households, a wife and family at home and himself at lodgings where he works.  I would urge upon the Minister, if that has not already been brought to his attention, to bear it carefully in mind.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to direct attention is the astonishing confidence trick that Fianna Fáil have so successfully carried out, that is, the extent to which they have persuaded public men in this country to become hypnotised by the Common Market. It has become the universal alibi for every error of judgment, inadequacy and fatuity on the part of the Government. I heard one of the younger Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party reading out with emotion some of the sections of the Treaty of Rome.  He was so deeply impressed by some of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, that when we got into the Common Market we would have complete freedom of movement of labour throughout the whole area of the Common Market, and he ventured to suggest this was one of the greatest forward steps in social thinking that he had come across in his, as yet, short life. I could see a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies looking around at him and thinking: &ldquo;Is he not a very learned man?  He has read the Treaty of Rome.&rdquo;  I wonder did he ever stop to think that the only benefit contained in this section of the Treaty of Rome of which he spoke was to provide access for our emigrants to the <Col N="1720" /> countries of Europe, to provide access for our emigrants not only to the poverty, the segregation, the loneliness and the homesickness so many of them have learned so well in Great Britain or the United States of America, but all those evils complicated by the additional cross of the language problem.</P>
    <P>Anyone who knows Europe knows of the tragic ghettoes, the Turkish, Greek and Italian ghettoes where are huddled the tragic people driven into them by the despair and poverty from which they came.  Many of them come from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Turkey and Greece and they suffer all the agonies of hunger, segregation, loneliness, homesickness and inability to communicate. If that is one of the benefits the younger members of Fianna Fáil are yearning for from the Treaty of Rome, I hope our people will never be called on to avail of it.</P>
    <P>At great political cost I have defended the Common Market.  I fought for it at Strasbourg when General de Gaulle rejected President Kennedy's demarche in which he offered Atlantic partnership to a truly united Europe.  I can look back to February of 1962 when, as Leader of this Party, I spoke at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis and said:</P>
    <P>In connection with the whole problem of Ireland's entry into the Common Market I think it right to make one thing clear, we in Fine Gael decided that it was the right policy for this country to enter the Common Market if Great Britain entered it, so as to protect the vital economic interests of our own people.  We believe that Fine Gael could have better conducted these negotiations than Fianna Fáil, but the people in the General Election entrusted this task to a Fianna Fáil Government.  Some people would have us harass the present Government by propounding an endless series of hypothetical dilemmas and challenging the Government to answer these in public.  This might provide entertaining political fireworks for those who are interested in sensationalism rather than statesmanship, but it would also make <Col N="1721" /> the task of any Irish Government negotiating on behalf of this country in Brussels utterly impossible.</P>
    <P>That declaration of support of our entry to the Common Market stands today as it did then but the decision to forbear from putting a barrage of embarrassing questions to the Government did not produce many good results.  Perhaps I was wrong in exercising that forbearance for so long.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have now pulled up their socks.  They may pull them up as much as they like.  They may dream dreams and formulate visions to deceive our people but the hard fact remains that we enter the Common Market if Britain enters and we cannot and will not enter if Britain does not enter.  It is time the Members of this House made up their minds that the question of Britain's entry at all is becoming more and more problematical.</P>
    <P>When we all dream our dreams of the solution of our economic problems, full employment, expansion of industry and growing prosperity for agriculture stemming from entry to the Common Market, we should ask ourselves on what do we base this confident outlook.  The Common Market has not saved Germany from an acute crisis.  Their coalmines are closing down and their steel masters are closing their mills and dismissing their men.  Thousands and thousands of migratory labourers are running home to their own countries from the unemployment of Germany and France.  Holland is in economic danger.  We in this House should ask ourselves the question of how much of the vaunted prosperity of the Common Market for the past ten years has been due to the introduction of free trade and how much of it to the abracadabra of the Common Market itself.</P>
    <P>There are still some old-fashioned economists who stick to the view that the whole illusion of tariffs and protection does little to advance the prosperity of anybody.  I have stated here before that when I was a child, I could learn geography by standing on O'Connell Bridge and watching the <Col N="1722" /> export of Jacob's biscuits to the four corners of the earth.  Since protection, they go nowhere except to Cork and Galway; they do not even go to Belfast.  Jacob's was one of the greatest exporting biscuit industries in the world at a time when it was part of a system of free trade.  The biggest ships in the world were built in Ireland under free trade and it is my belief that the bulk of the advantages of the Common Market have come from the creation of such a free trade area as was instituted in the United States 200 years ago.  It is on the ability to exchange one's labour and the product of one's labour for the products of other nations without restrictions of any kind that prosperity is built.</P>
    <P>The Common Market is not the solution of all the problems that face our people.  The Common Market has not provided houses for the people of France where the housing situation is nearly as bad as it is here.  The Common Market has not protected Germany from crisis.  It has not prevented Italy from buying coal from America when she found it cheaper than to buy it from the Ruhr.  It has not prevented a situation in which Dr. Strauss has almost split the German Cabinet because he says that Germany cannot afford to pay the £31 million which Dr. Erhardt undertook to pay to the British for the maintenance of their forces in Europe.  I suggest that the Minister for Labour is fluthering with the future prosperity of our economy if he thinks that entry to the Common Market is going to provide solutions of the problems that are going to confront us.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister shaking his gory locks at his neighbours and saying: &ldquo;Boys, if you won't play, if you won't help, then I must consider introducing legislation.&rdquo;  Legislation be damned.  The Minister knows well that there is no legislation on the face of God's earth, except that of the kind they had in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia, which can make a man work if he does not want to work.  There is no use making angry noises and announcing our intention of passing legislation, which <Col N="1723" /> we know damn well will not work. Either we can persuade our people to act reasonably or we will all go over the edge of the precipice together.  But there is no use reproaching people when you act in the opposite way yourself.  What, in the name of Providence, is the purpose of the Government telling everybody in the country that for the common good we must cut down and reduce our consumption, when they themselves are spending more than the Government of this country has ever spent since the State was founded, and with a whole row of Ministers already thirsting for the blood of their newly elected Taoiseach, conducting a competition amongst themselves as to which one of them will promise to spend most over and above what he is spending now?  If everybody is going to spend more, first, where is it going to come from and, secondly, where is it going to go?</P>
    <P>The Government cannot spend money without creating consumer demand and, if it is the Government's intention to spend more and more and more, then they must either borrow or raise it by taxation, and there is a limit to what they can get by taxation. In fact, if they honour half the commitments which some of the Minister's colleagues have already entered into publicly, we will be faced with inflation greater than anything we have ever known before.  The reason for that is the very reason advanced by the simple but eloquent Deputy Dowling.  Deputy Dowling's remedy for everything is that the greatest heresy any man can preach is that anyone in this country should be asked to work harder than he is working now.  Deputy Dowling says nobody need make the slightest effort.  All that is necessary is to improve the tools.  It is the old story&mdash;the bad workman complaining of his tools.  Deputy Dowling says there is nothing wrong with the work.  Everybody is doing splendidly.  What is wrong is the tools and, if we improve the tools, the E1 Dorado will be upon us all.  That is all the purest cod.</P>
    <P>The truth of it is we are all trying <Col N="1724" /> to live a champagne life on a porter income, and the tragedy of it is that in the presence of us all and in the eyes of us all, we are sinking deeper and deeper into debt.  Our difficulties are steadily growing and we have now reached the stage when Ministers of State are making promises of the wildest kind because they are ashamed of the situation that exists and indifferent to the consequences of the undertakings they are giving.  We have got our priorities all wrong.  We have enormous concrete office buildings on St. Stephen's Green and yet a married man, his wife and three children, will not even be considered for a Corporation house in the City of Dublin. Naturally the Minister for Local Government expresses horror and dismay, and rightly so, and promises that plenty will be made available for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes very near the root of the problems with which he will ultimately have to struggle.  The odd thing is nobody wants to listen to these problems or to face them.  There is one topic&mdash;it is not peculiar to this country; it is inherent in all free societies&mdash;from which men recoil with horror, that is, the inexorable, inescapable discipline of economic law.  People believe we can control these problems by regulating prices.  People believe we can control them by regulating wages.  People believe we can control them by regulating profits.  But, while they pass all this regulating legislation, the irresistible power of the economic heresy of inflation grinds on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why I should waste the time of the House trying to tell the Minister what he can read for himself but I think it is worth while referring him to something to which I myself have already referred in this House.  It is not a very long document.  It is only 5½ pages.  It is an address given by William F. Butler, Vice-President of the Chase-Manhattan Bank at the National Symposium on the Balance of Payments at the Chamber of Commerce, <Col N="1725" /> Mayflower Hotel, Washington, DC, on 19th October, 1966, entitled &ldquo;The Adequacy of Current Machinery and Proposals for Reform&rdquo;.  If the Minister has not got a copy, I shall be pleased to lend him mine, but I think it is highly likely that he or some of his advisers have already seen it and digested it.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude as I began. Inflation is the root of all our labour relations problems.  I want to express again my disgust at the picture of Deputy Childers, Minister for Transport and Power, cast in the role of Lady Godiva, purging with his nakedness, his unseemly nakedness, the sins of his Party.  I hope to hear from the Minister for Labour, when he is concluding on this Estimate, that he does not accept that our problems can be resolved by tinkering with each symptom as it presents itself.  He can do his job only in conditions of stability and, without that essential stability, no legislation and no administration can solve the problems, urgent problems, that threaten not only the economic but the political survival of this country as an independent state.</P>
    <P>I am certain that not all Deputies accept the proposition that it is better to be free and relatively poor; I am not certain that there are not amongst them some who yearn for the fleshpots of Egypt.  But I believe the situation is grave and I do not believe in asking the Minister to undertake the impossible.  His colleagues have a very material contribution which they must make if he is to have any prospect of success in the Department of Labour. If they do not do better in the next three years, than Deputy Childers, the Minister for Transport and Power, would have us believe they did in the past three years, he can throw his hat at it.  He has not a hope in hell of successfully performing the assignment he has undertaken unless the chilling vision of Deputy Childers, the Minister for Transport and Power, in his role of Lady Godiva, riding naked on a white horse, doing public penance for his past, has the effect of reforming his colleagues for their sins of inflation in the past.  If the problem of inflation <Col N="1726" /> is brought under control, then and only then his problems may not be so formidable as some people seem to think.  I believe in the commonsense of the ordinary people.  If they are asked to help in surmounting national problems, they will usually give the help needed, but they will not listen to frauds who ask their neighbours to make sacrifices while they increase their own dividends by 25 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that when the Minister is replying, he will be more informative and revealing than he was in his opening speech.  If one reads carefully through this speech, one gets the impression that Fianna Fáil never before had anything to do with employment, finding employment, creating employment, or looking after conditions of employment.  While I know that this is a new Department, the fact is that the Fianna Fáil Party have been in office for over 30 years and now we find in this Estimate a number of speculations, guesses or projections&mdash;call them what you like. I am anxious to get more information about these guesses or projections to which the Minister has adverted.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Minister said that it is his intention to increase the number of factory inspectors to 28, from 22 at the moment, which number includes three women.  This is something which indicates the need for attention in a matter which is so important.  On a previous occasion, the Minister in reply to a question said that there were 11,570 registered factories for the year ended September, 1965.  You do not have to exercise your imagination too much to wonder how they got around this job of factory inspection. Does the Minister seriously suggest that 28 people will be able to take care of so many factories?  In addition, we can of course conclude that more factories came into existence since 1965 and we can also have regard to further figures given by the Minister on a previous occasion, when he said that for the first nine months of 1966, there were 2,679 factory inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what are the duties of factory inspectors and if they are so simple that they can cope with <Col N="1727" /> such a vast number of factories.  Could the Minister explain why there have only been 2,679 inspections, when there are over 11,000 factories?  Surely the Minister has a sufficient number of advisers, even in his own Party, apart from the Department, to know that numerous factories are in urgent need of inspection, particularly in regard to conditions?  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that this is a trade union problem.  If the Minister assumes responsibility in the matter of factory inspections, he must be able to show that his Department can carry out these inspections satisfactorily. Frequently we hear about people stopping work because of such things as bad ventilation in their factories, or bad heating.  This is very prevalent in this city, not to talk about other parts of the country.  I do not know why the Minister has the idea that 28 inspectors will suffice. The people who have made the case for 28 inspectors should be made to spell out their reasons and say how these 28 inspectors are to do their jobs satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The time has also come when the Minister should improve the law in connection with safety committees.  It should be obvious to him that placing the onus on the workers to set up these committees is no use.  He expressed disappointment that more safety committees were not in operation. He did say that there were more in operation now than last year, but he should bear in mind that not all the workers in the Republic are members of trade unions and therefore this responsibility cannot be placed on the trade union movement.  If the Minister is serious, he should set about having his inspectors set up these committees. The Minister will have to take the initial step in this matter because if he leaves the onus on the people to say that they will set up safety committees in their factories it will not work.  This was borne out by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Dowling, tonight.  He indicated that there is a natural reluctance on the part of people in certain places to make suggestions and that even if they do make <Col N="1728" /> suggestions, the reaction of the employers is not very satisfactory.  This taken-for-granted attitude on the part of the Minister is not good enough. Either we mean business in this connection or we do not.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that he is going to review the existing law relating to the welfare of workers.  I hope that this is not a &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; promise, not a typical promise of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Minister should indicate how long this review is to take, bearing in mind that the Fianna Fáil Party for over 30 years have had an opportunity to do this.  It is now about time they came up with some sort of programme in regard to existing legislation. The Minister also pointed out that he is still working on the Industrial Training Bill, but while that is being done by the Minister and his Department, we have more and more factories closing down and workers being given notice that their employment is about to cease.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, in the week before last, the Philips Export Centre issued a statement to the newspapers that they were going to close down. The first indication given to the union concerned was that morning when they were sent for and told about it. There is too much of this.  A number of these places have obtained grants from the Exchequer.  Surely it is reasonable for the Minister to make an arrangement that people who avail of State funds to set up factories should give an undertaking that they will give reasonable notice of their intention to close down?  I do not think it unreasonable to ask them to give three or four months' notice.  This idea of taking people unawares is not satisfactory.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that the type of employment brought into existence is reasonably secure.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he will have an employment service, and he mentioned aptitude tests and placement officers.  I should like him to be a little more explicit about how this is to operate.  I am not decrying the idea&mdash;I think it is excellent&mdash;but we will have to have more positive statements <Col N="1729" /> and not just projections and guesses.  One thing that worries me about the proposed placement service is that the Department's predecessors in this field, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Industry and Commerce, failed to do anything about placing boys and girls leaving school on a proper register for employment.  The Minister should be aware of the fact there is no proper register being kept at present of children leaving school seeking employment. The only information comes by way of the child who finds his or her way to the employment exchange and registers there, but such children are in the minority.  The majority living in the outskirts of Dublin do not find their way into the centre of the city looking for employment.  In fact, the reverse is the case.  When this matter was in the hands of the Department of Social Welfare, they made no attempt whatever to have a register of juveniles for employment.  When we talk about an employment service, we must consider juveniles, and this postulates some form of registration.  I urge the Minister to do something about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already given us a rundown on the different types of disputes encountered during the past year.  He talked about the activities of the Labour Court in the matter of trade disputes.  I notice that again he did not say what he thought about the existing set-up in the Labour Court.  He has not indicated whether or not he is satisfied with the number of conciliation officers in the Labour Court.  I submit there are not enough. I am sure the Minister, now that he is operating from the Labour Court building, is well aware of the fact that there are queues to get a hearing before the Court.  That is quite common.  There is a lot of dissatisfaction in that connection.  Some people who have served strike notice seek to have their cases heard.  In some cases the case is heard and in others it is not.  Often it is said to depend on whom you are working for whether or not you will be able to jump that queue.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us <Col N="1730" /> what his intentions are, not only in regard to increasing the number of conciliation officers but how he intends to recruit them.  Having regard to the existing officers, does he intend to enable them to acquaint themselves with what are now being described as modern techniques?  I can well understand the predicament conciliation officers often find themselves in when trying to get knowledge of particular operations because they have not been afforded an opportunity of making a study of people actually in employment. This is something I would ask the Minister to consider seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was going to have a senior officer of his Department to maintain contact with both sides, for the purpose, I presume, of keeping peace.  How will this senior officer fit in with the Labour Court? Will he be responsible to the Minister or to the Labour Court proper?  Will he be a kind of arbitrator who will be outside the Labour Court?  What will his role be?  Will he come in before conciliation conferences take place? Will he come into the matter before or after the Labour Court hearing? We are entitled to have some more information about this to decide whether it is a good or bad idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to great lengths in talking about the importance of raising production and increasing employment. In that connection, he has been found to be making threats as far as the trade union movement is concerned, threats which I know are very much resented by the rank and file members of the movement, never mind the people who represent them. It is about time the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, turned their sights on the other side and talked to management, telling them what they should or should not be doing in this important matter of increasing production and employment.  We seldom, if ever, hear talk of that kind from the Minister. Perhaps it is due to the fact that there is a considerable number of representatives of management in the Fianna Fáil Party.  We also know they contribute to a great extent to the Fianna Fáil coffers.  There is no doubt <Col N="1731" /> about this.  This is what we have to have an understanding about.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks to the workers about increasing production, he should try to get more information about the difficulties often placed before workers in trying to increase production. I do not expect the Minister to be familiar with the operations of every factory in the State; neither do I expect his principal advisers to be familiar with them.  But I think the time has come for the Minister and his advisers to familiarise themselves to a greater extent with the operations in factories and the attitude of management.  It often happens that workers will be sweating their guts out to increase production and are prevented from succeeding by the stupid and foolish actions of the management, with different directors coming into the factory and giving contradictory instructions.  This happens in many factories in Dublin.  Do not blame the trade union movement for that.  It is happening, and nothing is being done about it.  What gave rise to that is that we have people who are directors of this company, that company and the other.  The only thing they look for is profit which is all they believe in.  If mistakes are made, the worker is blamed.  This type of thing should be exposed.  It is extremely unfair for the Minister to speak as he did and refrain from mentioning the employer's side.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Minister for Transport and Power changed his attitude.  It will not suffice for Deputy Dowling to profess to be a trade unionist and say the Minister is endeavouring to do all he possibly can in this matter.  In many things said by Deputy Dowling, he was simply expressing himself as a disappointed trade union official.  It is well known that he tried to become a trade union official on a few occasions and was rejected.  Now he is going to take it out on the trade union movement. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I am sure that when the Minister warns the workers about the advisability of increasing production, he <Col N="1732" /> must or should be conscious of why workers seek an increase in wages.  It is not for fun; most times they are made seek increases by actions of the Government.  It seems that the Minister in his pronouncements of this kind is not familiar with pronouncements made by fellow Ministers.  For instance, how does he expect workers to face up to the results of the instruction given by the Minister for Local Government regarding rent increases? Recently, in Cavan, the Minister for Local Government said that the price of houses and the profits on them were fantastic, but the workers must find the money to keep pace with these exorbitant prices.  So long as this continues, workers will have to seek wage increases.  Also, if you increase rents, you will have the same situation&mdash;it postulates a further increase in wages.  Conscious of the increase in house prices and excessive profits, the Minister for Local Government is at the same time urging that something should be done to inflate the rents of Dublin Corporation houses.</P>
    <P>You have the other situation when the Minister did say, by way of compliment to the Fianna Fáil Party, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now talking about the Minister for Labour.  The Minister, at column 1431 of Volume 226 of the Official Report, said:</P>
      <P>The greatest restraint will also be necessary in prices.  Some part of the slow down in the increase in the consumer price index in the latter part of 1966 must be due to the exercise of the Government's powers of price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I am sure the Minister is aware of the price increases that came about and have been referred to by RGDATA.  They have pointed out that increases were sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which were not publicly known.  In other words, the shopkeepers passed them on, the manufacturers having got <Col N="1733" /> permission to increase prices.  When people realise what has happened, you will have another round of increases. The Minister may do as much as he likes, take any action he wishes, but he cannot stave off people doing the natural thing, seeking to obtain the wherewithal to meet the increases. Inevitably, that is what the Minister is letting himself in for.</P>
    <P>Having regard to this line of example being set by some Ministers, the Minister for Labour should have regard to this and perhaps comment on it: between all the State Departments there are thousands of lowly-paid and badlytreated workers and if we are to advocate retraining, aptitude tests, redundancy payments and so on, it would not be a bad thing if the Minister for Labour particularly, seeing that he is now responsible, I understand, for securing employment, would set about having an understanding with his Cabinet colleagues and get them all to agree to treat their employees, underpaid workers in various Departments&mdash; not the highly paid civil servants&mdash; properly.  Then he can begin to talk down to other people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones and Deputy Dowling spoke about the desirability of preventing disputes.  This is very desirable.  I can understand Deputy Jones making a suggestion to cope with the problem such as he described where you have a factory in which the majority of the workers may be affected by a minority demand.  He made the point that the minority should have regard to the majority feeling in that sort of situation and to what would be the consequences of a strike.  There is such a thing as the function of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Deputy Dowling knows that.  There is such a body as the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  Deputy Dowling knows that, although he was never a delegate to it. The Congress has a regulation requiring its constituent members to notify Congress of their intention to enter into a trade dispute.  The purpose of that is twofold, to advise all constituent unions and also afford Congress an opportunity of endeavouring to avoid a dispute.  Insufficient credit is given for that.  Many disputes have been settled <Col N="1734" /> because of that Congress function.</P>
    <P>The same situation exists in the trades councils, the Dublin Council of Trade Unions and the other councils throughout the State that have similar functions.  You must give notice to the Dublin Council of your intention before you serve strike notice.  That notice must expire and it gives the council an opportunity to settle the dispute. This is commendable but we did not hear anything from the Minister about it.  We just had a rap on the knuckles and were told, if we did not keep quiet, what would happen.  Very good work has been done outside the Labour Court by officials of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In that connection, it is only right to say that the State and the community owe a great deal to the services of Mr. Leo Crawford, who was Joint Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions up to last year, and has since retired.  It was by the actions of people like him that you had disputes averted and certainly not by threats by the Minister who has been told by his advisers that this is the way to talk down to the workers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to bringing about circumstances in which working people will know or be able to ascertain readily their entitlements while in employment.  There is too much of a mystery about this.  The Minister has been asked to do something about it. I was surprised he made no mention of it.  The late Deputy Norton did something in his time about it.  It is about time the working class people were informed that when they go into their place of employment on a wet morning, they are entitled to put their clothes in a drying room and to have a drying room there for them, that they are entitled to proper canteen facilities, that they are entitled to proper cloakroom and toilet facilities, that they are entitled to proper ventilation and heating.  This, of course, postulates that the inspectors will be on their toes.  Heaven help the small band of inspectors: there will be only 28 of them.  How they are to get around all this I do not know. Perhaps the work may be made much easier if more publicity is given to the <Col N="1735" /> entitlements of the workers.  They would be a check, then, to employers who very often disregard such entitlements.</P>

      <P>To listen to some of the Labour spokesmen, one would think there was no such thing as a good employer and that they were all ogres.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Mullen say that the Training Bill was in the hands of the Minister or in his Department.  This Bill has passed through all Stages in the House and through the Seanad and, at the moment, the Minister is waiting for this Training Bill to be sent back from the Seanad.  It is deplorable that a member of the Labour Party who purports to be interested in the welfare of the workers should not even know about the passage of this Bill through the Dáil.  It is typical of the type of statement we hear from the Labour benches in particular &mdash; irresponsible and completely without any regard to actual fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Mullen is as much in touch with the members of his trade union as he is with the business that goes on in this House, then I feel very sorry for the members of that union. It is unfortunate that members of trade unions in this country are not looking on to see what is going on within their unions.  They are satisfied to leave it to a few men whom they elect to the executive.  In the latter part of last year, the Minister said that about three per cent of the registered union members actually vote at these elections.  Is it any wonder, then, that they get irresponsible leadership?  I believe there are some good union leaders in this country, but I am also aware that there are some very irresponsible union leaders, men who have but one motive, that is the furtherance of the Labour Party in this House, Dáil Éireann.  They will foster any unrest which they can create amongst the workers.  They are preaching hate and distrust to the workers. Everything this Government try to do to protect the rights of the workers is represented by certain trade union representatives as not being really for the workers but for the employers.  One <Col N="1736" /> would think there were some shame in profit.</P>

      <P>Later on, we listened to the tragedy queen of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon.  He said, in his usual dramatic manner that, on one occasion, he was electioneering down in Ballina and somebody asked him what happens if the trade unions and the employers do not agree.  Deputy Dillon's reply was: &ldquo;Then I have failed&rdquo;.  This is the Fine Gael policy towards trying to bring the trade union leaders and the employers together&mdash; that, if they cannot agree, it is none of his business.</P>
      <P>Every time I have heard Deputy Dillon speak, he has forecast disaster. For many years I have listened to his forebodings and prophecies of disaster.

It is clear to me that the Fine Gael Party can achieve power again only as a result of a disaster hitting this country.

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Labour has presented in his Estimate to Dáil Éireann this year a very full range of activities of his Department and particulars of the various steps he is taking to implement the policy of his Department and of the Government. We have no choice about EEC.  If Britain goes in, we have to go in.  We have to prepare ourselves, in that event.  In any case, it is a worthy exercise to prepare for free trade and to increase our competitiveness by modernising our various industries.  The Minister has done a great deal in this regard.  There has been much comment about the motorcar industry where workers may find themselves unemployed in the assembly business.  What do the Opposition expect this Government to do?  If we will have to trade under free trade conditions, then it is clear that some of our industries cannot survive and we must try to find ways and means of retraining the workers concerned for other trades.  That is one of the most difficult things to do, but if we do not prepare for free trade and do not go into the EEC, every worker will go down.  I am convinced that there are some people in this country hellbent on their own destruction and not caring whom they bring down with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a very responsible speech.  He has indicated the need for negotiation.  When he wanted proposals to be sent in by the unions for changes in the legislation which any fairminded Labour man or union man would agree are necessary, not one proposal came from the unions. Therefore, the Minister had to put forward his own proposals and these, of course, were all knocked down by the various officials of the unions who objected to them without putting forward any alternative suggestion.  I have not heard one constructive suggestion or even one destructive suggestion from either Labour or Fine Gael in this debate as to what the Government should do in these circumstances.  It is about time the rank and file members of the unions started to look at the statements issued by their responsible unions in order to discover if they are <Col N="1739" /> true.  I have yet to hear of a union calling in any independent authority to assess the state of the economy.  They are all the time coming in with biassed reports.</P>
    <P>During the last year we witnessed a recession which the Government handled exceedingly well but, in spite of that, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party continue to state that the Government by their policy are creating unemployment.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  New industries are being established and efforts are made to attract more industries.</P>
    <P>We all know the record of strikes in the past few years in this country.  Our name has gone abroad as being a country where the strike situation is very grim.  A great factor in attracting industry is stability.  There is a stable Government in this country, thank God.  If the members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party were sincere in what they say, they would be backing the Government all the way and proposing measures which the Government could take.  On the contrary, there is no suggestion from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that he is setting up placement officers within the labour exchanges to place people in employment and to take note of their qualifications.  This is an excellent move.  Nothing has been said in this connection other than the criticism that there are not enough details.  I do not know what further details one needs.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, I should like to say a word about a number of the staff of the labour exchanges.  Not all of them, but some of them, treat the unemployed man who comes in to register as if he were a bit of dirt, as if it were a tremendous shame to be unemployed.  The manner of some of these people towards unfortunate applicants is deplorable.  I should like the Minister to look into this question and to engage somebody to give talks to the rank and file members of labour exchanges and a simple course in humanity, to teach them that they are dealing with real people who have <Col N="1740" /> feelings and who are not proud of the situation in which they find themselves. These people should be taught to have a more humanitarian attitude in their work.  They are dealing with individuals, not with ciphers.</P>
    <P>I understand that discussions are still taking place with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers as to the type of disputes that have taken place during the past few years and how industrial disputes can be avoided. This is an excellent thing.  It is about time union leaders began to have a more responsible approach to this matter and ceased making political capital.  The worst thing for labour generally in Ireland&mdash;not the Labour Party but labour&mdash;is the fact that they are involved in politics and therefore most of their statements are suspect. The worker has been used shamefully by the Labour Party.  He has been used as a stick with which to hit the Government.  The Minister has been accused of waving the big stick, of threatening the unions that if they do not make certain recommendations the Dáil will have to do the work for them.  It is not exactly that the Minister plans to put anyone in jail who would take part in an unofficial strike. The whole idea behind the Minister's statement is to strengthen trade union law, to implement certain proposals which will make certain types of strikes illegal, as was done last year under the Electricity Supply Board (Employees) Act.  This was to protect the workers from themselves and was applauded by the whole country as being necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to shop stewards.  In many factories throughout the country the man elected as shop steward is the man who says that he is not afraid to talk to the boss but who may not be qualified to negotiate on behalf of the workers.  Because he says he is not afraid to wave the big stick at the boss, he is elected.  He may be ambitious for promotion within the union.  He engages in a very aggressive form of stewardship on behalf of the workers and may not fully realise what the management may be explaining to him.  It is shameful that unions have <Col N="1741" /> neglected to educate their members to be able to negotiate at top level with management.  Frequently one finds young shop stewards who have been waving the big stick being promoted to branch secretary.  If they do not continue to demand and to obtain concessions for the workers, they are out. Therefore, regardless of what they may see the situation to be and regardless of the fact that they realise that management cannot afford to make certain concessions, they press for them because they know that if they do not do so, they will be dismissed by the workers.  This happens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that the employer should pick the shop stewards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that at all.  To listen to the Opposition, one would think the Minister was directing all his remarks against the worker. This is not so.  The Minister has directed many of his remarks towards management.  In fact, he said in his opening speech:</P>
      <P>The country requires, at this time, (i) that managements should intensify and expedite their efforts to modernise and adapt their undertakings and expand production....</P>
      <P>What does that mean&mdash;to modernise and adapt their undertakings?  That means to plough back profits into expanding their factories and improving their premises.  This is one of the things in which every worker should be interested, for the welfare not alone of himself but of future generations&mdash;of building up a good strong industrial country.</P>
      <P>The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>... that a substantial improvement in productivity should be assured before there is any general increase in money incomes or other developments which would lead to increased costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we price ourselves out of markets and factories have to close down, then again the Labour Party will be on the wagon: &ldquo;You see, we told you&rdquo;.  The public memory is very short and the Labour Party know this.  They will forget about the time when the Labour <Col N="1742" /> Party were exhorting the Government, and the trade union officials of the Labour Party were exhorting management to give increased wages to workers, when the industry could not stand it at that particular rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister further states:</P>
    <P>Otherwise, there is a real danger of people losing their jobs and a certainty that the purchasing power of the wage packet will decline.</P>
    <P>He means if these reckless demands continue to be sent in.  When production costs rise, the cost of the finished article rises.  Therefore, the consumer has to pay more.  This is something every child in kindergarten knows by now, anyway.</P>
    <P>This Government want industrial peace; this country wants industrial peace and it is about time the Opposition Parties stopped trying to sabotage the country, which is having a very great effect I am sure, in discouraging people and making the workers feel there is no future for them.  It is about time, too, the workers began to take note of the kind of exhorting the Labour Party in this Dáil are engaging in on their behalf, without any sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Every single thing this Government have ever done has been criticised by Fine Gael and Labour.  When we started this industrial revival some years ago, Deputy Dillon spoke of tinshack industries and described various works as badly-run relief schemes. These people have no faith in the people of this country to produce.  We are quite capable of competing with other countries.  Every single facility is being given to people to produce.  We must try to be a bit big, to explain to the workers, as it is known to the Members on the opposite benches, that we must produce first.  Social welfare benefits, education, health, all those things are as a result of what we can produce.  The same applies to any household with its budget: it has so much to spend on food, clothing, heating and everything else.  Priorities follow, starting off with food, rent and so on.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House much further except to say that I do not expect my humble little speech to <Col N="1743" /> have any effect at all on the speeches that will follow from the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  I do not envy the Minister his most difficult task of trying to bring the various parties together.  I know he enjoys tremendous goodwill and the respect of the various members of the unions and employers' bodies and this Party is very proud of the way in which he is conducting his job as Minister for Labour.  It is the first time we have had a Minister for Labour and he is the man who will be looked up to in years to come as the great architect of the schemes we have to-day.  My colleague has brought my attention to the fact that Countess Markievicz was a Minister for Labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sorely tempted this evening, listening to Deputy Briscoe's optimistic expression that nobody following him would pass any remarks on his speech.  I agree he has put the correct assessment on it, but hearing a minicapitalist like Deputy Briscoe coming in here to criticise the trade union movement and trade union officials in this House would make one sick, because Deputy Briscoe knows nothing whatever of what he is talking about.</P>

The sheer audacity of anybody in the Fianna Fáil benches, particularly somebody like Deputy Briscoe, to suggest that the people who are elected by the general body of the trade union movement have not that right, to suggest that the people who are elected as shop stewards have not the right to speak for those who elect them, to suggest that they are not educated&mdash;&ldquo;educated&rdquo; was the word he used&mdash;in the proper way, that those who want to make trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Briscoe and now I intend to deal out a fair share of the medicine. Deputy Briscoe is talking about decent, respectable people.  I know, because I have been on a picket line and I know that nobody goes on strike just because he wants to displease Deputy Briscoe, the Minister or anybody else.  Workers go on strike when circumstances force them so to do.  It is, perhaps, something about which Deputy Briscoe and his pals know nothing; it is the democratic right and the democratic vote by which those people decide to go on strike. When they do, it is they who suffer, not the gentlemen who sit behind the glass doors and wait for the workers to be starved into going back to work, the modern William Martin Murphys of this country.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, as long as we are here and as long as we have the right to speak for the workers who put us here, we shall do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mind you, I would like to remind Deputy Briscoe, speaking for myself, that I come here representing several thousand trade unionists, several thousand businessmen and several thousand farmers and I do not have to listen to people like Deputy Briscoe, who get a handful of votes in Dublin. He comes in here apparently trying to impress some people in this House that the workers were codded into going on <Col N="1745" /> strike by the trade unions.  If he had sufficient sense to go into the case, he would find out that trade union officials do not take such action unless there is a very good reason for their wanting their members to go on strike. Does anybody think they want to throw away the money which has been so hard earned, so hard fought for and so hard collected by the very same people to whom it must be paid out?</P>
    <P>They do it because they know the only way the people, who elected them to office, democratically, can get what they want from the employers who, in 1967, have not yet realised they cannot get away with the bullying tactics which they apparently think they can put across on the workers of this country, is to go on strike.  This refers not alone to private employers but people in this city and elsewhere who are in charge of semi-State companies. Indeed, we have the situation where State bodies have refused to meet the trade unions to discuss very important matters such as sick pay, which is generally accepted now in outside employment, a shorter working week and decent wages.  When those things needed to be discussed, some of them would be deferred not for six months but for nine months, 12 months and two years because the State would not meet the trade union.</P>
    <P>Almost two years ago two State Departments met trade unions representing some of their workers.  We are still awaiting a decision on that.  Last week they notified us they were holding talks as to when they would be in a position to discuss matters which were discussed two years ago.  Why is this? It is for the very simple reason that they feel the workers concerned cannot go on strike.  If they could go on strike, and if they could hold up everything in this country, the very important matters they want to get clear would be cleared up overnight.  The Minister for Labour, according to the statement made last Thursday, will be continuing along those lines.</P>
    <P>During the year gone by we had a wage increase negotiated, as the Minister said, between the employers and the trade unions and, because Ministerial sanction was required, the date <Col N="1746" /> of operation of that was put forward two months simply because the State wanted to save on the lower paid employees.  Deputy Briscoe should note that in the Minister's speech, not alone did he threaten the workers and the trade unions, if they want to insist on getting wage improvements, but he threatened the employers because he referred to the fact that there were certain employers who were conceding this.  He said they were improving working conditions in the State.</P>

Does he not realise that the infamous Act, which Deputy Briscoe was so proud of a few minutes ago, the Act which forced the ESB workers to go back to work, could not be operated because of the fact that no matter what you do, the State has not found any way to make a worker work if he does not want to work.</P>

      <P>The Government should realise that when they talk about bringing in penal measures to force the workers to do something they do not want to do, they are only wasting the time of this House.  If the situation has to be brought to the test, I can assure the Minister the workers of this country will not be coerced into doing something which they do not want to do and neither will they be prevented from doing something which they want to do.  As far as the Minister is concerned, we all appreciate his kindness, his courtesy, and there is nothing personal in our attack on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe displayed his abysmal ignorance when he said that no suggestions had been made.  The Minister might tell him about all the memoranda which he got from the trade unions and from various Labour Party people who are trade union <Col N="1747" /> officials, and who are also members of the Labour Party in this House, who went along and had discussions with his officials for hours and hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not know the first thing about this. If he did, I would not have to tell him&mdash;he can check this with the Department of Labour&mdash;what took place. Not alone does the Deputy not know the answers; he does not even know the questions.  The situation as I see it is that we have the Minister for Labour introducing his first Estimate. Somebody said to me: &ldquo;Maybe it is not very big.  It is less than £1 million. Departments look for millions.&rdquo;  The Minister has broken up his Estimate fairly well.  One of the things which most of us here are anxious to know is what in fact the Minister has in store, apart from the stick he has, for the workers and apart from the threatened wage freeze?  It is an extraordinary thing that while we have heard an announcement about an incomes policy, when we take all the cover away from it an incomes policy develops simply into a wage freeze.  No other income comes into it: it is just wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is it proposed to do with the Labour Court?  Is it suggested that it will become a court of arbitration? Is it suggested, as the Minister suggested in his Bill, that there will be a situation where people going to the Labour Court can go there only if they agree beforehand that they will accept the ruling of the conciliation officers?  Is the present system to continue or are we to have a new system? Are we to have the present unsatisfactory position where people sent to the Labour Court as conciliation officers, and who develop over the years a knack of settling disputes, which is what they are there for, suddenly find that the only avenue of promotion for them is out of the Labour Court and back into some office of a Government Department?  Will the Minister not consider that there will <Col N="1748" /> be promotion there for conciliation officers, that there will be promotion up the ladder and that he will not take out those people who are there at present?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware also that there are not enough conciliation officers and that it is nothing unusual to have to wait several months before a conciliation officer can be made available to have a dispute considered? Is he aware that we had an employer where a dispute started over dark time last October and the bright days had come before a conciliation officer could be supplied to consider the dispute? It got him over it last winter but it will not get him out of it next winter as far as training and reduction in hours, which will solve the problem, are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to training and I would like his comments on that. There seems to be confusion as to who is to be trained.  The Minister says farm workers are not to be included, but that when people engaged in agriculture move into any other sphere, they will be included.  If a farm worker gets a job as a road worker for a day, he will come under the Bill.  The people causing the main trouble in this country, as far as industry is concerned, are the people coming off agriculture and the Government have sidestepped by leaving them completely out of the Bill.  The result is that these people cannot, and will not, be trained.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to a question I asked him last year.  For what are they to be trained?</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe seems to be pleased that factories are springing up all over the place.  There was one out on the Naas Road.  There is one closed down in Finglas.  These factories seem to be getting a lot of money but I should like to know whether the factories to be supplied with new tools are in Ireland, or whether the important machinery to be supplied here will be put into factories abroad.  Is that how we will put people into factories for training workers?  Will there be State control in the training of workers? Will we have almost 75,000 people looking for jobs?  Will we say that <Col N="1749" /> there is a Bill going through under which they will be retrained?</P>
    <P>It requires more than a bland statement by a Minister to solve the problem. The Minister has all our sympathy but not as much as we have for the unfortunates who are going to the labour exchange.  Some people think that those who go to the labour exchange get easy money.  Deputy Briscoe and his type should thank God that they never had to go to a labour exchange. I had to go, and I know how horrible it is to have to line up to get the wherewithal to keep body and soul together.  In the labour exchange the question of jobs does not arise.  The labour exchange knows nothing about that aspect.  All they are concerned with is that you sign on the dotted line.  If you have a certain number of stamps for a certain period, you get a paltry sum of money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the fact that the staff in the labour exchanges, are rude to some of the people who go in.  There are people in many walks of life who are not suited to the jobs they are doing.  No mercy should be shown to people who are not prepared to do the job they are paid for doing.  I wonder how some of us would react if we were behind a grille all day looking at people coming in signing on the dotted line and taking money.  I know that those people who are handing out the money are getting their week's wages, but I am quite sure there are better jobs in the country than those in the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not facing up to his responsibility if he simply says that the Bill will help in retraining.  All our Governments, and I am not excepting the inter-Party Governments, appreciate the fact that unemployment is a national emergency.  We should do something about it.  It is no use saying that we had that number of unemployed last year and the same the year before and that there is nothing we can do but accept that.</P>

      <P>Last year we had the extraordinary situation&mdash;indeed it happens every year&mdash;that towards the end of the season in various jobs men were declared redundant because there was no more money available for their particular job until the new money, as they call it, comes in on 31st March.  I am talking about public works.  These men go on the labour exchange.  If they have a family, it is quite possible they receive as much as, if not a little more, than when they were working.  They would rather work for the money they get, but because one Department of State cannot pay its way, the other Department of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of people are leaving the country.  Of course, they are relieving the Government of an awful lot of the trouble the Government would find themselves in if those people remained here.  It is a remarkable thing that those who have left are mainly people who, had they remained here, would be able to deal with the Government at election time. Therefore, it suits the Government that they should move off and having moved off, there is no responsibility for them.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the EEC and the Free Trade Agreement with Britain.  The Minister refers to competition with Britain and to the fact that we must work harder in order to be competitive on the British market.  We warned the Government when the Agreement was being ratified that this situation was likely to arise.  It has, in fact, built up to such an extent that we now have people out of work because tariffs are being cut.  The Taoiseach commented to me when I remarked about this that surely a ten per cent cut would not have much effect.  The Minister is aware of the fact that, not alone is it not having much effect, but that when the next ten per cent comes off in July the situation will be worse.  I am saying this because I know it is a fact and because the Government should be aware of it.  The fault is theirs, not the fault of the Labour Party or anybody else.  The Government should make provision to meet this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe said that &ldquo;profit&rdquo; was not a dirty word.  Of course it is not.  I am sure everybody in this House knows about industries making substantial profits.  One shilling of this profit is never ploughed back into the industry.  Nobody ever sees that the old chap living in the house on the hill&mdash;the owner of the industry&mdash;has actually been collecting money over the years.  In most cases this money has been invested abroad.  When the industry is no longer able to compete, <Col N="1752" /> all the owner has to do is get what he can and take a boat out of the country and he is a happy man.</P>

      <P>The Chair commented on Deputy Mullen's reference to prices.  The Minister brought the question of prices into this.  I want to repeat what Deputy Mullen said.  So long as prices go up, we will have a continuation of the demand for higher wages.  No trade union wants to see its members making demands for increased wages, if the wage they have is a fair one, but so long as prices go up, these demands will continue.  I am sure the Minister has seen in the newspapers that the leaders of the various unions have made it quite clear that they do not want to see a demand for an 11th round of increases started. They have advised their members not to start an 11th round demand unless prices get completely out of hand. They get very little thanks from their traducers.  They are branded as people who are trying to foment strikes.  The trade union movement spend a lot more time trying to settle strikes than they do in trying to organise them&mdash;a lot more time.  It is rather a pity that this is not appreciated by those who want to condemn and criticise them.</P>
      <P>On the whole question of wages, the Minister says he does not believe there should be further increases.  I will quote him because I think he is looking at me rather quizzically.  As reported at column 1432, volume 226 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a real prospect that some unions will press claims, which, if conceded, will raise industrial <Col N="1753" /> costs to non-competitive levels, leading to a loss of orders, a loss of production and a loss of jobs. Further there is evidence that some employers are disposed to concede claims even where they realise that their firms must lose business and reduce staff as a result.</P>
    <P>Both employers and unions have difficult decisions to face&mdash;the employer to concede a claim his industry cannot meet without damage, or face the dislocation caused by a strike; the union executive to do what he can say is his job in pressing for what his members demand, or risk unpopularity by refusing to give support to demands which he knows are too much for now or are coming too fast for the community&mdash;the community, of course, including his own members.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>If, having warned of the inevitable consequences, first, of income increases or other charges in excess of the growth of production, whether arranged by negotiation or secured by industrial action, and second, of misuse of the procedures for dealing with industrial disputes, we still find these damaging practices persisting, the Government will be compelled to come to the House for the powers necessary to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware that his Department in dealing with workers are dealing not only with men on £20 or £25 a week but also with men who still have a gross wage of £9 per week only&mdash;some in State employment.  Does the Minister suggest that there should be no increase for those workers?  Does the Minister suggest that there should be a blanket refusal to increase wages or allow wages to increase?  The Minister must know that if there is no general wage increase, there is not a snowball's chance in hell of getting an increase for the type of workers to whom I have referred.  This is an aspect which no Government so far have been prepared to face up to. Now that a new Ministry of Labour has been set up, an effort should be <Col N="1754" /> made to try to bring up the scandalously low wages for which some workers are still forced to work.</P>
    <P>I am quite well aware that when a wage increase takes place, everyone else thinks he should get it.  I am also aware of the fact that there are thousands of workers who, despite what many people in this House and elsewhere may think, are living at starvation level.  Any man who has £9 per week gross income, with deductions for superannuation and social welfare benefits taken from him, will find that he has very little to take home to his wife and family.  I appeal to the Minister when he is making up his mind finally on this to try not to exclude these people from getting a fair increase in their take home wages. There is a grave danger that they will be left behind.  There is a grave danger that they will be left as they were before one of the scandals which this country will never live down, when during the emergency period, during the war years, we had agricultural workers producing food not only for the people here but also for the people across the water in Britain, and getting £2 a week, while in industry and elsewhere wages of £9 10s were easily obtainable.  There was no question of their wages being allowed to go up because there was an embargo on agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question of prices in any great detail, but I want to refer to the failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to live up to the promise he made last July that he would allow RGDATA to publish, on notification from him, every increase in prices which he sanctioned.  That has now been countermanded with the obvious intention of hiding real increases in prices.  If the Minister for Labour does not take cognisance of this and take the necessary steps, we will have a continuing demand for increased wages because there will be increased prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews gave us the benefit of his long experience in dealing with the unfortunate lower paid workers. Like Deputy Briscoe, of course, I am sure he knows all about running a trade <Col N="1755" /> union and how shop stewards and officials are appointed.</P>

He talked about the other things a trade union can do besides looking for wages.  I am afraid Deputy Andrews, out of the depths of his ignorance, was talking about something he knew absolutely nothing about.  I am sure these young men will be here long after some of us older Deputies have gone, and they will be pillars of wisdom, but I am afraid that at the <Col N="1756" /> moment the pillars of wisdom they claim to be are simply made of salt.  I suggest that they should do their homework a little better before coming in here and lecturing people who have already done their homework and know their job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state in respect of each State-sponsored board or company for which he is responsible (1)  the date on which and the authority under which it was constituted, (2)  the names of the directors, designating those who are civil servants and also those who are wholetime employed by such board or company, and the manner in which each director is appointed, (3)  the amount of share or loan capital or advances made to each and not repaid at the present time and the terms of repayments, if any, of such amounts, (4)  the amount received by each during the last available financial year from (a)  voted moneys, (b)  the Central Fund, (c)  licence or similar fees paid to it by the public and (d)  sales, (5)  the amount of capital (a) expended during each of the three years ended 31st March, 1966 and estimated to be expended in the current year and (b)  for which commitments have been announced, (6)  the remuneration paid to each director and to each of the five principal executives in each organisation, and (7)  the names of the auditors to each such organisation and how they were appointed (i.e. by statute, the <Col N="1642" /> Minister or the company) and, if the company, how the shares giving the right to vote on such appointments are held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the bodies for which I am the responsible Minister has share or loan capital or has advances outstanding; none of them is engaged in activities involving sales to, or collection of licence fees from, the public; and none is in receipt of funds from the sources mentioned in the question.  The bodies are generally engaged in the provision of medical services, or services ancillary to medicine, and in the majority of them the function of the senior executive staffs are combined with medical functions.  In these circumstances, I assume that the Deputy requires information, as provided by my predecessor in reply to a similar general question last year, only in regard to bodies the members of which are remunerated, or in relation to which the Minister has any function in the appointment of auditors.  On that basis the information requested is as follows:&mdash;</P>
