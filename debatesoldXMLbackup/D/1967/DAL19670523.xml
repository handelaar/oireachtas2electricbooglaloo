      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the terms of General de Gaulle's press conference statement with regard to Britain's application to join the EEC, he will state what action, if any, the Government propose to take in respect of the application of this country to join the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on any change in Ireland's position as applicant for membership of the EEC as a result of President de Gaulle's recent press conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I have studied President de Gaulle's press conference statement on Britain's application to join the European Economic Community.  In relation to our application, no action is called for at this stage beyond that already intended.  As Deputies are no doubt aware, the British Prime Minister has indicated that his Government intend to pursue their application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say when negotiations are expected to commence on our application and if he is now in a position to say when a debate will take place here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say at this <Col N="1302" /> stage when negotiations are likely to commence.  As to when a debate will be taken.  I would prefer, if possible, that at least some of my visits to the capitals of the Six would have been made before we would have a debate because I feel that a debate in such circumstances would probably be more meaningful.  I certainly would hope to have the debate next month.  I would hope not to delay it too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say when he proposes to start his tour of the capitals of the Six and, also, is it proposed to make a separate approach on behalf of this country to the French President concerning our application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to visit each Member country and, appropriately, I should think that I would have a meeting with the Prime Minister of each country.  If it can be arranged, I should like to meet the President of the French Republic but I do not know if that will be possible yet.  I doubt if the visits could commence now before the summit meeting due to take place in Rome next week. I hope they will commence after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether the statement on Britain's application by General de Gaulle was totally unexpected by him, and not to have been by Mr. Wilson?  Further, will he say whether he thinks it necessary to have further consultation with Mr. Wilson before he sees the Heads of State in the other EEC countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>General de Gaulle's statement was not totally unexpected to me.  As I said already in a speech elsewhere, I regarded his attitude as rather more oncoming now than in 1963 when negotiations were broken off.  What was the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if the Taoiseach thinks it would be necessary now to have further consultation with Mr. Wilson before he meets the Heads of State of the other EEC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor visited the capitals of the Six in connection with our initial application.  In the meantime, our contacts were being maintained through the normal channels in the capitals of the Six as well as with the Commission of the EEC itself through ministerial and official contacts. I do not think it would have been appropriate before now to seek the meetings I have now sought with the Heads of Government of the Six.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we can understand from contacts already made, the attitude is quite favourably disposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Favourably disposed? Does this mean more favourably disposed to our application than to Britain's application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to weigh one against the other.  I do not know what is in the General's mind in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, in view of the proposed deferring of the debate, the Taoiseach may reconsider the suggestion that a White Paper be issued informing the Dáil and the country of the up-to-date position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that, apart from the representations made to the Board by the Deputy in March last, they have no record of any application in this case in recent years.  The Board are arranging to quote terms to the person in question and if he accepts and has his house wired electricity will be made available as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ask the Board to take into account that the applicant is not a person of very substantial means, and will he ask the Board to make the greatest possible effort to provide supply to this applicant at what would be to him an economic rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that there are four potential consumers in the townland of Forest, County Dublin.  The question of supply to these persons has been under consideration for some time past.  It was necessary to determine that an overhead supply to the consumers would not cause interference with airport operations.  It is expected that an acceptable route for a line will be settled very shortly and that the ESB will then be in a position to offer supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them do.  The first £20 will now be completely free of rates.  Prior to this, the first £20 was relieved to the extent of 80 per cent and the remainder to the extent of 30 per cent.  Now the first £20 will be totally relieved, so that a person with £21 valuation will now pay on £1 of that valuation, whereas prior to this he paid on £4.7.  It is graded down.  A person on £33 valuation will now pay on £13, whereas prior to this he paid on £13.1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what his attitude is in the matter of the application of differential rents by local authorities; whether he has ever recommended that such rents should be imposed upon existing, fixed-rent tenants or upon new tenancies only, and if, in view of existing confusion on the matter, he will state the position of local authorities in so far as power to fix rents, either non-variable or differential, is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and Management) Regulations, 1967, made by me under sections 44 and 58 and other relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1966, provide that the payment of housing subsidy will be conditional on lettings of new dwellings being in accordance with a rents scheme approved by me which takes account of the financial circumstances of the household and the standard of accommodation and amenity of the dwellings. Under these provisions, subsidy will not be paid for any new houses let in future at a fixed rent.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities can increase the fixed rents of existing houses without my sanction.  However, in order to qualify for subsidy, they must have regard in making such increases to the requirement in the regulations to charge income-related rents for all dwellings &ldquo;as soon as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About half of the housing authorities in the country, including Dublin Corporation and Wicklow Urban Council, have adopted rent schemes which I would regard as complying with the requirements of the regulations. Some thousands of poorer tenants have benefited by rent reductions under these schemes, while no one has been asked to pay, in rent, a disprotionate share of his income.  In regard to the remaining authorities, I consider <Col N="1309" /> that the decision as to when or how it is &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; to adopt schemes is a matter in the first instance for them, subject to review by me in due course in connection with the subsidy payments.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I would stress that housing authorities should bear in mind that the object of current policies is to ensure that no one in need of housing is refused it or is forced to pay a rent beyond what he can reasonably afford; that current subsidies for housing paid by the tax and rate payers, amounting now to more than £6 million a year are distributed equitably so that those most in need qualify for the greatest measure of assistance; and that the rate of increase in overall subsidy payments&mdash;estimated at up to more than £1 million a year cumulative, every three years for a programme of 4,000 local authority houses annually&mdash;does not absorb resources essential for the construction of new houses for those who so badly need them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject the suggestion that the customs were in any way responsible for causing annoyance to the organisers of the meeting referred to by the Deputy.  On the contrary the customs staff at Dún Laoghaire and at the Custom House went out of their way to facilitate them.</P>
      <P>Basic requirements such as filling up the appropriate entry forms, obtaining a duty-free licence for certain items and providing security for the duty on other items were not attended to by the importers before the material arrived on 10th May even though the procedure had been explained to them in writing beforehand.  After the matter had again been carefully explained to them the importers set about doing what was necessary and in this they were guided and assisted at all stages by the customs staff.</P>
      <P>All the material was released on 11th May, four days before the conference was due to begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our policy to waive payment of duty, as far as possible, on goods being imported for use at conferences of this sort.  Where the goods come within the <Col N="1317" /> scope of the international convention on the subject, they are granted exemption from duty and in other cases duty-free licences are issued.  The application of these procedures in the present case enabled a large quantity of conference material comprising some 40 different classes of goods, including rule books, to be imported without payment of duty, the only exceptions being badges and ball-point pens.  In the case of these two items the ordinary provisions authorising the issue of duty-free licences did not apply and duty was, therefore, correctly charged.</P>
    <P>I should add that a general review of licensing provisions is being carried out at present as a result of which we should be able to avoid this sort of difficulty in the future.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I am satisfied that the facilities for the importation of conference material are adequate.</P>

      <P>The Bill now being drafted was envisaged in the White Paper on Law Reform which was published by my Department in 1962.  It will provide for the re-enactment in a single Act of the substance of the seventy or so Acts comprised in the licensing code.  It will follow the usual course of consolidating measures and is not intended to provide for any amendments of the law.  It is a formidable task and I do not expect to be in a position to introduce it until about this time next year.</P>
      <P>It may be that it will be necessary to promote an amending Bill immediately prior to the consolidating measure in order to get rid of dead wood and make some changes, mainly of a technical character.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state specifically why he did not grant permission to me to visit Mr. James J. Flood in Mountjoy Prison, in view of his statements of 28th February and 1st March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to questions on 28th February and 1st March, I informed the House that visits to prisons are governed by Rule 119 of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947 and that visits to and communication with prisoners by their relatives, friends and legal advisers are provided for in Rule 59 and in Appendix No. 2 of the General Prison Regulations, 1953.</P>
      <P>The Rules and Regulations, which are on sale through the Stationery Office, provide for special visits or letters at the discretion of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Members of the Dáil, as such, have no entitlement to visit or communicate with prisoners but it has been the practice, in recent years particularly, for the Minister to encourage Deputies to visit the prisons in order that they may see for themselves the conditions under which sentences are served and the measures of penal reform that have been introduced since the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice, too, for the Minister to authorise special visits to any well-conducted prisoner by a Deputy when he is satisfied that the interests of the prisoner would be served and the general discipline of the prison or the administration of justice would not suffer.</P>
    <P>In the case of James Flood, the position was that on 15th May Deputy Sweetman made an application in writing for a visit to him&mdash;without giving any reason for a special visit.  By that date, the prisoner had already had three visits, including a special visit, from relatives and friends to whom, on each occasion, he made false statements that he was on hunger strike, which were given a good deal of publicity subsequently, thereby causing public concern.</P>
    <P>I was satisfied that the prisoner's conduct was not deserving of any further special visits and on 11th May I gave a general directive to that effect.</P>

      <P>I am quoting here from a similar reply given by me to a <Col N="1322" /> similar type of question on 28th February, 1967, as reported at column 1971 of the Official Report, Volume 226, No. 12:</P>
      <P>I will permit the Deputy, on application to me, to visit any prison in the State, subject to my discretion. It may not be issued to any Deputy who seeks to go there for mischievous purposes.  I will use my discretion in regard to such a Deputy.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the questions on that occasion arose by reason of the fact that I had refused admission to Deputy Esmonde and Deputy O'Donnell, on the basis that I thought their applications on that occasion were mischievous.  I did grant applications to other Deputies which shows that my attitude was, as the attitude of any Minister for Justice would be, to look at each application separately and to decide, on its merits, whether or not a visit was warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, presumably, referring to the fact that a widow in insurable employment who is in receipt of a pension, whether contributory or non-contributory, may not be <Col N="1324" /> paid disability or unemployment benefit at the normal rate.</P>
      <P>It is an underlying principle of the comprehensive social insurance scheme that only one type of benefit should be paid to a claimant in respect of any period even though more than one of the contingencies for which benefit is provided has arisen in that period in a particular case.  This principle has, however, been departed from to the advantage of widows by the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953 to 1967, under which disability or unemployment benefit can be paid in addition to widows' contributory or non-contributory pension. Under the regulations, a widow in receipt of a contributory pension at the full rate who qualifies for disability or unemployment benefit is paid half the appropriate personal rate of disability or unemployment benefit; if she is in receipt of contributory pension at a reduced rate the half-rate of disability or unemployment benefit is increased by the amount of the reduction in the pension.  If her pension is non-contributory, the rate of benefit payable depends on the rate of pension and can range from half the appropriate personal rate of disability or unemployment benefit to as much as the full rate, plus appropriate adjustments in respect of any dependent children.  A change in these arrangements is not contemplated.</P>

      <P>The long-standing general practice in the local authority service is that a new appointee is remunerated at the minimum of the appropriate salary scale.  While in response to acute shortages of trained personnel, departures from the general practice have been authorised sparingly for certain grades, so that a new appointee with previous experience could enter the appropriate salary scale at a higher point than the minimum, I do not think I would be justified in extending this concession to the radiographer grade.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>At the opening of the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill, it is customary for the Minister for Finance to confine his remarks to a description of the provisions contained in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the economic background to the Budget has already been fully discussed in the debate on the Financial Resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part 1 of the Bill deals with income tax.  Under section 1 the rates of surtax <Col N="1329" /> are increased by 20 per cent but these increases are offset in many cases by the new arrangement provided in section 10 whereby the first £1,250 of earned income will not be taken into account in calculating surtax.</P>
    <P>This arrangement brings the amount of tax payable by persons in the professional and managerial classes closer to that payable in Britain and, indeed, slightly below it in the lower ranges.  It goes some distance to restore the comparative position achieved in the 1959 Budget.  It is contrary to the interests of our economy that persons with valuable experience in industry should be deterred from coming here, or should be induced to leave employment in Ireland, by a level of taxation substantially higher than in Britain.  We are all anxious that persons possessing skills and abilities in scarce supply should play an active role in furthering Irish economic expansion.  We badly need their services and while in most ranges tax will still be heavier than it is in Britain, I am hopeful that the relief announced in the Budget will be of some assistance in this problem.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, which was not referred to in the Budget speech, provides for the granting of the housekeeper allowance to a married woman who is deserted by her husband and who secures the services of a housekeeper to look after a child in respect of whom the child allowance is granted. It will be granted if the claimant is engaged fulltime in employment or in a trade or profession.  The allowance is at present granted to a married man whose wife has deserted him and I consider it reasonable, therefore, to extend it to a married woman in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 improve the existing dependent relative and child allowances.  Section 5 raises from 40 per cent to 50 per cent the initial allowance for capital expenditure incurred on the purchase of new machinery and plant in the year ending on 31st March, 1968.  The increased allowance will apply to similar expenditure incurred in the three subsequent years up to 31st March, 1971.</P>
    <P>Two other proposals not referred to <Col N="1330" /> in my financial statement are contained in sections 6 and 7.  Section 6 extends the industrial building allowance to capital expenditure on the construction of a building or structure incurred by a person who leases the building or structure for use by a trader.  Section 7 raises from £300 to £1,000 the amount which a registered friendly society may assure to any person by way of lump sum without losing its existing exemption from income tax.</P>
    <P>Section 8 raises from £50 to £70 the income tax and surtax exemption for interest arising on deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank, the Trustee Savings Banks or specified commercial banks.  This increase is in line with the recent rise in the interest rate payable by the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 and section 22, which is contained in Part IV of the Bill, provide for complete exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax, respectively, for a period of 20 years in respect of profits derived from the mining of certain non-bedded minerals. The 20-year period, beginning on 6th April, 1956, within which a company must commence to trade in order to qualify for relief, is being extended to 30 years.</P>
    <P>Section 11 and section 23, which is contained in Part IV of the Bill, provide for a system of free depreciation for new machinery and plant used in the undeveloped areas.  For income tax and corporation profits tax purposes, these sections permit the writing-off of the cost of such machinery and plant to be accelerated to whatever degree the taxpayer wishes.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for a scheme of income tax relief, within certain financial limits, for medical expenses in respect of payments for the professional services of medical practitioners, for maintenance and treatment in hospital and for drugs, medicines and appliances prescribed by a practitioner.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill relates to customs and excise.  Sections 13, 14 and 15 provide for the increases already announced in the customs and excise duties on beer and tobacco and for <Col N="1331" /> the imposition of a special excise duty on all duty-paid stocks of tobacco held by tobacco manufacturers at 5 p.m. on Budget day.</P>
    <P>Because of recent developments in freight transport, particularly the growing use of sealed containers, merchants are considering the establishment of freight depots at points some distance from seaports and airports. Imports would be brought under customs supervision to these depots for clearance and export cargoes would be packed in containers there.  This would speed up freight movements by reducing the congestion at docks and airports. Section 16 will empower the Revenue Commissioners to approve transit depots for goods not cleared from customs charge and to impose conditions and restrictions both in relation to the approval of transit depots and the removal of goods to them.</P>
    <P>Under section 17 provision is made for the modification of customs law relating to documents to be submitted by masters of ships at arrival and departure.  The new procedures will lead to a reduction in formalities and documentation for shipping companies as well as the customs.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, section 18 provides for a further reduction of ten per cent in the protective element in road tax on cars.  The first such reduction was made with effect from 1st July, 1966.</P>
    <P>Two Statutory Orders are confirmed under section 19&mdash;the Imposition of Duties (No. 158) (Matches) Order, 1966 and the Imposition of Duties (No. 159) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1966.</P>
    <P>Part III contains only one section which provides for exemption from stamp duty on instruments giving effect to the purchase of land made with the aid of advances under section 5 of the Land Act, 1965.  This provision has the effect of freeing migrants from congested areas from liability to stamp duty on land purchased under the loans provided under section 5 of the Land Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains three sections dealing <Col N="1332" /> with corporation profits tax, two of which I have already mentioned in connection with Part I of the Bill.  The third section, section 21, enables relief to be allowed where an excessive assessment to corporation profits tax has been made by reason of an error or mistake in the company's return.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions.  Section 24 deals with the Capital Services Redemption Account.  This section adjusts the annuity fixed provisionally last year for the redemption of debt incurred on Voted Capital Services in 1966-67. Also, it fixes provisionally a new annuity, to redeem estimated expenditure in the Voted Capital Services in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 to 27 are self-explanatory. Section 25 repeals Section 100 of the Finance Act, 1963, and section 490 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I propose, however, to examine the question of making somewhat similar provisions at a later stage in the interests of the efficient collection of taxes and duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which is better discussed in Committee than on this Stage because most of the general provisions in the Bill are acceptable to us but I should like at this stage to indicate one or two matters which the Minister, perhaps, might deal with when he concludes on this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the provisions in section 12 which relate to the allowance for income tax purposes of certain medical expenses.  This, of course, is a matter which has been the subject of debate here for a number of years and in fact amendments to previous Finance Bills were moved by Fine Gael Deputies, particularly by Deputy Patrick Byrne, to achieve this or a similar change in the law.  Therefore what is proposed in section 12 is something which we accept and are pleased to see.  At the same time, I note that the provisions in the section appear to vary in a rather definite way from the recommendation contained in the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  That Report recommended that a taxpayer who incurs expense on himself or on <Col N="1333" /> any dependant arising out of disability or illness which is serious or likely to be permanent should be allowed vouched expenses in excess of £50 per person per annum, subject to a maximum of £300 per person per annum.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech, I think the Minister adopted those words when he said that the House would recall that the Commission recommended that a taxpayer who incurs expense on himself or on any dependant arising out of disability or illness which is serious or likely to be permanent in excess of £50 per person up to a maximum of £300....  So that the Commission's Report and the Minister's Budget Statement indicated that this allowance would be confined to expenses arising out of a disability or illness which is serious and likely to be permanent. The section now in the Bill goes considerably further and, in fact, provides for relief in respect of expenses involved in any illness.</P>
    <P>I certainly feel that is an improvement but at the same time, I should like to know what views the Minister has.  I am sure he has considered whether this is likely to have an effect on the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's scheme and their activities.  Is it envisaged that this may affect in any way the attraction of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's schemes or is it felt that the confining of this allowance to expenses in excess of £50 will be a sufficient guard in that respect? I should like to have the Minister's views on it because, quite frankly, I would view with caution any proposal, however well intentioned, if it caused difficulties in the operation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's schemes.  That is one matter with which perhaps the Minister might deal.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is not in the Bill but which might be raised on this Stage.  It is not in the Bill because the Minister indicated in his Budget Statement it would not be before the House at this stage &mdash; the proposed repeal of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965.  The Minister has indicated that that Part will be repealed but he said that the details of what was to take its <Col N="1334" /> place were so complicated that it would not be convenient to bring the legislative change before the House at this stage.</P>
    <P>That is understandable, but I would like, and I think the House and the country would like, to get some indication from the Minister, perhaps in a general way, of the kind of new scheme he has in mind to replace that Part of the Finance Act, 1965.  We are all aware that there has been in this country over recent years a considerable amount of speculation in land. This arises because of neglect, over the past ten years, in particular, by those having the responsibility to provide services and to provide serviced land for house development.  Accordingly, speculation has taken place and very large profits have been made from time to time.</P>
    <P>It was presumably with the objective in mind of providing a system of taxation on those benefits that this particular provision was introduced originally in the Finance Act, 1965.  It was ill done.  It was open to many criticisms. Indeed, in the course of the Committee Stage debate on that Bill, a number of amendments had to be accepted by the then Minister for Finance.  At the same time, when we are told now that this entire Part of the Act is disappearing and we are not told what is to take its place, there is very justifiable ground for inquiries as to what is the nature of the new proposal.  While the Minister has said that whatever is to operate in the autumn will be retrospective, in so far as the tax impact is concerned, he has not, at this stage, given any indication of the general scheme.</P>
    <P>May I say, generally, that the various income tax reliefs contained in the Bill are welcome in so far as they go.  I am glad to see, in particular, the new provision for the granting of the housekeeper allowance to a married woman in the circumstances set out in the section, who is forced to engage in employment. I do not know how necessary it is to the provision of that relief that re-employment should be fulltime. Many a deserted wife in circumstances of this kind can get only part-time employment and indeed may require the assistance which is envisaged in the <Col N="1335" /> section in order to take up that part-time employment.  However, I suppose that is a matter better dealt with on Committee Stage and we will discuss it further then.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the other increases in the allowances.  May I just raise this general matter now?  Our income tax code, which is subject to change at this time every year, in this Bill, still remains a system of taxation which is generally regarded as being unjust and pinching hard in many places.  I do not suppose we will ever reach the situation in which the general body of taxpayers will regard income tax in any other light.  I feel, however, that the increase in allowances proposed in this Bill, and proposed from time to time, in certain Finance Bills, are generally wrung from a Minister for Finance rather than gladly given.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated that at the bottom of the income tax structure is a very parsimonious provision as to what amount of a person's income should be free of tax.  Up to £240 is not taxable.  In regard to the general provision for a single person, in so far as the income tax code is concerned, it is felt that a person can exist on £5 to £6 a week.  It seems to me that at that level there is scope for a more generous and beneficial approach by the Minister for Finance, which I regret is lacking in this Bill.  In so far as the Bill contains the allowances indicated, it certainly is welcomed by us. As I indicated, it is on Committee Stage that we will have certain matters to raise with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget, having being passed, and the Finance Bill being a necessary part of the Budget, I suppose, as Deputy O'Higgins said, it is not necessary to go into too much detail on the Second Stage.  However, I should like to make a few short comments, particularly with regard to sections 1 to 8.  These sections give certain reliefs to people paying income tax, and particularly to those paying surtax.  It is rather a pity that the Minister did not take the opportunity of trying to alleviate, at least, the <Col N="1336" /> hardship caused to persons who are expected to exist on what is regarded as a fair income.  I can never understand why the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance have never gone to the trouble of checking on the obvious injustice which arises from income tax being charged on everything a single person earns over £6 a week and a married person earns over ten guineas a week in 1967.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago, income tax was chargeable on the same amount.  At that time I was representing rural workers and the average wage of a rural worker was £5 to £6 a week.  In actual fact, at that time he could earn a full week's wages before he was taxed.  If a married man he could earn much more than he can now earn in real money before being taxed.  While the Minister has not done anything about this matter this year, he must take into account that this is something which will have to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>It was also a great pity the Minister did not take into account the obvious hardship on people who, instead of going to the employment exchanges and getting employment benefit for at least six months, acquire very large type vehicles and drive 30 to 40 miles to building sites, work hard all day and drive home in the evening, only to find that they get no allowance for travelling.  Whatever money they are spending&mdash;and it is a substantial amount&mdash;the Minister can be assured that his Department probably assessed their earnings without any tax allowance in this respect.  This is one of the shortsighted approaches by the Department of Finance which the Minister has put in very bad odour in the income tax portion of the present Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was quite right when he referred on section 2 to somebody who will qualify for the new housekeeper allowance, the married woman who is not living with her husband. She must be in fulltime employment. This shows an absolute lack of knowledge of the people who have to work for a living.  I know many of those people, and unfortunately there are far too many in the country, who have to go out to work, not for a full <Col N="1337" /> day because some of them are not able to continue to work for a full day, but for a portion of the day.  Unless they put in a full week's work, they will not qualify.  I am sure the Minister's approach to it would be different from what is in this Bill had this aspect been brought to his notice.</P>
    <P>The question of raising the allowance from £120 to £135 for tax purposes in respect of a child not over 11 years of age is something that had to come.  The previous decision to leave those out was a faulty one.</P>
    <P>Section 4 raises the income limits which apply in relation to the dependent relative allowance.  Here again there has been a lack of thinking, or of knowledge, about what actually happens to people with a low pension. This, in fact, prevents certain people who are drawing a contributory old age pension, or contributory widow's pension, from getting the benefit of the Act&mdash;relatives who are keeping those people, and it is something the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is graded only in the way that those who are in receipt of £140, or less, do not get the full allowance and when the income is up to £200, they are allowed a smaller amount.  The amount of £200 represents under £4 a week.  Many people retiring at the present time have combined pensions up to £6 a week. Those who look after any old person of 70 years of age, who requires to be looked after day and night would require more than that.  It is overlooked that this is not a question of giving them the full allowance of £60.  What is £60?  At a rate of 5/3d, or 7/-, if you like, it is less than £20 in hard cash. The approach is all wrong.  The Minister does not look at this in the right way.  What he is saying in effect is that people, instead of sending their parents into the county home, can keep them at home and ensure that they are living in some comfort.  If they have an income of over £200, slightly under £4 a week, they cannot get the £20 allowance which they should get.  The approach is entirely wrong and it is <Col N="1338" /> something that warrants rethinking.  I should like to ask the Minister to do something about it or see whether there is something he can do to help in this matter.</P>
      <P>The increase of the initial allowance of 40 per cent to 50 per cent applicable to capital expenditure on new machinery and plant is something we all welcome, if it is an encouragement. The same applies to the building allowance if it is given to the right people, not to chancers who come around and get out as soon as the building is erected.</P>
      <P>Section 8 raises from £50 to £70 the income tax exemption in respect of interest on bank deposits.  Savings certificates are included in this and it is wrong, because the amount is small.  It is no incentive or encouragement.  The Minister might have been far more generous when thinking about this the other day in regard to savings certificates. An increase from 2½ per cent to three per cent is no incentive.  It is no incentive to say that it affords relief from income tax.</P>
      <P>The concession given to mining of minerals is something to be welcomed. It is not generally known that the development of mining has not been encouraged by the State.  The State burnt their fingers badly when someone attempted it and because of that, they got a grudge against everybody who attempted to start or develop mining.  The result was that those who attempted to spend their own money, or their company's money, on it were treated with suspicion.  They ask: Where are these fellows coming from; are they out to make a big kill?  All of us are anxious to see the State profiting from our natural resources.  Development is helping the State to such an extent now that if it is properly handled, I believe the incentive will be welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House further except to refer to the duty on cigarettes.  Has the Minister had second thoughts on this question?  There is a difference between the amount of duty paid, as distinct from collected, on the tipped and the ordinary blend cigarettes.  It appears to me that somebody will make a substantial profit, <Col N="1339" /> particularly as the tipped cigarette appears to be more popular than the other brands.  The Minister said that cigarettes will be improved.  All smokers will agree that cigarettes have been improved.  Are they going to produce coloured cigarettes or will the packets be improved?  There is an amount of money collected and where is it going?  The companies netted a valuable profit and the State was not able to get at it because the Finance Bill was so framed that the Government allowed them to get it.  Is it now tied up to ensure that if the public have to pay more for their smoke, the extra money will go to the State, not to private companies who want to make a profit on the State?</P>
    <P>As Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has said, on Committee Stage we shall have something more to say on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Finance Bill in its new form.  The Minister was very wise in his decision that the implementation of the actual Budget policy would be summarised in one short Finance Bill and that any question of general amendment of the tax law, or bringing us more up to date could be better handled by a subsequent miscellaneous Bill.  That has clarified the whole situation enormously and will enable us to get through this Bill quickly and properly and spend more time, without being under any pressure, in discussing the various amendments later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part I of this Bill deals with income tax.  We have got to remember that in spite of a certain amount of discouragement in recent weeks, there is still a very real prospect of membership of the European Economic Community within the comparatively near future.  I cannot see us going in readily to the Community with our tax structure as it stands at the moment. Not only is our income tax structure complicated&mdash;as Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has said&mdash;but it is largely, to my mind, incomprehensible.  The first stage in rectifying that position has already been taken with the passing of the Income Tax Act.  At least now we have in one Act the complete income <Col N="1340" /> tax code.  It does not make it any easier to understand but at least makes it easier to commend.  I would hope that during the next few months the Minister and his advisers will give very serious consideration to a radical recasting of our whole tax structure, bearing in mind general European Economic Community policy in this connection.  What has been done in this Bill is merely to ease the load here and there and, while it is very welcome that these additional concessions should be given, we are still merely trifling with the problem.</P>
    <P>In sections 1 and 10 we have provisions relating to surtax.  The Minister in his speeches previously and today, made it perfectly clear that he appreciates the desirability of setting up a proper tax structure, using the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; in the sense that it bears comparisons with that in Great Britain. We do not wish to take the risk of highly qualified technicians, managers or executives being drawn across the water simply because they can get not only higher gross incomes but higher net incomes as well.  We should not apologise for this, because the employment of top-rank men in this country is a first-rate investment for the whole community.  Unless we have the very best in management and the highest grade of technicians, we will not be able to make the progress which is so essential if our economy is to get really moving again.</P>
    <P>It is more than discouraging to find that if you are really tops in your job and are being rewarded appropriately in the terms of the market at present, you will leave yourself open to 7/- in the £ income tax and an additional 9/- surtax on a considerable portion of your income.  At that stage, it just does not become worthwhile.  The number of people who will be affected by this is very small.  Therefore, the amount of income which the State will receive from such a high rate of taxation is, to my mind, negligible.  It is far better to go on the ordinary business practice&mdash; the way to increase your turnover is to reduce your prices.  If we reduce our taxes, we will get more money simply because we will encourage people either to stay here or even to come <Col N="1341" /> here and, thereby, draw more people into the tax net.  But it will mean that the burden is more evenly and fairly spread among various members of the community.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has already committed himself to some sort of review but I hope it will be a really comprehensive one.  We have to try to swing our taxation system away from income taxation altogether.  I am becoming increasingly convinced that this is a disincentive and, even in cases where this criticism is not justified, wage-earners are very often discouraged from working harder, or even working overtime, because they say: &ldquo;We are working for the Government more than for ourselves.&rdquo; In many cases that is an illusion, but, in some cases, it is not, and certainly it is most discouraging.  I am convinced that a far better method of taxation is that adopted in EEC countries, which are ahead of us in this way of taxing expenditure rather than income.</P>
    <P>If you tax expenditure, the taxpayer is the man who spends most; if you tax income, it is the man who earns most who bears most of the load and he is thereby made unable to save as much as he should.  If you tax expenditure, you encourage saving; you encourage increased earnings, and that is the way to get an expanding economy.  But, in the situation as we have it at the moment, the Minister has probably gone as far as he could; we cannot expect him to come in like a new broom and sweep clean altogether. It probably would be unhealthy if he tried to do too much too quickly but he appears to me to be moving in the right direction.  I only hope that between now and the next Budget, he and his advisers can think this matter out very fully and come up next year with much more comprehensive and drastic reforms.</P>
    <P>As our income tax structure stands at the moment, one of the classes most seriously hit is the class of people who are living on fixed incomes, either by way of pensions awarded by their employers, or other fixed pensions.  It applies also to people who have been left a small amount of investment income. At the moment these people are <Col N="1342" /> bearing too high a proportion of tax and, unless the Minister makes more drastic reforms within the next couple of years.  I would hope that next year he might take a very friendly look at these people living on small fixed incomes to see whether some means could be devised of giving increased tax allowances in their case.  These are people whose incomes are continually falling behind the rising cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the concessions which the Minister has made in sections 1 and 10 raise a higher rate of surtax but I am prepared to forgive the Minister that because I am not in the higher surtax bracket myself.  Anyway, I think the general trend is in the right direction.</P>

      <P>In section 12 we have a provision which is very worthwhile&mdash; the allowance of tax against medical expenses.  I do not quite follow Deputy T. F. O'Higgins's fears about how this might affect voluntary health insurance. I am every bit as enthusiastic about voluntary health insurance as is the Deputy.  It is doing a marvellous job but, at the moment at any rate, voluntary health insurance covers only hospital expenses.  It is doing a very good job in that context, but the relief granted in section 12 is much more extensive, relating as it does to professional services, maintenance, treatment in hospital, drugs, medicines and appliances.  I cannot see any way in which this provision could prejudice voluntary health insurance in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III, dealing with stamp duties, is a worthwhile provision but I still feel the Minister has not gone far enough as far as stamp duties on transfers of property are concerned.  Here again we are far behind the taxation system in Britain where purchasers of <Col N="1343" /> houses do not have to pay stamp duty at all until they get into the category of people buying pretty expensive houses.  Stamp duty and legal fees account for a considerable amount of the cost of a new house for a newly-married couple.  I would be the last to say that legal fees are in any way excessive.  They are kept constantly under review and I regard the rate of fee on ordinary land transfers as practically all right as it stands.</P>
    <P>However, the stamp duty is, to my mind, far too heavy.  If the Minister could find some other way in which he could raise the money I, for one, would be delighted.  I do not think the amount can be enormous but the amount in respect of each individual transaction can be a killer altogether when a deposit must be paid, furniture bought and so on.</P>
    <P>I would hope the Minister would keep in his mind for next year the possibility of a very substantial relief on stamp duty on the purchase of house property, particularly new houses for young married couples.  It may not be possible to confine such a relief to any particular class of people but the matter is one which could very well be looked into during the months ahead.</P>
    <P>In general, I am quite happy with the Bill as it stands and I look forward to a further continuation of the Minister's policy in reviewing the tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated already that he proposes to bring in a different Finance Bill in the autumn.  I feel, therefore, that it is really in relation to the provisions of that promised Finance Bill that there is likely to be more discussion in general and in particular than in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pressed him recently, and Deputy O'Higgins mentioned it today, that it is highly desirable that at the earliest possible opportunity there should be an indication of the proposals the Government have in that regard.  There can be very great difference of opinion indeed in the interpretation of the phraseology of the Minister for Finance in the Budget in relation to <Col N="1344" /> the promised second Finance Bill and it is important for the business community that the taxable limitations of the measure that is to be introduced by the Minister be known as soon as possible.  All of us appreciate that the Bill may be a bit complex.  However, there has been a long period of gestation for it and I do not think it unreasonable to say that the gestation should now be ended and the Bill should see the light of day as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister in that Bill will deal with anything other than the matters dealt with in Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965. Perhaps he might indicate whether he proposes to make it a general Miscellaneous Provisions Bill or merely one designed to deal with a single problem. If the Minister is to make it a more general measure, is he going to include anything in it which would harmonise, or start to harmonise, our system of taxation with that in existence in Europe?  Quite apart from whether we do or do not join in the Community, it is quite desirable that there should be a full examination of the methods of taxation available in other countries.  I would strongly urge the Minister to make available to the House in the form of a White Paper an analysis of the main forms of taxation with which we are shortly to be associated, if and when we do join the Community.  It is one of the things that should be done in some detail before the decision is taken and debate takes place in this House.</P>
    <P>In relation to the position in taxation <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries, I want to mention another matter which came to my knowledge last week and about which I wrote to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  Frankly, I have not yet had time to have a reply. It is a matter of general application I understand that some time last November or thereabouts, the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;entered into a new double taxation agreement with Canada, which double taxation agreement will, in due course, be laid before the House and will then be enacted, I suppose, by Schedule, or perhaps there is a general <Col N="1345" /> enactment that enables the Minister to bring it into force by ministerial or Government order.  It has not been possible to get any information about the provisions of that double taxation agreement here in Ireland.  However, last week I came across a memorandum&mdash;it was brought in by a Canadian&mdash;on the contents of the agreement that had been published in Canada.</P>
    <P>I want to urge very strongly on the Minister that it makes us look extremely foolish here if the position is that he has signed a Convention with another country which can publish the details of it while we do not publish the details here.  It may be that in the particular case there was some mistake &mdash;mistakes can happen even in the best ordered families&mdash;but as a general principle, I would urge the Minister most strongly to make certain that when Conventions with other countries are signed and completed, whatever may be the date of implementation, there will be a clear understanding at the time as to the publication of the details thereof, a summary of it or the entire contents of such a taxation agreement, and that we will not be put in the position of being pennyboys here, not knowing what has occurred and making ourselves look entirely foolish in the eyes of the people in the other country concerned.  I do not think that is asking too much and it is something on which the Minister and I for once will be in agreement.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I find some of the provisions of this Finance Bill somewhat difficult to follow.  Indeed, the provisions, in certain circumstances, do not at all carry out what the newspapers took from the Budget speech of the Minister.  I am quite clear that I interpreted the Minister's Budget speech in the way in which it has been put into legislative form in this Bill in these respects.  The fact is that it was interpreted otherwise and I am afraid a great many people were under the impression that they were going to get substantially greater reliefs than they did get.  Many people thought that the effect of the increase in the income margin for the housekeeper allowance would be an increase <Col N="1346" /> in the allowance itself, but the allowance is remaining at £60.  In this Finance Bill there is no improvement whatever in the actual allowance, although there is an increase in the margin of income allowed before the allowance is knocked off.  Similarly there was some misunderstanding in relation to the child allowance.  This is bringing up, if you like, to the over 11 margin, the allowance for a child under 11.</P>
    <P>I must confess I was bitterly disappointed that the Minister did not include in his budgetary proposals anything to increase the age and small income allowance for old people.  From a question I asked in the House on 6th April, it is clear that the cost of increasing the age allowance would not be of any real consequence.  A figure of £20,000 for an increase of ten per cent in terms of the amounts the Minister is budgeting for is a mere bagatelle&mdash;it is not even big enough to be called a bagatelle.  Yet, for old people who are endeavouring at the end of their years to put up with the ever-spiralling cost of living and to maintain some standard for themselves, it would have been really worthwhile.  A ten per cent increase in the age allowance would cost only £20,000, and presumably therefore an increase of one-fifth would be £4,000 a month only.  An increase in the small income relief would be even smaller.  Were it a ten per cent increase it would cost only £10,000.  I think the Minister was lacking not merely in imagination but also in charity when he did not ease the lot of those old people in that way when it could have been done for so very little.</P>
    <P>Speaking of charity, I was disappointed also that the Minister did not include in the Finance Bill a provision to permit formal covenants for the benefit of charities to be deductions for income tax purposes.  I think I am right in saying this was originally permitted and many charities benefited from it.  Then the Finance Act of 1940 cut down the relief completely, and subsequently the Finance Act of 1957 modified the restriction and covenants for research charities were allowed. Then in 1959 that was extended to <Col N="1347" /> convenants where the proceeds are used for teaching the natural sciences.</P>
    <P>I can see a very strong argument against allowing such covenants for surtax as well as income tax.  I think that in 1952 the British brought in a provision by virtue of which covenants for charities were not allowed as deductions for surtax purposes but were allowed as deductions for income tax purposes.  The effect of that has been some amelioration of the position of certain charities there.  The Minister would be wise not merely to follow the pattern set for him in 1952 in England, but also the pattern in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation in Chapter 8 where, having examined the matter in great detail, they made it clear in the end that they came down in favour of a recommendation in the following terms:</P>
    <P>We recommend that formal dispositions of income, under a covenant, in favour of charities for a period which may exceed four years should be effective for income tax, but not for surtax.</P>
    <P>The effect on formal covenants of that sort would have been a substantial assistance to these charities and in this respect one is not thinking in terms of the taxpayer at all because the taxpayer is giving away money.  One is thinking of the charities concerned.  It is most unfortunate that in 1967 the recommendation in the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation was not considered and brought into effect, speaking from recollection, five or six years after the report was brought in.  It is to be regretted that the Minister has not seen fit to include such a provision.</P>
    <P>I might add in support of the Commission's report that not only is this the position in Great Britain but it is also the position to some degree in the United States of America and in Canada.  There it is not done by way of deed of covenant but by way of a contribution up to a stated percentage of income.  This would have affected not merely the universities but also the secondary schools.  There would be a strong argument for the schools concerned, <Col N="1348" /> and, indeed, for the universities also, why rely on the sentimentality of those who passed from them in their earlier days.  Even between now and Committee Stage, I would strongly urge the Minister to include such a provision in this Bill, realising of course, as I do realise, that the inclusion of such a provision would have a negligible effect in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>I found very considerable difficulty in an interpretation of section 8 as drafted, and of section 344 of the Income Tax Act.  It is obviously not a matter to be raised on Second Stage except from the point of view of giving notice to the Minister that I will raise it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The way the section is drafted in the Act&mdash;I freely admit to the Minister that perhaps I should have spotted this when we were consolidating the section in question&mdash;makes it look as if, when a person has more than £50 interest, the first £50 will not be exempt.  In practice, the first £50 is exempt and I assume the first £70 will be exempt, but it does not look as if the section was drafted in that way.  It seems to me it should be drafted with greater certainty.</P>
    <P>In my statement on the Budget, I referred to the mining incentives to which the Minister now proposes to give legislative effect in section 9.  I made is clear then that I appreciated the reason for them and intimated that I thought the Minister was right in viewing the broader general issue rather than the details that had been put forward.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, however, in relation to section 12&mdash;in which medical expenses can be deducted&mdash;that I find one very bad vacuum.  As I understand the section, a taxpayer will be allowed relief for medical expenses even if the person on whom the cost has been incurred is one in respect of whom the taxpayer is given a tax allowance by reason of his dependency.  We all come across sad cases indeed where children of more than 16 years of age, perhaps mentally retarded and not able to be in school, are a source of great expense to their parents.  Under the Income Tax Act, once a child becomes 16 <Col N="1349" /> years of age and unless he is in an educational establishment, the parents cease to obtain any allowance in respect of that child As far as I can read section 12, there will be no allowance either for medical expenses incurred on that child.  If I have read the section correctly, it is a gap which should not have been left in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy please repeat that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand section 12, a person is limited to medical expenses on a dependant and that dependant is a person for whom the taxpayer is already getting a tax allowance of some sort or another.  It can be a wife, in which case the taxpayer gets the married allowance; it can be the people set out in section 139, 140, 141 and 142 of the Income Tax Act.  Section 139 provides an allowance for a housekeeper; section 140 provides an allowance for taking charge of an unmarried brother or sister; section 141 provides child allowances and section 142 provides the dependent relative allowance.  If I read section 12 correctly, the person on whom the medical expenses have been incurred has to come within one of those categories before the allowance is given.  If the taxpayer has a child who is more than 16 years of age and who is perhaps so mentally retarded that he cannot go to a school, then the taxpayer in question suffers twice: firstly he does not get the child allowance because that allowance is only to be given where the boy or girl who is more than 16 years of age is in a school; and secondly, because no matter what expenses he has incurred on the child, he does not get relief under section 12 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that is a great mistake.  It should not be at all difficult to provide a form of definition which would mean that a dependant was somebody who is dependent on the taxpayer concerned not only in the common or garden sense but in the legal sense under the Income Tax Act.  It seems grossly unfair that the section should not be extended to cover such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be appreciated that in relation to a married man with a family <Col N="1350" /> of three or four children the relief is given to him only in respect of expenditure in excess of £50 on any one child.  If he has to spend £70 between all the children, he gets no relief because each single child is regarded separately in relation to medical expenses incurred under the section concerned. At the same time, I accept that the section is drawn a little more widely than was suggested before the Commission.  The fact that the section is there at all is a tribute to the persistence with which Deputy Patrick Byrne has, during the years, endeavoured to push this door open.  It shows that persistence, even in Dáil Éireann, brings its rewards.</P>
    <P>Indeed as I mention that, I might also mention another section of which Deputy Byrne can fairly claim parentage. It is section 21 which permits errors found afterwards to be considered for relief from corporation profits tax.  That was brought to light as a result of an amendment put down by Deputy Byrne, and when he was not available last year, it was moved by me without my being able at all to advocate the case as strongly and as clearly as he would have been able to do had he been here.</P>
    <P>The other provisions in the Finance Bill can be discussed more clearly on Committee and Report Stages.  I should like to say now, however, that it is a good thing we have gone over to the Swedish system of free depreciation under which one is entitled in certain respects to depreciate as seems desirable for commercial purposes and to ensure that such commercial depreciation also will rank for tax allowances. I hope the opening of that door in a small way, following the Swedish precedent, will be followed by the adoption of other similar precedents in our tax inducements for the purpose of endeavouring to get modernisation and adaptation.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed, though I suppose I had no business to be, in the light of a reply given by the Minister to a question on 5th April last that he would not include a section to provide that <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value of free-hold registered land would not be concerned with death duties arising in <Col N="1351" /> respect of previous ownership.  The Minister was all wrong in the answer he gave when he referred to the avoidance of unnecessary expense, being the expense of obtaining a certificate in discharge of death duties.</P>
    <P>I was not referring to that at all.  I was referring largely to Civil Service administrative expenses, apart from the expenses of solicitors.  As far as the solicitors are concerned, they obtained the certificate as part of their ordinary scale fees.  It does not arise there, but it does certainly mean substantial administrative expenses.  I do not think it is worthwhile as a revenue saver, having regard to the fact that the Land Registry transactions are there for examination, and are examined, and having regard to the fact that the tendency of the Government in the past years has been to endeavour to move all titles bit by bit into the Land Registry.  Certainly, the existence of this provision will not be an encouragement to people freely to register title without the necessity of compulsion.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I will probably have an opportunity on the Money Resolution to come back on another point I raised with him in relation to the Budget.  I do not propose, therefore, to say very much about it except that it seems odd to see from <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the 16th of this month, notwith-standing the note that revenue this year is £7 million up on last year, which one would hope, that stranger still expenditure is £1 million down on last year for the very reason I said originally that the Minister &ldquo;cooked the books&rdquo; on the 31st March last.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt but on a point of fact, in case I do not get an opportunity of replying this evening, the case mentioned by the Deputy of the mentally retarded will, in fact, be covered because the definition of a dependent relative means somebody who is prevented by old age or infirmity from looking after himself or earning his own living.</P>

      <P>We are all very glad to hear that from the Minister.  It would worry every Deputy if that were not so.  I do not propose to be overlong in my contribution or to repeat what I said on the Financial Resolutions in respect of the various matters affected by the Budget, such as industry and so on.  There will be other opportunities of dealing further with this very interesting source of conversation, discussion and indeed civil unrest.  I want to refer specifically to a matter which I would be glad if the Minister would deal with in his reply.  I hope he will not be long delayed and that he will get in this evening.  I refer to the effect of our taxation code upon the provisions of the recently enacted Landlord and Tenant Act.  In other words, my purpose is to speak about something which is not provided for in the Finance Bill and to ask the Minister to take any necessary steps to make provision to meet the problem which is there.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that our existing code of taxation can have the effect of nullifying the objects of the Act to which I have referred.  The relevant part of our taxation code is called Schedule A tax.  As every member will be aware, many thousands of house purchasers who borrowed money either from the local authorities or the building societies in the period since the war have been levied with a ground rent which has long been accepted as having no real basis in so far as the moral and social rights of the community are concerned. I take it that it was in good faith the Minister for Justice introduced the Landlord and Tenant Bill discussed in this House following the deliberations of a commission.  I accept it was an effort by him to bring this medieval concept of ground rents in so far as they affected house purchasers &mdash;as they did and indeed do in thousands of cases&mdash;to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> That Bill should have represented for most people the wrapping up of the unfinished business left over by people like Davitt and those other great men of history who secured the removal of landlordism from the rural areas of Ireland.  It was an effort to try to wipe out the last vestiges of a system which had been imposed on our people and which had no basis in justice&mdash;the ground rents system.  Its provisions offer to house purchasers the opportunity of obtaining the fee simple of the ground upon which their houses are built.  But I do not know whether it was foreseen at the time of the passage of that Bill&mdash;certainly I must say it was not foreseen by me&mdash; that this system of ground rents could be replaced in effect by Schedule A tax as operated and imposed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister for Justice on this matter at the behest of a considerable number of my constituents in the suburban areas of Dublin. He was good enough to consult with the Minister for Finance, who provided him with a memorandum supplied by the Revenue Commissioners setting out their position in this regard.  Like all emanations from the Revenue Commissioners, it is to a simple man such as myself a complex and almost inexplicable document. From my reading of it, it does appear that whether or not a house purchaser of the type whom I describe and for whom the Landlord and Tenant Act was, I take it, primarily intended, sets about the purchase of the fee simple of his house and the piece of land attached to the house, he will continue to have to pay in money the same amount as if he never opted to avail of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act.  It would appear so.  I do not know whether I would be in order in reading this memorandum.  It is, perhaps, too lengthy and the Chair would take exception to my doing so. The reading of it might be useful inasmuch as it would write it into the record as, perhaps, a guide to the thoughts of the Revenue Commissioners and would also help me to impress what I mean on the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are two examples given in the <Col N="1354" /> memorandum as to the method whereby Schedule A tax would operate. Figures are given.  It appears that, i ndeire na dála, the purchasing tenant who had been paying, say, £10 ground rent per annum and who is now in process of purchasing the fee simple will find himself paying out of his pocket the same amount of money, whether it be in the shape of interest on a loan which he might have to borrow in order to purchase the fee simple, whether it be in the shape of the national value which the Revenue Commissioners say attaches to the fact that he is no longer paying ground rent and, if he has purchased the ground rent out of other moneys which are not borrowed moneys, that he is enjoying an income equivalent to the amount which he had been formerly paying to the landlord.  If I sound somewhat confused in this, blame the Revenue Commissioners and not me.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the principle on which the Revenue Commissioners operate and on which this memorandum is based is a clinging, as it were, to the idea that while ground rents may be gone in theory they are not gone in fact so far as payment is concerned and in so far as the idea of ground rents can be employed by the Revenue Commissioners to extract from this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I knew this much about them, that I have been listening to the grievances and complaints of my constituents who, let me say, are affected in greater numbers by ground rents than are the constituents of the Minister or of any other Member of this House, due to the fact that in the County Dublin area there has been more building.

      <P>My principal purpose in standing up here was to discover how this Schedule A tax was going to affect people whom I represent. The Minister is in a very testy mood this afternoon and he sought to denigrate my efforts to get some clarity <Col N="1358" /> in this matter.  The fact that house purchasers now paying ground rent of £10 per year and who when they purchase the fee simple of their places, will still be paying that £10 a year is a very important matter, and I want to hear how the Minister says that this will not be so.</P>
      <P>There are up to 15,000 such people in my constituency and it is on account of the fact that I have attended meetings of their associations at which this matter was raised that I bring it forward here.  I mentioned at the outset that I did not want to make a prolonged speech on this, much as I have been provoked to do so by the impudence, if I may so describe it, of the Minister, and I am in two minds whether I should or not even now. Were it not for a previous commitment, it would be a pleasure for me to stay here for some little time, possibly some hours, and recite the facts as they affect this Government and the inequities for which this Government are responsible in so far as their activities are concerned throughout the country.  The temptation is great and the spirit is, indeed, willing, but time just does not allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grievously disappointed with the Bill before us for several reasons.  I am disappointed because, in common with many Members of this House, I respect the considerable talents of the Minister for Finance because he is a professional colleague of mine, as a chartered accountant, the first chartered accountant to become Minister for Finance since this State was established.  Because tax law is so complex, previous Ministers have signally failed to effect any substantial or significant mechanical changes in the British code of taxation operated in this country which I have said many times before is so unsuited to our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed also because some months ago, with the assistance of a Special Committee, the House enacted an Income Tax Consolidation Bill consolidating the British Income Tax Act of 1918 with the various Finance Acts passed here since the establishment of the State, thereby making it mechanically <Col N="1359" /> much easier to effect the desirable and necessary changes.  In the past, it has been very difficult for the lay person, and even for the lawyer, to disentangle the cumbersome complexities of our tax law.  Now with the new Income Tax Act it is somewhat easier to follow, but the Minister has failed to bring in any significant changes.</P>
    <P>A few months ago there was submitted to him a memorandum by his own professional institute, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, pointing out nine worthwhile changes, most of which could be implemented at no great cost financially.  The first of these proposals is one to which I wish to draw the attention of the House, for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, in making this submission to the Minister, were joined by the Incorporated Law Society, and these two most eminent professional bodies submitted to him a memorandum urging a certain change in the powers possessed by the Revenue Commissioners in assessing persons and firms to taxation, the powers of re-opening cases, of assessing tax back to the very foundation of the State, creating a situation where nobody really knew where he stood.</P>
    <P>The continued existence of the powers possessed by the Revenue Commissioners relating to several different matters affecting the rights of the individual is a public scandal.  We are indebted to the President for the action he took in relation to the power of lodging persons in prison without a court order.  That has been found unconstitutional and repealed.  There are other harsh, arbitrary and unjust powers unnecessarily possessed by the Revenue Commissioners, and they must be repealed also.</P>
    <P>I want to quote briefly, if I may, from the submission to the Minister by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Incorporated Law Society in relation to the power to re-open assessments, to assess to taxation right back to the very foundation of the State, a situation which did not always exist.  In British law there is a six-year time limit in respect of this matter of re-opening assessments. <Col N="1360" /> There was a six-year time limit in this country up to 1936, when it was changed so that assessments could be made for any year from 1922-23 onwards; that was 14 years back, and is now 45 years back.  The reason for the change in 1926 could, in my opinion, have been connected with loss of records during the Civil War and in the period preceding it, and I have no doubt that it was perfectly proper in 1936 to provide for extended powers for the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  But the position has changed very drastically since 1936 and it is surely grossly inequitable to have these powers continued over such a considerable period, and that notwithstanding the fact that the six-year limit still exists in Britain, from which our legislation, in the first instance, was culled.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister taken no action in respect of this matter, a matter in relation to which he received such a concise and well-produced memorandum from the professional bodies to which I referred?  It is not good enough that successive Ministers should continue to remain inert and lethargic.  It is particularly deplorable and reprehensible that the Minister involved now should continue these provisions; he ought to appreciate better than any of his predecessors the full significance of and the grave injustice in these provisions.</P>
    <P>There is a power of seizure of goods possessed by the Revenue Commissioners, a power which exists without reference to the courts; it is a power which enables the Revenue Commissioners to seize goods, not necessarily the property of the taxpayer involved. Many members of the public were very shocked when they read the very trenchant and vigorous article on this subject in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> some weeks ago by an eminent Dublin accountant, well known to the Minister and to myself, Mr. Gerard Wheeler. We are very much in his debt and in that of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> for the disclosure of this public scandal and it behoves us here now in this House to demand of the Minister that these unnecessary powers, which hark back to the first decade of the last century, <Col N="1361" /> should be repealed.  The context in which these powers were first created was that in which a person's hand could legally be chopped off for stealing a loaf of bread and in which our forefathers were executed or transported for what are now regarded as trivialities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the argument that these over-severe powers should continue to be implemented <i>in terrorem</i> by the Revenue Commissioners?  It was said by the Minister&mdash;he will correct me in this if I am wrong&mdash;that the power of lodging persons in prison, now repealed at the behest of the President, was never, in fact, used by the Revenue Commissioners.  It was used.  In many cases it was used as a threat to intimidate unfortunate tax-payers. It may be that in the past this House could afford to ignore these matters because not very many people were affected by them, but income tax is now run-of-the-mill.  It is common-place. Every second citizen is therefore affected by the continued existence of these provisions.  We intend to give the Minister an opportunity of further considering these matters on Committee Stage.  It is my personal hope that, as he did in section 12 in relation to health expenses and in section 21 in relation to CPT, he will accept some further enlightenment from us.  As I said on the Budget debate, we do not believe that Fianna Fáil possesses the urge to create the kind of just society which we espouse but, for what it is worth, they are most welcome indeed to learning from our policy and implementing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where suitable, as is being done here in section 12. <Col N="1362" /> Credit where credit is due: in section 12 the Minister is doing something which was urged in this House over the past six years, something three of his predecessors persistently refused to do.  He is also doing something which was opposed by the Revenue Commissioners before the Commission on Income Taxation.</P>
      <P>In Britain many people are concerned about the unsuitability of ancient tax laws.  Recently I saw the view expressed that no Chancellor of the Exchequer remains in office long enough to get round to tax reform and initiative in tax reform is unlikely to come from his technical advisers because they are preoccupied with the burdensome task of raising the necessary moneys to run the country and they have, therefore, little time to think of anything else.  They do their task most efficiently and with great dedication.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth implied that more was to come in the shape of tax reform in a Bill in the autumn, more than just the reform of the notorious Part VII of the 1965 Act.  It is desirable that the Minister should indicate to us now if Deputy Booth is correct in this.  Has the Minister any tax reform proposals up his sleeve?  I am somewhat sceptical.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his very brief statement today did not explain the significance of the repeal provisions in section 25.  I do not think these provisions are of any great significance. I am quite satisfied that they do not deal with the objectionable powers to which I have referred vested in the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 481 of the Income Tax Act is not affected by these repeal provisions.  I should like further clarification of these matters, if not at this stage then on Committee Stage, from the Minister.  This power possessed by the Revenue Commissioners, to which I referred at the outset, to re-open cases back for 45 years is in very marked contrast indeed with the converse restrictive powers <Col N="1363" /> possessed by the taxpayer in connection with the re-opening of cases in his interest.  If the taxpayer forgets to claim a personal allowance for a child, dependent relative or housekeeper, he cannot claim one back for further than six years.  If he has a claim for a loss, he must claim within two years.  If he has made an error in his return he can only claim back six years.  Indeed, in section 21, now applying the error or mistake provisions for corporation profits tax purposes, I am pretty confident I am right in saying that the six-year limit is again applied&mdash;yes, it is quite clear in section 21 (1): the taxpayer is restricted to six years.  This is in contrast to the Revenue's right to re-open all cases, not only those cases where fraud is suspected but all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right.  It certainly is right.  These matters I speak about are undoubtedly far more suited to a Committee Stage discussion.  As I have already said, I intend to give the Minister a full opportunity of considering them with particular reference to the submission made to him recently by the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Incorporated Law Society. We on this side of the House are not prepared to permit these bodies to be treated that lightly by the Minister for Finance.  It is our intention to submit amendments relating to their submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would once again say what I have said <i>ad nauseam.</i> I have said it so often that I am almost getting tired of doing so myself.  We might as well never have obtained Home Rule in this country for all the difference it has made to our tax code.  I am convinced that in the opening decade when this State was set up, in the 1920s, the Government at the time were so preoccupied with more serious matters&mdash; the Civil War situation&mdash;that much of the British legislation which was adapted under the Adaptation of Enactments Act ought to have been kept in force for a time and should then have been the subject of radical reform. Again, in the 1930s, the Government <Col N="1364" /> of the time were preoccupied with a depression situation, with the Economic War, and, in the 1940s, we had a World War.  Since then, say 1950, we have had the report of the Commission on Income Taxation many of whose recommendations have not been acted upon at all.  It ill behoves a Minister for Finance of my generation to take the same line on these matters I am speaking of as was taken by his distinguished predecessor, the then Deputy Dr. James Ryan, who was Minister for Finance for so many years.  We expect more of a Minister of this generation.</P>
    <P>The Income Tax Act recently enacted will be translated into Irish.  That will cost just about £20,000.  Much of that Act goes back to William Pitt. Much of it is totally unsuited to our conditions and our requirements.  We shall give the Minister an opportunity here next week or the following week of dealing, piecemeal and in a small way initially, with some of the matters I have spoken about as was done by him today in section 12 in respect of health expenses.  We shall give him a full opportunity of adopting our proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins indicated at the outset of his remarks, this is really a measure more appropriate to discussion on the Committee Stage than on the Second.  However. I feel I should say in regard to the Bill generally that I think it is an excellent measure, one which brings about very considerable improvements and gives effect to Government policy in a number of ways both in regard to the achievement of social justice and economic expansion.  Indeed, the excellence of the measure, like the Budget itself, can be gauged more by the lengths to which the Opposition were put to try to criticise it than in any other way.  I would not wish and I do not think the Chair would wish me to deal in detail with technical points at this stage.  I shall therefore just reply to a few of the main points which were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I want to deal in general with this question of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  I shall be quite happy to return to a fuller debate <Col N="1365" /> on the issue on the Committee Stage. We have to be sensible and practical about this matter.  In every country in the world, the Revenue Commissioners or the revenue-raising authority&mdash;by whatever name they are called&mdash;have to have very specific and very real powers to enable them to do their job because the collection of revenue is at the very basis of the operation of the State.  If we cannot collect the revenue to run the State then everything else falls down.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputies to fulminate about this and that particular power and it is all very well for people outside to berate the Revenue Commissioners and to attack certain powers which they have but the job must be done.  Human nature being what it is, nobody will pay taxes, customs duties or anything else unless they have to and unless we have some arm of the Government or the administration with the necessary powers to do this job then we might as well forget about administering the State and go back to some sort of pastoral type of economy.</P>
    <P>Even as it is, in this Bill, we are repealing some provisions which give the Revenue authorities certain powers. Deputy Byrne does not seem to be aware of that.  But, if we are repealing them, we shall have to put something else in their place.  We just have to have machinery to enable revenue to be raised and the raising of revenue to enable the State to function is in a different category from any other aspect of our administration and must be approached in that way.  It must be approached in the knowledge that it is a fundamentally important matter from the point of view of the functioning of the State and of the Government. However, as I said, I will be quite happy to return to this subject later and deal with it more fully and in greater detail on the specific provisions when we come to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne suggested that perhaps we did not pay enough attention to the memorandum submitted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  First of all, I want to say that I do not think a recommendation has any particular value because of the source from which <Col N="1366" /> it emanates.  I judge a recommendation on its merits.  No matter where it comes from and no matter how exalted a body is, I do not think we should pay any more attention to a recommendation than it deserves on its merits.  In regard to this memorandum we considered it in the greatest possible detail.</P>
    <P>The Institute had a technical session with the Revenue Commissioners and my understanding is that they received satisfaction on a number of points and in particular with regard to the point raised by Deputy Byrne specifically, the question of the length of time which the Revenue Commissioners can go back.  The Institute was written to indicating that the practice is&mdash;and this practice has the formal sanction of the Minister for Finance&mdash;that assessments are not re-opened for a period further back than six years except in cases where fraud or wilful neglect are involved.  We have put in writing to the Institute the clear rule that unless there is fraud or neglect involved then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must deal with realities.  We have given the Institute the assurance that it is not the practice to do this.  I have already dealt with a point raised by Deputy Sweetman but it is no harm to mention it again.  The new medical expense provisions will apply to anybody, child or adult, who is prevented from earning his own livelihood by reason of his infirmity. I want to point out again to Deputies who have been expressing disappointment that this or that was not done with regard to the medical expenses provisions, that we are going further than the Commission recommended. We are going further in so far as we are deleting any requirement that the illness must be likely to be permanent. We are deleting that because, first of all, it would be very difficult to administer, and secondly, because what matters to the taxpayer is the cost of the illness and not the type of illness. If an illness involves a taxpayer in heavy expenses this is the thing that will operate to get him relief and not the particular type of illness.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out that we are including chemists' bills, the cost of drugs and so on, and the fact that we are including such a wide range of medical expenses will mean that the limit of £50 which applies will not, in fact, be a very onerous limitation at all.  I think it was Deputy Tully who raised the question of the married woman who is deserted by her husband and who will now be able to get the housekeeper's allowance.  I admit that the section does refer to full-time employment but I can assure the Deputy that that will be interpreted in a liberal and sensible way.  The idea will be that where a woman is in employment in which she is earning sufficient to provide for herself and her children she will be regarded as being in full-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>It has implications. Our idea is that where a woman has to spend sufficient of her time to earn enough to keep herself and her family she will be included.  I do not think there is any reality in the fears mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins that these new medical expense provisions may affect the activities of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in some way. In that connection I should like to point out, of course, that a taxpayer will only be allowed to charge up for income tax purposes un-recouped medical expenses and there will still be an overwhelming advantage in being a member of the Voluntary Health Insurance.  Bearing in mind the fact that in these income tax proposals we have the £50 limit on the one side and the £300 on the other side, I do not believe there will be any adverse effects from the point of view of the activities of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board because of these new proposals.  I would be very sorry if there were and I am sure there will not be.  Like other Deputies I, too, subscribe to the appreciation to which the Board are entitled for the wonderful job they are doing.</P>

I can only assure him again that the manufacturers will not, in fact, use this to increase their own profits in any way. I understand that the amount involved in a packet of 20 tipped cigarettes is <Col N="1369" /> very small, .01 of an ounce.  This amount will be put back into the cigarettes and will not be used to enhance their profits.</P>

      <P>I think it is about one per cent.  Deputy Sweetman has a point about the double taxation agreement with Canada.  Unfortunately, it is just one of those things in which we were caught out by the march of events.  We were ready to circulate the text of the draft Order with an explanatory memorandum to Deputies when we discovered certain statutory references in the draft had to be altered because of the passing of the Income Tax Act 1967 and this matter is having urgent attention with a view to getting the details into the hands of Deputies.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any other matter of major significance at this stage with which the House would expect me to deal except, perhaps, to come back to the matter raised by Deputy Byrne.  The Deputy will forgive me&mdash; he comes from my own constituency and he is a colleague&mdash;if I tell him that the spectacle of himself as a seagreen Republican demanding complete independence of everything British amuses me a little.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the background and circumstances as well as I do.  I am as anxious as anybody else for the reform of our taxation structure.  I have welcomed, and will welcome, any proposal put forward by any Deputy or organisation but I have the experience of going, not too recently, to experts and saying to them: &ldquo;This is a very difficult and complex problem.  You have been <Col N="1370" /> talking a lot about it but I cannot see my way to a solution of it.  Would you please give me a draft of a solution?&rdquo; Mark you, they disappeared and were not terribly anxious to come back to me with a ready-made solution to any of the problems I put to them.</P>
      <P>I do not know how far we can go in achieving simplicity in our income tax code.  It is all very well to talk about the complex system we inherited from the British but I wonder if the German, French or Belgian system is any simpler.  Certainly, when we go to make double taxation agreements with any of these countries we do not find any great amount of simplicity in the work that has to be done.  I have a suspicion that, by and large. there is roughly the same amount of complexity in all income tax codes because the process goes on interminably of revenue commissioners trying to close loopholes and clever accountants and lawyers finding other loopholes and revenue commissioners seeking to close these again.  That being so, we can expect a great deal of complexity which is unavoidable but I shall devote my attention to the problem and see how the code can be simplified and keep a very open mind on any suggestions or proposals that may be put forward.</P>
      <P>Basically, I suspect what really annoys people about income tax is not the complexity of the code but that it has to be paid.  I do not think we can ever do a great deal to make people happy with income tax, or indeed any other form of tax, simply by playing around with the way in which it is administered.  I may be wrong and if I can discover any concrete solution or if anybody can put such a solution before me in the form of concrete proposals or suggestions, I shall be very happy to adopt it.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last Thursday, I had been speaking about the rate of interest in relation to Post Office savings and the Trustee Savings Bank Account and I referred to the criticism of what was described by a number of Deputies as &ldquo;the low rate of interest&rdquo;.  That rate was increased from 2½ per cent to 3½ per cent from 1st January last.  Deputy Fitzpatrick had drawn attention to the fact that there had been more withdrawals than deposits during 1966 and I pointed out that the rate had then been 2½ per cent and that it had since been increased. From inquiries I made over the week-end and while it is too early to draw any definite conclusion, I am able to say that over the four complete months following the increase in the rate of interest from January 1st, the net deposits in both the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank show a significant improvement as compared with last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Tully to the annual problem of the format of the Telephone Directory. This is a problem which is, and has been engaging our attention over a number of years.  With each issue of the directory, the question of the size of print and whether it is possible or right to continue to endeavour to have all numbers contained in one directory, arises.  In view of the progress made with telephone installations over the past 12 months and the target we have <Col N="1372" /> this year, there is no doubt that this problem is yearly becoming more difficult. Consideration is being given to this question of whether we have a Dublin city directory plus a country directory or whether we endeavour to continue with the existing arrangement. There is no point in my suggesting that we may come down heavily on one side or the other because circumstances will probably force us into having two separate directories.  Against that there is the over-all problem of costs.  As long as we can maintain it at one, we should endeavour to cling to this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to the manner in which we have phased the opening of the Sheriff Street Sorting Office.  The position is that we are most anxious to have our staff move in there as quickly as possible but so far it has been possible to accommodate only the administrative side.  I recently inspected this office and I saw that this is a complex matter.  There were a number of items which had to be attended to but we hope to have the sorting office going ahead there in the next few months.  As most Deputies will be aware, it is very difficult to keep to a deadline in this regard.  Certainly we hope that the whole sorting office will be functional for the Christmas traffic.  In actual fact, it is quite possible that the phased moving in there may prove to be an advantage in <Col N="1373" /> so far as the various staffs will be able to adjust themselves to it in that phased way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the staff quite happy with the arrangements made already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff at all stages have been kept in contact with the arrangements.  They are fully informed as to the developments.  It is fully agreed that there is no point in endeavouring to move any staff in until the facilities are fully laid on for them.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies Molloy and Tully suggested that the Post Office should engage in the manufacture of telephone equipment.  I am sure both Deputies will be fully aware that telephone equipment carries literally thousands of individual pieces, most of which require to be mass-produced for efficient and economic manufacture.  I honestly believe that a telephone industry here could not hope to survive on our requirements alone.  It would need to rely mainly on exports.  With the general overall change in the day-to-day development in this regard, if we endeavoured to get into that field at present, we would probably find ourselves in great difficulty.  It is quite possible we would be very seriously criticised for not having studied the implications of this matter before we embarked on such a venture.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully suggested that we could import the personnel who would have the full qualifications to help us in this regard.  I have had an opportunity of looking over stores in connection with telephones and I have seen the thousands of different parts involved. I think it is certainly too big a venture for this Department to involve itself in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been examined and I certainly agree that we could not possibly consider taking over this particular work in the Department.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy Mullen and Deputy Tully referred to the purchase of foreign supplies.  In fact Deputy Mullen suggested that we were giving preference to foreign suppliers.  This suggestion of giving preference to foreign suppliers is unfounded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of the particular case to which the Deputy refers.  Certainly we could have that investigated and the result communicated to the Deputy.  There is certainly no question of giving preference to a foreign firm in relation to any purchase made by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The reverse in fact is over-all Governmental policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully made reference to telephone account cards.  Straight off, I must state that no firm at present is willing to take on the printing of these cards to specified requirements.  If the Deputy knows of any Irish printing firm interested in this work, he should advise them to get in touch with the Department or with the machine firm itself, IBM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the rental <Col N="1375" /> charge on the Telex services as it affects firms in Galway and the West generally.  The point is that in actual fact the cost for any caller in any part of the country for the Telex service is the same.  The position is that if a user from Galway calls a firm in Dublin, the charge is exactly the same as if two Dublin firms were calling each other. The only difference is the annual rental charge.  The basic rental of £160 per annum covers the cost of the Telex equipment and the line charge within ten miles radius of the Telex exchange in Dublin.  Then there is an additional 30/- per mile charge from 10 to 55 miles and £1 a mile for any distance over 55 miles.  This appears quite a sizeable rent but, as against that, once the rental is paid, the firm has an advantage of having cross-country rate at exactly the same rate as is enjoyed by the Dublin subscribers.</P>
    <P>Since the Telex system was introduced here in 1955, there has been no increase in the rentals or, in fact, in the call charges.  In order to encourage provincial subscribers, the excess mileage charges were reduced as from 1st October, 1964, when the service was converted to automatic working.  This revision benefited all subscribers who were liable for the excess mileage charges.  For example, in Galway rents were reduced by approximately £53 per annum, and in Cork the reductions effected amounted to £63 per annum. There certainly would be an appreciable drop in revenue if the excess mileage charges were to be abolished.  I would point out that costing of the Telex service is at present being undertaken and it is proposed to reconsider this whole question when the costing has been completed.</P>
    <P>In relation to pirate broadcasting, I was pleased to hear Deputy M. E. Dockrell say that he welcomed the proposed legislation in this regard.  He indicated on behalf of his Party that they would support this measure.  As the House is aware, it is in accordance with the Government's decision of March, 1965, to have unified action in this matter and I expect that legislation to outlaw the pirate radio will be before the House shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> Some Deputies referred to various individual local problems.  I do not know whether these are subjects with which I should deal here, but, in an effort to try to be as comprehensive as I possibly can in dealing with the points raised during this debate, I should like to refer to Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick's <i>(Cavan)</i> point in connection with the slowness in the provision of the Post Office in Cavan.  This is a matter which he has raised already and I should like to inform him that Cavan will be an important centre in the postal and telephone network.  In relation to the telephone network, it will have to cater for automatic and, for some time at least, manual working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is over-playing that.  It is necessary in relation to Cavan to plan to the very best advantage for these general purposes, so that, at the same time, maximum space be left for future development. A final sketch plan of the scheme was approved some time ago and at present the detailed working drawings are in hand.  On completion of these, the preparation of the bills of quantities will be proceeded with.  I do not want at this stage to forecast when we will be able to get this work under way but I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it must take some time.  I certainly will go so far as to say that it should be under way in a period of from 12 to 18 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy had a lot to say about the Rowland Hill Fund.  I venture to say that he may not have been fully informed on this.  Lest the Deputy be under any misunderstanding, I should explain that the Rowland <Col N="1377" /> Hill Fund operating in the Post Office is of inestimable value.  I have nothing to say in this regard except to compliment all concerned in operating the fund and to pay tribute to those among the staff who subscribe.  I should certainly like to pay tribute also to the trustees outside the Department who give their time freely in looking after the people who benefit under the fund.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured, Sir, to deal in much detail with the matters which have been raised here on the postal side, and I should like to express my pleasure at hearing the many complimentary remarks passed by almost every Deputy on the operation of the Post Office in general, and to take this opportunity on behalf of my Department of expressing our gratitude for those words of encouragement to the Department as a whole which, in general, praised the progress being made.  It would be wrong if I were to conclude without acknowledging those compliments on behalf of the staff of the Department.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a brief intervention in this debate.  I do not want to take any advantage of the Parliamentary Secretary who has, to all intents and purposes, concluded the debate in relation to the Post Office.  First of all, I should like to say that to nobody has it given greater pleasure than to me that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been amalgamated with the Department of Transport and Power and that the Minister for Transport and Power, with a Parliamentary Secretary, is now running this vast network which might well be entitled Communications, communications of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say one or two things in relation to the Post Office. I am sorry I did not speak before the Parliamentary Secretary.  I was not in the House when he probably dealt with a similar complaint, if it was made, that is, the delay at certain times in getting the exchange to answer in relation to trunk calls.  I remember asking a Parliamentary Question on one occasion, when Deputy Hilliard <Col N="1378" /> was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and he gave me the reply that the average delay was 11 seconds.</P>
    <P>I should like both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to try it some time, without mentioning any kind of priorities, and they would realise there are far more than 11 seconds involved, at certain times.  That may well be due to change over of staff at some particular hour, when there are not as many as at another time.  I do not know what is the reason but it certainly gives rise to a considerable feeling of irritation in subscribers. Otherwise, I have nothing but the highest praise for the operators on the long-distance calls with whom one comes in contact from time to time. They are all extremely helpful and knowledgeable and, once one gets them, there certainly can be no fault to be found with the service they give.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make&mdash; and I am sure it has been made already &mdash;is this business of demanding so many years' rental prior to the supply of a telephone, getting a substantial sum of money, with then a considerable delay before the telephone is supplied. I know a case where over two years ago a lady in a very remote part of the country&mdash;where a telephone would be a considerable help to her, now that she lives alone, her family having gone to Dublin and other parts of the country&mdash;paid a sum of over £80 and is still waiting for her telephone.  This is not right.  I do not think there is any other sort of commercial enterprise which would ask for money so long in advance of supplying the article for which the money is paid.  However, it is the brighter side we have witnessed and heard about in the provision of telephones.  That complaint may well be obviated in a very short period, if telephones are to be supplied.  But it is a very annoying thing to people who have paid a sum of money immediately on demand&mdash;substantial to them &mdash;to have to wait for a period of one, two, or over two years, for a telephone.</P>
    <P>Something which is missed when we are dealing with the Post Office&mdash;and not so much missed as taken for granted&mdash;are the two great qualities in the postal service, from sorting to <Col N="1379" /> delivery: honesty and care in handling the wares submitted to them.  The incidence of dishonesty in the Post Office, having regard to its vast ramifications, to the opportunity and, very often, the temptation offered, is very small indeed.  It is a very rare type of case which goes into the courts in relation to the opening of postal packets.  For that, those people who operate at all levels in the Post Office are to be complimented. The same can be said of the manner in which they handle the property entrusted to them, from sorting to delivery.  That is all I have to say about that portion of the Department now known as Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann is quite another matter and, lest there be any confusion on the part of anybody as to the Fine Gael attitude towards Telefís Éireann, I should like to restate it simply: we have no quarrel whatsoever with the staff, individually or collectively, in Montrose.  Our objection is to what we regard as unwarranted interference with members of the staff by members of the Government from time to time, an interference which the Minister may exercise, pursuant to statute, by giving notice in writing. This, it has plainly been admitted on at least three occasions, has not been done.  The telephone has simply been taken up, and a Minister not responsible at all for the activities of Telefís Éireann has been able to do it, has been able to ring up and get a programme cancelled or curtailed.  That, of course, is going beyond the powers provided in the statute setting up the Authority.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has read the article in today's <i>Irish Times</i> dealing with this matter.  I shall not bore either the Minister or the House by quoting from it but certainly it is an article which is thought-provoking and certainly demands an answer from the Minister. It is a timely article, written before the Minister has replied in this regard, and dealing with the constitution of the Authority.  Indeed, I do not think it can be gainsaid, in spite of the Minister's protestations in another place recently about people appointed to State bodies, <Col N="1380" /> that the majority of the members of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority are people who will readily listen to advice, or anything else you like to call it, from Government Ministers.  They are hand-picked, and indeed in the vast majority of the cases picked not for any contribution they might be able to give to television, radio diffusion or anything of that kind, but for the service they have given to the Government Party in the past and are prepared to give as members of the Authority, by their silence, in the future, and by failing to stand up to individual members of the Government when they seem to interfere in a manner unwarranted by the provisions of the statute.</P>
    <P>The people in Montrose, in so far as I have personal experience of them, in so far as I hear from others and in so far as I can gather from the programmes they present, are doing a wonderful job of work, and are not the kind of people who should be subjected to this kind of interference.  This is a new station, a new venture, comparatively, for us and one that should be allowed to grow naturally, free of inhibiting influences.  Admittedly, of course, the Government could, through the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, step in at certain times, but as I think the former Minister said on one occasion, it was only in the case of an emergency that that power would be exercised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a statement, as is referred to in this article, that it was never intended that television would be completely independent of the Government. That statement, of course, has no authoritative basis in the legislative provisions we have at the moment relating to this Authority.  It would be a very good thing for the Authority if they were able to go ahead in the knowledge they would not be interfered with in this manner.  As I have said, they are doing an excellent job on nearly all of the fronts in which they have interested themselves. When one looks at the speed and accuracy with which a much bigger and much older organisation, the BBC, is able to deal with an emergency at the moment, to deal with a particularly <Col N="1381" /> interesting current event, and then looks at a programme like &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; here in which the people directly responsible for its production are able to marshal their facts and get the interested people together, one realises that our service is moving very rapidly into the sphere of creditable comparison with the BBC.  That is the only guide we have to help us in making these comparisons.</P>
    <P>There are the other programmes: the political programmes, the nature study programmes, all of which are done very well.  The news for the most part is done extremely impartially but it cannot be denied that the flavour of the news from time to time is very much pro-Government and Government activity.  That is a bad thing and not alone politically.  It is a bad thing socially for our people that they should, through any interference by the Government or by members of the Government, be led into a situation in which they would be irritated or goaded into looking at such an excellent institution as Telefís Éireann with a cynical eye.  That is the kind of thing that I would fear for the future of this station which is, at the moment, excellently manned and run excellently and nothing should be done to give rise to it.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I would make a brief intervention.  Those are the points in which I have a particular and immediate interest and I feel that they are points that might merit some consideration.  Above all, I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to deal with the points made in this article which, I am sure, he has read in today's <i>Irish Times</i> and to give an assurance once and for all to the people of this country that Telefís Éireann is an independent authority and that the Authority are working simply according to the mandates given to them under the particular Act under which they operate and that even the Taoiseach's statement that it was never intended that they be independent is not exactly in accordance with the facts.  I will conclude by wishing the staff of Telefís Éireann the very best of luck and hope that they will enjoy the full <Col N="1382" /> confidence of the Irish people for the future.</P>
    <P>May I go back to the Post Office again to compliment them from the very top echelon down to the people who deliver the mails on the very high incidence of honesty and care in these transactions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank everybody in the House who praised the general efficiency of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Even though they made individual criticisms, it was quite evident that the staff of the post offices can feel that they have the general support of all Parties in the House.</P>
      <P>In regard to Radio Telefís Éireann. Deputy M. E. Dockrell led for the Opposition and in what he said there was no suggestion of excessive interference by the Government.  He made no suggestion of there being a need for any kind of inquiry into the conduct of Telefís Éireann.  Indeed, when one reads the speeches of all the Deputies on the Opposition side, they had so much to say in praise of the general programme of Telefís Éireann that one can only conclude that they must admit by implication that there has not been any noticeable interference by the Government of a kind which would inevitably be reflected in the programme.  There were no suggestions by members of the Opposition of the failure of Telefís Éireann to express particular views on social or economic problems.  There was no sustained suggestion on either side of the House that there was a lack of balance in political reporting. There was no suggestion whatever in speeches in general that Telefís Éireann failed to have constructive discussions on matters of interest.  There was nothing of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one reads the speeches, as I have done, of all those Deputies, one can only come to the conclusion that the few Deputies who made absurd suggestions that the Board, allegedly largely Fianna Fáil, was under my thumb or under the thumb of other Ministers, and was servile to the Government, were ludicrously out of touch with realities.  Their statements are revealed to be ludicrous by the <Col N="1383" /> general character of the speeches made by the Opposition.  The actual fact is that as a State company, Radio Telefís Éireann is one of the freest in the world.  I do not suppose there are even 20 countries where a service is so free of interference of one kind or another. I might add that the veto clause which exists and which has not been used is to be found in the Acts of other countries setting up a State broadcasting authority.  In the case of the BBC, which, heaven knows, has enough controversial programme material, there is a clause in the constitution making it quite clear that any Minister may require the broadcasting authority to broadcast an announcement, in illustration of a broadcasting organisation's obligation to deliver certain types of information.</P>
    <P>I thought I had better speak in some detail about this in order that people may understand the complex issue of broadcasting in television.  I have had very considerable experience of broadcasting already.  It was I who initiated legislative freedom for Radio Éireann, or rather I set it on the path to being free of immediate Civil Service control. I am as jealous as anybody else of the freedom of Radio Telefís Éireann, that they should be able to act freely and to make quite sure that all points of view in regard to the community's problems are expressed.  In a modern democracy, conditions for discussing the character of a broadcasting service are very much the same but, of course, there are local variations.</P>
    <P>May I say to the writer of the article in the <i>Irish Times</i> that it was an interesting, challenging, controversial statement but one cannot lay down rigid rules for the character of a radio or TV service in the sense that the board could stick to a detailed settled policy of what their intentions and ideas were in regard to every single aspect of the programme.  There are financial limitations on the Board which provide one very final discipline on their actions and their policy.  I think it is true to say of all television authorities that the developing and changing programme spells the character of the policy, not a set of rules published by <Col N="1384" /> the board, and the extent to which controversial matters are discussed, the extent to which the programmes cover different aspects of national life as they change from year to year indicate what is in the mind of the authority. Quite naturally as the Government appoint the board and must have confidence in the board, the Government naturally have an interest in this general character of programme as it emerges through the years.</P>
    <P>May I point out to the Members of the House who talk about this, that television is entertainment?  There is only one programme and a great many different kinds of viewers with different points of view.  The television service is not like a newspaper and it cannot give the sustained coverage to events that a full-scale newspaper service can give by its very nature.  I suppose it is true to say that the board of Telefís Éireann, knowing the mood and the ideas of the members of the Government and of the House in general, would feel that the programme must be designed on a generally commercial basis, that there must be adequate numbers of viewers in order that the advertising can be secured, that they must entertain people, that the kind of programmes that will be acceptable would be of a light kind, that people like to relax and to be amused in the evenings with programmes of various sorts.  Quite obviously, the House and the Government will wish that the Board will provide stimulating discussions and features relating to social and economic matters and particularly in relation to our cultural heritage and to stimulate interest in the modern development of a distinctive Irish civilisation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I know the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority have these ideals.  I met them when I was appointed Minister.  I should add to this general statement the desirability of having political discussions and religious talks of every kind.  This is the broad spectrum of policy shared by the Board and myself.  I think it is true to say that we would all wish RTE to push the higher level of programmes somewhat in advance of demand, so that we can be certain <Col N="1385" /> that Radio Telefís Éireann are helping to develop the national consciousness and helping to develop&mdash;how shall I describe it?  &mdash;an Irish-Ireland consciousness which is at the same time thoroughly international in attitude and understanding the modern world.  These are the ordinary generalisations with which any person with national feeling would agree in so far as television is concerned.</P>
    <P>May I point out in relation to the writer in the <i>Irish Times</i> that there will always be discussions about what exactly is the right kind of programme. Unless there is controversy about what RTE produce, the service will die.  Inevitably there will be people who will object to this programme or that programme, and say we should have more of some and less of others.  There is sufficient controversy circulating about RTE, which they receive in the form of letters and telephone calls, so we can be certain that they are interesting the public.  The day that controversy ceases so far as broadcasting is concerned, it will be a very dead service.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is quite possible to have controversy arising quite suddenly on matters of alleged interference by the Government, on matters such as the request by the Taoiseach to RTE not to send a team to Vietnam. A great deal of criticism is based on the immediate view of a specific programme. It is very hard to expect people to judge a television service over a prolonged period, because most people have an immediate reaction to a programme.  As a result, there is always excitement and always controversy surrounding a broadcasting service. That can be found in the BBC or in any other broadcasting organisation in any other democracy.  It is quite inevitable.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the statement by the former Taoiseach about RTE having to take account of Government policy.  I have already spoken of the BBC regulations.  Government decisions based on existing legislation, Government policy on new Bills passed in the House, and comments by Ministers of some importance in relation to economic problems and economic issues, should be properly broadcast by <Col N="1386" /> RTE and full attention should be paid to all announcements which come from the Government on important matters. When the Government decide on a specific policy it is usual, in a democratic country, for that policy to be expressed, and there should not be an immediate sabotage of that statement by someone deliberately produced to confuse the minds of the listeners or viewers in relation to important statements on policy.  This does not mean that there cannot be discussions on what constitutes policies on all the social and economic problems in the country, conducted in a proper manner. That will be the case in any democratic country.  RTE cannot give all the news.  They must give expression to Government policy on an important matter, and Government decisions in a proper manner.  This particularly applies to any Government statement made at a time of crisis or emergency. I do not think anyone could have any objection to this policy.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the appearances of Ministers on television. Ministers appear on television services all over the world.  The television news service content depends to a great extent on what is considered to be news, and what Ministers say is considered to be news.  News of speeches in the Dáil is given in a reasonably balanced way.  RTE cannot guarantee balances over a 24-hour period, but taking one day with another, there was very little criticism from either side of the House about the balance of the news so that the people can appreciate Deputies' views and the views of the Parties.</P>
    <P>If anyone thinks that the appearance of a Minister on the television service here or in Sweden or in Denmark is evidence of prejudice on the part of the Authority the answer is that in every democracy there are loads and loads of unsolved moral, social and economic problems which are debated continuously.  When unsolved problems are debated over television, or in the newspapers, or over the radio service, the Government of the day inevitably can only take what I might describe as a defensive point of view. If the Government are involved in a <Col N="1387" /> controversy, directly or indirectly, they can only indicate that they have done so and so, or will do so and so, or have not enough money to spend more on what is being done.  In countries where there are unsolved problems the idea that there can be a heavy balance of interest in favour of the Government of the day is ludicrous.  It is ludicrous in the case of RTE and, indeed, it has not been suggested in the House that there is an imbalance.  We have unsolved problems and every one of them has been debated over RTE in one way or another.</P>
    <P>As I say, the Government have a programme which they believe to be right for the economy.  They continue that programme, amend and change it. Of course, no Government's programme ever satisfies everyone.  Therein lies the opportunity for a continuous&mdash; how shall I put it?  &mdash;sniping at the Government, and criticism of the Government in all those discussions which take place.  A great deal of agitation takes place over a broadcasting service in times of stress.  Everyone remembers the controversy that took place over some BBC reports when the Conservatives were going out of power.  Equally, now that the English people have been in some financial difficulties, one can see again the controversy that inevitably takes place when the sayings and actions and politics of the present British Government are discussed over the BBC.  People supporting different Parties always worry as to whether there is sufficient balance or a sufficient interest being given to one Party or another.</P>
    <P>In all of this, it should be stated in relation to all sorts of rumours that emerge, that RTE itself is an entertainment organisation with a staff of very able people, many of them full of excitement and interest, anxious to produce this and that programme, to innovate here and there; and quite naturally every single producer in RTE has his own particular view as to what constitutes the right kind of programme and the right kind of approach to these controversial matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> Indeed, I have heard criticism of a varied kind of RTE which can be reflected in speeches of Members of the House.  Some say there is too much violence, others that the Wild West story has now become a traditional form of entertainment&mdash;that the good man always wins.  I have heard suggestions that RTE produces programmes that are offensive to people of conservative taste and I have heard equally from the younger generation that the programmes are not sufficiently controversial. A balance has to be struck between the two.</P>
    <P>From listening to Deputies, I think Radio Telefís Éireann has been fairly successful in holding a balance between the old and the new, between the traditional and the modern, between the various Parties; and I repeat that the interference in the programmes of RTE has been absolutely negligible, and I hope will continue to be so.  I hope everybody understands the point made by a previous Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in regard to the veto clause.  There is no reason why the veto clause should be used.  In the two cases that have been quoted, the Authority agreed with the suggestion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I need to deal in detail with the various comments made by Members on the programmes. As I have said, the Board of RTE know my ideas which are of a general character requesting RTE to advance the cause, as far as possible, of a fine Irish civilisation; and I do not intend to interfere in detail.  I occasionally make suggestions on things that might be considered as new programmes. These suggestions are made in a nonpolitical way.  I have the right to do that.</P>
    <P>Whether I need to comment on everything that has been said is very doubtful but I will make one or two comments because I think Deputies ought to have the answers to some of the questions they asked.  It is a fact that the farming programme has been dropped, largely for the summer months.  This is the kind of programme on which I have very strong views as being in general the type of programme which RTE must indeed include and <Col N="1389" /> I would intervene very specifically if the programme did not continue, even if I might be accused of interfering with RTE.  This is a generally desirable programme which has been dropped for the summer.  The same thing applies to the &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo; Programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne referred to the desirability of having more programmes on the EEC.  There has been quite a discussion on the EEC and as the situation develops one way or another RTE will play the same part they have played in relation to other matters concerning our economic development. Members of the House naturally ask for more home produced programmes. I do not think I would be telling any secret if I mentioned the fact that the cost of a canned programme can be as little as one-tenth of the cost of a home-produced drama for the same time.  We shall have to develop the financial resources of RTE before we can go very much beyond the present level of the home-produced programmes, which, I think, are 53 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the necessity for dealing with economic problems.  If he looks at Telefís Éireann and listens to Radio Éireann, he will find that in a week's programmes most of these problems, such as our relationship to GATT and the Kennedy Round of tariffs, are being covered in one way or another.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the orchestra.  As this is a very important element in our cultural programmes, I should like to tell him that the Authority have entered into agreements with a number of eminent conductors to conduct the orchestra during the months that follow the time when Tibor Paul's contract ceases in July. It is the policy generally to rely on guest conductors rather than to employ permanent conductors.  This is quite common to a number of orchestras.  I join with Deputy Dockrell in expressing the hope that the very high standard of the orchestra will be maintained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it is a question of having to consider the number of people listening and viewing in relation to the total programmes.  I am always encouraging RTE to go a little in advance if they can in order that more and more people will take an interest in everything&mdash;our culture, our economic and social problems.  I think the Authority are doing their best in that respect and I am sure the Board will take note of what the Deputy has said.</P>
      <P>One Deputy suggested that the advertising revenue of RTE was going down.  What was said was that it is less buoyant, which means it is not rising so rapidly.  I do not want to be taken as indicating that there is any question of reduced RTE advertising revenue.  Far from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to interference by Telefís Éireann with transmissions from UTV in certain areas.  This was fully considered a few years ago and the position was explained in reply to a number of questions.  A lengthy statement was issued to the Press by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1962.  Briefly, the position is that RTE operates on frequencies which are shared by international agreement with other transmissions.  Some mutual interference is therefore necessary outside the service area of the transmitter. RTE overlaps UTV.  The signal from Mount Leinster interferes with the <Col N="1391" /> weak UTV signal outside the UTV service area.  Special technical measures have been taken to reduce mutual interference between UTV and Mount Leinster to a minimum and I do not think anything further can be done in this direction.  The main consideration about this whole business is that Telefís Éireann stations are operating in accordance with the Stockholm Agreement and that our first obligation is to ensure that viewers get satisfactory reception of the home programmes and that Telefís Éireann transmitters must not cause interference within the service area of the transmitters of other administrations.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about licence fees.  I have already said that licence fees will not be changed during the current financial year.  Although I know the licence fee is a definite expense for families of modest income, I think a television programme is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment in the world.  The cost, based on a £5 licence, is roughly a halfpenny an hour.  I do not know whether there is anything else quite so inexpensive in the form of a programme of entertainment of that kind.  Although people do not feel that when they have to pay the full £5 and when they have modest incomes, I would like to express that fact that it works out at roughly a halfpenny an hour.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies referred again to the necessity for providing telephones where there is a waiting list.  I have already dealt with that whole question.  The waiting list is going to be reduced this year and the long term applicants' needs are being satisfied and telephones installed.  I want to make it clear that, as far as I am concerned, the first and absolute priority is to ensure that the <Col N="1393" /> present service, which has grown so rapidly, is a first-class service in relation to the efficiency with which calls can be made, and the second priority is to continue with the installation of telephones and the improvement of the service in general.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke of the very heavy charges, particularly in rural districts, for telephone installations and the advance charge now required.  I am looking into this as far as possible.  Deputies will appreciate that the capital cost of the installation of a long-distance telephone is very heavy. I am looking into it, but I cannot say what the outcome will be.  Many Deputies also referred to the higher rental charges which have been established. One of the reasons for this is inflation, and I hope the disadvantages of inflation have been learned by now.</P>
      <P>I recall a recent instance of a Deputy referring to a particular applicant for a telephone who was setting up a factory.  I do not think I need mention the name.  He implied that the deposit required seemed to be rather excessive.  In reply to the Deputy, I can say that the firm intended to be in daily telephone communication with a European country and the deposit asked for was entirely reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to the fraudulent booking of trunk calls by quoting wrong originating telephone numbers. All I can say is we do all we can to take precautions to see that this does not take place.  I do not intend to divulge any details of these precautions, but Deputies can be assured that we do everything we can to avoid people having calls added to their bills which are the result of others making use of their telephone numbers for the purpose of making calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great number of Deputies spoke about the establishment of more and more kiosks.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to that very adequately.  I must make it clear that there really must be priorities in regard to the national programme for communication development or any other development. If we establish kiosks that literally have to be subsidised and subsidised and still further subsidised, <Col N="1394" /> somebody else is going to suffer. Eventually, if we go on with that process, the taxpayer will be literally drowned with gross subsidies in order to provide services for everybody and at every conceivable opportunity.  We are quite liberal in our kiosk policy.  It is essential that a kiosk should pay. Our communications have grown so much in this country, with the number of private cars and telephone lines available, that our policy for kiosks is reasonable at present.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the need for telephone kiosks in connection with the tourist campaign.  I agree with them, but, there again, there are limits.  If somebody really feels a kiosk is required in some particular area for only two months of the summer season, then I think the regional tourist organisation or the local authority, or a combination of the two, should help with a subsidy and the ordinary telephone user should not be asked to pay a subsidy in that connection.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the western telephone service.  If they read the statement made in connection with the telephone service, they will find an improved service, for example, the Athlone-Ballina cable.  Other circuits are being established throughout the West and the telephone service there is steadily improving.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte suggested that trunk telephone calls should be routed through Belfast and not through Dublin.  This has been suggested but the British Post Office, apparently, contrary to what Deputy Harte thinks, have no circuits to spare and they could not undertake to handle the extra traffic of which he spoke.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to overhead wiring versus underground cabling.  Of course, there again, the cost of underground cabling in a great many cases would be prohibitive and only as the number of circuits increases can the utilisation of underground cabling become a practical proposition.  As a matter of fact, the Department is providing an increasing proportion of underground cabling as the circuits develop in general and I would hope that in future we will be able to reduce <Col N="1395" /> the number of occasions in which overhead wiring in suburban areas is inevitable. I think it is true to say that in new housing estates most of the cabling is placed underground as the duct is provided at the building stage but, unless ducts have also been provided into the houses, the lead-in wires to subscribers' telephones must, in the interests of economy, be provided by means of overhead wires.  We have been experimenting with the provision of underground lead-ins to houses in some new private housing estates, where we think telephone density would be high.  This experiment has been working quite satisfactorily and I think it is true to say that these arrangements for underground lead-ins to houses are likely to be introduced in the majority of new private housing estates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the reinstatement of roads and footpaths opened in the course of cabling works. The work of reinstating roads and footpaths opened by my Department in the course of cabling works is carried out in almost all cases, not by the Post Office, but by the local authority.  The Department temporarily fills in the ground that has been disturbed and serves a reinstatement order on the local council or corporation and the corporation carry out the final restoration of the surface as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>A telephone weather service for the Dublin area was opened on 23rd March, 1967.  Forecasts supplied by the Meteorological Office are recorded at the Dublin exchange where special equipment has been installed for the transmission of the bulletins by telephone. Callers may obtain the information by dialling 1199.</P>

      <P>The number is 1199. Forecasting relates to the next six hours and covers the land area within 20 miles of Dublin and a few miles of the adjacent coastal waters.  The service, I am glad to say, has proved very popular.  Approximately 132,000 calls were made to the service in the <Col N="1396" /> first five weeks of its operation.  I hope that the good lady whose pleasant voice is recorded and is heard by so many people will have some better news to give us than was possible in the past week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay referred to certain aspects of the telephone service.  I should tell Deputy Lindsay that we are experiencing difficulties with Mayo County Council about wayleaves required for new poles.  This has caused serious delay to certain installations including, perhaps, the one Deputy Lindsay has in mind.  If the Deputy will give me particulars of the case to which he referred, I will be glad to look it up.  We have ceased the practice of asking for advance payment before looking for any necessary wayleaves. We are returning payments in delayed cases which appear unlikely to be settled quickly.  I quite sympathise with the Deputy when he suggested that people should not be asked to pay a very large sum in advance over a long period and then not be supplied with a telephone.  That is the answer to what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher referred to the necessity of ensuring that the telephone administration in general is as efficient as possible.  I hope Deputies read everything I said in the course of the Estimate speech, that my predecessor established an investigation by a consultant into certain aspects of telephone administration. That examination is continuing. I think it is true to say that any efficient organisation periodically has its whole structure examined from within and from without in order to ensure that the most modern practices are being applied, that the administration is geared to face very much higher turnover and a great expansion. I wish to assure Deputy Gallagher and other Members of the House that the telephone administration has been through an explosive period of expansion and that all these matters are being examined into.  He referred to the position of the telephone service as a Civil Service organisation.  We are examining the question of whether under future circumstances a very large commercial business with, admittedly, very valuable social service responsibilities, is best <Col N="1397" /> run in its present form or whether there could be changes in the form of administration.  I think it is a convenient time to do it because we have come, as I said, to a period when the service has grown very, very greatly and when this kind of examination may be made with a view to thinking of the future.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that because of the fact that at all times capital has not been fully available for everything in this country and there are periods of particular credit squeeze, no administration, either run entirely by the Civil Service or by a State company, can proceed on the most efficient lines if it is unable to plan capitalwise for at least five or six years ahead and even to have a certain general programme planned tentatively for ten years ahead.</P>
    <P>As some Deputies may know, it can take as much as two years to deliver equipment when it has been finally ordered, particularly complicated exchange equipment, and it is true to say that the telephone administration has not had the benefit of an absolutely continuous five-year programme in the sense of being absolutely assured that, on the basis of an increase of a given number of telephone installations per year, capital would be available and, in making certain assumptions about the growth of the service, that capital would be available.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, in the case of the ESB, where the problem is rather different and where it is absolutely essential to link demand with supply, at no time has any question of shortage of capital prevented the ESB from going on a continuous five-year programme basis.  The Report on Full Employment did suggest that the telephone service is a very vital factor indeed in our future economic progress and I hope to be able to establish the idea that there must be, at this stage of our existance, proper programming of telephone development. That in itself will help the officers of the Department to ensure that progress is made and on the most efficient basis.  In line with any examination which we make into the <Col N="1398" /> character of the telephone administration, there must be concomitantly with that a plan for programming an expansion on a definite basis.  I think it is only fair to the officers of the Department to say that.</P>
    <P>It is true that very large sums of money have been voted by the House year after year but what I should like to see would be a programme based on a given anticipated expansion of the service, with everything settled and agreed to in advance as far as it can be under our law.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt at considerable length with all the observations made, not already very ably dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary. I should like once more to thank the Members of the House for their very constructive approach to this debate and for the very pleasant observations they had to make both on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and on the general organisation of Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,524,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I want to refer in relation to the administration of lands.  The 1965 Act revolutionised the distribution of land in this country.  I had always thought that the policy of the Department was to place as many people on the land as possible and to increase the holdings of small farmers but to leave them in the position that they were able to make a proper living.  Under the 1945 Act, the charges imposed on the farmers on the side of the country from which I come, the east, and to a large <Col N="1399" /> extent in areas in Munster and other places outside the congested areas, have been considerably increased.  I thought also that up to the enactment of the 1965 Act as a result of legislation introduced around the time of the Economic War when Fianna Fáil first came into power, the annuities were halved, but under the 1965 Act, as far as I can read it, the annuities are no longer halved anywhere except in the congested areas.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission finds itself in the position of having to go on a free market to buy land.  The minimum prices of land today are in the neighbourhood of £100 or £150 an acre. The rate of interest charged by the Department is 7¾ per cent.  That means that on a farm of land bought on the open market by the Land Commission at £100 an acre, the charge is approximately £7 15s per statute acre.  On land bought at £150 an acre, the charge is £10 per statute acre.  Therefore, if I am a small farmer receiving an allotment of land from the Land Commission and I do not live in the congested areas which cover about six or seven counties, I have to pay a minimum flat rate of £7 15s. per statute acre.  That is not the end of it.  If there is fencing to be done and if there are roads to be laid down, I have to pay for this work as well.  Living as I do outside the congested areas, I also have to face a charge which is double the annuity charge those more fortunate people have to pay in the congested areas.  I fully realise that the circumstances prevailing in those counties are quite different from those prevailing in my own county but, in my considered opinion, there is no small farmer, that is, provided he is entirely dependent for his living on farming, in a position to pay a charge of £7 to £10 an acre for a farm allocated to him by the Land Commission.  That may not sound like an awful lot of money but it boils down to this, that if the allotment of land is 30 acres, then seven times 30 is £210 a year, which makes it quite impossible for the allottee to pay his way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that when the Minister rises to reply, he will say&mdash;one cannot blame him for putting the best face on <Col N="1400" /> the unfortunate situation which has been brought about by the 1965 Act&mdash; that there is a very small percentage of refusals of allotments.  That is perfectly true.  The refusals today, I understand, are in the neighbourhood of ten per cent.  Is there anybody in this country struggling to exist on a small farm of 30 acres who gets an opportunity of an allocation of another 25 acres and who will not take it?  The majority of people will chance it, hoping they will be able to weather it.</P>
    <P>What I want to suggest to the Minister and to the House is that an impossible burden is being placed on the small farmers of Ireland, and it should not be very hard to get around this. It will not cost the State all that amount of money to equate the charges with those in the congested areas.  We are very fairminded in Leinster, and I am sure the same in Munster, and we appreciate the fact that perhaps we have a slightly better way of living than those in the west of Ireland and in the congested areas, but surely the ratio between the two is out of all proportion?  The Constitution says that everybody in this country should get an equal chance.  I submit to the Minister that under his policy everyone is not getting an equal chance.  It is desirable socially and economically that we should expand our farming production and keep as many people on the land as possible.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to rectify the situation, the only way he can rectify it without legislation&mdash;I am not permitted on the Estimate to advocate legislation and I do not think it is necessary in this case&mdash; is to look to the Minister for Finance for a subsidy to reduce the rents; otherwise, the Department of Lands will be faced with chaos in the not too distant future.  They are going to allocate land and, as I say, the allottees will naturally take the land in the hope that they will be able to carry on. They will find they will not be able to do so and chaos will set in.  Farms will be returned to the Minister for Lands, or to the Commissioners, as the case may be.  The land will have to be re-allocated which will mean extra work and extra finance, and it will <Col N="1401" /> show that the present policy in respect of the allocation of land is a total failure.</P>
    <P>I am making this speech not in any spirit of acrimony but because I am conversant with what is happening and with the difficulties farmers in my constituency will have to face&mdash;and not alone in my constituency but throughout the country&mdash;if they have to pay these very high charges, because, on top of whatever annuity they must pay, they also have to pay rates, and rates are not going down and are not likely to go down in the foreseeable future.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>The second matter I want to deal with is the question of the North Slob. This is constituted of 1,400 or 1,500 acres of arable land.  A special embankment was erected there 100 years ago.  Portion of this land was owned at one time by a Wexford family who farmed it, produced root crops and reared livestock on it.  It is some of the best arable land in Europe.  It is owned at present by a non-national.  He has 200 head of cattle on it and he employs 12 men.  Not many farmers are in a position today to employ 12 men. I understand he wanted to carry out some deep soil drainage.  He applied to the Department of Agriculture for a drainage grant and he was refused on the ground that, if he carried out drainage, he would ruin the marshes.</P>
    <P>Last January the Minister for Lands made a speech and, according to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 18th January, he referred to the white-fronted geese from Greenland migrating to the Wexford marshes and said: &ldquo;The drainage of these marshes, which would be detrimental to the geese, had presented the Department with a big problem.  The Department hoped to acquire 500 acres of these marshes as a preserve for these geese.&rdquo; I submit there are no marshes.  A drainage scheme was carried out in this area a century ago and, as a result of that, the area was freed of marshes and is today arable land fit to grow anything.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is the intention of the Land Commission to acquire this land in order to encourage white-fronted geese to migrate here every year and provide tourists with shooting <Col N="1402" /> facilities.  Because of my local knowledge, I know that the geese have been coming to this area over the years; they have been coming into the sloblands, not into a marsh.  This slob is, in fact, arable land.  It would be a great pity if facilities are refused for the drainage of these lands in order to preserve them as so-called marshes to encourage the geese to come into this country.  I should like the Minister to give an assurance that the Department do not intend to acquire 500 acres of the North Slob or, if they intend to acquire it, as they are entitled to do, that they will treat those 500 acres as arable land.</P>
    <P>The next matter I wish to raise relates to forestry employment and pensions for forestry employees.  I understand a gratuity is payable to a worker who has been employed for a certain number of years.  I think the period is 20.  Lately I have been getting correspondence from constituents who have retired from forestry for a number of years and who knew nothing whatever about this system of gratuity.  Some of these people have been retired for three or four years.  I suppose if they were retired for six years, they would be statute barred.  If there is a system of gratuity on retirement, these forestry employees should be informed of it when they are retiring.  It should be a simple matter to do this through the local forestry office.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment, I am not satisfied with the reply the Minister gave recently as to the reduction because of redundancy.  Some of the redundancy is due to less land being acquired, but I understand that problem has now been solved.  The target of 25,000 acres per annum, set by the inter-Party Government originally, is again being reached.  It had dropped to 20,000 acres for a year or so.  I understand that redundancy now is due to more modern techniques: fewer people can do the work with better results.  That is what I am told.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question, the Minister stated that he believed the reduction in employment would be only 2½ per cent.  I think he was referring to the entire country.  Everything seems to work out to our disadvantage <Col N="1403" /> in Wexford and I should like to know now if we are paying for redundancy in the rest of the country, if redundancy over the entire country is 2½ per cent.  I submit that there is a much higher reduction in employment in one forest in my constituency and I believe the position is the same in other Wexford forests.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Department of Lands giving my views on this matter.  I have not yet received a reply. No doubt they are cogitating on the points I put before them.  In Wexford the reduction is, in my estimation, 12 per cent.  If the overall reduction is 2½ per cent and the reduction in Wexford is 12 per cent, Wexford is not only paying, along with the other counties, a higher rate of charges but is also paying dearly in employment. I trust the Minister will answer the points I have made when he comes to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points I should like to make.  The first is in relation to the Kennedy Memorial Park.  I am glad to see an increased allocation for the development of that worthy project.  I should like, however, to remind the Minister that originally the lands here were sold to the Land Commission, not specifically, I am sure, but with the general idea that the land on that very fine farm of between 300 and 400 acres would be available for division among the many smallholders in that area.  After the assassination of President Kennedy and when the Government were endeavouring to commemorate him in that area, the Minister was aware of that holding in the hands of the Land Commission and proceeded to have it transferred to the Forestry Division of his Department for development.  In his speech, the Minister complimented the societies in America that helped to commemorate their President in this venture.  I should like to place on record our appreciation of the many smallholders in that area who would have benefited by the division of that land because when the land was transferred to the Forestry Division, not a dissenting voice was heard in that semi-congested area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on in the development, when <Col N="1404" /> the Forestry Division came to acquire the commonage on Sliabh Coillte, they were not very generous in trying to purchase the rights of the landowners there.  Including the Land Commission, there were 21 tenants who had rights to an area of over 200 acres.  In their first effort to acquire that land, the Forestry Division offered a ridiculously low sum to the tenants for their rights there.  It was so low that it created a certain amount of resentment.  People came together and said they would not accept the offer and asked for a higher price.  In the course of further negotiations, particularly by the local curate and other people, it was asked what might be considered a reasonable sum.  They were not prepared to take &mdash;and I think they were right&mdash;the ordinary price offered by the Forestry Division for land suitable for planting.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider that the tenants were entitled to look on this land as to a certain extent development land.  In any area where development takes place, landowners get prices for their property far and away above those for what might be regarded as land for agricultural purposes.  The tenants are entitled to some extent to view this undertaking as development.  The price they asked was fairly reasonable.  I do not know the exact position.  My information is that the Forestry Division have now decided not to develop the commonage. If this is because of the difference of opinion on price, then I think it is a pity.  The difference between what is offered and what is asked is about £3,500 to £4,000.  It may seem big money but it is relatively small in the light of the total amount of money to be spent on the undertaking.  I appeal to the Minister to have his officials deal sympathetically with the people here. They are mainly the people who would have benefited by the division of the land and, as I have said, when that land to which they had been looking forward for many years passed out of their grasp almost there was not a dissenting voice to be heard.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that when the Forestry Division took over this land, there was an application to <Col N="1405" /> the Land Commission by the local GAA club for a site for a playing field.  I am sure there will not be difficulty about that application because, with the development of a college there, a playing field will be a necessity.  I trust that the local GAA club will be granted their request.</P>
    <P>There is another small problem in connection with this take-over.  A relatively small landholder, living on the fringe of this, enjoyed a right there over a period of 90 years of approximately 5 or 5½ acres adjoining his own land.  For practically 75 of the 90 years, it was rent free.  Then the late owner, in order to regularise it, I suppose, charged a rent of £6 a year.  When it passed to the Land Commission, the Land Commission told this tenant verbally that this right of his would not be interfered with.  But, again, when the Forestry Division took it over, they took over this part, too, and proceeded to fence off the land that was held by the family in question for 90 years.  It is on the fringe of this holding.  It is adjoining the road.  It is bounding the dwelling and the property of the tenant in question.  I think the Forestry people could well meet the request of that tenant.</P>
    <P>All the people in the area of Sliabh Coillte are delighted that the development has taken place and the Forestry Division can be assured of help and co-operation in everything they do.  As far as the Land Commission are concerned, I just want to make a few remarks about the acquisition and allocation of land in County Wexford. It has been represented to me that a farmer in my constituency with a holding of 16 acres was recently allocated 28 acres by the Land Commission. That 28 acres would cost him £224 a year.  This man has refused the allotment because not by any stretch of the imagination could a farmer of 44 acres pay an annuity of £224.  It should be possible to devise some means to remedy this situation: I am sure it can be done with the aid of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the structural alteration of land is a cure for our farming ills.  All that the small farmers in County Wexford want is more land <Col N="1406" /> at a price that they can afford, a price that will enable them, when they have got possession of the land, to improve their standard of living and encourage their children to remain on the land.  There is not much land for division in Wexford except in small lots and when it comes on the market, the price is high.  Perhaps living in the east we are not entitled to any concessions but there is no use giving land to a farmer engaged in mixed farming if the annuity is to be over £6 an acre.  Even where it is £6, the acreage of land must be less than he has.  You can give a man 10 acres if he has 30 and charge him £6 an acre for it, but if he has only 10 acres and you give him 30 acres at £6 an acre he cannot make a living from it.  In conclusion, I hope something will be done about the case I have quoted and that the matter will be reconsidered.  Perhaps if a smaller acreage was offered to the man, less than 20 to his 16, he might be encouraged to have a &ldquo;go&rdquo;, but he could not undertake to pay that annuity on 44 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am disappointed with the progress made under the Land Act, 1965.  When it was introduced we were led to believe by the Minister that if it would not solve all the problems of congestion it would solve a great many of them very quickly. As a result, many people in congested areas on small, uneconomic holdings were led to believe that they would be dealt with without delay.  Whether due to insufficient staff or insufficient money or some other cause there does not appear to have been any worthwhile improvement in the provision of land for uneconomic holders since that Act became law.  I want to deal with the Land Act, 1965, as it relates to my constituency. The Minister for Finance, when introducing his Budget, promised a number of worthwhile incentives to small farmers in the 12 western counties.  As far as I can ascertain. Cavan is regarded as one of the 12 western counties because it is in the undeveloped areas.  In the course of his speech the Minister for Finance mentioned that the farmers in these areas <Col N="1407" /> would be helped by the self-migration and other provisions of the 1965 Land Act.</P>
      <P>When the Land Act was going through the Seanad, I tried to get the Minister to include Cavan in the congested areas but the Minister resisted an amendment I put down and the result is that the self-migration provisions of the Act do not apply to Cavan, notwithstanding what the Minister for Finance said.  Accordingly, the farmer in Roscommon who wishes to purchase a farm in Meath or elsewhere can get assistance by way of loan from the Land Commission under the Land Act, 1965, but a Cavan farmer does not qualify for such a loan. That is unfair.  Further, a farmer in Roscommon who gets an allotment of land in Roscommon has only to pay half the annuity, half the rent, while a farmer in Cavan who gets an allotment in Cavan from the Land Commission has to pay the full rent.  For example, a farmer in Roscommon has to pay £50 but the Cavan farmer has to pay £100.  This is not equitable and it is not fair.  Cavan is now regarded as being in the undeveloped areas and is so treated under some schemes and under some of the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the promises contained in the Budget are to be of any value to Cavan, the Minister for Lands should take steps&mdash;I think he can do so by order under the existing Act and without any amending legislation&mdash;to ensure that the Cavan farmers get the same treatment in relation to loans for the purchase of lands and rents as their neighbours in Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon and other counties.  I cannot see why a Roscommon farmer should get more generous treatment under the Land Acts than a Cavan farmer.  There are parts of Cavan, particularly of West Cavan, which are much more congested than parts of Roscommon and parts of other western counties.  I wish to renew the appeal I made in the Seanad when the Land Bill was being discussed, for the same treatment for my constituents as the constituents in Roscommon, South Leitrim <Col N="1408" /> and the people of the so-called congested areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few points of interest which have occurred to me as a public representative and by reason of the representations made to me from time to time.  I want to add my voice to the voices of others who over a long period have been pleading in this House for a better deal for forestry workers.  It is extremely disconcerting that despite the pressure of various trade unions and the very many pertinent questions asked here conditions of employment of forestry workers are still very much below what is normal for those in comparable employment.  This is particularly so in respect of the way in which the hours are worked and the fact that these workers have, as yet, no pension scheme.</P>
      <P>We have continuous complaints from them that they are not being properly provided for in respect of huts against inclement weather, protective clothing and, from time to time, that they are not provided with tools and equipment to carry on the job.  There are instances in which the supply of boots or wellingtons at a given time is such that the men are expected to use boots of fellow workers.  This is not good enough.  I invite the Minister to make a categorical statement on this occasion regarding improvement in the lot of forestry workers particularly in regard to a pension scheme.  Forestry workers realise that so many employees in comparable employment enjoy these fringe benefits, as they are now called, and such benefits are becoming of more and more importance in the minds of union leaders and members. Benefits such as the shorter working week, the provision of sick pay and pension schemes, security in sickness and old age are becoming of primary importance, even more important than wage increases as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate the importance of this matter and I invite him to make a statement indicating once and for all that he will bring in a pension scheme for forestry workers. Employees of local authorities, county council road workers and so on have enjoyed a superannuation scheme for <Col N="1409" /> a considerable time.  They contribute weekly and receive a pension on retirement.  This was a tremendous benefit to them under the Superannuation Acts of 1955 and 1956.  Even at this late stage I invite the Minister to concede to workers under his authority something similar to what workers in comparable employment enjoy.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that there seems to be undue delay in the payment of gratuities or Treasury warrants, as they are called, to forestry workers.  I have been making repeated representations that these gratuities should be paid to retired forestry workers and in many cases the men are of such advanced age and so extremely ill that I fear many of them will have passed to their reward before the Department concede this gratuity based on the length of service they have given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made an excellent point when he said the Department should inform all forestry workers who are about to retire of their rights in this respect.  Unless a retiring forestry worker becomes aware of this concession in some haphazard way, such as being informed by a colleague or by inquiring from a public representative, they are, in the main, largely unaware of this gratuity concession.  It is only fair that the Department should advise their employees of this right, indicating how they may secure it when they reach retiring age.  I hope the Minister will say that will be done.  It is a reasonable request and would help in expediting payment of these gratuities.</P>
    <P>The credit squeeze which we experienced in the past few years affected the Department and afforestation.  This is seen in the delay in the purchase of land, in the redundancy which took place in many forest areas and it was particularly deplorable in respect of the laying off of forestry workers.  I do not have to emphasise the importance of the work of afforestation, the acquisition of these barren tracts of mountain land and their development for seeding in due course and the wealth which accrues to the nation in the long term.  These are aspects which everybody can appreciate.  It is work of a highly productive nature and it is deplorable that the Minister should see fit to cut back on this work in the <Col N="1410" /> interests of alleged economy.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some hope of acceleration in the acquisition of additional land for afforestation and of a very great increase in the numbers employed.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department are fully aware of how important forestry work is to people in rural areas.  Employment on farms is becoming rarer; labour is being displaced by mechanisation and more and more potential agricultural workers are looking to afforestation for employment. I appeal to the Minister to accelerate the excellent work in the nurseries and forestry work generally, with a view to providing more employment for workers in rural areas.  Like most Deputies, I have been obliged to put forward the views of those small farmers of my constituency, the congests in particular, and prevail on the Minister and his Department to do what they can to provide additional land for those farmers who were forced to try to exist on what were clearly known to be uneconomic holdings. My concern is that despite the many representations one makes, it is only in exceptional cases, it would seem, that the applicants concerned are visited by the Land Commission inspectors in the area.</P>
    <P>One expects, when one states the needs of the smallholders, that at least those particular applicants should be properly visited by an officer from the Land Commission.  I cannot conceive how land can be distributed on a fair, just and equitable basis if each applicant is not fully and properly investigated by such an officer.  I submit that it is simply not good enough that a Land Commission officer should accept the views of the man's neighbour or assess the applicant on some secondhand or third-rate information, or that he should even assess the worth of an applicant on the summing up or advice of an agricultural officer or even some public person in the locality.  The applicant is worthy of a visit and a proper assessment of his worth in respect of getting an economic holding.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that every application for additional land is investigated by a personal visit to the applicant in a fair and impartial <Col N="1411" /> manner.  Secondhand information is simply not good enough.  It is no wonder that when estates are divided from time to time we have expressions of anxiety in the area that political influence has been very largely responsible for the success attending certain applicants for land.  I should hope that the Land Commission is a neutral and impartial body, removed from political pressures.  Unfortunately, to us laymen, and as public representatives, there seems to be evidence from time to time which would indicate that the Land Commission, as such, is being subjected to political pressures and that quite a lot depends on what Party one belongs to.</P>
    <P>I remember coming across what purported to be an application for land from the Land Commission.  It was issued by a certain Fianna Fáil cumann.  The applicant had been recommended by the local TD or some such important person in the Party. This application form, which purported to be a legitimate form, was taken as a virtual guarantee that the applicants from this particular political camp would get first preference for any land being divided in the area.  Even in my short term in public life, I have heard allegations made of land being divided on the kitchen or parlour table of certain important personalities in the Government Party.  This caused something like consternation in my area on a number of occasions when it transpired that people were allotted land who did not engage in agricultural pursuits of any kind, who did not own land, who did not come from the land and who were in fact engaged in industrial employment.  Despite this, they could secure reasonable amounts of land, to the detriment of the legitimate smallholders in the area, who were deriving their livelihood from the land.  This is bound, of necessity, to cause anxiety and suspicion in the minds of people that undue political influence from time to time is being brought to bear on the Land Commission in the allotment of land.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Minister about something which happened in relation to the acquisition and division of the larger estates and I have particularly <Col N="1412" /> in mind the Charteris estate in Cahir in my constituency.  When this estate was divided, numbers of smallholders in the area, particularly small farmers, were very pleased, until it became known to them the kind of valuation which had been imposed on them.  The valuation in this instance was of such an excessive nature that many of the farmers concerned told me that unless they could get some relief from this crushing burden of the valuation imposed, they might well be forced to give up the farms again.  I appreciate this may not be within the ambit of the Minister for Lands but I am sure it concerns him to realise what transpires here.  It would seem to me that estates of this kind are exceptionally high-rated.</P>
    <P>When the land was allotted to those small farmers, the county council made a provisional assessment of valuations, merely dividing the total valuation between the number of allottees concerned and apportioning the valuation and the rates equally on them.  This, of course, did not take into account the obvious disparity between lands, good land and bad land, marshy land, rocky land and land fit only for afforestation. I appreciate that this is purely provisional and that the valuation authorities in due course will have regard to the disparity in the valuation of the land allotted to each individual on this particular estate.  In the meantime, great hardship is arising for the small farmers concerned.  They are quite outspoken in saying that apart from the annuities which they are obliged to repay to the Land Commission, those rates are a very crushing burden.  It would be interesting to know what relief of rates will be conceded to such as those in the Budget proposals.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to interest himself in the present method of the county council deciding on the provisional valuation, pending proper investigation by the valuation authorities at a later stage and the hardship that can accrue to a small farmer starting out to equip himself on a new holding of this kind.  My information with regard to the small farmers who were given land on the Charteris estate in Cahir is that the valuation imposed on them is a millstone around their <Col N="1413" /> necks, and I welcome the Minister sending down a valuation officer whose function it would be to apportion the valuation in a more just and equitable fashion.  Perhaps the Minister will advise me as to how I should set about securing relief for such farmers. I hope I am not taxing him with a responsibility outside the control of his Department.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about tracts of land which are disposed of by public auction in which the Land Commission seem to take no interest whatsoever. It is disconcerting for a public representative to be told by a group of congests that a farm of a very sizeable nature has been sold in their area to a man who already had more than a fair share of land, and that it was scandal in the extreme that a rancher should be permitted to purchase a sizeable farm which could, and should, be acquired by the Land Commission to bring about the relief of congestion in a particular area.  I ask the Minister whether the Land Commission take any notice at all of our daily papers in respect of auctions of this kind, and to what extent they interest themselves in the possible purchase of these tracts of land for the relief of congestion and the provision of economic holdings.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that by reason of the shortage of credit in the Minister's Department the Land Commission were shying away altogether from auctions of this kind.  The rumour is abroad that the Land Commission are not prepared to compete on the property market for farms of this kind. If that is so, it will impede all the good work which the Land Commission should be doing.  If the Land Commission are not prepared to compete on the open market at auctions of this kind, it seems to me that there is no hope whatsoever for a better deal for the small farmers.  I would welcome a statement from the Minister in his concluding remarks that this is not so and that the Land Commission interest themselves in auctions of this kind, that they do compete and are prepared to pay a decent price for land.</P>
    <P>Recently my attention was drawn to an estate near my native town which <Col N="1414" /> was purchased by a large farmer. Naturally, there was disappointment and distress among the smallholders in the area that the Land Commission did not interest themselves in this particular estate.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Land Act which we passed here two years ago has had such a desirable effect in preventing the purchase of land by aliens. Mark you, in most of our constituencies, there are still areas with big estates.  I should like the Minister to satisfy himself that the legislation we passed in this House is foolproof and cannot be circumvented in any way.  I should also like him to satisfy himself that Irish land is not being purchased under the guise of a company, or a pseudonym, or through auctioneers or solicitors, or any other device.  If the Minister is able to make a statement that he is satisfied that this is not happening, it will make many of us content. It would seem that a lot of tightening up is necessary before we are completely satisfied that the Land Act which we passed here has had the desired effect and will not be circumvented by various means.</P>
    <P>There is not much more for me to say, Sir, except to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this very laudable scheme so that land which is not being properly worked may be made available to the Land Commission for division among those in need of it.  I refer to the scheme whereby pensions, or a gratuity, may be paid to, perhaps, an aged couple or an aged farmer who is no longer able to work the land, or where a farmer is mentally or physically handicapped and is unable to work the land economically.  I sincerely hope that this very laudable scheme meets with the desired success. It is to be regretted that up to now there has not been the response to this scheme which many anticipated.  Perhaps the Minister can say why there has not been that desired response to what seems to many of us to be a worthwhile proposal, affording a pension and security in the old homestead to those people who are no longer able to work their land.  If the many farms which are lying fallow were made available to the Minister and his <Col N="1415" /> Department much more could be done for the relief of congestion and the provision of economic holdings on which young, enthusiastic and progressive farmers could provide a decent livelihood for their families and contribute much to the economy.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister to have regard to the feasibility of opening up many of our lovely tracts of forest land from the point of view of tourism.  This would be a tremendous attraction to all of us, particularly the tourists.  Before doing so, however, the Minister would have to satisfy himself there was no threat to our forests. I am sure the Minister will be replying to many of these queries later on.  I wish the Minister every success in his endeavours to do the things in his Department which we deem can be done to provide better standards for our farmers, our forestry workers and all those under his control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on these Estimates has ranged very wide which is not unusual, considering their interest for Deputies, particularly Deputies from rural Ireland. Perhaps Deputy Treacy was not here for my opening statement from which he would have gleaned that on the broad front we are providing more money in these Estimates for land, game and forestry than has ever been provided before, together with money to implement the-many new schemes to which I shall refer <i>seriatim</i> later on which we are now introducing for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall endeavour to meet a number of points raised by Deputies.  I want to take some of them in the order in which they were raised.  Let me take the question of the allegation of delays in the disposal of land acquired by the Land Commission, which was made by Deputy Flanagan and others in the course of the debate.  This, of course, is a matter raised from time to time on Estimates in this Department.  Every effort is made to dispose of lands acquired by the Land Commission as readily as possible.  There are standing instructions to the effect that lands should not be in the hands of the Land <Col N="1416" /> Commission longer than two years, unless where the Commissioners specifically direct otherwise.  An exception has to be made where land is destined for migrants because buildings have to be erected, or other improvements carried out, or where the preparation of re-sale proposals has to be deferred in the interests of ensuring that this scheme will be the best possible one. I dealt with this matter fully when replying to the debate on Lands last year.</P>
    <P>On 31st March last the Land Commission had in their possession, apart from substantial areas of turbary and inferior quality land, some 52,000 acres of arable land.  That such an acreage, however, is not unreasonable can be gauged by the fact that the average allotment, between all classes of land, is something like 185,000 acres.  The average annual allotment is something like 35,000 acres.  Getting to the nearest figure possible over the past five years, the total amount of land allotted would be about 185,000 acres.  Therefore, to have 52,000 acres in the machine, in the course of being dealt with&mdash;because this is a continuous process with the Land Commission from year to year&mdash;is not an unreasonable figure.  Of course, Deputies who do not come from the congested areas may not be aware of the fact that in rearrangement schemes, in many cases, lands are left in the hands of the Land Commission because they cannot get agreement with those concerned in the scheme.  In many of those cases, schemes have been held up, to my knowledge, over a number of years. Where you get one recalcitrant farmer in an area who will not surrender one field which is vital to another farmer in the area because of the element of fragmentation, because he holds his great-grandfather put far more manure into it than any other farmer and sits back in that situation, there is nothing the Land Commission can do.  In many cases the Land Commission have land on hands through no fault of their own, but because of the failure to get agreement, as we must get in these cases, before such a scheme can go through.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the meticulous examination which must take <Col N="1417" /> place in the preparation of a scheme of division.  Apropos what Deputy Treacy says, it is not true, to my knowledge, that Land Commission inspectors do not visit everybody within the policy distance.  There is a policy distance on an estate to be divided, of a mile in some cases, it may be a half a mile in others, depending on the amount of land available, and all people within that policy distance are normally visited by an inspector of the Land Commission.  He does not rely on what the neighbour says. Naturally, he hears what the neighbour says because in many cases some of those people for their own purpose are a bit backward in coming forward about vital statistics in relation to their land or the land in another part of the country some of their friends may own and which they will ultimately possess. But, normally, the practice is that people within the policy distance are visited by a Land Commission inspector.</P>
    <P>He reports on each and every one of these and when the scheme is being prepared, the man on the ground, the report of that inspector, is submitted to the inspector in charge of the area. It goes then to the divisional inspector and to the Land Commissioners. Therefore these schemes are scrutinised and settled, not alone by the man in charge of the scheme, in the first instance, but his work is vetted by senior officials up to the Land Commissioners and if they see anything odd with his proposals, on the facts that have been garnered by the inspectors to whom I have referred, then they will change that scheme or question him to justify his proposals. Therefore, this business of the division of land is not done in the haphazard way that seems to be suggested by some Deputies from time to time in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it would be only courteous to inform the applicant who is not being visited, by reason of his being outside the zone, why he is not being visited?  Why ignore some of them altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience, on any complaints I have received on this <Col N="1418" /> score&mdash;and I have very long experience in this field&mdash;I have found that the people were not visited because they were outside the policy distance, or for some very obvious reason as, for instance, a man who had some other outside employment and, considering the amount of land available, obviously his personal circumstances would exclude him.  Where anybody has requested a visit, or complained that he did not get a visit, invariably the Land Commission send an inspector to visit him.  I can only say to the Deputy that in my experience in any complaints I got of this kind, I discovered they were not visited because they were outside the policy distance of the lands being divided.  The Deputy will appreciate that when land is for division, needless to say, people are not slow to to go looking for it and whether they come within a mile, two miles or, sometimes three miles, they will try to get in on it, if they can &mdash;if I may put it that way.  But the officials, naturally, must confine themselves, for the sake of avoiding useless work, to those who must be considered, those within the policy distance to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>There was a practice in the Land Commission, and I have put an end to it, that where they acquired land but had not a sufficient acreage to make a reasonable scheme, they left it there in the hope that the lands of some other people in the area would come into the Land Commission machine in two or three years' time.  They held on to this land in the hope of getting sufficient land to make a proper or a better division scheme at a future time. This gave rise to a number of complaints by Deputies and others, and of course those immediately concerned.  A direction was issued by me through the Chief Inspector of the Land Commission on 18th January, 1965, in connection with the disposal of lands.  It read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To each inspector,</P>
      <P>The following policy directions should be noted and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All lands on the hands of the Land Commission should be schemed and allotted to the approved allottees as quickly as practicable.  In future, <Col N="1419" /> lands should not be retained on hands longer than two years save where the Commissioners specifically direct otherwise.</P>
    <P>The practice of holding land on hands pending the acquisition of other land in the neighbourhood, with a view to the formulation of a composite scheme, should be discontinued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a standing instruction to the officials of the Land Commission throughout the country.  It is an official policy instruction issued by me.  Therefore, on this question of delay in the allotment of acquired land, it is only in the type of case to which I have referred that this can take place now unless the Commissioners specifically direct.</P>
    <P>We have of course invariably allegations of political discrimination in the determination of lands to be acquired and the selection of allottees for these acquired lands.  Such allegations are made here from time to time but they are not confirmed by facts or investigations. I should like again to make the position clear.  As far back as 1933, the Government enshrined in the Land Act of that year a section which reserved to the Land Commissioners the final decision in certain clearly specified fields of Land Commission activity.  The Act provided: &ldquo;In the exercise of any of these reserved functions the decision rests with the Land Commissioners who are in a similar position to judges.&rdquo; I am satisfied that the Commissioners can be relied on to act fairly in the matter of acquiring land and the selection of allottees and in all other matters under their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The choice of allottees is, of course, a difficult business.  It is impossible to satisfy every applicant.  The great difficulty is, of course, that every disappointed applicant will make all kinds of allegations about his neighbour who has been successful.  There is not enough land to go around.  This is the position in 99 per cent of cases of the division of land and I suppose that is possibly at the root of some of those wild allegations always unsubstantiated, which we hear in this <Col N="1420" /> field from time to time.  In many cases with the limited amount and the layout of land, the Land Commission cannot make a perfect scheme.  This is regretted.  Some applicants have to be unavoidably disappointed but in most cases there is the possibility of reconsideration for those when further land comes to be divided or comes into the Land Commission machine. If it is felt that a scheme requires investigation, this of course can always be done.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate on the Estimate a year ago, I said that I deplored the practice of Deputies of making allegations about Land Commission inspectors unless there was some reason or unless some notice of the matter was given.  It is unfair to attack people who cannot defend themselves here.  In any event, I am confident that most of these attacks on individual inspectors are ill-founded, or certainly exaggerated.  What I want to emphasise is that from the ground floor up in connection with land acquisition and division, it is not alone the junior inspector who goes out to take the necessary particulars who is involved.  His work is checked by a senior inspector in charge in that area.  It is passed to the divisional inspector and ultimately must go to the Commissioners themselves.  This is the way the job is done; this is the way the law provides that the job be done.</P>
    <P>In this connection, for instance, there was an allegation made in this debate by a Deputy regarding a man named McCormack from the west of Ireland who was supposed to be allowed to sell land or purchase land because he came evidently from my county. On investigation, I find that this man came up on a major exchange of lands over 30 years ago to that particular county.  On further inquiry&mdash;although I do not know the man personally, nor did I receive any representations one way or the other about that particular case&mdash;I find that he is not of my faith either religious or political and was in fact a very definite opponent of my Party many years ago.  These wild and irresponsible allegations of political discrimination cause an awful lot of suspicion and an awful lot of <Col N="1421" /> harm to the ordinary people concerned in this field because when it is said, as is being alleged, that there is some form of political influence being used at some stage or other in the proceedings with the Land Commission officials, a number of innocent country people are bound to believe it.</P>
    <P>Let me say this: any politician, no matter which side of this House he is on, who tries to sell the idea that he is responsible for giving people additions of land is a common idiot, in my view.  If he has anything upstairs at all, he should keep well away from any question of the division of land because for every single case&mdash;and I come from the heart of the most congested area in this country&mdash;or for the two or three people who will succeed, there will be 40 unsuccessful applicants in that immediate area.  If I may, with my grey hairs of experience in this House, give any advice to any young Deputies, may I suggest that they try to get the Land Commission to take over lands that should be suitable for the relief of congestion but once that is done, if they want to survive politically, let them keep well away from the suggestion that they have anything to do with the allocation of that land, once it comes into the hands of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to deal with, and there is some substance in this on one side, is the allegation by Deputy O.J. Flanagan and others about delays in paying for acquired land.  Let me make it quite clear that there are no delays in the lands that are being purchased in a straightforward way by cash at the moment.  There have been delays, and still are delays, in connection with the compulsory acquisition of lands where the land is being paid for in land bonds.  I gave figures to the House some time ago regarding the delay in this latter type of case.  I am certainly not happy with it myself, I candidly admit.  It used to be 27 months before the final proceedings were completed in these compulsory acquisition cases.  It is down to something like an average of nine months.  I am just saying that this is an improvement but I am not happy with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> All the delay in this matter cannot in any way be attributed to the Examiner's Office of the Land Commission. A big percentage of the delay in many cases is due to the legal gentlemen handling it for the owners.  That happens from time to time.  I certainly get many letters from people complaining about not having received their land bonds or purchase money and, on investigation, I find that the Examiner's Office are waiting on some legal formalities of title to be completed by the solicitors having the carriage of sale.  At the same time, I want to say that I have done an amount of work in simplifying and streamlining the procedure so that now in the ordinary straightforward case of a voluntary purchase between the Land Commission and a vendor down the country, a sale can be and is closed in the course of a month like any ordinary sale, unless there is some unusual difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the other cases there are certainly legal reasons why the Examiner's Office have to be so meticulous.  I am endeavouring to find a way to further shorten this delay period in so far as it is created by the Examiner's Office. I am not saying, however, or accepting that all this delay is on one side only. There may be cases, and there are, in which it is not the solicitors' fault.  For example, in some cases questions about death duties arise and a certificate of discharge from death duties has to be got.  Also there can be long delay in dealing with the Estate Duty Office. I do not know whether we will be able to achieve any streamlining procedure. We can only try.  In the majority of cases, and even in the compulsory cases in which there are delays, I am satisfied that much of the delay is due to the legal people concerned taking things easy and not getting on with their work as quickly as they should.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to landless men being excluded from the categories of persons to whom land may be allotted.  Where the disposal of lands which are not required for the structural reform of uneconomic holdings or other priority commitments is concerned, the claims of such applicants in any locality are always carefully <Col N="1423" /> considered by the Land Commission. Preference is then given to those who have experience of the working of land and who have sufficient capital or stock to enable them to work any land that might be allotted to them.</P>
    <P>In practice, however, the needs of the structural reform programme are such that the landless man must of necessity take a very low place in the allotment queue, and with a very serious land settlement problem still confronting us, it would be unrealistic to hold out much hope that the landless man can be moved up along the queue.  Having regard to the extent of genuine congestion still awaiting solution&mdash;that is, amongst the people exclusively or mainly dependent on agriculture for a livelihood&mdash;the main emphasis on land policy must be directed towards uneconomic holders and migrants from congested areas.</P>
    <P>I am being requested here, as I was during the debate on the Land Act, 1965, to declare additional congested areas.  I have already pointed out on a number of occasions in reply to questions, and in the course of the debate on the Land Act, 1965, that I consider priority should be afforded to the traditional congested areas where congestion has for so long been so pronounced that it would, as yet, be premature to declare additional areas under section 4 of the Land Act, 1965. I need scarcely point out that for historical reasons the scheduled congested areas constitute the main area in which agrarian structure requires radical reform.  That is why the various Land Acts and land settlement policy were and still are directed mainly towards ameliorating the lot of the smallholders in these regions.  It is here that there is the greatest need for rationalisation of farm structure, and consequently the powers provided by the Land Act, 1965, particularly the new life annuities and self-migration loans schemes, will have to be concentrated on these regions so that as much land as possible can be made available to assist materially in the implementation of the structural reform programme.</P>
    <P>I readily concede that there are other <Col N="1424" /> parts of the country which, by modern standards, must also be regarded as substantially congested.  Pockets of congestion will be found in other places in the country, but it is utterly unrealistic for Deputy Fitzpatrick and others to come crying to me about discrimination, and about all the people not being equal under the Land Act, 1965.  The people outside the congested areas had better land, better availability of markets and higher valuations on average from time immemorial than the people in the congested areas. Literally there is no comparison whatever between the land slum problem in the congested areas and the rest of the country.  It is utter nonsense to talk about alleged discrimination because special measures are being taken to deal with the land slum problem which was left to us as a result of our history.</P>
    <P>Until I became Minister for Lands, there were two different standards by which people could get land.  West of the Shannon once you had a valuation of £10, you were written off by the Land Commission and not entitled to any additional land.  There were holdings vested down there with valuations of £3 10s, £4, and £4 10s still leaving a bad land slum problem, whereas if you lived east of the Shannon if you had not more than 33 acres of good land, which could run to a valuation of £35, you were entitled to be considered by the Land Commission. So, down through the years, and through all the Land Acts, there was discrimination in one direction only, and that was discrimination against the unfortunates in the most congested land slums in the whole country.</P>
    <P>If in this day and age a special effort is being made to consider those people now, I do not see what people in the rest of the country have to complain about.  They had a better opportunity and better land, and they had it for a longer time.  They should not now start crying because their poorer neighbour west of the Shannon is getting some preferential treatment.  As far as Cavan is concerned, there is a pilot area in the country and Deputy Fitzpatrick has, no doubt, read the budgetary provisions for the pilot areas and the scheme for intensification of <Col N="1425" /> the land structural reform areas.  This will apply to all the pilot areas.</P>
    <P>Very few Deputies devote much time&mdash;it does not suit their programme to do so&mdash;to discussing the fact that for the first time £200,000 is being made available to do a complete clean-up job of structural reform in these pilot areas, which are now being extended.  This is the beginning of an all-out attack on the land slum problem in a way in which it will be seen to be done.  The Land Commission will henceforth be able to finish an area for all time and say: &ldquo;These people are on viable holdings with modern buildings.  If they do not succeed, it is not the fault of the State or of the Land Commission, but of the land owners, because for the first time they are being provided with the where-withal, by way of acres, to provide themselves and their families with a good living&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the first time that there has been a real attempt to attack the land slum problem.  Dr. Scully, in his report on the pilot areas, found that it was impossible for the Land Commission to achieve the results they intended to achieve under the pilot areas scheme unless major surgery was carried out.  In five of his points, he referred to deficiencies because of lack of Land Commission work in the areas. Now, even as I speak, Land Commission inspectors are going through these pilot areas, doing a comb-cut, getting details of circumstances, noting the people who might be likely to accept a pension scheme, who might be suitable for self-migration, so that they can say within six weeks: &ldquo;In this area the situation is that we are making an overall plan for it in conjunction with the pilot areas committee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the first time this has been attempted.  It is a logical way to do the job, replacing some of the haphazard work done by the Land Commission&mdash;dealing with one small farm here with not enough land to go round; dealing with another small farm there with not enough land to go round; still having to come back to that area, not having finished the job.  In this intensive job now being done in these <Col N="1426" /> areas, we shall be settling people on viable holdings and unless it is their own fault, there is no reason why the landowners should not survive on the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The pattern in our country will go that way and while the pilot areas are being extended, as has been announced, I do not conceive this as merely drawing a line on a map.  In a congested area where the Land Commission have done a good structural reform job and have the new houses ready, the new stables ready and the drainage and fences done, they can say to the pilot areas committee: &ldquo;Here is the Land Commission's structural reform job.  We are ready for you to go in, horse, foot and artillery, with all the inducements for the people concerned to get the very best in productivity from that land.&rdquo; I do not see why, when we get the statistics in this comb-out, we cannot work the pilot areas scheme by extending it in conjunction with the increased Land Commission activity to any particular area.</P>
    <P>We have had complaints about higher annuities.  Higher annuities are inevitable at the moment in the non-congested areas.  What Deputies seem to forget is that in paying these higher annuities, people are not in the position of having to pay rent for land.  It is a matter of the tenant being enabled by the Land Commission, under a hire purchase agreement, to purchase the land.  That is what Deputies keep away from.  I have had deputations not alone from the West but indeed from the middle of Carlow, who told me they were paying £25 and up to £35 an acre for conacre.  I had a question three weeks ago about a man who did not get land.  I discovered that though he did not have land, he had a tractor, about 25 milch cows, about 14 dry cattle.  He is a man without land.  I gathered, if my memory serves me right, that this individual was paying out £1,100 a year for land and that he had more stock and equipment than the majority of the small farmers in the part of the country from which I come.</P>
    <P>I should like those people crying out about high annuities to explain <Col N="1427" /> how men without any land can live and build houses and rear families and pay from £15 to £25 an acre for conacre, which they are taking every day in the week from auctioneers throughout the country.  There is something queer about the starving gentleman who cannot survive on 300 acres in the midlands when we have these people going about.</P>
    <P>The position is that it has been provided by law that where land is bought and being divided in non-congested areas, the full purchase price must be paid.  There may be the odd case where some farmers have refused allotments. Deputy Kennedy mentioned one here today.  Of course there are farmers and farmers.  There are some farmers who would be better off following some other occupation.  There are some alleged farmers who will not take additions of land because it might interfere with the dole.  I do not regard these as people who should be running the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission, as bankers, enable these people to buy out their land during a long number of years. These people are getting the land from the Land Commission; they do not have to pay out money in perpetuity for conacre but acquire additions to their farms, and I think the progressive man in any community will be very glad to get that addition from the Land Commission and to pay the purchase price spread over a long period of years in the way to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy also raised the point about Sliabh Coillte which I shall refer to more appropriately when I come to deal with forestry. Deputy Treacy had something to say about the Charteris estate and about the valuation of the lands divided on that estate.  The question of the valuation of land is one for the Valuation Office, the Land Commission supplying them with particulars after a scheme has been operated.  Some anomalies may arise in sorting out these people's valuations <i>vis-á-vis</i> adjacent holdings: there may <Col N="1428" /> be unfavourable valuation comparisons.</P>
    <P>I wish to put it on record, however, for Deputy Treacy's benefit that we have nothing to do with that operation: it is a question for the Valuation Office in consultation with the county council.  As the Deputy is aware, there is an appeal, if they are not satisfied with their valuation.  The only advice I can give him&mdash;I do not know how it operates with the county councils as far as housing is concerned&mdash;is that if there are anomalies, the place to straighten it out is the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>The size of units in the intake of land going into the Land Commission machine is going down substantially from year to year.  The average size of holding coming in five years ago was 126 acres.  That is down for the last year to an average of 60 acres.  The reason is that in many cases the old, big estates have already been acquired and the type of land coming in to us now is in smaller units.  The same appears to be true in regard to forestry offers.  Since the units are smaller, more work is involved, more inspections, more valuations and more time taken up with the investigation of the acquisition and allotments.  I assume this figure will come down as time goes on. From my own recollection, there are very few large estates west of the Shannon that have not been acquired and divided compared with 15 or 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies&mdash;with the exception of Deputy M.P. Murphy, who seems to have a peculiar view of his own about the Land Commission&mdash;are complaining that there is not sufficient staff in the different areas to carry out the Land Commission work.  I candidly admit that.  We are looking for more staff.  With the increase in Land Commission activity, particularly that engendered by the Land Act, 1965, we will have to get more staff if we are to do the job the country expects us to do.  Again, with the new activity in the pilot areas, we need more staff.  As far as I am able to achieve it, the level of Land Commission activity in the pilot areas and the congested areas generally will continue to increase in relation to <Col N="1429" /> the amount of national resources that may be there to promote it.  It is very high on the priority list of the Government as is evidenced by the increased provision made this year for this work. It is not the kind of work that can start and stop.  It must be a continuous effort.  The machine must be geared to it by having adequate staff.  We are endeavouring to get the necessary staff as quickly as possible.  However, the latest information I have shows that our efforts are not meeting with great success.  While we have got a number, we have not got nearly as many as we require.  However, we will be making further efforts shortly to make up the deficiency.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed their interest in and concern for the game resources of our country.  I am entirely with them in that and can assure them I am sparing no pains to ensure the success of our game development movement and the preservation and conservation of our wild life.  This is something new in my Department and we have had to build up some expertise in this field.  I am glad to say we have now some experts trained.  We have a scientific officer, Dr. Fergus O'Gorman, helping us, and this help and technical knowledge will be available to the regional game councils throughout the country.  I hope we are getting on to a new start on this work.</P>
    <P>Last week we had in Dublin the annual general assembly of the International Game Council, a body of world standing in the game, hunting and conservation fields.  I had the privilege of being host to this organisation of sportsmen and scientists.  It was a most valuable experience to meet these people and have the benefit of their readily-given views and suggestions on game and wild life conservation matters.  It was manifest that these people, with the wealth of experience at their disposal, appreciated the possibilities of game and wild life development here in Ireland and that they were willing and anxious to help in every possible way.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I am considering many proposals and suggestions which have been made by our game councils, and game and wild life <Col N="1430" /> associations throughout the country for new legislation on game and wild life protection.  I have been thinking on the lines of one comprehensive measure in which game would be dealt with, not as an isolated entity, but in its natural context of the living, natural environment of land and water in which predators and potential prey be managed and controlled in the interest of the wise stewardship of our natural resources.  I am happy that the International Council, in particular the legal committee, has fully endorsed these lines of thought and I look forward to the day in the very near future when I will be introducing legislation to this House on these lines.  We need comprehensive law in this field.  I am anxious, and I am sure the House would be, that we would learn from the mistakes made elsewhere in this field.  Therefore, it was very interesting for us to have the legal committee of the Conseil Internationale de la Chasse prepared to give us every help from the wealth of experience they have throughout Europe and indeed the United States.  They are giving their attention to the legislation we are drafting.  I am glad to say that a lot of it has already been prepared, suitable, I hope, to our conditions here. I am satisfied there is a great national potential for development here.  I know we have built up, for the first time, through the regional game councils and others, a great fund of goodwill in this field.  I hope much further progress will be made during the coming year.</P>
    <P>As far as the Forestry Estimate is concerned, we have the general run of complaints about the lay-off in employment last year.  I told the House, when introducing the Estimate last year, what we expected the position to be.  Let me assure Deputy Esmonde that there was no particular discrimination in the loss of forestry employment in Wexford, in the south, in the east or in any particular place.  The overall loss of employment, due to the reduction of the Estimate, has been calculated by my advisers at 2½ per cent, and that was spread all over the country.  I can remember a forest in my own county, in Foxford, in which there was a very substantial lay-off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> Forestry employment, as Deputies know, largely depends on conditions at the local forests, the stage of development, the land available for planting, and so on.  There is no rule of thumb whereby ten go out of this forest or five out of that.  It depends upon the work programme that there is, the work that is available there and employment in some cases suffers in certain forests much more than in others.  The Forestry Division regret very much having to leave off workers but there is no alternative in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, however, the target this year is again 25,000 acres. We do not know whether it can be reached but that is the target and that is the amount that is budgeted for.  If we are able to get the necessary land, if we are able to implement our programme, we expect that we will reach the target figure.  I am sure that as far as Deputies are concerned the main thing is the fact that the money is there provided for the job, if we are able to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the question of marketing of forestry produce and industrial development based on that. It is generally agreed that the existing capacity of the sawmilling industry is sufficient to cope with all our output of saw-log material and there will be no significant increase in the availability of such material over the next few years.  In regard to the smaller dimension material, which arises mainly from thinnings, the four existing processing factories are taking almost all our output and plans for the expansion of the industry's capacity are in hand. Minor difficulty can always arise in getting a market for produce in an area remote from any of the processing factories but, overall, it should be possible to get the supply and demand for forest produce into reasonable equilibrium over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I know that there was some public misunderstanding about this matter and allegations have been made by new people who wanted to come into this business that there was more material available.  People are inclined to forget that those in the business and the existing <Col N="1432" /> industry have expanded their capacity very substantially since they originally started and that they have been continuously demanding more material and, so far as we can see, for the immediate future at any rate, the existing industry is in a position to absorb what the Forestry Division can give them, whatever may come from private forestry.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Tully who raised the point that forestry workers who break their service by a continuing absence of over 30 days may lose their holidays for the year in which the break occurs.  That is not, in fact, correct because under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, forestry workers who complete the necessary 1,600 hours and do not break their service are entitled to 14 consecutive days holidays and a man who, because he breaks his service by an absence of over 30 days fails to qualify for annual leave, is, nevertheless, allowed one-sixth of a day's pay in respect of each month in which he has worked the necessary 135 hours.  There is no question of a man who is otherwise qualified being deprived of leave because of a break in service.  If he does not get his annual leave, he will qualify for this payment in lieu of his annual leave.  The Deputy's reference to loss of leave might perhaps, arise from some misunderstanding but this is the position as I and my Department understand it.</P>
    <P>The question of sick pay for forestry workers was raised.  An outline of a proposed new scheme has been issued by my Department to all the trade unions concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of income tax deductions was raised and it was stated that hardship was being incurred by forestry workers suffering from heavy deductions in the weeks preceding Christmas. A scale of income tax deductions is, in fact, in operation in the Forestry Division whereby workmen can have a certain amount deducted from their incomes each week, starting at the beginning of the financial year, towards payment of their income tax assessment. This scheme is not obligatory and workmen who do not wish to have <Col N="1433" /> regular deductions made from the beginning of the financial year can opt out of the scheme and await the arrival of their assessments in the normal course.  I understand that income tax assessments in respect of forestry workers were out by the end of July last year so that even in the case of those who opted out of the earlier deduction, a fairly substantial part of the year remained over which to spread the payment.</P>
    <P>There is always, of course, the possibility of an exceptional case.  A man who has opted out of the scheme or who has come to our employment late in the year and had earnings elsewhere could be the subject of a late assessment. I believe, however, that such cases are rare and would be unusual under the present arrangement and, from the point of view of staggering income tax payments, I think that the scheme that exists is adequate.  Of course, I suppose the fact is that many workers, like many of us, do not want to pay too early or do not want to start paying income tax until they have to pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> Many Deputies made reference to the position as regards employment in forestry and expressed disappointment that staffs had been reduced in the forests.  I think I had better say that in this connection&mdash;this is generally speaking, outside the position last year which I have dealt with&mdash;that the fact must be faced squarely.  The prime fact is that costs in forestry have risen very sharply in the past ten years.  The cost of labour alone, for instance, has doubled since 1957 and there has not been a comparable increase in the price of forest products.  This makes it essential that all costs be carefully scrutinised and that measures be taken by way of the rational use of labour, methods study, mechanisation and the elimination of less essential operations, to reduce costs to the lowest possible level.  These objectives are being actively pursued in the Department and it is an indication of the success with which their efforts have been met that many of our forests have been able to absorb an increased workload of management and maintenance operations without any appreciable increase of staff.</P>
    <P>There are other forests where, through completion of road programmes, lack of plantable reserve or similar cause, the programme of work was insufficient to absorb the existing labour strength.  Here there was no alternative but to lay men off, some of them, unfortunately, with long service. This is not a new feature in proper forestry employment.  We always have had this situation at forests and that will continue until forests develop to the stage when there is regular rhythm of operations from planting to felling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can read what I said in the debate.  The problem of rising labour costs not matched by short-term improvement in timber prices is not a phenomenon peculiar to Ireland.  Virtually every country in Europe has been facing this situation over the past few years, and forestry authorities from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean are engaged in multiple lines of action to offset increased labour costs by higher productivity and a more thrifty use of resources.  Methods of reducing cost, in order to keep Europe's forestry on a competitive basis, was indeed one of the main matters under discussion as recently as last week at a session of the FAO European Forestry Commission.  We in Ireland have the advantage that our relatively heavy forestry investment programme spurred us to early action towards increasing productivity, and we can indeed claim to have set a headline in at least some respects.</P>
      <P>We cannot, however, afford to relax our efforts.  The competition from Europe, and particularly Canada and which is now emerging from the South American countries, is becoming very intense, and production costs must be watched at all times.  There are some factors like outside mechanisation, factors like keeping down competing vegetation that is now being largely done by herbicide, which formerly gave employment by way of hand labour, and which is being replaced by these new methods.  However, the overall picture is that forestry costs are being watched in so far as it is possible for the Department to watch them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins made <Col N="1437" /> a plea for the introduction of more hardwoods into our planting as a means of improving visual amenity.  We do endeavour to plant hardwoods where the ground is suitable, but it should be remembered that hardwoods demand high quality ground and shelter and the areas which she mentioned around Loughrea would be quite unsuitable.  We get letters on this subject from many people throughout the country.  As I say, I am very anxious to plant more hardwoods, but it must be appreciated by all these organisations such as &ldquo;Trees for Ireland&rdquo; and other tree-lovers that hardwoods can only be planted in fairly good ground and that it is only when we take over old woodlands, or perhaps a very small bit of land other than what we get for usual forestry purposes, that we can produce hardwoods. However, we do plant as many hardwoods as the type of land we have allows us to plant.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there are any other matters of main interest to the House that have been raised in connection with the Forestry Estimate.  I want to emphasise, just as I did in dealing with the Lands Estimate, that the unit intake for the machine of forestry is coming down each year.  The number of transactions are accordingly going up and this is a process that will continue.  I should perhaps mention one new development in connection with both Forestry and the Land Commission, that in the pilot areas, the Land Commission inspectors will find out whether there is any potential forestry land in the area with which they are dealing, and I am assigning a special inspector from the Forestry Division to deal with and to correlate this work. Therefore with this new combing-out that is being carried on in the pilot areas, if there is any potential for forestry, if there is a commonage, if the man on the spot finds out there is a possibility of getting suitable forestry land, there is a man from the Forestry Division waiting specifically to call urgent attention to the acquisition of that land.</P>
    <P>In this way we shall, as it were, be going out in the field much more after <Col N="1438" /> potential forestry land than in the past.  The Land Commission officials also in scheming mountain areas are now requested to furnish to the Forestry Division, as they are working on this land, information as to whether there is potential forestry land there for a forestry build-up.  We must do this in order to try to keep up the intake into the forestry machine.  It is getting more and more difficult to maintain the necessary plantable reserve and, of course, the bigger the plantable reserve, the less undulations there will be in the employment figures for forestry workers.  I am hopeful that with the increased provision made this year and the new avenues of approach towards the acquisition of more forestry land, we shall be able to report an improvement in the position when I come to the House next year. I do not think there is any other point that I have not dealt with adequately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister has dealt with it to some extent but is it not discouraging that forestry, one of the major means for employment in the rural areas, should be decreasing rather than increasing?  The Minister is well aware that those who are now laid off from forestry employment may not be there, and certainly will not be in the rural areas, if there is an expansion in the forestry industry.
