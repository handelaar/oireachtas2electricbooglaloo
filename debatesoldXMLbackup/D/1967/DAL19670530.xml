      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the increasing gravity of the NFA dispute and the urgent necessity of an early settlement, he will take the initiative to arrange an early meeting between the NFA and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the public statement I made on 9th March last when I told the leaders of the National Farmers Association that the solution to the problem of the Association's relationship with the Government was solely in the hands of the NFA itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meeting between any agricultural organisation and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries are, of course, a matter for the Minister but, until the NFA accept the basic fact that the law <Col N="1574" /> of the land and the orders of the Courts must be complied with by the Association and its members, just as by every other organisation and individual in the State, I do not see that any useful purpose would be served by yet another meeting between the Association and the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the number of visitors who entered the country in the month of April, 1966 and in the same month in 1967; if he is aware that so far this year there has been a great decline in the tourist industry in the west of Ireland generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that the provisional returns for April of the total number of passengers who arrived in this country by sea and air in that month show that the number of arrivals was lower than in April, 1966, but the decrease is offset by increased arrivals in March.  This was no doubt caused by the fact that the Easter holiday fell in April last year and in March this year.  Overall, there was an increase of about 5,000 in the number of passengers arriving by sea and air in the first four months of the year.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any decline in tourist traffic in the west of Ireland. It is much too early to make any firm forecast about the 1967 tourist season but the general indications are that tourist traffic will show an increase over 1966.  Advance bookings on the cross-Channel car ferry services at a recent date were 20 per cent higher than at the corresponding date last year.  The west of Ireland attracts a high proportion of motoring visitors and the West should, therefore, benefit from the increased traffic which is expected this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of boats that used the Grand Canal in the years ended 31st March, 1966, and 31st March, 1967, was 213 and 141, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to 1965 and 1966.  The Minister appeared to speak of 1967.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the financial years ending 31st March, 1966, and 31st March, 1967, each of which would include a large part of 1965 and 1966, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, has the Minister given any consideration to the question of keeping this canal and the Royal Canal clean?  It appears to me that, owing to the decline in traffic upon them, it is now becoming nobody's business to keep them in any state of reasonable repair.  They have a very valuable amenity value over and above their transport value.  Has the Minister considered this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I get representations from the associations interested in the maintenance of the canal for navigation purposes.  I have not had any complaints. CIE regularly maintain the Grand Canal and make use of machines for that purpose.  I think the decline in the number of people using it is due to the fact that the Ringsend Docks were out of action from May to July, 1966, following damage to the lock gates by a ship.  That would probably account for some, if not all, of the decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Any decline in traffic would not justify the virtual abandonment of the canals.  It is very necessary, from an amenity point of view, that they be maintained in reasonable and clean condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the location of the motel is in an isolated pocket within the Board's Castletown-bere rural area some three miles from the nearest point of supply.  This locality was not due to be re-canvassed under the post-development scheme until about 18 months from now but because of its tourist interest it was brought forward.  The locality has recently been re-canvassed and the results are at present being evaluated by the Board.  Supply will be extended about October next to all unconnected householders who accept the terms offered and have their premises wired. I am having inquiries made of the Board to see whether anything can be done to expedite connection in the cases to which he refers and I will communicate with him when the results come to hand.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that 26 men were laid off in this factory last week, due to the scarcity of pigs and the export of bacon?  This will mean a loss of about £300 a week to the town, in addition to the pay packets of the 26 men.  As we do not want to see this factory closing down in Tralee, can the Government do something to increase the supply of pigs because this position has been going on for too long now?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the number of cattle likely to come forward for export either in the form of cattle or beef during the whole of the calendar year of 1967, based on the experience of cattle population and exports in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the number of cattle likely to be available for export in all forms in 1967, should be about 1.1 million to 1.2 million head.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for the forecast is the increased number of cattle in January of this year.  The total number of cattle was 5,149,000 as against 4,945,000 in January 1966.  As regards the Deputy's question about prices, I would not be able, and I do not think anybody else would be either, to say what they would be, but we would presume that the price would be at least as good as last year, if not better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Good&rdquo; is scarcely the adjective to use; &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; would be more becoming.  In view of the fact that the increased number of cattle is largely due to Deputy Smith's calved heifer scheme which provided for increased numbers of cattle without making appropriate provision for increased markets in which to sell them, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate whether the producers who suffered a catastrophe last year are to suffer another catastrophe this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the case I referred the Minister to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in that case the applicant, who would be entitled to, I think, £1,500, has since died in the county home in very hard circumstances simply because of the failure of the Minister to permit this application at the proper time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  The Deputy is as well aware as I am that control of this fund is with the High Court and not with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister brought in the legislation.  The judge has ruled that under that Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the judge has not ruled as yet.  This is why the application has been brought.  As I pointed out to the Deputy on a previous occasion the liquidator acted on legal advice.  There has not been a court ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why he said on the previous occasion that the matter was being <Col N="1598" /> dealt with in the ordinary form of liquidation proceedings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that under ordinary liquidation proceedings the liquidator acts on the legal advice he receives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that a bad mistake was made in this case.  I am glad to hear, at least for the sake of other people, that steps are now being taken to correct it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce how many motor, lorry and tractor tyres of all sizes were imported during each month from 1st April, 1966 to 1st April, 1967; in how many cases the foreign manufacturer or foreign factor absorbed the 45 per cent import duty payable; and if he will state from what countries those tyres were imported.</P>

      <P>As the reply regarding the imports of tyres and the countries of origin is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate this statement with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I have no information as to whether the exporter absorbed all or any part of the import duty.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

    <Title>Redundancy Payments Bill, 1967: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide financial help to workers who lose their jobs on account of redundancy and financial help to unemployed workers who have to move from their home areas to secure employment.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to stress is that I have not prepared this Bill because of fear that the future holds the prospect of large-scale redundancies. A basic fact of economic life which we must accept is that a certain degree of redundancy is an inescapable feature of a dynamic economy.  But although only a small proportion of workers may be affected by redundancy, it is cold comfort for those who are affected to know that.</P>
      <P>Redundancy has serious and distressing implications for the workers involved.  It can have a shattering effect on a man with family responsibilities who thought his job was secure.  It is understandable, therefore, that many workers are suspicious of economic or technological changes which threaten their sense of security. Yet change is the lifeblood of progress and fear of change and resistance to it can be a formidable obstacle to economic and social advancement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem posed by this situation requires to be solved if our hopes and aspirations for the future of our country are to be realised.  A more realistic approach than an indiscriminate resistance to redundancy is required.  A policy of job maintenance at all costs will not do.  This would be tantamount to a policy of economic stagnation.  In the long term&mdash;and not very long term at that&mdash;such a policy would have disastrous results for workers and for the community as a whole.  The Government's policy is to promote economic expansion.  It is policy for the welfare of the nation and <Col N="1603" /> the nation is largely composed of workers and their families.  It is essentially a policy which accepts the need for change involving some redundancies and displacements.  The dictates of social justice demand that, in implementing that policy, we should strive as best we can to protect the interests of individual workers and their dependants.</P>
    <P>While the primary purpose of this Bill is to provide a solution for the human problems associated with redundancy, there is a second aim which is also of major importance.  This aim concerns the relationship between redundancy and economic progress.  We are all anxious for the welfare of our economy; for more and better jobs and for higher living standards.  The necessary economic growth which will provide these improvements is being fostered by the Government through a variety of measures.  The ultimate success of the Government's measures will depend to a large extent on the capacity and the willingness of individual businesses to adapt themselves to new and changing demands; to avail themselves of the most modern techniques for improving their efficiency; and to accept change as a prerequisite for increased productivity.</P>
    <P>Because of past experience change has, in the minds of many, carried with it the threat of the loss of job; the threat of long-term unemployment.  A built-in resistance to change has thus been created.  Apprehension on the part of workers is understandable.  It cannot be dispelled merely by holding out a prospect of a better job at some undetermined date in the future. Something more is needed.  The worker feels entitled to some compensation for the loss of his job and he needs protection for himself and his family in the interval that may occur before he finds other employment.  The Bill is intended to meet this situation and so give the worker a sense of security, even when confronted with a threat of redundancy.  The weekly payments for which the Bill provides are very important in this context.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not <Col N="1604" /> regard this Bill as providing the answers to all the problems associated with redundancy.  It is an essential part of our manpower policy, but it is only a part and it should be clearly seen as such.  The main purpose of the Bill is to provide financial help for redundant workers in the difficult period between the loss of one job and the securing of another.  It is not enough to compensate a worker for the loss of his job.  Positive steps must be taken to secure suitable alternative employment for him.  That is why the placement and guidance functions of the Employment Service are being strengthened. That is why proposals for the training and retraining of redundant workers are now being considered by An Chomhairle Oiliúna under the Industrial Training Act, 1967.  That is why this Bill contains provision for a scheme of resettlement allowances to enable redundant workers to move to new areas to secure employment.</P>
    <P>Employers should not feel that, by meeting their obligations under this Bill, they are absolved from all responsibilities in regard to redundancies. They should plan their manpower requirements as far ahead as possible, and they should introduce schemes of early retirement, of transfers and of retraining to keep the number of redundancies to the minimum.  There is little prospect, however, of employers being able to do this unless they appoint personnel managers, whose training and experience fit them for these specialised tasks.  I should therefore like to take this opportunity to again ask employers in their own interests to consider appointing personnel officers.  Where some redundancy is unavoidable, employers have a responsibility to co-operate fully with the Employment Service in an effort to secure suitable alternative jobs for the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>Before coming to deal with the important sections of the Bill, I should like to refer briefly to another aspect of what I might term its secondary aim.  With the coming of free trade and an intensification of competition, the outlook will be bleak for any industry or business that does not strive for maximum efficiency.  Two practices <Col N="1605" /> which greatly militate against the achievement of maximum efficiency are underemployment, that is, overstaffing or under-utilisation of skills&mdash;and a reluctance to keep pace with modern methods and techniques.  The preservation of jobs is frequently advanced as a reason for such practices, but the real interests of a business and of the workers engaged in it cannot be served in this way.  Nor is it the way to protect employment.  It is my hope that the introduction of the redundancy payments scheme will enable both managements and trade unions to adopt a more realistic approach towards practices which militate against efficiency and adversely affect the competitiveness of many of our products.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are now aware, this is a very complex piece of legislation.  We decided that, before the Bill was drafted, the proposed scheme should be discussed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the main employers' organisations.  The discussions have been long and detailed and have involved some delay in the introduction of the Bill.  However, I am satisfied that this has been worthwhile, because the scheme which has emerged has benefited considerably from the useful contributions of both sides. There were, of course, some areas in which agreement was not possible.  In spite of this, I believe that the main structure of the scheme provided for in this Bill will be acceptable to both employers and workers.  I would like to thank all those who were involved in the discussions and to pay tribute to their constructive and responsible approach to the many problems involved.</P>
    <P>To turn now to the actual provisions of the Bill the basic proposals are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A qualified worker who is discharged because of redundancy will, if certain conditions are fulfilled, be entitled to redundancy payment, and this will consist of</P>
    <P>(a)  a lump sum payment, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a weekly payment.</P>
    <P>(2)  The lump sum will be payable by the employer direct to the worker <Col N="1606" /> and the amount of the payment will be related to the worker's length of service with that employer and to his normal earnings prior to redundancy.</P>
    <P>(3)  The maximum lump sum payment will be the equivalent of 16 weeks' pay.</P>
    <P>(4)  The weekly payment will be contingent on unemployment and will be paid out of a special fund which will be financed by contributions payable by employers and workers.</P>
    <P>(5)  An employer who makes a lump sum payment to a worker will be entitled to a rebate of 50 per cent, which in certain circumstances may be increased to 65 per cent of the lump sum.  These rebates will be paid out of the fund.</P>
    <P>(6)  The qualifying period of service for a redundancy payment will be four years with the same employer.</P>
    <P>The scope of the scheme is set out in section 4.  It will apply to all workers who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts. This means that almost all manual workers and clerical workers with incomes of less than £1,200 a year will be covered with the exception of part-time workers and workers under the age of 18 years or over 65 years of age. There are, of course, some workers below the £1,200 limit who, because of the permanent and pensionable nature of their employment, are not insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  These will not come within the scope of the scheme. I think it will be agreed that, with the emphasis on weekly payments, it is realistic to tie the scope of the scheme in with the scope of the Social Welfare unemployment benefit scheme.  We recognise that there may be some classes of workers for whom the general scheme would be unsuitable. The Minister for Labour will have power under the Bill, following consultations with the employer and worker interests concerned, to introduce special schemes more suited to the needs of any categories of workers <Col N="1607" /> for whom the general scheme may be found to be unsuitable.</P>
    <P>Representative committees are already considering the possibility of preparing special schemes for building workers and for dock workers.  I intend in the immediate future to open discussions with appropriate interests in agriculture on the question of whether a special scheme should be prepared for agriculture workers.  We have to recognise, however, that there are many workers in the classes of employment to which I have referred who would, in the event of redundancy, qualify for benefit under the general scheme.  I feel that the most equitable arrangement, in the circumstances, is to include all such classes in the general scheme until such time as a special scheme may be ready to be put into operation.  If and when a special scheme is ready for any particular class, I can at that stage exclude that class from the main scheme, with effect from the date of introduction of the special scheme.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the scope of the scheme, I think I should next look at the provisions dealing with the circumstances in which redundancy payments are to be made.  Redundancy is defined in section 7.  In effect, it means that an employer is required to make a redundancy payment to a qualified worker if he is dismissing the worker because he no longer requires his services.  It is immaterial whether the dismissal is due to a change in production methods, falling off in demand for products, complete closure of the firm or its transfer to another area.  Dismissal due to misconduct or some other fault of the employee would not, of course, rank as redundancy.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 15 are very important in regard to the question of entitlement to benefit; a worker who unreasonably refuses to accept an offer of suitable alternative employment by his employer will not be entitled to a lump sum payment.  This applies only where the alternative employment is in the employer's own business, or, in the case of a company, in the business of a parent or subsidiary <Col N="1608" /> company.  The same section also provides that a person who unreasonably refuses an offer by the Employment Service of suitable employment will be disqualified from receiving weekly payments.</P>
    <P>There are several rather complex sections dealing with entitlement to redundancy payments arising out of lay-off or short-time working.  I do not intend to deal with these provisions in detail on this stage, except to say that the intention is to provide that an employee will be entitled to redundancy payments if he is laid off or kept on short-time working for excessive periods.  At the same time, it would be unreasonable to expect an employer to make redundancy payments because of a temporary lay-off, and this is recognised in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements are made under section 8 to deal with the case of seasonal workers who return to the same employer year after year.  What we propose here is that, in the case of workers who are laid off for an average period of more than 12 weeks during the four years prior to redundancy, the provisions relating to lay-off in the Bill will not apply until the end of that average period.  In the case of a seasonal worker, therefore, there will normally be no question of redundancy until the usual commencement time of his seasonal work.  If he is not then re-employed, the question of redundancy arises, but not until then.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises the principle that, over the years, a worker builds up certain rights in his job, and if he is deprived of these rights by circumstances outside his control, that he ought to be compensated.  This will, I believe, give the worker a new status in relation to his job and in the long run, will make for better relations between managements and workers.  It is necessary to say in the Bill after what period of time this right commences to operate.  There can be divergent views on this but I consider that four years is a reasonable measure of the length of time that must elapse before a worker can be said to have established a right in a particular job.  I have decided, therefore, that to qualify <Col N="1609" /> for a redundancy payment a worker must have had at least four years' continuous service with the employer by whom he is declared redundant.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the Bill provides for redundancy payments in two forms, a lump sum payment to be made by the employer at the time of dismissal and weekly payments which will begin four weeks after that date. The amount of the lump sum and the amount and duration of the weekly payments will be related to the worker's service and to his normal pre-redundancy pay.</P>
    <P>In deciding the scale of benefits, there are a number of factors to be considered.  Firstly, the benefits must be sufficient to enable redundant workers to maintain standards relatively close to their pre-redundancy levels while they are being placed in, or retrained for, alternative employment; secondly, they should be substantial enough to effect the necessary change in attitudes towards redundancy; and, thirdly, they must not be so high as to add significantly to production costs or to act as a disincentive to the seeking or accepting of alternative employment.  This last mentioned point has particular significance in relation to the weekly payment.  I believe that the benefits proposed in the Bill achieve the necessary balance between these various considerations.</P>
    <P>The scale of payments and methods of calculation are laid down in Schedules 1 and 3 of the Bill.  The lump sum will be calculated on the basis of half a week's pay for each year of employment between the ages of 18 and 41 years and one week's pay for each year of employment over the age of 41 years.  The maximum payment will not exceed the equivalent of 16 week's pay.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, one of the aims of the scheme is to try to maintain the worker's living standards as close as possible to the pre-redundancy level. For this reason the emphasis is on continuing weekly payments rather than on a large lump sum payment.  The weekly payments, which will be contingent on unemployment, will be the equivalent of 50 per cent of the <Col N="1610" /> worker's pre-redundancy pay.  The payments will be payable in addition to social welfare benefits and will continue for a period of one week for each year of employment.  For the purposes of this calculation each two completed years of employment over the age of 41 years will count as three completed years.  It will be noted that the benefits are weighted in favour of older workers with long service and I think Deputies will agree that this is a just and reasonable approach.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the weekly payments will be paid in addition to any unemployment benefit or assistance or other social welfare benefit to which the worker concerned may be entitled. However, because of the disincentive danger to which I referred earlier, it is proposed that the total amount of the weekly redundancy payment and the social welfare benefit payable should not exceed 90 per cent of a redundant worker's pre-redundancy pay.</P>
    <P>Another important point in connection with the weekly payment is that, while it is payable only if the worker is unemployed, the worker will not lose his entitlement to the balance of the payments due if he accepts employment before exhausting his entitlement. The proposal is that the unexpired balance will be placed to his credit and may be drawn by him in the event of future unemployment.  This will involve administrative problems, but I believe that any other course would be unfair. Besides, the fact that his entitlement to weekly payments will be kept open should encourage the worker to accept alternative employment, even if it is only of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of weekly payments, there is one point I should like to make.  There is a strong link between these payments and certain social welfare benefits and, consequently, any adjustment or other developments in regard to the social welfare payments will inevitably involve a review of the weekly payments under the redundancy scheme. My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, is at present considering the feasibility of introducing a wagerelated social insurance scheme.  The introduction of such a scheme would <Col N="1611" /> make it necessary for us to re-assess the benefits payable under the redundancy payments scheme.  Any changes or adjustments that may be necessary in such circumstances will, under the provisions of the Bill, be subject to an appropriate resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Since the amount of the lump sum payments and the duration of the weekly payments are related directly to the length of the workers' service with the employer concerned, it would be relevant at this point to comment briefly on the provisions for calculating length of service.  The first thing to be noted is that the service must have been continuous, and rules for determining whether service was continuous or not are set out in Schedule 3, Generally speaking, service can be taken to have been continuous unless it was broken by the worker being discharged or voluntarily leaving the employment. However, discharge due, say, to recession in business or to illness of the worker which proved to be only a temporary break and did not exceed 26 weeks in duration would not be regarded as breaking continuity.  While certain absences from work will not break continuity, the periods may not be reckonable for the purpose of calculating length of service.  Rules in regard to this aspect of the matter are also included in Schedule 3.</P>
    <P>I might mention that under the proposed rules in Schedule 3 strikes will not break the employee's continuity of service, although neither will periods spent on strike after the commencement date of the Act count as reckonable service: periods of strike which occurred prior to that date, however, will count.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the establishment of the redundancy fund. This fund will be financed by contributions from employers and workers. The employer will pay 8d a week in respect of men and 6d a week in respect of women.  The workers' contribution will be 4d a week for men and 3d a week for women.  The main purpose of the fund is to spread the major part of the cost of redundancy <Col N="1612" /> over the widest possible area of employment. I think the idea of a special fund will meet with general approval. I believe that the proposed contributions will be sufficient to meet the likely outgoings from the fund.  This opinion is based on the best information available to my Department at the moment.  There are too many imponderables involved at this stage&mdash;the likely incidence of redundancy, the average age, length of service, and pay levels of workers becoming redundant &mdash;to enable us to estimate with any certainty what the outgoings from the fund will be.  Experience alone will show whether adjustments in the contribution rates or the benefits are necessary.  If they are, I will have power under the Bill, subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses, to make the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>The weekly payments which I referred to earlier will be paid out of the fund.  In addition, where a worker is unable to obtain from his employer a lump sum payment to which he is entitled&mdash;for example, if the employer is insolvent&mdash;the full amount due to the worker will be paid from the fund. Steps will then be taken to recover for the fund the part of the payment which should have been made by the employer.</P>
    <P>An employer who makes a redundancy payment for which he is liable will be entitled to a rebate from the fund equivalent to one-half of the lump sum paid.  This rebate will be increased by an additional 2½ per cent bonus for each extra week of notice which the employer gives in excess of the minimum notice of two weeks required under the Bill.  The maximum rebate will be 65 per cent of the actual lump sum payment.  I hope that this added incentive will encourage employers to give early notice of impending redundancies. This will enable the Employment Service to take steps in good time to seek suitable alternative employment, after a period of retraining if necessary, for the workers about to become redundant.</P>
    <P>In discussions it has been suggested that the fund should bear all or, at least, a higher proportion of the lump sum payments.  I do not agree.  It is <Col N="1613" /> essential that a substantial part of the cost of redundancies should be met by the employer who is declaring the workers to be redundant.  This will help to safeguard the fund from possible abuse and will ensure that employers adopt a responsible approach to redundancy.  If employers could declare workers redundant at little or no cost to themselves the scheme would be open to abuse.  But apart from this, I believe that it is right in principle that an employer should meet a reasonable portion of the redundancy payments for his workers directly from his own resources.</P>
    <P>It has been argued too in discussions that there should be a State contribution to the scheme.  I cannot accept this.  It is clear from what I said earlier that this scheme will be of direct benefit to both workers and employers, and it is only right that they, and not the public in general, should bear the cost.  It has to be borne in mind that a whole range of manpower services are being provided&mdash; new training and retraining schemes, an improved and expanded Employment Service, a manpower forecasting service and a scheme of resettlement allowances.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer will be bearing the major part of the cost of providing these services.  In these circumstances it would not be reasonable to expect the taxpayer to contribute also to the redundancy payments scheme.  Having regard to the relatively low contributions, it is only fair that employers and workers should share between them the cost of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been drafted on the basis that contributions will be collected by means of a special redundancy stamp.  The possibility of having contributions collected by means of a surcharge on the existing Social Insurance stamp is being examined but there are serious administrative and other problems involved which it may not be possible to overcome.  I will have power under section 33 to make regulations providing for the collection of contributions by means other than by a special redundancy stamp and the merits of alternative methods of collection will be fully investigated before <Col N="1614" /> I come to a final decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>If a worker is dissatisfied with an employer's decision regarding a lump sum payment, he may ask to have the question resolved by the appeals machinery of the Department of Social Welfare.  A worker may also avail of the same appeals machinery if he is dissatisfied with a decision of a deciding officer.  Likewise, an employer may appeal against the decision of a deciding officer on matters relating to scope and contributions.  Reference to the High Court may be made where a question of law is involved.  In some respects, separate machinery for redundancy appeals would appear to be desirable, but if we are to have a scheme which provides for continuing weekly payments tied in with certain social welfare benefits the only practical arrangement is to have appeals under both schemes dealt with by the same appeals machinery.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements are proposed in relation to CIE workers.  This is necessary because, under the Transport Acts, certain CIE employees might already be entitled to compensation in the event of redundancy.  It is proposed under section 48 that all CIE workers will be covered by the provisions of the Bill.  If, however, a worker should qualify for redundancy payment under the Transport Acts, he will not be entitled to receive, as well, payments under the Redundancy Payments Act.  In such circumstances redundancy fund contributions will be refunded.  New entrants to CIE will not be entitled to compensation under the Transport Acts.  They will be insured under the Bill in so far as they come within its scope.</P>
    <P>I will have power under section 46 to introduce a scheme of resettlement allowances.  The cost of this scheme will be borne by the Exchequer and will not be a charge on the redundancy fund.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide financial assistance to unemployed workers who must leave their home areas to secure employment.  I do not want anyone to get the impression that the introduction of such a scheme would represent a major shift <Col N="1615" /> in the Government's policy in relation to undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>It has been and it will continue to be Government policy to stimulate economic activity in such areas and, in particular, to do everything possible to facilitate the establishment of new industries which will give much-needed employment.  The resettlement allowances scheme is designed to promote a desirable degree of geographical mobility of labour within the country as a whole.  Its main value, however, is likely to be in assisting the establishment of development centres in undeveloped areas by helping workers within these areas to move to jobs in the development centres.</P>
    <P>The resettlement scheme will provide for payments to meet part of the cost of household removal, travel allowances, lodging allowances and part of the legal costs involved in selling a house in the home area and buying one in the new area.  It is the intention that the scheme will apply to unemployed workers over the age of 18 years who have no immediate prospects of re-employment in their home area.  The payment will, of course, only be made if employment of a reasonably permanent nature is available in the new area and there are no suitable unemployed workers available in that area.</P>
    <P>Both the redundancy payments scheme and the resettlement allowances scheme provided for under this Bill are largely experimental.  Experience alone will show whether they are financially viable.  Experience alone will show whether they are suitable to achieve the social and economic objectives at which we are aiming.  I want to assure the House that the operation of both schemes will be kept under careful review and that I will have no hesitation in promoting any improvements or amendments that may be shown to be desirable.  I think the only sensible course is to introduce the schemes as quickly as possible, to learn what lessons may have to be learned from their own operation, and to be ready and willing to make whatever <Col N="1616" /> improvements or modifications that time may reveal to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to emphasise once again that in introducing this Bill the Government are in no way pessimistic regarding the future of the economy.  We are confident that the measures in this Bill will strengthen the economy and that whatever future redundancies may occur will reflect the success of the Government's programme for economic development and expansion and not economic recession or malaise.</P>
    <P>The type of redundancy that must be envisaged is that associated with the transfer of surplus workers from contracting industries to new or expanding industries; the release for retraining of workers whose skills have become obsolete in consequence of advances in technology; and the re-training or resettlement of workers who may become surplus to a business because of mergers, and readaptation or other measures designed to promote efficiency.  Workers, however, cannot be expected to accept the hardships of disemployment even in such circumstances unless their personal interests are protected.  This is precisely what the Bill attempts to do and I commend it to the House for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to describe this Bill as an audacious piece of legislation.  Here the Government are exacting contributions from employers and employees, without their making any contribution. Despite what the Minister says in regard to the interest of the Government in workers, I think it is rather a reflection that the Government, who could find ways and means to assist some sections of the community, feel in this instance when, as the Minister says, the workers are under the stress of having lost their jobs, that it is the workers and the employers alone who are to deal with this unfortunate happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also audacious from the point of view that in regard to the fund which is being created, the Government and the Government alone are to have a say in its distribution.  Neither <Col N="1617" /> the workers nor the employers are to have any say in regard to this fund which they are going to create by their contributions.  Generally speaking, there are quite a number of firms&mdash;and I am sure the Minister knows this&mdash; that operate welfare schemes and pension schemes and even redundancy schemes at the present time.  These firms have been operating these schemes over the years and have been making contributions themselves to funds which provide for the kind of circumstances of which the Minister is now speaking.  In a good many cases, these are completely non-contributory schemes, provided in whole by the employers who make contributions through some kind of insurance funds and there are pension consultants who devise such schemes for the benefit of employees in industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has missed a golden opportunity in introducing this legislation. Everyone is aware of the difficulties in the kind of negotiations upon which the Minister has been engaged. Surely here was a golden opportunity to bring both sides together and to obtain from them some kind of advisory body or advisory council to administer the fund which the Minister proposes to set up under this Bill.  It is not very often that these opportunities present themselves and the Minister might have seen that this was an opportunity for him to engage in this exercise.</P>
    <P>Throughout this Bill from start to finish we find sections which give the Minister power to make regulations of various kinds.  That is particularly true of sections 4, 19, 28, 30 and 47.  Here is a piece of legislation dealing with a subject which can be a difficult one. Surely the Minister should have taken this opportunity to set up a joint advisory council to deal with the kind of regulations about which the Minister talks in these various sections? A joint council of workers and management would be of inestimable benefit to the Minister in his approach to the problems which will come before him in relation to questions of redundancy.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of making orders and putting them before the House.  I <Col N="1618" /> approve of these draft orders being brought before the Oireachtas before being confirmed by the Minister.  If this had happened in relation to previous legislation&mdash;the planning legislation, for instance&mdash;we would not now find ourselves in some of the difficulties in which we are.  If the Minister in that case had been prepared to lay the orders before the House before they were made, some of the difficulties would have been eliminated.  Therefore I commend the Minister for Labour on the fact that he is prepared to do this.</P>
    <P>One is struck by the thought at this stage that here is legislation in respect of which workers might well say to the Government: &ldquo;Thanks for nothing&rdquo;, because the Government are not contributing anything to it, one way or the other.  Another thought that strikes me has been provoked by the Minister's statement that change is the lifeblood of progress.</P>
    <P>Here is a piece of legislation in which I deprecate the change in departing from well-established principles of social welfare legislation.  In such legislation, as it has existed here since its introduction in 1952&mdash;and, indeed, in regard to legislation which it superseded&mdash;the State made a contribution of one-third towards the welfare of the community.  I deplore the departure from that principle.</P>
    <P>Indeed it may be a dangerous precedent inasmuch as here we are reaching the stage where we impose indirect taxation by the type of precedent we are now creating.  Once we have moved in that direction one could think of schemes of a like kind through which individuals in the State would find themselves compelled to contribute to measures for their own supposed benefit outside the ordinary forms of taxation to which they, in common with everyone else, already contribute. A further question strikes me in this respect and I put it to the Minister: will the contributions made by workers under this legislation be allowable for income tax purposes?</P>
    <P>Another factor that strikes me about this legislation is the anomalous position in which the Minister is being put. <Col N="1619" /> The Minister has a most important function in the State.  When this new Ministry was being set up, it was realised that on its success would depend not only the future prosperity of the country but the more harmonious working of both sides in industry. What do we find?  In regard to matters which are in dispute&mdash;for instance, in the matter of appeals&mdash;immediately an appeal lies to the Minister, the question will be decided in another Department over which the Minister for Labour has no control whatever.  He passes his responsibility over to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is something the Minister should not do.  He should stand on his own responsibility in regard to appeals made to him as Minister for Labour and should not pass them on for decision to the Department of Social Welfare.  I hope to illustrate the importance of this for the Minister.  The appeals officers are supposed to be independent officials. Their status will be set by the Minister who appoints them, but in this case it is not the Minister for Labour who decides the status of the appeals officers in regard to the various matters mentioned in this Bill&mdash;redundancy payments and so on.  This will be determined by officers in another Department and it is the Minister for Social Welfare who will decide the status of these officers.</P>
    <P>Once this legislation leaves this House and goes to the Seanad and is dealt with there, the Minister for Labour will be powerless to do anything about this matter.  His power will then have been transferred and I suggest that he is willingly transferring it and that he is unwise to do so because at a later stage the Minister for Labour will be answering questions in regard to these matters though he will not have responsibility for them.  For instance, if the Minister is not satisfied in his Department in regard to the quality of a decision which has come from these deciding officers, what power will he have to remove these officers or to vary that decision?  What power will he have to supervise these <Col N="1620" /> officers who are in another Department?</P>
    <P>This is a crazy trend and I hope the Minister will forgive me if I refer to other pieces of legislation which we recently have had before us and which clearly revealed a crazy pattern in regard to supervision and responsibility as between Ministers.  The Minister for Labour will recall that a week or so ago the Minister for Local Government introduced a Road Traffic Bill, the responsibility for whose administration will lie with the Minister for Justice.  Then we had the corollary of the Minister for Justice introducing a Bill dealing with ground rents, the availability of housing and of sites and so on.  That is surely in the province of the Department of Local Government and it seems to form a strange kind of pattern.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt we shall be told there are reasons for this.  In this case the Minister justifies it by telling us that social welfare payments are tied up with redundancy payments and lump sums in regard to redundancy.  I have seen these sections in the Bill and I do not think it is beyond the compass of officials in the Department of Labour, who will be dealing with these payments, to ascertain at any stage from the Department of Social Welfare whether a prospective recipient is receiving benefits under the social welfare code.  Every applicant for benefits, whether social welfare or otherwise, must, first of all, make a statement as to whether he is in receipt of payments or benefits of another kind.  This is a standard pattern in regard to social welfare at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister, therefore, should not hand over his responsibility in this way. Decisions in regard to lay-off and part-time employment should be decided as it is stated in section 37 by such and so many persons as the Minister thinks proper to be deciding officers.  The section also says that these officers will hold office during the pleasure of the Minister.  I take serious objection in principle to this kind of status being conferred on these officers, whoever they may be.  What does the phrase &ldquo;hold office during the pleasure of the <Col N="1621" /> Minister&rdquo; connote to the ordinary individual? I suggest it immediately creates doubts in the minds of the people looking at it.  I put it in this fashion for the purpose of highlighting a matter which I think the Minister should look at very seriously.  If deciding officers decide matters in a certain fashion, would the Minister be empowered, at his pleasure, to dismiss them?  I should like the Minister to have the power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Social Welfare had the power, could the Minister for Social Welfare remove them?  In the main, this will be a Committee Stage Bill and on Second Reading, I do not want to go into these matters unduly.  Why should these officers not be appointed on terms and conditions laid down by the Minister, terms and conditions which will be open to inspection and, if necessary, criticism by any Member of either House of the Oireachtas?  Leaving such matters as the conditions in regard to lay-offs and redundancy payments to those I have heard described as &ldquo;faceless individuals&rdquo; is not the way it should be done.  We ought to know about these officers and their terms and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>If we are to allow decisions to pass over to Social Welfare, I am sure the Minister, both as a Minister and as a Deputy, has as much experience as any Member on any side of the House of what happens to appeals in the Department of Social Welfare.  We are all aware of the decisions given by deciding officers at local level.  The most exasperating situations are created for the people directly involved, the applicants, who get stereotyped replies telling them that under section 53 of No. 57 of 1934 or 1953, or whatever it is, they are turned down.  The applicants do not know where they stand or what are their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Written into that kind of legislation &mdash;and indeed into this legislation&mdash;is an appeal to the High Court.  I challenge the Minister to say whether from 1952 to 1967 there have been even six or ten cases of appeals to the High <Col N="1622" /> Court under the social welfare code. The Minister will find that there have not been because a person can appeal only on a point of law and not on a point of fact.  He cannot have a decision stated on which he may argue.  This raises the whole question of appeals to an appeals officer.  I recently raised with the Minister for Social Welfare a case of whether or not a person should get the extra 5/-social welfare payment.  The old lady in question was turned down.  That was communicated to her, but she was not told why.  When a question was asked in regard to it, it transpired she was obtaining benefit from a plot of ground on which there were some cabbage plants.  I do not have to bother the Minister with these cases because I am sure he has as many of them as any other Deputy and that he has made representations on them to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>To come back to these deciding officers and appeals officers, I would expect the Minister, in the appointment of these officers, to have regard to certain facts.  I would suggest to him that he appoint his own.  Somebody might say to me: &ldquo;You are going to create more jobs.&rdquo;  I am prepared to create more jobs if I believe it means the persons affected will get a better, a more ready and more logical decision.  I notice in today's paper that a body of officers are complaining they are very often decried because of decisions they have to give under legislation.  I have admitted in the House that I think it is we, the Members of the House, who are crazy in that we have not spelled out the type of regulations under which these officers are expected to work and have not given them that measure of freedom of interpretation which ought to be their due if they are to discharge their responsibilities in a humane fashion, as it was meant they should when the legislation was going through the House.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister wants the decisions to be taken by these men to be taken in that fashion?  To that end I want to put a number of questions to him in regard to these officers.  First, what does he think ought to be their <Col N="1623" /> rank?  Secondly, are they to get any preliminary training of any kind?  Will they be experienced in any way in regard to conditions in industry?  Will they be capable of understanding the outlook of workers in industry, particularly workers under the stress of a threat of redundancy?  Will their decisions be given in writing for reasons stated?  This is all-important. When they do give decisions, they should be given in writing for reasons stated.  You cannot challenge a decision when you do not know the basis on which it is made.</P>
    <P>If the Minister agrees with me that these are valid points in regard to these officers, I think these matters should be written into the legislation.  I do not accept that decisions should be given in the stereotyped fashion in which decisions have been given by Social Welfare, whether on questions of unemployment benefit, the latest form of farm assistance or old age pensions, widows' pensions, orphans' pensions and so on.  Stereotyped replies are given which convey nothing to the individuals receiving them.</P>
    <P>Another question is: within what time limits will decisions have to be given?  I raise these matters now so that when we come to the Committee Stage, the Minister may have the answers for me.  I would be very pleased to hear them at that stage.  I want to put another query to the Minister, arising from the decision to allow it to pass over to Social Welfare.  We are all aware of the long list of cases awaiting decision by Social Welfare down in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada.  The Minister has given answers in the House time and time again that there have been delays of three months or six months or some other number of months.  Delay should not occur in regard to decisions under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister quite seriously if there is this long list of appeals, is it not quite clear that the Minister for Labour will be powerless to get rid of the backlog?  If I may be facetious, the Minister can open a file and the file can go from the Minister for Labour to the Minister for <Col N="1624" /> Social Welfare asking him would he consider appointing a few more deciding officers.  This highlights the fact that in any legislation which is the province of the Minister's office he should keep the decisions within that office and they should not pass from him.  No matter how willing officials may be, the machine of officialdom is so geared that files will be created and will grow because a file must pass from one to another and everybody adds a little bit as it goes along.  I would suggest to the Minister that it would be much easier to expedite matters in his own Department rather than try to deal with them through some other Department.</P>
    <P>There are, as I have said, a number of points which will require clarification on Committee Stage.  There are quite a number of points of interpretation that we will have to raise.  For instance, we would like a definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and whom this is supposed to cover.  There are phrases like &ldquo;expressed or implied&rdquo;.  Again it will be a question of who is to determine what is expressed and what is implied. For instance, who will determine between &ldquo;a contract of service&rdquo; and &ldquo;a contract for service&rdquo;.  Section 4 appears innocuous but the phrase is used &ldquo;insurable for all benefits&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;all&rdquo; is a very significant word in the context in which it is used&mdash;&ldquo;all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts&rdquo;.  What about clerks who happen to have an income of £1.201 and who make contributions in relation to the widow's pension?  What will be their position?  Will they be outside the section? Take manual labour, clerical work or otherwise.  What will be the position of, say, analysts who may have an income of £1,250?  These are points that I mention to the Minister as falling for discussion on Committee stage.</P>
    <P>As to the question of working for the same employer for less than 25 hours in a week, what is the position of charladies or part-time waitresses?  The Minister has mentioned that there are various classes of workers whom he will be thinking about later.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not to apply to a person who attains the age of 65.  What is to happen to persons between the ages of <Col N="1625" /> 65 and 70?  What is to happen to these persons at this most defenceless period of their lives?  There are no pensions for them at the age of 65.  At 65½ years they are not going to be redundant. They will have to carry on until they are 70 years of age, until such time as the social welfare pension is available.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say that he will have discussions with the agricultural community in regard to the application of this Bill to persons engaged in the agricultural industry.  That will be a very big problem.  The Minister is aware that according to projections being made there will be approximately 70,000 persons coming off the land in X years.  Will any provision be made for that situation?  I realise that it is a large problem.  It is another matter that is not at the moment written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>In section 4 subsection (3) (b) it is provided that the Act shall not apply in respect of employment where the employer is a relative of the employee. Certain relationships are mentioned. Has the Minister thought in terms of brother-in-law and sister-in-law?  Under the social welfare code, an employer is not allowed to stamp a card in respect of a relative unless that relative is living in a separate house.  These are additional matters that can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As to the question of entitlement to redundancy payment and this matter of 12 weeks, I am sure that the Minister, being a rural Deputy, is aware of the special position in which road workers may find themselves in this modern age when machinery is eliminating this type of employment.  I listened to the Minister for Industry and Commerce here today expressing his concern for places like Limerick. I did not want to interrupt at that stage but I should like to say now that I wish there were special regard for people in the West Limerick area where, despite the fact that there are four large towns, one of them, Newcastlewest, the premier county town, there has never been an industry and where even shops are shutting down. The application of this Bill will not be confined to the larger centres but <Col N="1626" /> will vitally affect even the rural areas.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that a Redundancy Payments Bill should be introduced at a time when, according to published information, there is a shortage of skilled labour in certain sections of industry.  I am sure the Minister has seen the Quarterly Industrial Survey issued by the Economic and Social Research Institute in January 1967. Statistics are given on page 3 of that survey as to the availability of skilled labour.  Three headings are used: &ldquo;easily&rdquo;, &ldquo;sufficiently&rdquo; and &ldquo;with difficulty&rdquo;.  The following percentages are given as to the industries in which skilled labour can be obtained with difficulty: total manufacturing, 48 per cent; food, drink and tobacco, 25 per cent; textiles and clothing, 78 per cent; metals engineering and vehicles, 39 per cent and other industries, 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>These statistics are borne out by the Joint Industrial Survey of April, 1967. For instance, in regard to the industrial group and all manufacturing, where the question was put to firms: &ldquo;Could more be produced with present resources?&rdquo;, where firms replied &ldquo;no&rdquo;, they gave the reason as to why more could not be produced and in 17 per cent of the cases, shortage of manpower was the reason given.  In regard to industrial textiles, under the same headings, in 38 per cent of cases, the shortage of manpower is the reason why these firms could not produce more.  In regard to clothing and footwear, it is 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>This would seem to suggest that we ought to be concentrating on industrial training.  This would seem to be part of the answer to the kind of problems which the Minister is not afraid of but which are going to arise.  He is not, he said, unduly pessimistic in regard to redundancy, but these are the problems which it is feared moving with the times will bring this country and other countries.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we cannot be too early or too radical in providing the necessary skilled manpower.  The urgency of industrial training extends downwards even to the section with which the Minister for Education is dealing, those who are leaving school.  That <Col N="1627" /> combined with the intention of the Government to move into the Common Market and the exploratory missions which the Taoiseach is about to undertake, highlights the urgency of industrial training schemes.  The Minister is well aware of the position from the office of Minister for Education which he has held; he has figures in his mind of the number of young people who are school leavers seeking work.  It will become increasingly difficult for them to find work if they have not got the kind of training, industrial training, which will guarantee them a job in the world of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I say, is one which will need close examination on Committee Stage.  There will be quite a number of points to be elucidated.  I hope the discussion will be helpful to the Minister and that it will lead to the clarification which is needed on certain points so as to ease people's minds.  As to the Bill as we have it at the moment, as I said at the outset, I do not think the Government can take any great credit for it; they are not contributing to it at all.  Indeed, one might say that if there had been more attention given to the question of re-training and the question of getting industry going, the need for the Bill would not be as great as it is.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of his speech and at the finish, the Minister created an air of optimism on the question of redundancy.  I hope he is fully justified in his optimism.  I hope the kind of things he has in mind for the undeveloped areas will come about.  I hope the projection of 77,000 leaving the land will not come about, because if it should, it would throw a grave burden on the Minister's office.  With the modern trend of getting young people to remain on longer at school and to engage more in this kind of training, the opporutnities should be available for expansion if we can get industry of the type into the country which needs the kind of manpower we have for it.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, a detail of the Bill, which I am sure the Minister will have in mind.  It is the question <Col N="1628" /> of employees within the State and without the State.  I hope this does not recognise a barrier.  There are people in this State who have part of their industry up across the Border at the moment.  I hope we can keep the country as a unit so far as our nationals going up there are concerned.</P>
    <P>The people for whom this piece of legislation is intended to provide will naturally be concerned at the threat of losing their work and at the prospect of the wage packet suddenly going and being left with nothing.  I mentioned this question of the time-lag in these matters.  I hope there will not be any time-lag when the Minister comes to administer this scheme, that workers who do unfortunately find themselves in that position will enjoy continuity of their wage packet, even to the extent of 90 per cent, and that there will not be this break for inquiries, decisions, appeals, and so on.  This is something that should not and must not happen with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I want again to say to the Minister that I hope he will take a very serious look at the question of letting responsibility pass from himself to Social Welfare.  Even given the best will in the world on the part of the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Labour is the person who must deal with this legislation.  I would ask him earnestly to keep the working of this measure within his own Department where he himself will be able to clear the bottleneck, so that there will be quick decisions and those who will be undergoing a period of stress will be helped as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>When we come to Committee Stage, we on this side of the House hope to be helpful to the Minister, but in the meantime we offer these criticisms of the legislation.  We do so with the best intentions in the world and with best wishes for the success of the kind of legislation the Minister would like to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have been waiting impatiently for this Bill, because we have been convinced for some time that legislation of the kind we are offered here was necessary.  We could see that <Col N="1629" /> Irish workers being displaced, because of technological advances, or becoming redundant if they were to have any protection, needed some statutory minimum below which their earnings would not fall in times of disemployment as a result of freer trade, competition and so on.  As I say, we have been waiting a long time for this.  At different times the Minister has offered different excuses for the delay in the production of this Bill.  Looking over the Bill, I cannot see that the end-product offers much in the way of meeting the objections put by our side in the discussions that took place prior to the formulation of the Bill.  It certainly does not approximate in any degree to the advantages enjoyed by our fellow-countrymen who find themselves in a similar position in the North. If the excuse is put forward that a great deal of drafting was necessary, then one can reply that the British Government under Wilson has done all the drafting necessary and all our civil servants had to do was to have a look at the provisions in the British Bill in order to get over some of the difficulties, at least, that might be involved in drafting.  Our fellow-countrymen in the North enjoy far better conditions also in terms of retraining and from the point of view of the other provisions essential if industry is to have proper legislation governing provision for training and retraining of workers, and so forth.  We shall be discussing this in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, we must clearly understand that this Bill takes second place from the point of view of the provisions obtaining for those workers who are ground under the tyranny of the Stormont regime.  They have, in fact, a far better deal from that Government than we are getting from ours in this Bill.  We have been calling for the introduction of some kind of minimum legislation because we appreciate that the kind of social welfare provisions we have here are quite inadequate and constitute in no degree a protection for the worker who is out of work.  It has always been extremely unfashionable to refer to this kind of thing because, down the years, people did not consider that society ought to <Col N="1630" /> be just.  We, in the Labour Party, have all down through the years been drawing attention to the inadequacy of our social welfare code.  So bad has it been that at no stage did it allow us any excuse for inactivity in bringing in legislation of the kind now offered here.</P>
    <P>Building workers and dock workers are excluded from this Bill.  The Minister referred to the setting up of special working parties.  The setting up of working parties has always operated to delay.  The Government set up a working party when they cannot come to a decision or when they do not want to bring about some desired result for a number of years.  I query whether the setting up of a working party in relation to dockers and workers on building schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what I want to establish.  At any rate, we will have a working party to look after the matter and we will, I hope, have a <Col N="1631" /> special scheme.  We will deal with all that on Committee Stage.  Over the years we have called attention to the inadequacy of our social welfare payments and we have waited impatiently for this legislation.  This is not a new deal for workers who are declared redundant.  This is minimum legislation. The Minister has warned about not opposing change and the obligation of seeing redundancy as part of the necessary changes in our society, changes intimately associated with economic development and economic prosperity.  I wonder if we have not missed the real meaning of redundancy. I wonder if a number of employers have not, in fact, fallen into the trap of disregarding the grave import of redundancy to the individual worker.  I fail to see the progress involved in certain workers being declared redundant over the past year or two.  There have been all too many unfortunately declared redundant.  The man who loses his employment in the cause of progress will not feel too happy in his position in the onward march.</P>
      <P>The regrettable thing is that representations were made to the Government in 1963 by the unions in relation to redundancy.  This is 1967, four years later, and all we have had in the interim is hot air and special working parties.  Now we have this legislation. When we did make representations, there was a kind of euphoria in official Government circles.  That was the time when we were looking forward to 86,000 extra in the labour force by 1970.  That date has now been advanced another decade to 1980.  It is more a matter now of television programmes rather than actuality or practicality. The anticipated increase in 1963 was 86,000.  This is 1967 and our targets are set considerably lower.  In fact, our targets have tumbled.  They are reserved now for television programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I remember rightly, the CIO at that particular period, having examined the jobs of 105,000 workers in manufacturing industry in the country, considered that if all adaptation measures were taken&mdash;if you remember, I think there were 15 reports over <Col N="1632" /> each industry&mdash;and if we topped up the number of measures that they requested on Irish industry, the number of adaptations that were necessary, ranging all the way from the changing of management structure itself down to the installation of new machinery&mdash;we would certainly get a most formidable list of changes that were essential in Irish industry&mdash;and if Irish management were good enough to take the tax concessions a benevolent Government is pleading with them to take to improve their industry then there would be only 11,000 redundant in Irish industry in the jobs of those 105,000 workers that were examined. If these measures were not taken the CIO said we could imagine redundancy in the region of 23,000 workers in the jobs of those 105,000 workers that were examined.  Admittedly, at that period, such was our optimism for the future &mdash; we had a man who was certainly gifted in public relations in command of the Government at that period&mdash;that we believed that, to offset these dangerous figures produced by CIO, there was a possibility that by 1970 we would have 86,000 new jobs in Irish industry.  Now, in 1967, the weather being a little bit damper, our figures and our targets are a little bit more modest.</P>
    <P>We must see this Bill against the more alarming picture exposed at this time of the future of our economy and against the kind of picture exposed last year and what we can see of it this year.  It is against this kind of background that we must measure the effectiveness of this Bill.  I do not think &mdash;CIO have, in fact, referred to this already also &mdash; that this Bill deals with the financial aspect&mdash;admittedly inadequate financial aspect&mdash;but deals with the purely financial aspect in the name of redundancy.  We cannot isolate the aspect of a man's losing his job and also of his possible re-entry into the work force, re-training and the provision of an alternative job.  It is against this background and the failure of the economy to come up with sufficient jobs that we must see if this Bill will provide any real improvement for the people who will be concerned with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> Again, we heard today, at the end of Question Time, that the Taoiseach is arranging to pass through some European countries to find out what is happening to our application to enter the Common Market.  I think it shows the lack of a sense of urgency in official circles that on the same day we are discussing in its Second Stage a Bill concerned with redundancy against the kind of figures we can expect in Irish industry in redundancy in the years ahead.  The Taoiseach will be going on his trip through Europe next month and today we are discussing how we can introduce redundancy legislation in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been at pains to inform us that the discussion of redundancy does not mean that the economy is going backwards.  The figures are there for all of us to see.  The redundancy Bill is with us.  There is as yet no practical programme of training or re-settlement of workers in evidence in the country despite the fact that we are up to our necks in negotiation for entry into EEC.  Whilst many speeches have been made over recent years on the challenge, as it is called, of the EEC, little in fact has been done on the home front; little in fact has been done by this Government to prepare this country for what the late Deputy William Norton called many years ago &ldquo;an excruciating experience for Irish industry&rdquo; if we enter this Common Market competitive jungle.</P>
    <P>The Bill here expresses that&mdash;in considering eligibility&mdash;we must look for people with at least four years' continuous service with the same employer in the case of workers who would hope to come under this and the service of a worker under 18 years is to be disregarded and all eligibility is to cease at the age of 65.  There is the difficulty that has already been mentioned in regard to dock workers and building workers. Surely a fairer continuous service period and one more in conformity with the kind of industry we have in this country would be to put it, say, at a two-year continuous service period? Surely this would approximate more to the kind of industry we have in this country?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> There are quite a number of jobs in Dublin where a worker does not have more than a very short period of continuous service.  We can see the position in Irish industry where, through no fault of his own, a worker may have to change jobs many times over a period of a few years.  The terms of this Bill are more suited to a heavier and more industrialised country than in fact this is.  The average experience of many workers would suggest that, in fact, their period of service with a particular employer must be far shorter than that of the average worker in most other more heavily-industrialised European countries. There are many jobs with large firms in Dublin where a worker reluctantly takes up employment for a period in between jobs.  There is quite a number of that sort of thing.  It would surely more truly approximate to the problems of this country if we had specified a shorter period of continuous service for eligibility for a worker to come under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, we would have thought that the lump sum payment should at least have been put down to a maximum, say, of five years' continuous service. This surely&mdash;again following the same argument&mdash;would have applied to the workers who had been fortunate enough to get employment in Irish industry.  Five years' continuous service would be pretty high by comparison with the periods of continuous service that workers in other countries in Europe might enjoy, in Britain especially.  The lump sum redundancy payments in the Bill are half a week's pay for each year of employment between the ages of 18 and 40 and one week's pay for each year of employment over 40 years subject to a maximum of 16 weeks' pay.  Here, surely, there should have been a shorter period.  Just consider half a week's pay for each year of employment between the ages of 18 and 40.  In Britain, they offered half a week's pay for the years between 18 and 21&mdash;I suppose on the basis that, at that stage, the worker involved would have been unmarried.  Here, however, the cheese-paring went to the extent of half a week's pay for all the responsible years of the normal adult worker's life <Col N="1635" /> between the ages of 18 and 40.  The British legislation, which applies in the North of Ireland, refers to 1½ weeks' pay for those over 40.  I just mention these figures to show that the Government have been guilty of cheese-paring in this legislation.  This legislation does not truly answer the problem of industry and the people who will be affected.</P>
    <P>I know that later today we will have the brass band of Fianna Fáil Deputies parading and thanking the Minister for the great work he has done in bringing in this legislation.  We will have the showpiece trade unionists of the Fianna Fáil Party talking about what a great job he has done.  I know the Minister will be as embarrassed as many more of us will be when he hears the comments of these showpiece trade unionists on this legislation.  What we want on this Bill is honest discussion about whether it is to mean any improvement for the people who will be suffering.  We can see some of the cheese-paring when we look at Schedule 3 where it refers to &ldquo;Normal Weekly Remuneration&rdquo;.  Care is taken to exclude overtime for the purposes of calculation.</P>
    <P>One is worried about the kind of deciding officer who will preside over the interpretation of the Bill's provisions. It is well known that it is not the common experience that officials know the facts of industry here and one is worried about the possibility of a man who has worked at a certain routine all his life being asked to decide, in relation to such matters as shift work and so on, whether a man is applicable for this kind of payment. At any rate, when one reads this Part of the Bill, one sees that care is taken in relation to things like overtime and the qualifications surrounding bonuses not to err on the side of generosity to the workers who will be at the butt end of this Act.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that there should be weekly redundancy payments of 50 per cent of previous payments.  Representations have been made in regard to the weekly redundancy payment that we should at least have seen the kind <Col N="1636" /> of problem of a worker who is out of work as a result of things beyond his control and that we should at least look for 75 per cent of the average weekly earnings for the best of the previous three years' earnings and also that payments should have been made for a minimum period of six months. We are being over-confident if we think that a person put out of work as a result of technological changes, or more competition, is not going to be out of work for a much longer period than this legislation anticipates.  Certainly that is true from what we can see in regard to new jobs coming up.</P>
    <P>Whilst this legislation&mdash;leaving aside the financial aspects which are unsatisfactory&mdash;might answer the problem in an economy which had an increasing number of jobs coming up, it does not answer the problem in an economy such as ours, which is on the down-grade and where the number of jobs is decreasing rather than increasing. In this situation we need a longer period of protection and security of earnings for employees than would be the case if we had an expanding economy.  It is also true to say that the workers themselves will be contributing heavily to the cost of this scheme.  Male workers will contribute 4d a week and female workers will contribute 3d a week.  We see that there will be a sugar coating for those employers who will be good enough to give the necessary notice to their employees.  There will be a 2½ per cent increase on the lump sum added to a rebate in respect of each extra week of notice given in excess of the minimum period of two weeks.  Therefore, to the employer who is good enough to accept that in 1967 he should give at least two weeks' notice, we will give him a monetary reward.</P>

      <P>The State will give a rebate of 2½ per cent to an employer who gives more than two weeks' notice and says to his employees: &ldquo;You are out of work; there will be no further work for you in two weeks.&rdquo;  Presumably this principle of industrial good behaviour can be applied to both sides in industry.  I do not see any rewards for the worker who is doing a good job.  Throughout the Bill we see the cheeseparing when it comes to the unfortunate individual who with his family will have to survive for months while he looks for a job, while the employers who are already stuffed to the gills with tax concessions and so on, and with whom the State is pleading to adapt their industries, will be given this rebate.  As well as the Fianna Fáil trade union lobby, we have the Fianna Fáil employers lobby here.  The employer lobby of the Fianna Fáil Party have had plenty of formidable experience of firing workers without consultation or notification.  Perhaps there will be the possibility of some dialogue between that element and the trade union brass band in the discussion on this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Very early the organisation representing workers, in looking at this matter of redundancy, sought as one of the most important things from the employers, that adequate notice be given of the employer's intention in regard to laying off workers.  Experience of the past year or two was that many Irish employers still felt it was not necessary to tell the people who work for a living what were their plans for future employment. There is still a number of workers in the car building and vehicle assembly industry who do not know if their jobs will be there next year.  Of all industries in Dublin I should say there is very little evidence of any real serious intention on the part of employers in that industry to consult the workers. This is not good enough in the circumstances of our time.  If there is to be true consultation, employers must be prepared to come out openly and talk to the workers about the state of the <Col N="1639" /> industry and whether jobs will be there for them next year and where they will fit into the general scheme of things. Employers must get away from the practice of saying to workers on a Wednesday evening: &ldquo;Take your cards on Friday as we will not need you here for the next few weeks at any rate.&rdquo;  That has occurred in industries where overtime has been the order of the day up to two or three weeks before this lay off.</P>
      <P>This Bill understands the psychology of such employers because it says that if they are good enough to give an extra week's notice, in addition to the statutory two weeks' notice in the Bill, there will be a bonus of two and a half per cent in respect of each extra week's notice.  It understands the policy of these cash register merchants and cash appears to be the only consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say that this Bill gives that rebate and I am sure the Bill has some relation to the Minister's wishes in this respect.  I think the Minister will understand my function here.  He knows the discussions that have taken place and I am here merely to counteract the rather embarrassing bouquets that will be thrown at him for the remainder of the evening by the brass band of trade unionists in his own Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worried about it; I know there will not be one fact in the whole thing.  I have seen examples of these plaudits earlier. My function here is to bring up as far as possible the position of the people who will be at the butt end of this legislation, those who will have to make do on the rather meagre financial <Col N="1640" /> concessions given in the Bill.  I have pointed out that this legislation is very much a second runner to legislation brought in by the rather dyed-in-the-wool Tory administration in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for redundancy payments subject to a maximum of 16 weeks' pay.  This may mean for many Irish workers merely £160, because many such workers are still living on £10 a week.  I wonder if there has been any realistic thinking in the Department about the duration of unemployment workers may face. Admittedly, the Minister says we shall learn by experience and that he is ready to change it if experience is one way or the other but the initial production of this Bill suggests there has not been a great deal of realistic thinking about the period for which workers can expect to be unemployed between jobs.  Expansion in Irish industry is not such as to suggest that this period will be short&mdash;rather the contrary&mdash; because jobs are not there and presumably for many workers there will be a pretty long wait.</P>
      <P>From the outset we have said that even if we had the most wonderful provision for workers out of jobs, the really essential thing so far as they are concerned is to obtain alternative work and in so many cases this is not possible.  In the past year we have seen a brewery close down in Portlaoise and many workers thrown out of their jobs. Later, some kind of chicken farm was started, although I could not see very much connection between a brewery and a chicken farm, but this chicken coop has now closed down.  When we talk of the transferability of a worker, this is only possible where there is some link between the job he leaves and the one to which he goes.  Where that does not exist, the possibility of transferring does not arise.  We talk about geographical mobility and transferability but so far as the choices facing workers in different parts of the country are concerned, I believe the pattern of emigration has been set from time immemorial, in certain places, emigration to Liverpool, Manchester and other industrial towns in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the drawbacks of <Col N="1641" /> the present situation, and they are drawbacks which should put in perspective the frenzy of diplomatic activity of the Government in tours to Europe and so on and their complete inactivity on the home front where such activity is essential in the workers' interests.  We have mollycoddled inefficient Irish industrialists for years and we have now discovered that they are not up to the standard required to meet competition, that they have no intention of adapting, that they do not give a curse about their workers and will lay them off.  In this legislation we actually understand this and suggest there will be a rebate for the good boy of an employer who will give an extra week's notice.</P>
    <P>This is a very alarming situation, irrespective of Party considerations and it may even sink through the rhinoceros skin of the loyalty of trade unionists in Fianna Fáil that this Government are not truly concerned with the people who work for a living, that they are not a Government who can be applauded for the kind of legislation produced in this case.  The trade unions that are attacked by some of the trade unionists opposite first brought forward their proposals on redundancy in 1963.  Let them answer that one.  They made proposals for redundancy compensation.  This is 1967 and we now have the first piece of legislation in that connection.  Later this month the Taoiseach will go to the continent of Europe to see whether we are being allowed into that particular club.  I think this is a class of non-activity by the Government, a lack of concern for the real problems of the working people, that will need a good deal of answering.  The real tragedy of the situation facing us is that people are waking up too late to the kind of laziness that has existed in Government circles and the lack of activity in preparation that should have taken place.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any thing else I can have a shot at in this Bill at this stage.  Yes&mdash;No. 8, which states:</P>
    <P>An employee will not be entitled to a redundancy payment if he unreasonably refuses to accept an offer <Col N="1642" /> of suitable alternative employment by his employer. </P>
    <P>We have often in this House spent a number of days on clauses in some minor Bill which might have something to do with whether £100,000 which a man had to leave was to go to his daughter or his son.  The plain concern of the Deputies who spent such time on this particular clause was to whom the money was to go.  I wonder how much time will the House, these Deputies who had so much time to spend on that £100,000, have to devote to whether the freedom of an employee is being impaired if he reasonably refuses to accept alternative employment by his employer.  We will have, presumably, a deciding officer who will decide whether in fact the employee has reasonably refused.</P>
    <P>I am not a trained lawyer but I would say that any trained lawyer could run a coach and four through this.  In circumstances such as these when an employee is offered employment, it could be employment which is completely unacceptable to him.  It might not even be suitable for him.  He might be offered a lower rate of pay or there might be many other disadvantages attaching to it.  Despite this, we leave this wide open and say: &ldquo;If he unreasonably refuses to accept an offer of suitable alternative employment&rdquo;. Are we quite sure that if the worker refuses this employment, it would constitute an unreasonable refusal in respect of the loss of pay involved?  Such a person could be offered employment in a firm which might not remain in operation.  It could be closed down after a short time.  Are all those elements to be considered as unreasonable?</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister this.  We propose to go through every provision of this Bill with our viewpoint as representing the workers' attitude to it.  Any amendments we bring forward will show up the deficiencies of this Bill.  I shall await with great interest the comments of the trade unionists in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not mean their comments this afternoon because this afternoon will be a stage curtain raising by those individuals.  I hope <Col N="1643" /> they will be prepared to discuss the amendments we bring forward.</P>

      <P>I am just anticipating the Deputy.  I want to say this. I know the Minister is one of the adults of the Government and will be embarrassed as I would expect any reasonable man to be by the comments we hear from those Deputies over there.  There will be room for serious discussion when we come down to the amendment stage and when we bring forward some of the reservations we feel.</P>
      <P>We have waited a great number of years for this legislation.  While we were waiting for this Bill, many workers, not defended and protected by unions, have in fact passed out of Irish industry with not so much as a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; from the Irish employers. Quite a number of industries closed down during that time for some of the reasons which this Bill seeks to withstand.  The workers involved in many of those industries which closed down were not in trade unions and did not receive anything from their employers. Having waited so long, it can be understood that we want to protect the workers in regard to the deficiencies in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As far as we are concerned there will be serious criticism from this Party of this Bill.  It will be purely on behalf of the workers and will not be made for any partisan reason.  The overall thing is that this legislation is absolutely necessary.  There can be no doubt about that but the provisions of this Bill are rather the product of cheese-paring by the official mind with no reasonable concern for the people who will be at the butt end of this matter.</P>

      <P>At the butt end. Let us not quibble over this.  We must not leave out of sight the fact that there will be many families in this country who will have no other defence or security of income for a long period of time in the years ahead and it is important that in this House we intend to bring in legislation which will truly protect those families in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The situation which we find in the economy is not good.  When we first looked at this redundancy matter many years ago, we thought, as I said at the outset, in terms of the jobs examined in Irish industry&mdash;105,000 jobs were examined&mdash;that if all the adaptation measures were taken, 11,000 might be declared redundant and if these measures were not taken, 23,000 would be declared redundant. The measures recommended by the CIO in that period aimed at the large scale sacking of a great number of people who graced directors' chairs in Irish industry, people who do not have any particular knowledge of Irish industry, who apparently have no regard for the workers, and were designed to end that situation.  It has not ended, and unfortunately this Bill does not appear to set down any serious approach to it, unlike some countries on the Continent where people in private industry who were not doing their job in the way the Government considered they should, were cut off from tax concessions and other steps taken to see that the policy of those firms was changed.  This has not been done here.  The different provisions of this will have the greatest attention from the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>As a trade unionist of good standing, fully paid up to 31st December of this year, which is probably more than many of the people on the opposite benches can say, I want to sympathise with Deputy O'Leary. If his is the best the Labour Party can do in relation to this Bill, the Minister will have an easy time.  Deputy O'Leary for the past halfhour or so dealt with a variety of matters, some related to the Bill and others to other <Col N="1645" /> Bills.  I shall deal with this as time goes on.</P>
      <P>First of all I want to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It is just another step along the long road which is paved with various aids to the workers, starting away back when we came to office in 1932.  Those various aids to workers, whether holiday pay, conditions of employment or matters such as are in this Bill or other Bills going through the House at the moment or have already gone through the House, have all been the work of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>As a worker, I understand workers to a greater degree than Deputy O'Leary who never had to dirty his hands.  It is only the people who have to work in the workshop who can really understand the ordinary workers. The approach which Deputy O'Leary has in regard to them is whether they, as trade unionists, pay their contributions.  That is as far as he is concerned about what he can get for them.  He shed a lot of salty tears today for the unfortunate workers.  If he wants to do anything for the workers he must be completely in touch with them.  If he wants to be their mouthpiece in Dáil Éireann, he must show that he is interested and keep in touch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of redundancy will not arise in future.  It has arisen on many occasions in the past.  Redundancy in CIE was tackled by Fianna Fáil not so long ago to the satisfaction of all the workers.  They were satisfied with the amounts they received and they were entirely satisfied with the industrial state of the country.  There were occasions in 1956, 1957 and 1948 when the people were scattered.  There was no question of redundancy payments then.  There were aircraft technicians and people in the industrial and building trades who had to emigrate in 1956 and 1957.  There was no regard for their future employment in industry when the shutters were put up by the Labour Party and their associates in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives the worker a sense of <Col N="1646" /> justice and a feeling of security for the future.  He will also be able to meet his commitments in the period when he is awaiting further employment.  There is recognition in the Minister's statement of the worker's rights in his job.  If he is deprived of these rights through circumstances outside his control, he ought to be compensated.  This will give the worker a new status and will mean better relations between management and workers.  This is a recognition of the rights of the worker by Fianna Fáil and by the Minister for Labour.  This will give comfort to the worker, knowing that if he becomes disemployed through circumstances outside his control he will receive redundancy payments.  This Bill is one of the various measures to consolidate the worker in his job, in relation to conditions of employment, holidays and other matters, which this Government, on examination of the rights of the worker, have seen fit to introduce down the years.</P>
    <P>There were two occasions when the Labour Party, in conjunction with their friends, had an opportunity to introduce legislation to meet these requirements, which were necessary then, and on no occasion have they done anything about it.  Such action was necessary in 1948 when the Labour Party went into power and when they dispossessed hundreds of workers, but they did not think of the workers then. Redundancy was a dirty word when they scattered the workers who were in sound employment on a fortnight's notice&mdash;indeed, on a week's notice in 1948.  These workers got no redundancy payment.</P>
    <P>Again, in 1956-57 the Labour Party were in power for another three years and there was nothing but disaster.  At that time we had 97,000 people on the labour exchange.  In fact, the labour exchanges at that time were not big enough to cater for the volume of unemployed people who were knocking at the doors.  There was no question of redundancy payments then and the Labour Party had been in power for two periods of three years.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary said that the Labour Party have always used pressure with regard to social welfare <Col N="1647" /> benefits.  Of course, they have been speaking about this but they did not do anything about it when they were in power.  Perhaps Deputy O'Leary would tell us what social welfare benefits he was talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>You just did not do anything.  You did not think of the workers.  The only contribution you made to the workers was to take away their employment and close the factories where some of the people could have been readily placed.</P>
      <P>It is easy to speak on a redundancy Bill and the extent to which it should go when you are sitting on the opposite side of the House.  You will have plenty of opportunity in future to sit on the opposite side and discuss the many Bills which will go through this House in relation to further improvements for the workers.  I am sure the capable Deputy Hillery will ensure that the problem of the workers will be corrected to their satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of the nation as a whole, and that he will ensure a balanced sense of responsibility between management and labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is just another milestone on the road to ensuring that the workers will have the necessary protection <Col N="1648" /> during any crisis that may arise from time to time.  With regard to employment, mention was made of the reluctance of some employers to keep pace with modern developments and modern techniques and methods. We should impress on those people who are at the helm in industry that it is necessary to ensure that they adapt themselves in the interests of the nation and the workers to ever-changing circumstances and be ready to meet new circumstances and new competition from outside.  It certainly will not come from any laxity on the part of the Government, in so far as assistance is concerned, if the jobs which are anticipated or the industries which are in operation have not equipped themselves to meet new and changing circumstances. This assistance was criticised by Deputy O'Leary today; that people are getting all sorts of handouts in order to adapt themselves.  This is necessary and desirable.  I am glad to know that the Labour Party have gone on record as being opposed to the adaptation necessary to meet new competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. The Deputy did not go to the trouble of listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Once there is a problem at all, you magnify it out of all proportion and then blame the Government&mdash;a very simple matter of putting across your point of view.  But you can be quite sure that whatever the problems may be we have the men capable of tackling them.  They will tackle and solve them in a manner which is just and in the best interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned also the question of personnel managers.  To my mind, this is something which is absolutely necessary and desirable.  We have trained personnel managers who can assess the situation in relation to the industry in which they operate&mdash; assess the capacity of their workers for interchange and acceptability in other departments.  They would have at their fingertips an assessment of the future development, which is something which would ensure harmony among the staff and better relations <Col N="1649" /> between management and workers, so desirable and necessary in many industries. We should applaud those people who have introduced personnel managers, who have accepted all the aids made available throughout the years in order to adapt themselves to meet these new conditions and so increase production and their personnel, and, in that way, assist not alone their workers and themselves but the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>As I said before, this Bill is the Government's answer in concrete terms.  Whatever may be the limitations of this Bill, I am quite sure that if the Minister said that the period should be ten years Deputy O'Leary would say it should be five years; if the Minister said it should be four years, Deputy O'Leary would say it should be two.  It is not merely today that happened; it happened for a period in the past when in relation to measures introduced here in regard to workers or to benefits given at Budget time, we were told they were only half as good as they should have been or, as on this occasion, the Minister's period was too long.  That is one of the ways to put across to the people they are being fooled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy surprises me with his cynicism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a few items in the Minister's speech on which I should like to comment. Deputy Jones and Deputy O'Leary criticised the question of the contributions of workers and employers.  Of course, the money could be got in other ways, by taxing the housewife and the unfortunate child who would have to pay their contribution towards the redundancy of the worker.  The Minister's assessment of the situation is a realistic one and will meet with general approval, rather than taxing other people who would have to pay one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going through the Minister's statement, we see there are some items which will be met by taxation&mdash;borne by the Exchequer&mdash;the provision of financial assistance to unemployed workers who must leave their homes early in order to secure employment. <Col N="1650" /> This is a step forward.  In the past all too many people had to leave one area and go to another without any assistance from anyone.  We have in this Bill the necessary means of assisting people who have to travel.  The resettlement scheme will provide for payments to meet part of the cost of household removal, travel allowance, lodging allowance and part of the legal cost involved in selling a home in the area in which a worker resided to buy another.</P>
    <P>These are very substantial assets to any worker and probably something which the Labour Party&mdash;or Fine Gael Party for that matter&mdash;never believed possible from any Government.  It surpasses their understanding that the workers could get this type of treatment. Deputy O'Leary did not mention those points.  He spoke about cheese-paring. This cheeseparing reminds me of a fellow setting a mousetrap and trying to decide how much cheese to use.  Well, the mice have all gone; Deputy O'Leary had trapped them already.</P>
    <P>We have here in realistic terms our assessment of the situation as a step on this road to progress so that the worker can exist in comfort, in understanding, and will have such a sense of security in the future that when the time does come when he is redundant, he will have a scheme to meet this travel allowance, lodging allowance or even legal costs involved in buying or selling a house.  These are very substantial advances and the Minister is to be congratulated on them.</P>
    <P>There are a few items in the Bill with which I am not terribly satisfied. The Minister refers to the lump sum payable by the employer direct to the worker.  The amount of the payment, he says, will be related to the worker's length of service with that employer and to his normal earnings prior to redundancy.  It may well happen&mdash;we have very cute employers in this country, as Deputy O'Leary pointed out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suppose it grieves members of the Labour Party that we have people here who give good and <Col N="1651" /> valuable employment.  It would seem to me that Deputy O'Leary is perturbed that we have people of this capacity in our ranks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. Under this Bill it will be no longer in the hands of trade union officials or others to see that their friends are retained and someone else goes.  That was the position in the past.  Many a man was pushed out the door because of a phone call between one office and another.  It will mean now that every worker, irrespective of who he is, will have some security if, through redundancy of one type or another, he finds himself without employment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the breaking of service, many employers have from time to time in the past in relation to holidays with pay deliberately broken the service of their employees in order to evade their responsibilities and this could very well happen under this section.  I would ask the Minister to see that the necessary safeguards are there so that there will not be any succession of breaks in a man's service in order to deprive him of this lump sum the employer may have to pay. One of the things I fear is that there are employers who would continually break a man's service.  The necessary safeguards will have to be there to ensure that workers are not victimised in this manner.  There may or may not be something in this but I would ask the Minister to keep it in mind.</P>
      <P>With regard to dismissal, the Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is immaterial whether the dismissal is due to a change in production methods, falling off in demand for products, complete closure of the firm or its transfer to another area. Dismissal due to misconduct or <Col N="1652" /> some other fault of the employee would not, of course, rank as redundancy. </P>
    <P>When it comes to paying out lump sums, I can well understand a lot of headhunting going on with some of the employers in this country.  They will look for some opportunity to dismiss a man on the ground of misconduct in order to evade their responsibility. I would ask the Minister to ensure that this matter is kept under review in order to prevent such action.  I know it has happened in the past.  Misconduct is the reason that has been given when there was no answer at all to trade union or other representations on behalf of an employee.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this head-hunting that does and has taken place will not take place in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister says:</P>
    <P>However, discharge due, say, to recession in business or to illness of the worker which proved to be only a temporary break and did not exceed 26 weeks in duration would not be regarded as breaking continuity. </P>
    <P>This seems to be a reasonable period but I would ask the Minister to take into consideration the case of men who are in employment for a number of years and because of TB are forced to take long-term hospital treatment.  I can readily see that some men due to the type of employment they are in are more likely to contract TB.  In regard to a temporary break of this nature where TB is the factor and where there is long-term hospitalisation, the Minister should take into consideration the question of reckoning this period as service because this is something over which the man has no control.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to know whether Deputy O'Leary wanted men to get a week's, a fortnight's or a month's notice or whether there should be no incentive at all in the Bill to ensure they get longer notice.  My only fear about this section is that an employer might give notice every week&mdash;whatever the period may be&mdash;until he intends to let them go.  He might start dishing notices out every week in order to ensure that he will get the 65 per cent and while the employee would get <Col N="1653" /> reasonable notice, in that case, there is many a crafty employer here who will examine this Bill in great detail and if he thinks he can get an extra percentage out of it, he will look for it.  I am sure there will be notices flying around like confetti at a wedding when some of the employers get their hands on this section.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to safeguard against that.  It is important that such a provision be used with discretion and to assist an employee rather than the other way around.  I can well visualise that some of the employers will read this in relation to themselves. I know it is the Minister's intention to safeguard the worker and that that is his trend of thought, but where there are loopholes, I would ask him to see that they are sealed off and that unscrupulous individuals will not be able to avail of them.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy mentioned that there were firms who have introduced schemes of one type or another and some of them have introduced redundancy schemes.  However, you will find that in the firms where redundancy schemes have been introduced, there will never be any redundancy.  This is one of the concessions that is held up to men which they can never obtain. You will find that in firms with redundancy schemes, redundancy is not in view at all.  This is something to attract a worker and when they get him, if he is not suitable he goes within the prescribed time, six or 12 months, but you will find that he will not qualify and that many a worker has been allowed to go who has not been able to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I regard some employers with the same suspicion as does Deputy O'Leary.  We have some very good employers, people who give thought and consideration to their workers, but on the other hand we have the other kind.  There are many schemes in operation that must be commended, schemes developed by employers who have the interests of the workers at heart and under which there are definite benefits for the worker which the worker can obtain.  They must be applauded and every assistance must <Col N="1654" /> be given to them to ensure that they can carry on with their development and make their businesses and industries more attractive to the better type of worker.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary covered so many points that it would take too long to deal with them.  I want to leave something for some of the other trade union members of the Party to answer. I am sure Deputy Moore will deal with some of the items I have not covered. As this debate is to be adjourned at 7 p.m., I want to give other members an opportunity of saying a few words this evening so that they will get their names in tomorrow's paper which seems to be the order of the day. Deputy O'Leary, when speaking, was not so interested in the provisions of the Bill as in flowery phrases and after everything he said, he looked up at the Press Gallery to see that it was being noted.  Those tactics can never last. People will find him out.  I am sure that if he got the report and read it in detail, he would see that a lot of the nonsense he dished out here for three-quarters of an hour would not impress many of the workers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Government once again on this measure which covers not alone redundancy but a variety of other matters.  Other measures have gone through quite recently in relation to the training and retraining of workers and now we have the measures here providing for, in addition to redundancy payments, movement from one town to another and the necessary aids that will be given.  This proves beyond doubt that we have the interests of the workers at heart now as we had in the past when we brought in various other measures. My only regret is that the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party did not think about redundancy when they were dispossessing so many engineering workers and skilled workers from satisfactory and sound employment in an industry which is due for considerable expansion.  We now have very many thousands employed in it as a result of the efforts of other Ministers for Industry and Commerce in successive Fianna Fáil Governments, and <Col N="1655" /> never again will there be redundancy in Aer Lingus or elsewhere.  The workers in those industries will not have to avail of the redundancy payments as envisaged in this Bill, and they will have sound and full employment for the remaining years of their working lives.</P>

      <P>I will give credit where credit is due.  Deputy Dowling has done his best here today.  It is comforting to know that he now believes that there should be an end to what he called colourful phrases, and that no more will television audiences hear such phrases as &ldquo;thousands who emigrated to die and lie in lonely graves in Pakistan&rdquo;.  I fear for the Deputy's reputation.  He may not go down in history if he so lightly abandons his facility for colourful phrases.</P>
      <P>I thought I understood the provisions of this Bill, and I believed that my understanding was the same as that of the Minister, but having listened to Deputy Dowling, I am more confused than ever, and I suspect that the Minister and his advisers feel the same.  The idea that this Bill could be used by unscrupulous employers to get 65 per cent of the redundancy grant paid to them <i>ad nauseam</i> by the dismissal of workmen seems to cause a certain amount of alarm to Deputy Dowling. Why anyone should do that and lose on the transaction is beyond the understanding of reasonable people.</P>
      <P>I must say I was also glad to hear Deputy Dowling say that he was a worker because he has now announced himself to the people of Dublin as a non-worker.  I was looking at his nomination papers in connection with the forthcoming local elections and in the &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; column, he does not call himself a worker; he calls himself a P.C.</P>

He said that everything was in perfect order because of what was done under Fianna Fáil Governments.  The strange thing is that the redundancy in CIE to which he referred has nearly closed our oldest engineering works.  This was the redundancy which was brought into operation in the Inchicore Engineering Works when CIE declared several craftsmen redundant and said their skills were not required.  Several men were retired before they reached the age limit.  Now those works are in danger of closing because they have not got the craftsmen they declared redundant.  These men will not come back into the employment of CIE no matter what CIE offer them.  They advertised in the newspapers and when that was unsuccessful they advertised in their buses and trains trying to entice those men to come back, but they have not come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are most anxious to have a proper redundancy scheme with safeguards so that the fund which will be created by the workers and the employers will not suffer at the hands of the clumsy managers of State-sponsored companies like CIE, or at the hands of any clumsy managers who make mistakes in their decisions and declare people redundant and a few years later there is a danger of the whole labour force being thrown out of work because of the mistakes the managers made.  It seems only proper that if wrong decisions are taken the redundancy fund should be compensated by those people in respect of the mistakes made by them.  We are all too well aware that when mistakes <Col N="1657" /> are made by State-sponsored bodies it is the taxpayer who has to pay for those mistakes.  It might assist management generally in making right decisions if they undertook that they would not get a contribution from the redundancy fund in respect of wrong decisions, or that if subsequent events proved them to be wrong in a declaration of redundancy they would be required to refund to the redundancy fund the money which had already been paid out of the fund.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister in a typically modest way made no claim to the vice of extravagance of which Deputy Dowling said he was guilty although he seemed to regard it as a virtue.  He said the Minister was almost too extravagant in this measure.  Of course, no cost is involved to the State, none whatsoever.  The Minister went out of his way to justify as best he could why the State makes no contribution to the redundancy payments.  We in Fine Gael consider that he has failed completely to justify it.  Worse than that, in section 55 of the Bill we find that the State takes care to provide that not only will it not contribute to the fund but it will also take from the fund any cost, good, bad or indifferent borne by the State in relation to labour matters.  In the Department of Labour at the moment there are and in the Department of Industry and Commerce for years there have been sections dealing with labour matters in one way or another.  In the past the State has carried a certain proportion of the cost of the administration of those offices; in the future the redundancy fund is to be raided to make these payments.  The Minister may shake his head if he wishes to but section 55 (2) provides:</P>
    <P>There shall be paid to the Minister for Finance out of the Redundancy Fund, at such times and in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct, such sums as the Minister may estimate, on such basis as may be agreed upon between him and the Minister for Finance, to be the part of the said expenses of the Minister or any other Minister and any sums so paid shall be appropriated in aid of <Col N="1658" /> moneys provided by the Oireachtas for carrying this Act into effect. </P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware and the Minister is aware that there are in the Department of Labour now, and there have been in the Department of Industry and Commerce for years, men who were concerned with the redundancy of workers.  Some of those people will be transferred, as it were, to this new office, to this new Parkinsonian cell to operate this Act.  At the moment their salaries and pensions, all their benefits and emoluments, are paid out of the Exchequer.  In future, every thought they think, every word they write, every breath they breathe during official time will be paid out of the redundancy fund.  Not only is that cost to be imposed but in estimating expenses for the purposes of subsection (3), there is being included such amount as, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, represents the amount of the accruing liability in respect of any superannuation or other retiring allowances, lump sums or gratuities accruing in respect of the employment of any officer or other person for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>So their salaries and lump sums, their gratuities and emoluments and superannuation will be paid out of a fund which will be created not out of any funds of the State but out of contributions of workers and employers at an annual rate of about £3 per head. Therefore, the extravagance of which Deputy Dowling spoke evaporates in a bottle of smoke when we find that the State will levy the redundancy fund in future.  I do not think it would be too much to ask the State, at the very least, to administer this fund.  It is the least the State can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are quite adamant in asserting that the State should make a contribution to the redundancy fund of at least one-third of what is needed to provide a proper scheme.  There are two reasons for that.  One is that it has been the practice over the years for <Col N="1659" /> the State to pay in relation to social welfare and other similar payments roughly one-third the cost of financing such schemes.  But in relation to this redundancy scheme for which provision is now being made, the redundancy which is contemplated in the future will arise out of deliberate State decisions in the main, not out of individual inefficiencies.  We have had those in the past and we have not had redundancy schemes for them.  If we were not at the moment contemplating redundancy of far greater proportions, we would not be changing the arrangements and making these new provisions. It is because we all acknowledge the colossal problems which will be foisted on us by new trading arrangements, new agricultural and industrial arrangements, that we expect there will be substantial redundancy and that some kind of compensation, some kind of protection must be given to the people who will suffer during this time of very great change.</P>
    <P>We all hope that, because we have no option in the matter, it will be a change for the better; but even if it is a change for the better, there will be a temporary period of hardship and the purpose of this scheme is to provide the necessary lifeline for men between the period of their unemployment and the period of new employment after they have been retrained.</P>
    <P>We must always remember that this is coming about as a result of a deliberate decision on the part of the Government.  This is State policy.  It is the policy to go into the Common Market.  The decision was taken to enter into a new free trading agreement with Britain which has had some effect and will have greater effect on Irish industry in the future, with consequent serious unemployment.  If the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; smacks of the hard times of the 1930s, they can use the currently acknowledged word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo;. If ever there was an obligation on the State to provide money to assist unemployed people, it arises here because it is as a result of deliberate State action that this problem is arising.</P>
    <P>The State says: &ldquo;We made the <Col N="1660" /> decision to go into the Common Market, into a free trade arrangement with Britain, and we tell you as we have been telling you during the past five years that the result of our decision will be redundancy and unemployment for Irish workers but we will not pay for it; you will pay for it&mdash;you whose lives and fortunes we are affecting will pay for your protection and safeguards.  We, the State, who are making the decision to make or break you, will not do anything to protect you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is what the Government are saying here.  It is entirely wrong and it must be rejected as such by anyone who has any conception of the obligations of the State to the community. The whole purpose of the State is to make life possible and bearable for the largest number of people, to allow people to make the most of the short period they are given in this valley of tears.  If the purpose of the State is to create hardship and unemployment and at the same time wash its hands, Pontius Pilate like, and say: &ldquo;You pay for it&rdquo;, we think that is a most unjust conception of Government, far removed from the just society to which we in Fine Gael are so vitally pledged. That is why we find the basic approach in this Bill to be so completely and utterly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>We have been preaching for years that there was vital need to have an adequate redundancy scheme.  That situation existed in the past.  Deputy Dowling facetiously tried to make play of the fact that it was not done ten years ago.  There is no point in 1967 in facetiously criticising our antecedents. We are here, sent by the Lord, to do our duty now, and now is what matters. It is not what any Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or any Labour Government did in the past that matters, that is of concern to the man who will be unemployed in the future.  What matters is that we should all bear a share in decisions taken, and where a decision is taken by a Government the Government must take a financial share in providing redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>We have been advocating during the years that we should have wage related insurance.  This is something which is <Col N="1661" /> long overdue.  It is because of acceptance of the Fine Gael view on this that we now have the Minister, through this Bill, indicating that the benefits will be related to the wages received. This is the right approach.  It is the correct thing to do because it is the just thing to do, the proper thing to do, so as to make hardship, to make unemployment easier to bear, to let it have some relationship to what the person affected was earning.  The acceptance of this principle has been difficult for some people but now the gimmick with which to sell everything is to say: &ldquo;This is being done in Europe&rdquo;.  Like something with threepence off, this is the thing which makes people grab it off the shelf. This has been done in Europe for decades past.  They have had wage related insurance.  We are quite confident that everybody in this country, be he employee or employer, is prepared to have an adequate wage related insurance scheme and we hope the Government will take the necessary action to bring it into operation.</P>
    <P>I am only too glad to support what Deputy Jones said in relation to the use of social welfare appeals machinery for the purposes of determining differences of opinion or difficulties which may arise under this Bill.  As he so clearly pointed out, the present machinery in the Department of Social Welfare, to put it mildly. is not working efficiently and untold hardship is caused to people who are deprived of benefits of one kind or another while awaiting determination of their appeals. As Deputy Jones said, we saw in the past few days a statement from the social welfare officers organisation complaining of the invidious position into which these very capable officers are being put in endeavouring to interpret the law as it is stated to them.  Not only are these honourable men put in an invidious position, but I think also the Members of the Legislature of this State are put in an invidious position, because most of the laws and regulations they have to interpret and apply are not made in this House and are not made upstairs either but are made by the Minister and his advisers in the most incomprehensible language.  We who <Col N="1662" /> are, relatively speaking, experts and masters of the intricacies of regulations and statutory instruments frequently find these things incomprehensible. The general public&mdash;the people who are intended to benefit by them&mdash; certainly find them far beyond them.</P>
    <P>The safeguard provided of allowing a final appeal from a decision of an appeals officer on a point of law to the High Court is entirely valueless.  This is not the time to advocate, nor am I going to advocate in this debate, Sir, free legal aid.  But of what use is the right to go to the High Court for a man who is unemployed, who is denied his redundancy payments, who is on his uppers, who is receiving perhaps in unemployment benefit a sum equal to 20 per cent or 25 per cent of what he was getting when he was earning? Such a man cannot avail of the notional right to go to the High Court on a point of law.  The right in the Bill may appear to be the proper thing to do&mdash;and in theory it most certainly is&mdash;but, without making money available to people so that they can avail of this machinery, what you are doing is conferring on them an non-exercisable right.</P>
    <P>Suppose the worker does come to exercise this right, what will his position be?  We have a perfect example of it in relation to insurance agents, who under the holiday Acts have been claiming they are entitled to annual holidays.  Their claim has been denied and rejected by their employers, the insurance companies.  They have appealed for several years past to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Labour is aware of this because I am sure he had the matter on his desk on innumerable occasions.  They were unsuccessful in getting a decision in their favour and were told they had better take the matter elsewhere.  Simply because there is a large number of them and they had the means, they brought the matter to court.  Again, as the Minister for Labour knows, it was some 18 months or so before the matter was lodged in court.  Finally, it reached the court within the last fortnight.  The learned judge had learned arguments from both <Col N="1663" /> sides as to what was and was not a contract for service or a contract of service, and he reserved his judgment. I was glad to see the Minister endorsed my disappointment that the matter had taken so long.  But that is just one of the things that can emerge under this Bill.  Can you imagine any poor unfortunate man, having run out of his period of unemployment benefit, trying to survive on unemployment assistance and home assistance, availing of this mighty, magnificent generosity we confer on him in this Bill to take his little problem to the High Court on a point of law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think we should not put it in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  All I am saying is that it is no use doing it unless we also provide the means to exercise the right. If the Minister for Finance can make his estimate of what he ought to be able to get as a rake-off from the redundancy fund to pay for the several people operating the Parkinsonian cell, I think it is proper that some group of advisers or adjudicators should consider whether or not a complainant has a reasonable case to take to the High Court.  If such advisers or adjudicators felt there was a good reason to bring the matter to be decided to the High Court, I think it proper that the redundancy fund would provide the means necessary to float the litigation that would be necessary.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister sees my point and is not unsympathetic.  I can certainly see the horror on the faces of some people in this country if we were ever to start such a system.  I assert again there is no use in conferring a right unless you give the person the means to exercise it.  It is valueless and all you are doing is pretending you are conferring freedom. You are not conferring freedom if you do not give the person the means of exercising the right in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other matters, which perhaps would be more relevant on Committee Stage, but I mention them now because the Minister might be good enough to give us some guidance on them.  The Minister proposes to <Col N="1664" /> provide for a qualifying period of service for redundancy payment of four years with the same employer.  The Minister said there would be differences of opinion as to what should or should not be a proper qualifying period. Quite frankly, I think the qualifying period of four years with the same employer is not good enough.  There are many people whose periods of employment with individual employers are much less than four years.  The Minister mentions in his opening statement building workers and dock workers as a class apart who have peculiar individual problems which might best be dealt with by a separate scheme outside the general scheme provided for in this Bill.  But there are other people who, like building workers and dock workers, have short, intermittent terms of employment with an employer but who may spend a lifetime going from one employer to the other, working for three months, six months, two years or three years.  It seems utterly unfair, if the State takes a decision to enter the Common Market or any other trading arrangement which causes substantial redundancy in their particular activity, that these people should not get benefit from the redundancy scheme proposed. It is terribly important that they would.</P>
    <P>Again, there will certainly be cases in which people will change their employment. Take a young man who enters the employment of one firm.  He may stay there for three years.  Then, to better himself in order to get promotion, he may change from the firm in which he started off to a second firm. He may stay there for another three, four, six or seven years and then, in order to get further promotion, transfer to yet a third employer.  During all this period such a worker might well be at a certain kind of activity, following the one vocation, doing the same type of job, but acquiring extra skill and additional responsibility.  If he is unlucky enough to be with the third employer who has cause to declare redundancy, he is not going to get any benefit under this scheme, although from the day he began work he would have been contributing towards the redundancy fund.  His first employer, second employer and third employer <Col N="1665" /> would also have been contributing towards the redundancy fund but if he were unlucky enough to have been with the third employer only three years, 11 months and 29 days he might find himself utterly and completely disqualified.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that hard cases make bad law and that these will be rather rare cases.  I do not think they will be all that rare.  It is not an infrequent occurrence for people to change their employment to better themselves and it is terribly important, if we are going to have redundancy schemes, that we dovetail them in such a way that one employment will dovetail into the other so that the benefits will be transferred from one employment to the other.  Particularly should this be so where a person is enticed from one employment to go to the employment of another.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers of the particular scheme which the Minister has is that it will discourage people from showing initiative and enterprise to a degree which would cause them to change from one employment to another.  The danger is that people, in order to avoid being caught by this four-year rule, may stay in a rut in a particular firm, may fail to improve themselves, may fail to avail of opportunities which are opening to them in other companies and with other employers.  It is vital, therefore, that the Minister would take the steps necessary before this Bill becomes law to ensure that such people are adequately protected and that this rule of four years with the same employer will be modified in some way or another.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that this certainly cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as a Money Bill and while I do not intend to anticipate what you may or may not do, this does appear to be a Bill on which we can put down any amendments we like because it is not going to cost the State one penny or one farthing.  If we decided to quadruple the redundancy payments and if we decided to give redundancy payment to a man who was working for only one week, our amendments could not be ruled out of order.  The Minister can expect that he will get a generous number of amendments before this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for assuming that I would do only that which was reasonable. He is quite right in that.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the Bill and, I think, a fair one, that if a person unreasonably refuses alternative employment the redundancy payments may be withheld but it is terribly important that that provision be very fairly interpreted and that all relevant factors, including the schooling of children, location of employment, and so on, be taken into account and that these things be regarded as being reasonable.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Dowling, one would think that he was not a member of Dublin Corporation.  He showed an appalling ignorance of housing matters.  He referred to the liberal provision of compensation in this Bill so as to provide a person with the money to pay somebody to move the furniture by lorry from one place and to set up home elsewhere.  There is no provision in this Bill to get over the various residential qualifications which apply. A man may well be down the country in a house at 7/6d a week and be declared redundant and be given under the Bill, not by the Minister but by the redundancy fund, sufficient to move his furniture from Ballydehob to Dublin but he will not get a home for love or money in Dublin, certainly not from the local authority until he is four years in residence and that residence may well be a caravan.  I am certain there is no provision at all in this Bill to provide for that kind of certain eventuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> We have had this very frequently in relation to CIE men where railway lines were closed down.  Men who lived in a cottage at a nominal rent of 1/ - or 2/ - a week, surrounded by an acre or half-acre of land on which they could cultivate vegetables, found themselves hooshed up to Dublin where there was a nominal increase in their wage and having to occupy a flat at £3 or £4 a week for at least three years and, if necessary, breed like rabbits in the meantime in order to have the necessary number of children to qualify under the overcrowding rules of Dublin Corporation.  Some people think it is not nice to mention these problems.  There is no point in drafting fancy theory in legislation.  It is the acute problems which will face thousands of people when redundancy becomes a horror in this country that we need to tackle.  We do not think they are being tackled in this Bill.</P>
    <P>At present there is some cause for concern amongst workers that they are being laid off or they are under threat of being laid off and as we are discussing this and as this legislation has now become public knowledge there are clear indications that some employers are jumping the gun or are considering jumping the gun.  It is terribly important that the Minister would ensure that the benefits of this legislation would be made retrospective because that is the only way in which we can protect people who may be declared redundant before this Bill becomes law.  There is plenty of precedent for it.  There are cases under various types of legislation where a section is put into the Bill that it will be operative from a date prior to the passing of the Act.  If, say, for the last year or two people have been declared redundant because of changing market situations, particularly situations which have arisen since the talk of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain and of the Common Market, it is terribly important that we would provide adequate protection for such people.  I would like the Minister to answer that particular problem because I am sure he must be acutely aware of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> Apart from that kind of thing of declaring people redundant there are cases of people who have had long service who have been put or who are about to be put on short time.  It may well be that this is also being used by people as an escape hatch, that they may be able to point to the fact that people were on short time prior to the passing of the Act and if they are declared redundant ultimately that this is only a deterioration in their situation but not a new situation.  I would like the Minister to give us some encouragement here and to give the workers affected some confidence that their position will not be worsened and that that will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The Minister says also that redundancy payments will be available to people if they are on short time for excessive periods.  I do not think he has given us any indication in the Bill or in his opening statement as to what he considers to be an excessive period and I would ask the Minister to clarify this. While we acknowledge that it is not an easy thing to state what may be put into regulations later on it would be helpful to members of the Dáil and Seanad if Ministers would indicate in whatever detail is possible to them at the time something which would give us a lead on what they have in mind. We should certainly like to know what he has in mind when he uses the phrase &ldquo;excessive periods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We notice also that the Minister does not propose to have the weekly payments made out until four weeks after the unemployment begins.  I think this is a wrong thing to do.  The argument, I suppose, is that the worker will receive a lump sum payment at the time of dismissal and that this ought to last him out for the following four weeks.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £40,037,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1968, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid. </P>
      <P>The total net Estimate for 1967-68 of £40,037,000 shows an increase of £4,728,000 on the original Estimate for 1966-67 which was £35,309,000.  The final total Estimate for 1966-67, including the Supplementary Estimate, amounted to £38,476,000.</P>
      <P>As compared with the amounts voted in 1966-67, the extra money which I am now asking the House to vote this year is accounted for mainly by increases in the following subheads: N.1&mdash;Marketing of Dairy Produce; K.14&mdash;Brucellosis Eradication Scheme; K.9&mdash;Lime and Fertiliser Subsidies; K.7&mdash;Farm Buildings Scheme and Water Supplies; K.8&mdash;Land Project; K.24&mdash;Grants for the Glasshouse Industry and I.5&mdash;Grant-in-Aid to An Foras Talúntais.  Reduced expenditure is foreseen this year on the Calved Heifer Scheme and on the support of pigmeat exports and this is reflected in the provisions shown for subheads K.15 and K.19 respectively.</P>
      <P>Notes on the main activities of my Department have been circulated to Deputies; I trust these will be of help to them in the debate on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing in detail with the <Col N="1670" /> main provisions of the Estimate, I would like to comment generally on the state of agriculture and on recent developments in the industry.</P>
    <P>Gross agricultural output in 1966, including the value of livestock changes, was slightly below the level of the preceding year in volume and £5 million lower in value.  This decrease was due mainly to two factors.  First, the very unfavourable weather throughout the Spring hampered the sowing of crops, affected milk production temporarily and resulted in cattle not reaching marketable condition as early as usual&mdash;a position aggravated not only by the bank strike and the credit squeeze but also by the shipping strike. Secondly, during the second half of the year, difficulties in export markets, arising from circumstances over which we had no control, led to a fall in the price of cattle and since cattle are the major item in agricultural output, this resulted in the value of gross output being substantially lower than had been expected.  Crops, however, benefited from the favourable weather during the growing and harvesting period and yields were higher.  With the upward trend in farming expenses continuing, the net result was that total family farm income fell by about £6 million or by about 4½ per cent.  The figures take account of the value of changes in livestock on farms as between the two years; actual cash income received by farmers during 1966 was considerably higher than in 1965.</P>
    <P>The outturn would have been more serious had it not been for the special measures introduced by the Government during the year, namely, an increase of 2d a gallon in the price of milk from the end of May, 1966, the extension of guarantee payments to exports of beef and lamb to the UK in excess of the quantities covered by the Free Trade Area Agreement, the scheme of temporary headage payments for fat cattle exported to Britain last autumn, the introduction of the farrowed sow scheme and the mountain sheep subsidy schemes as well as special credit schemes.</P>
    <P>During the year there has been a lot of misleading talk about agriculture <Col N="1671" /> and particularly agricultural prices being in a depressed state.  I freely acknowledge that agriculture did not make the progress which we all would like but the facts belie the suggestion that agricultural prices generally were depressed.  In fact, increased prices operated for milk, wheat, sugar beet and pigs and the general level of agricultural prices, as shown by the agricultural price index, was only slightly below that of 1965.  When it is remembered that the agricultural price index which had hardly moved at all between 1953 and 1963, rose by 11 per cent in 1964 and by a further four per cent in 1965, it will be realised that it is an exaggeration to talk of agricultural prices being depressed.  Indeed, had it not been for the drop in cattle prices in 1966 from the high level of 1965 the index would have been above the 1965 level.  Despite the fall in cattle prices on export markets, it is gratifying to note that the total value of agricultural exports continued to increase reaching the record level of £123 million or seven per cent more than in 1965.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, it is always hazardous to attempt to predict what the future will bring&mdash;even in the short-term&mdash;but the present indications are that 1967 should be a considerably better year for farming.  The weather so far has been relatively good and so has the market situation for cattle. While the January 1967 livestock returns suggest that the growth in cattle stocks which was such a marked feature of recent years has lost some of its momentum, I am confident that, with the substantial and indeed, increased inducements available to farmers, cattle output will continue its upward trend.</P>
    <P>The prospects for milk production are very good and while we, like some other countries, have not yet recovered from the cyclical decline in pig numbers, I am hopeful that, with the extension of the period of operation of the farrowed sow scheme and the recent increase in the guaranteed price for pigs, it will not be long before our pig numbers show an increase.  The January 1967 livestock enumeration showed gilts in pig to be about 20 per <Col N="1672" /> cent higher than in January, 1966.  The indications are that the decline in tillage which has been a feature of recent years has been arrested and that we will have increased acreages particularly of wheat and beet this year. If, therefore, we get reasonable weather during the rest of the year the prospects are that farmers will have a good year financially and they should more than recover the ground lost in 1966.</P>
    <P>The extra provisions made in this year's Budget to assist farmers clearly demonstrate the Government's concern to increase agricultural output and income and to supplement the earnings of low-income farmers.  The increase in the price of milk will benefit a large proportion of farmers and will contribute to expansion of the cattle industry.  The new scheme of grants for milk coolers is designed to enable many smaller farmers to qualify for the creamery milk quality bonus.  The increase in the guaranteed price for pigs will encourage producers to plan with more confidence for increased production and should again be of special benefit to the smaller farmer. The complete derating of agricultural holdings of £20 land valuation or less will benefit a vast number of farmers in the category most in need of State help and puts the question of rates on smaller holdings outside the realm of controversy.  The decision to introduce an incentive bonus scheme for small farmers arising out of the recommendations of the Two-Tier Milk Price Committee also breaks new ground inasmuch as it will be designed to provide special direct assistance to farmers who increase their scale of production on a planned efficient basis.</P>
    <P>The progressive expansion of Government assistance for agriculture is evidenced by the growing amount coming under the heading &ldquo;State expenditure in relation to agriculture&rdquo;.  The figure as published in the Budget tables this year was £60 million.  Including the extra assistance provided in the Budget, the actual figure for 1967-68 is now estimated to be more than £64 million.  Even if we go back no further than 1960-61, we can see how sharply this expenditure has risen.  In that year, the figure was £26 million which in <Col N="1673" /> turn was far above the figure for 1956-57 at £17 million.  In view of the rapid rise in State expenditure connected with agriculture I thought it well to have an examination made of the various forms which State assistance to agriculture takes, especially our price support and productivity schemes, with the object of ensuring that we are getting the best value for money and that in particular an equitable proportion goes to the smaller farmers.  This examination is proceeding.</P>
    <P>In mentioning these figures for State aids, it is not my wish to suggest that the amount now being provided is not fully justified on economic as well as social grounds but, as efforts are made from time to time to belittle the Government's assistance to agriculture, I feel it is necessary to put things in their proper perspective.  Total State expenditure on agriculture now accounts for nearly 20 per cent of total Exchequer spending.  In considering this figure, however, one must constantly bear in mind the importance of agriculture in the Irish economy.  It accounts for one-fifth of the national income, provides employment for some 30 per cent of the total labour force and contributes some 55 per cent of our total exports.</P>
    <P>But the real significance of agriculture in our economy cannot be judged solely by looking at it in the narrow sense of what is directly produced from the soil by way of crops and livestock.  One must also have regard to the vast complex of industries and services which are so dependent on agriculture; for example, the food processing industries, the agricultural machinery industry, the fertiliser industry and the transport of agricultural products.  One would need to add the output of these industries to that of agriculture to see the real significance of agriculture in the whole economy. The food processing industries alone which comprise mainly those industries engaged in the processing of meat, dairy products, fruit and vegetables, grain milling, bread and flour confectionery, are estimated to have accounted for over one-third of the gross output of all manufacturing <Col N="1674" /> industries and for nearly one quarter of the total employment in these industries.</P>
    <P>On the trade side if one included exports of certain goods whose raw materials are derived from agriculture, such as chocolate crumb, beer, and food confectionery to mention but a few, the percentage of the country's total exports attributable to agriculture would be up to 70 per cent.  I thought it necessary to make these few comments at the outset because one frequently hears quite a lot of misinformed comment about agricultural output.</P>
    <P>The reactivation of Ireland's application for membership of the European Economic Community is an event of some significance for our agricultural industry.  At this juncture it is not possible, of course, to say what will be the outcome of the applications by us and the other applicant countries but any prospect of participation in the Community's agricultural arrangements must be welcomed by us.  Pending Ireland's entry into the EEC we must so plan the organisation and future development of the agricultural industry that, when we do enter, Irish agriculture will be as well prepared as is possible to meet the conditions that will be encountered within the Community.</P>
    <P>While membership of the EEC would benefit the more important branches of Irish agriculture, it will not of itself provide an automatic remedy for all the problems with which our agriculture has been faced in the past.  The EEC market is highly competitive and only the progressive farmer who is geared to the highest level of efficiency and ready to satisfy the exacting standards of that market will reap the full benefits of membership. I am confident, however, that, given the opportunity, our farmers generally will be able to measure up to what is required and to adjust themselves to the changes in farming patterns which will inevitably follow on our entry.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EEC will likewise call for the highest levels of efficiency in our processing and marketing <Col N="1675" /> arrangements.  Full use must be made of the time available before entry into the Community to carry out any necessary re-organisation or improvements in order to raise efficiency, increase our competitiveness and generally strengthen our export trading.  In this connection the establishment of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area last year has served a dual purpose by providing us with guaranteed and improved access to our main market for agricultural, horticultural and fishery products, while at the same time strengthening our main export industry and thereby putting us in a better position to meet EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the National Agricultural Council recently decided that a detailed study should be undertaken of the implications for Irish agriculture of membership of the EEC.  A special study group has been set up for this purpose in my Department and it is the intention to associate recognised outside experts with the group's work.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy Round of Trade negotiations in the GATT is now drawing to a conclusion.  It had been hoped that these negotiations, in which Ireland is participating as an applicant for accession to GATT, would have had some positive effects in a general liberalising of world trade in agricultural products.  Unfortunately, this has not been the case.  The Kennedy Round has produced no significant results in regard to international trade in meat and dairy products, which are our main agricultural interests and indeed it is doubtful if the final outcome of the negotiations will involve any appreciable benefit for Ireland in the agricultural sector.  Therefore, until such time as we secure access to the agricultural arrangements of the EEC, it looks as if our agricultural exports will continue to be faced with the numerous and varied restrictions which the main importing countries for one reason or another maintain against imports of temperate agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The virtual closing of the EEC markets to imports of cattle and beef, which had such serious effects on the cattle trade in the second half of 1966, is still a matter of serious concern to <Col N="1676" /> us.  A full levy of about £30 per beast at present applies to imports into our main EEC market, Germany, and this with the import duty of 16 per cent makes trade completely uneconomic. So far as the EEC is concerned, therefore, it is not possible to be optimistic about the prospects for exports of cattle and beef this year.  The guide prices for home-produced cattle in the Member States was raised last month and this means that import levies come into operation at higher levels of domestic prices than was the case previously.  Because of these high protective levies we cannot hope to have a steady and remunerative cattle and beef trade with the EEC until we ourselves enter the Community.  At present steps are being taken by the Community in the context of the Kennedy Round to facilitate imports of cows for processing and frozen beef but these are not likely to help us in this country and we have made our views on this known to the EEC Commission and to each of the Member States.</P>
    <P>The sluggish demand from Britain for Irish stores was another major factor in the difficult cattle situation last year.  I am glad to say that the store demand has improved considerably and that store exports so far this year are well above those in the early part of last year.  Indeed, the increase in store exports has more than compensated for the decline in exports of fat cattle to the Continent.  Exports of carcase beef, too, are substantially higher than in the early part of 1966. Up to 30th April a total of 104,000 fat bullocks and heifers had been slaughtered at meat factories this year as compared with 40,000 in the corresponding period in 1966.</P>
    <P>A very welcome development during 1966 was the revival in our exports of manufacturing-type beef to the United States which provides such a valuable outlet for the cull cows from the dairy herd.  Exports to the US during 1964 and 1965 had declined largely because of a temporary falling-off in the availability of cows for slaughter here and to some extent because of the existence at that time of more remunerative markets in Europe.  The quantity exported in 1965 was only 4,000 tons <Col N="1677" /> but in 1966 exports reached 18,000 tons and it is confidently expected that the trade will develop still further during 1967.  We estimate that exports this year will reach 30,000 tons which would approach the level of the previous record high exports in the 1961-1963 period.  From January to May, 1967, we have already exported almost 14,000 tons as compared with 3,700 tons in the same five months of 1966.</P>
    <P>During the past year, considerable efforts have been made to develop new markets for cattle.  About 10,000 young feeder cattle were sent to Egypt but this trade has been dormant for some time now.  About 4,000 young feeder cattle were exported to Italy from December onwards and my Department is at present actively exploring with exporters here and with Italian importers the prospects for continuing this trade.</P>
    <P>I have already taken the opportunity of suggesting to producers and traders that they should take advantage, so far as this is practicable, of the seasonally better prices obtaining in the first part of the year and should try to distribute marketings more evenly through the year.  The over-loading of the market in the months of September to November when price conditions both here and in Britain tend to be weakest is in nobody's interest.</P>
    <P>I have been keeping in close contact with the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about the cattle and beef market situation.  In view of the importance to both countries of the Irish exports of cattle and beef it is essential that such contact should be maintained and that any possibilities of fostering and developing agricultural trade in the interests of the two countries should be fully explored. Arising out of my recent discussions with Mr. Peart, Irish and British officials met in Dublin last week to examine the possibilities for further measures to introduce more stability into the trade.  A further meeting of officials is taking place in London this week.  At this juncture, I do not wish to speculate as to the eventual outcome of my discussions with Mr. Peart.</P>
    <P>I have been considering various aspects of the marketing of agricultural <Col N="1678" /> produce and, as already announced, I propose to introduce at an early date a marketing bill which will provide for the licensing of livestock marts.  I believe the time has come when such legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>On the whole, our cattle industry is in a very healthy state with more stock on farms than ever before.  Cow numbers, after spectacular increases in 1964, 1965 and 1966, now show some evidence of levelling off.  Against this background I have discussed the operation of the Calved Heifer Scheme with the National Agricultural Council. The council recommended that it should be continued, but that, if possible, the administration of the scheme should be tightened up to discourage the &ldquo;in and out&rdquo; people.  The council also recommended that the Department should consider how best the scheme might be operated to maintain livestock quality.  The scheme will be revised to take account of these recommendations.  Despite the various criticisms made against it, there is no doubt that the scheme was largely responsible for the remarkable increase in the country's cow numbers and can be regarded as a very considerable success.</P>
    <P>During 1966, the number of cows artificially inseminated was 930,000, representing about 60 per cent of the cows of the country as compared with 700,000 in 1963.  While Friesian inseminations accounted for 55 per cent of all inseminations in 1965 they only accounted for 42.5 per cent of all inseminations in 1966 although the Friesian remained the most popular individual breed.  This swing from Friesians went almost entirely to Herefords, which increased from 196,000 inseminations in 1965, 21.4 per cent of total, to 309,000 in 1966, 33.2 per cent of total.  The position of the other breeds was largely unchanged but it is worthy of note that interest in the Charolais breed is increasing.</P>
    <P>Reference to cattle breeding policy raises the question of progeny testing. I am convinced of the necessity of expanding the system of progeny testing to enable our breeding stocks to be quickly and accurately evaluated on <Col N="1679" /> a national scale.  I am having this whole question examined and will have it discussed in the National Agricultural Council following which I hope to be in a position to put forward a scheme, which will be to the benefit of the industry and acceptable to all the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>It has for many years been the policy of my Department to improve our native herds by the importation of selected breeding stocks and strains.  In recent years, the popularity of the Aberdeen Angus breed, which enjoyed an important place in the cattle economy of the country particularly in the west and north-west, has waned on grounds of size, scope and growth.  Last year, officers of my Department went to the USA where they saw strains of Angus which they considered could substantially improve our native stocks. Following this visit, arrangements have been made, in conjunction with private breeders and AI stations, to import a number of Angus animals including four or five bulls from the USA.  These animals will arrive next month and will be placed in quarantine in Spike Island where exhaustive veterinary tests will be carried out before they are released. They have, of course, already been subjected to stringent veterinary tests in the US.  This import has also raised questions of Herd Book registration and an Irish Angus Herd Book has been opened.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the problem of scrub bulls and I have initiated moves for an intensive combout of such bulls.  I am sure that all who are genuinely interested in the welfare of our cattle industry agree with me in this matter and I would ask for their fullest co-operation in helping to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The provision in Subhead N1 for price support for milk through the medium of the grant to An Bord Bainne for export support and direct payments to creameries in respect of the milk price and quality milk allowances shows a substantial increase over last year.  The total provision, including some minor items, amounts to £15,400,000, an increase of £2¾ million on last year's original estimate and of <Col N="1680" /> £1½ million on last year's final provision.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on the milk price allowance has been calculated at the rate of 6d per gallon but, as Deputies are aware, this allowance was increased by 1d per gallon from 1st May, 1967. This increase will represent a further £1.6 million for the part of the financial year from 1st May and provision for this will have to be made in a Supplementary Estimate in due course.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the Exchequer assistance to milk this year will accordingly be about £17 million, or about 9d per gallon.  This very large sum shows in the clearest possible fashion the importance which the Government attach to the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>Total milk deliveries to creameries in 1966 amounted to 411 million gallons as compared with 392 million gallons in 1965.  So far this year deliveries have shown an increase of over 14 per cent on the level in the corresponding part of 1966.  It is expected that overall production in 1967 will be well above the 1966 level and will establish a further all-time record.</P>
    <P>The results of the Creamery Milk Quality Grading Scheme indicate that 48 per cent of the milk qualified for the special allowance during the past year as against 42 per cent for the previous year.  The results are very encouraging and it is expected that about 55 per cent of the milk delivered to creameries will reach the requisite standard in the current year.  The increase in the quality allowance from 1d to 2d per gallon which took place on 1st April makes it well worth while for every milk producer to make a special effort to qualify for the allowance.  In order to assist the small producers, I have introduced a scheme of grants for the provision of milk coolers on small farms for which a sum of £100,000 was set aside in the Budget.</P>
    <P>In July last, my Department introduced a Cheese Grading Scheme and I am very happy to say that the scheme has proved eminently successful. The improved quality of Irish cheese has attracted considerable trade interest in Britain and has resulted in <Col N="1681" /> improved prices, thereby reducing the cost of the export subsidy on the product.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the study group appointed to consider all aspects of a two-tier system of payment for milk delivered to creameries has submitted a summary report.  The group concluded that a two-tier milk price system was not the way to improve the income of the small-scale dairy farmer but rather that a bonus incentive scheme should be introduced for all small farmers who are potentially viable to enable them to secure the optimum returns from the resources of land and labour available to them. The proposal is that a grant of £50 would be paid in each of any four years in a six-year period to those who, with the assistance of their advisory officers, aim at increasing output levels to be decided in the case of each type of farming system.  For instance, 7,000 gallons of quality milk would be the aim in the case of dairy farmers and comparable production criteria would be used in the case of other farming systems including mixed systems.  My Department is making a detailed study of the group's proposals including the question of comparable production criteria for application to the various farming systems and the matter is also to be examined by the National Agricultural Council. It will be recalled that an initial sum of £250,000 was provided for this scheme in the recent Budget.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, the Government decided that the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society should be given the task of encouraging re-organisation of the dairying industry. A plan illustrative of a possible form of re-organisation of the industry was prepared by the society and circulated in February, 1966, for consideration by the creamery societies.  The IAOS plan greatly stimulated interest in the subject of re-organisation and there now seems to be a growing acceptance of the desirability of rationalisation of the creamery industry. At its recent meeting the National Agricultural Council considered this matter and decided that it would be desirable to have a special <Col N="1682" /> study undertaken of the present position and recommendations made on the type of reorganisation best calculated to meet the needs of the future.  Preparations for a study on the lines suggested by the Council are now being made.</P>
    <P>The Mountain Sheep Subsidy Schemes, which were introduced last autumn and which for the first time gave direct financial assistance to mountain sheep farmers, evoked wide interest.  My Department received many suggestions on ways in which the schemes could be made even more effective.  The schemes were discussed by the National Agricultural Council in the light of the experience gained last year, and an amended scheme is now being drawn up, details of which will be announced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>During the year the reports of the Committee on Wool Marketing and of the Survey Team on Horse Breeding were published and the recommendations made have been considered by my Department.  Arising out of the recommendations of the Wool Committee my Department is preparing legislative proposals on the marketing of wool.  The recommendations in the Horse Breeding Report have necessitated consultations with the various interests concerned.  These consultations are in progress but it will take some further time before final decisions can be taken.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.4 million is being provided under subhead K. 19 for pigmeat export support in the current year.  This compares with an expenditure of £1.2 million in 1966-67.  Pig deliveries to bacon factories in 1966 amounted to 1.65 million head, which was second only to the record level of 1.8 million in 1965.  The decline which set in during 1966 has not yet ended but the expectation is that the upturn will take place later in the year.  Cycles in production are a feature of the pig industry in every country and over the past year production in Britain and some Western European countries has been passing through the same low point of the cycle as has our industry here.</P>
    <P>With a view to encouraging increased production, I have increased the guaranteed minimum prices for all the <Col N="1683" /> better grades of pigs by 6/- per cwt. liveweight as from 1st May.  This will ensure that when pig supplies increase, prices will continue to be maintained at improved minimum levels and so producers can now expand output with still greater confidence.  Also, with a view to helping pig producers, I have extended to June, 1968 the period of operation of the Sow Headage Payments Scheme, which was due to end next September.  This scheme is being well availed of and in the eight months since its inception we have paid subsidy on a total of 75,000 sows.</P>
    <P>The measures which my Department and the Pigs and Bacon Commission have been taking to improve the quality, presentation and marketing of our bacon have been meeting with success and have been reflected in the price of Irish bacon on the British market which has improved in comparison with the prices for bacon supplied by our competitors there. Twelve months ago the price of our top-quality bacon in Britain was 15/-per cwt. lower than Danish, 10/- per cwt. lower than British home bacon and the same as that of the Six Counties.  In contrast last week the price for our bacon in Britain was only 5/- per cwt. below the Danish but 5/-and 7/- per cwt. respectively above British and Six County bacon.</P>
    <P>I have been coming to the view in recent months that some basic changes may be necessary to ensure the future prosperity of the pigs and bacon industry, particularly in the context of the competitive conditions that will exist for both our producers and processors on Ireland's entry into the EEC.  Already, I have had a study made of the pig price/feed price relationship, and the question of changes in the marketing arrangements for pigs is being considered by my Department and the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  This whole question will also be examined by the NAC following which I hope to be in a position to reach conclusions as to the changes in the organisation of the industry which might be desirable.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of pigs, I would like to stress that increased pig <Col N="1684" /> production is desirable not only as a means of increasing farmers' income but also in view of the fact that the present level of production is substantially below the capacity of our processing plants.  Moreover, it is important for us to fill our bacon quota in the British market to which we also have unrestricted access for our surplus pigmeat in the form of pork.  I would, accordingly, urge farmers to plan increased production secure in the knowledge that good prices are available to them for quality pigs.</P>
    <P>The most notable feature of the poultry industry has been the rapid expansion in broiler production in recent years.  This expansion continued in 1966 when production just passed the ten-million mark.  This represents an increase of 34 per cent over the 1965 figure which was 7,500,000, and a ten-fold increase over the last eight years.  The indications are that there will probably be a further rise in broiler consumption in 1967.  Some of the world's best strains of broiler stock which have been imported by commercial interests over the last few years are now available to growers here. Last year arrangements were made for a survey of the position and prospects of our poultry and egg industry by two outside experts.  The recommendations made by these experts are currently being examined.</P>
    <P>Under subhead K.12 I am providing a sum of £2,363,000 to meet the cost of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  Against this expenditure there is an appropriation-in-aid of £463,000 under subhead P.18, leaving a net estimated expenditure of £1,900,000.  The greater part of this is in respect of veterinary surgeons' fees and the disposal of reactors discovered in check testing the country's herds. This check testing will, of course, continue to be necessary if the tuberculosis free status of our cattle is to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The campaign for the eradication of brucellosis is forging ahead.  I hope soon to be able to declare County Donegal a brucellosis-free area.  Four other counties are under test and testing will commence in another five counties this year.  The gross provision for the scheme this year is £948,000 <Col N="1685" /> but estimated receipts of £198,000 from the disposal of reactors leaves the net expenditure at £750,000.  My Department is examining the possibility of speeding up the timetable of the eradication programme for the remainder of the country.</P>
    <P>While the campaign for the eradication of sheep scab has advanced considerably, I am not quite satisfied with the rate of progress in some areas. With a view to facilitating flock owners in having their sheep dipped, the prescribed dipping periods have been extended this year to include the month of June in the first period and the last two weeks of September in the second period.  The subsidies of 50 per cent of the cost of new public dipping facilities are being continued and a significant development in this respect is that a number of county councils are providing themselves with mobile baths which are efficient and cheap and which qualify for the 50 per cent subsidy.  Subsidies also continue to be available for the provision by farmers of sheep dipping and handling facilities on their own farms and for groups of farmers who come together to provide such facilities for use by members of the group.</P>
    <P>The activities of the veterinary side of my Department in connection with efforts to reduce the economic losses in livestock caused by mastitis, liver fluke and scours in calves and young pigs are continuing.  Since liver fluke is causing substantial losses to farmers, I have formed a small expert committee to examine all aspects of the disease and make recommendations as to the further action needed to control it.  The committee; which held its first meeting recently, is composed of specialists from my Department's staff, the Veterinary Faculties of the Universities, the Agricultural Institute and the Irish Veterinary Association.</P>
    <P>The Warble Fly Eradication Scheme has been highly successful.  Checks on the incidence of warbles in cattle on farms and passing through marts and export points indicate that the level of infestation, which a few years back was in the region of 60 to 70 per cent, has now been reduced to less than two per cent.  This gratifying result <Col N="1686" /> reflects great credit on all concerned. The campaign was recently reviewed by the National Agricultural Council, which recommended that, in view of the low level of infestation reached, it was not necessary to undertake a further national campaign next autumn.  Instead the Council recommended that action be directed towards securing the treatment next spring of all animals showing visible evidence of infestation, and requiring farmers and shippers to produce certificates of treatment of such animals.</P>
    <P>A new regional veterinary laboratory has been constructed at Sligo and will be in operation very shortly.  The intention is to provide similar laboratories at three or four other centres in the country.</P>
    <P>Turning now to tillage, I am glad to say that this year there will be an overall increase in the area under cereal crops, particularly in the case of wheat where the increase seems likely to be as much as 50 per cent.  The decline in the wheat acreage in recent years was disturbing.  There have been many reasons for this.  Apart from unsatisfactory results arising from bad weather conditions, there were marketing problems.  In 1965 improved marketing arrangements were introduced which have reduced considerably the marketing hazards.  The guaranteed price for the 1966 crop was increased by 10/- per barrel and the crop was very good in all respects. These factors no doubt gave growers the confidence to sow a larger area to wheat this year.</P>
    <P>The acreage under feeding barley has levelled off over the past few years and it is not likely that there will be any great change this year.  There seems no reason why the objective of increased economic production and greater utilisation of feeding barley cannot be more fully achieved.  It is a reasonably profitable crop; the risks in sowing and harvesting are few and as well there is a guaranteed market.  This year's price of 45/- per barrel is the same as last years.  In determining the support price, the implications to the pig feeder, who uses the major portion of the crop, must, of course, be borne in mind and, as I have already mentioned, <Col N="1687" /> this question of the relationship between the pig and feed prices is to be examined by the NAC.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to oats production has been a source of some concern to me.  I note that there have been fairly substantial imports of milling, feeding and seed oats over the past years.  I feel we may not be doing all we can to secure our requirements for all these purposes at home.  I believe that growers for their part could do more to produce and market oats to the standards required by both millers and bloodstock breeders, while in turn these interests could do more to secure their requirements at home rather than look for imported oats.  Certainly in regard to seed, I am satisfied that we could produce our full requirements of high quality seed and thereby ensure the production of enough oats to meet all commercial requirements.</P>
    <P>My Department continues its highly successful research work in cereal seed breeding, as a result of which there is an ample supply of high class home grown wheat and barley seed of suitable varieties.  By using these and by good husbandry, there is no doubt that this country can produce the greater part of our cereal requirements.</P>
    <P>This spring I introduced an important horticultural scheme which should have a considerable impact on the future of the glasshouse industry. This provides for substantial grants for the erection of new glasshouse nurseries and the modernisation of existing ones.  The scheme is already being widely availed of and should enable the industry to reach a higher degree of competitive efficiency.  The scheme will operate for five years and a sum of £100,000 is being provided for it under Subhead K. 24.</P>
    <P>The publicity campaign introduced in 1965 to promote increased use of ground limestone has had spectacular success.  Consumption, which in 1965-66 had reached a high level at 1,257,000 tons increased by a further 25 per cent in 1966-67 to 1,565,000 tons.  This is very satisfactory and indicates that farmers are becoming more aware of the importance of ground limestone in securing increased production. <Col N="1688" /> This is the first time since the scheme began that consumption has topped the 1½ million tons mark.  It is, of course, desirable that the usage of limestone should continue to increase and to this end, I would strongly urge farmers to concentrate more on summer liming when the supply position is easier and lower prices generally prevail.</P>
    <P>Fertiliser consumption which had not been so satisfactory in recent years showed a welcome improvement in 1966-67.  In addition to the substantial subsidies on phosphates and potash and the various credit facilities for the purchase of fertilisers a special campaign was launched in the latter part of 1966 to promote increased use of fertilisers.  Because of the importance of stimulating increased use of fertilisers, 1967 has been designated &ldquo;Fertiliser Year&rdquo; and my Department, the fertiliser industry and the local advisory services are co-operating to secure greater and more efficient use of fertilisers. I am happy to say that already the indications are that consumption in 1967-68 will be on a much higher level than in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is one point, in particular, in regard to fertilisers which I would like to stress and that is the desirability of farmers applying fertilisers to grasslands for the purpose of increasing their stock carrying capacity and producing more winter fodder.  It is most desirable that greater attention be given to producing increased supplies of winter feed.  The amount of hay and silage produced in recent years has not increased in step with the increase in livestock numbers and this adversely affects the condition of animals and increases mortality risks.  Moreover, the lack of adequate winter feed often forces farmers to dispose of stock at a time of the year when supplies are flush and prices low instead of carrying them over the winter in good condition for sale in the spring when prices are good.  I would, therefore, exhort farmers who were short of feed last winter to take the necessary steps this year to ensure adequate feed supplies through the fuller manuring of their grasslands and greater use of silage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> The total amount being provided under Subhead K9 in the Estimate for lime and fertiliser subsidies is £5; 174,000 which represents an increase of £314,000 on last year.</P>
    <P>Demand for the facilities of the Land Project continues at a high level and expenditure during last year was the highest so far.  The amount paid by way of grants to farmers was £1,777,000 or £196,000 higher than in the preceding year.  Expenditure under the Land Project Fertiliser Credit Scheme rose from £220,000 in 1965-66 to £353,000 in 1966-67, which was also the highest figure yet reached.  It is expected that this upward trend in both schemes will continue during the present year and hence the increased provision being made in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In order to keep pace with increasing participation in the Farm Buildings Scheme and Water Supplies Scheme, I am providing under Subhead K7 £2.2 million and £400,000 respectively for grant expenditure on those schemes. Grants paid under the Farm Buildings Scheme in 1966-67 amounted to almost £2 million compared with £1.8 million in 1965-66 and £1.7 million in 1964-65. The amount expended on grants under the Water Supplies Scheme in 1966-67 was £310,000.  In August, 1966, the Farm Buildings Scheme was extended so as to provide higher grants to smallholders for piggeries, grants for the construction on farms of fixed cattle crushes or holding chutes and grants for new sheep-dipping and handling facilities erected by co-operative groups of farmers.</P>
    <P>This year I am making provision under Subhead F for £755,500 for grants to county committees of agriculture. In the past ten years the total numbers of advisers employed by committees has increased from 301 to 482. While an adequate advisory service is essential to provide the most up-to-date technical advice for all our farmers it is equally important to ensure that the advisory service itself is organised on the most efficient and effective lines. Accordingly, last autumn we secured the services of two experts from abroad to make an independent appraisal of our agricultural advisory services. <Col N="1690" /> Their report was received very recently and as I have already indicated it is my intention to print and publish it. The scheme of grants towards the purchase of forage harvesters for which I am providing £70,000 has been very successful and is being widely availed of.  Since its introduction the tonnage of silage has increased more than threefold from about 430,000 in 1963 to an estimated 1,400,000 in 1966.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead I.5 a sum of £1,486,000 is being provided for An Foras Talúntais.  This is made up of a grant of £1,386,000 towards non-capital expenses of the Institute and a grant of £100,000 for capital purposes. These sums bring the State's contribution to date towards the cost of the Institute's work to almost £8 million.  As the Institute's work has expanded so has the amount of the State grant to the Institute increased and at present it represents over 80 per cent of the Institute's total income.</P>
    <P>One of the subheads which shows a sizeable increase this year is Subhead D.2 under which funds are provided for private State-aided agricultural schools and schools of rural domestic economy.  The increased provision is, in the main, intended to meet payment of grants for the expansion of these schools to enable them to accommodate more students and to modernise their equipment and teaching facilities, all of which is very important, having regard to the key role which education must play in raising the general standard of agricultural efficiency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions in the Estimate for grants to the Faculty of Agriculture at University College, Dublin, and the Faculty of Dairy Science at University College, Cork, the only change of substance in the amounts sought as compared with last year's Estimate is in the amount of the additional grant for University College, Cork, provided under Subhead D.9.  This includes a sum of £100,000 for the much needed expansion of the Dairy Science Faculty, the building work on which is expected to commence during the year.</P>
    <P>The problems of small farms and of agricultural development generally in the western areas are among the most challenging of all those facing us at <Col N="1691" /> the present time.  These questions continue, therefore, to have my own and the Government's closest attention.</P>
    <P>The list of special measures to aid agriculture in the western areas has been growing constantly in recent years.  The very generous State aid towards the cost of the advisory service in the West has brought about a rapid increase in the number of advisers in these counties.  The pilot area development programme has been of great value in identifying and measuring the scale of the main problems associated with agriculture in the West, and, more particularly, in demonstrating that considerable improvement is possible even under existing conditions, when the intensive advice and encouragement and the wide variety of facilities and incentives provided for farmers are properly and prudently availed of.  As announced in the Budget, the pilot areas are now to be extended.  Arrangements for this extension are already in hand and the enlarged pilot areas should all be operational before very long.  As I have already mentioned, many of the other measures provided in the Budget are also designed to benefit the small farmer, not only in the West but in all other areas of the country as well.</P>
    <P>No matter what measures are adopted to help small farms or western agriculture, and, however we may set about intensifying agricultural development, the whole problem of the small farm areas is not by any means one to be solved in the realm of agriculture alone.  These problems demand a concerted approach by all Government Departments, all other State agencies, local authorities and voluntary bodies, to devise ways and means of realising the stated objective of maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas consistent with social and economic progress, while continuing at the same time to create viable family farms in all our small farm areas.  All facets of development in the West&mdash;agriculture, land structure improvement, housing, the provision of amenities, industrialisation, education, tourism and so on&mdash;must, therefore, be co-ordinated to constitute in effect a full-scale <Col N="1692" /> regional development plan for the area and the Government are now giving special attention to this form of approach.  A special Cabinet committee has already been appointed to examine and report to the Government on the preparation of a suitable regional development plan for the western area.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to give the House a comprehensive view of what we are doing for agriculture and I am sure Deputies will agree that our aim should continue to be to help farmers earn higher incomes by producing more and by doing so more efficiently. This objective can only be attained through the combined efforts of the Government and the farmers working together.  In this partnership, farming organisations have the vital function of making known the views of farmers to the Government, putting forward suggestions and recommendations and in their turn promoting a better understanding of Government policy amongst their members and ensuring more widespread collaboration and participation in schemes benefiting farmers.  As has been stated many times already, this Government attach great importance to consultations with farming organisations.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that one farming organisation&mdash;I refer of course to the NFA&mdash;should have elected to depart from the normal procedure of consultation and collaboration with the Government and to embark instead on a course of action designed as a challenge to orderly democratic Government. The facts prove conclusively that responsibility for the present situation rests solely with the NFA.  Deputies will recall that, although the Minister for Agriculture met the NFA about 64 times between the beginning of 1964 and mid-August 1966 and had agreed to a further meeting on 26th August, the President of the NFA on 25th August launched his militancy campaign with an unexpected and unwarranted personal attack on my predecessor.  The association followed this up with their so-called &ldquo;farmers rights&rdquo; march on Dublin on 19th October and with a &ldquo;secret plan&rdquo; which they were going to put into operation whether they were met or not.  Next came the sit-down on the <Col N="1693" /> steps of the Government Buildings. Following an indication from the NFA that such tactics would cease, the outgoing Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries met them on 8th November.</P>
    <P>One of the first things the present Taoiseach and I did, after assuming our present offices, was to meet the association on 21st November for a session which lasted four hours.  Within a few days, the association were seeking yet another and immediate meeting with the Taoiseach and myself. Although I wrote promptly to the President of the NFA agreeing to a further meeting with them, I found that, on the very morning they got this letter, they were again squatting on the steps of Government Buildings. On the same day, the NFA President announced the association's intention to stage farm machinery demonstrations along main roads in selected areas on December 9th: this they did. Their second farm machinery demonstration took place on January 9th. We all know what happened on that day.  In the following weeks, the association intensified their no-rates campaign and announced a policy of non-cooperation with Government Departments and committees of agriculture. In the week commencing 5th March they staged their so-called commodity strike.</P>
    <P>On 14th March the association announced that they had decided not to engage in any further activities outside the law and this was followed by a meeting between the association and the Taoiseach and myself on 21st March which lasted for some eight hours.  It was the understanding of this meeting that the association would make it clear that the abandonment of their illegal activities included the calling-off of the no-rates campaign which was then continuing.  When subsequently it emerged that the association were not honouring this understanding, the Government were left with no alternative but to take action to ensure the collection of rates which were legally due.  It had become perfectly obvious that the only objective of these people was to put themselves into a position where they could, by one means or another, dictate to <Col N="1694" /> the Government and to undermine the authority of Government if they did not get their way.  No Government worth the name could tolerate this kind of thing, which could only lead in the end to anarchy.</P>
    <P>The association's campaign, which has discredited the organisation and does not represent the true feeling of more than a handful of farmers&mdash;most of them very large farmers indeed&mdash; has created a great deal of bitterness and unrest.  A new and disturbing feature of this campaign has been the apparent attempt of late to coerce farmers to join the association or to punish those who refused to be associated with their unlawful activities.  To mention only a few examples, there was the case of the man who, because of his opposition to the methods used by the NFA in their campaign, has been threatened with expulsion from the committee of his creamery society; there was the County Kilkenny farmer whose catering contract with certain marts has been cancelled simply because he provided a meal for gardaí who happened to be on duty in connection with seizures for non-payment of rates; or there was the County Westmeath farmer who is not permitted the use of a neighbour's corn drill apparently because of his refusal to join the NFA.</P>
    <P>It is the first duty of any Government to ensure that the laws of the land are upheld, and this is a duty that the present Government are determined to fulfil, however unpleasant and unpopular that may be in the eyes of a certain small minority.  The Government have shown that they wish to exercise that duty with the utmost restraint, great though the provocation has been.  It would be a great relief to all if, even at this late stage, the NFA abandoned their current tactics and decided to work constructively with other organisations and with the Government. There is no need for me to tell the NFA how they may do that.  If they abandon their present attitude and tactics they will be welcome to take up the two seats reserved for them on the National Agricultural Council&mdash;a Council through which decisions are <Col N="1695" /> influenced not by the number of heads present but by the value and soundness of the views expressed.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the National Agricultural Council, there is little I need say, since Deputies are already well aware of the facts.  The two meetings already held leave me in no doubt that it will prove a most useful body to me and to the Government in our efforts to adapt agricultural policy to changing conditions.  The Council will prevail despite the efforts to undermine it.  One very red herring raised for this purpose concerned the chairmanship.  I set the Council up to advise me on agricultural policy matters and the place for me to get that advice is in the Council.  If I had wanted a separate agricultural body representative of the various and often conflicting interests which go to make up the agricultural sector of the economy, I would have set up such a body and studied with interest any recommendations they might have been able to agree upon amongst themselves. What I wanted was to draw on the advice and experience of the typical farmer and to establish a two-way channel of communication&mdash;direct communication.  This the Council does.</P>
    <P>The fact that it has been agreed that the Minister should be in the Council will not detract one iota from the independence of the members or their freedom and determination to express their views fully and frankly&mdash;these in fact are the only kind of views which a Minister with problems on his hands would want to hear.  Farmers are businessmen or entrepreneurs and they are not employed by the Government in the same way as a trade union member might be employed in industry.  It is right that their representatives should speak up for them and speak up strongly if need be.  However they cannot be allowed to make demands under threat of illegal or violent action if the demands are not met&mdash;even if some people think this constitutes &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo;. As Deputies will have noted from my remarks, I have already placed on the agenda of the NAC a number of subjects which are of great importance to our future agricultural development, and I expect to have very <Col N="1696" /> fruitful and constructive deliberations with the Council on these matters.  It is my intention to make available to the Council any additional expertise, whether from within the country or abroad, which they may need to help study these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement could very easily give the false impression that all is well in Irish agriculture. Of course this is anything but the true picture.  It is fair to say that progress can be claimed in certain branches of the industry, but in far too many other areas there has been no progress.  In fact, considerable deterioration has occurred.  This can only be regarded as a serious situation in our largest and most important industry, and I might say, indeed, in an industry on which the whole of our economy depends.</P>
      <P>It is more serious still when we have regard to the fact that we have recently re-activated our application for membership of the EEC and when we bear in mind the contribution that will be expected from agriculture, if and when we join the EEC.  If our application succeeds, it is reasonable to expect that we will get better prices and expanded markets for our main agricultural products. In the time available to us, we should be making an all-out effort to increase production of those products and to reduce costs.  Before any worthwhile advance can be attempted, peace must first be restored&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a reasonable and proper working partnership built up between the Government and the farmers.  It is right to say that Government-farmer relationships have never been worse than they are at the present time.  A state of war exists for some considerable time.  Indeed, one might describe it as open conflict.  I think that not nearly a sufficient effort is being made by the Government, and particularly by the Minister for Agriculture, to find a way to solve these difficulties. All of us see, every day that passes, that the position is getting worse.  Speeches are being made by Ministers and by the leaders of the NFA which, in my view, are only serving <Col N="1697" /> to create additional bitterness and a rekindling of fires.  I think that a way can and must be found out of this situation.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to make the statement that certain Members of the Opposition are using the present situation for Party political purposes.  Whomever that applies to, it certainly does not apply to me because I, and indeed many of my colleagues on these benches, have refrained to the point of which we have been criticised by our own supporters.  We have done so in the national interest.  I hope it is not too much to expect that in the national interest the Minister and the farmers will sink their differences now and get together to try to find a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>Very unnecessary steps have been taken by the Government in this whole campaign, steps which have made a solution more and more difficult.  Many farmers have been sent to jail for doing things which they believe to be necessary to bring their plight and the neglect of their industry before the people in a public way.  More farmers have been brought to court; they have been found guilty of breaking the law, and driving licences have been suspended for long periods.  This has caused very considerable hardship and loss to the people concerned.  Instead of adding fuel to the fire the Minister should be using his influence with the Minister for Justice, to exercise his powers of mitigation in order to start the creation of a climate in which negotiations can be restarted, in the hope of finding solutions to the various difficulties which exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the Minister's speech, we had many references to the National Agricultural Council and to the important part this Council can and has started to play.  I want to make my attitude to this Council quite clear. I have said before on numerous occasions that the idea of such a council appealed to me.  I think I was speaking of a national agricultural council perhaps before the Minister took up his present position as Minister; either that, or proper representation on the NIEC.  There was a golden opportunity <Col N="1698" /> here to unite the farmers into one huge group and to get worthwhile work done through them; but, unfortunately, the Minister, in my view, made serious errors in his efforts to set up this Council. The first serious error he made was in insisting that a large block of the membership of this Council would be nominated by the Minister and he crowned the situation finally by taking the chair himself.  Now we have the extraordinary situation at this point of time that we have the Minister for Agriculture chairing a group which is negotiating with the Minister for Agriculture on behalf of the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I correct the Deputy at this stage, lest everybody else keeps talking in these terms?  It is not a negotiating organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me continue: if this is not a negotiating body, then there is considerable confusion in the country, which should be cleared up. We had a national negotiating body, recognised by the Minister's predecessor, recognised by the previous Taoiseach, the National Farmers Association. They were recognised as the body to have an annual review and to be consulted about prices and prospects, not only during the year that passed but in the year to come.  That was something which was dispensed with; they were refused those opportunities. The Minister has given a detailed account, a calendar account, of the events which led up to the present situation.  All I can say is they make fairly sorry reading.  It is an extraordinary thing that we managed to get on in this country up to the present without any of these unfortunate incidents. The responsibility rests with the Minister to restore peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the Minister, time and time again, referred to the important work to be done by this National Agricultural Council.  It is quite obvious the Minister has got in a group simply to advise him on agricultural matters and he is chairing that group.  As I see it now, he makes a suggestion to this group of people: &ldquo;Look, there is something giving me a certain amount of bother; would you go away and look into it, or discuss <Col N="1699" /> it amongst yourselves, perhaps; then come back and we will have a discussion about it&rdquo;.  The great mistake the Minister made in nominating the people he has nominated up to the present time was that the people he put on this body, or selected, do not represent any particular farming group in the country.  It is fair to say that.</P>
    <P>When the Minister set out originally, he stated that the six people he was retaining for his own selection and nomination were to be people representing various groups in Irish agriculture. The persons who have been so selected by him do not, in fact, represent any group and, consequently, can speak for themselves only and do not have to answer to any group.  It is an extraordinary situation, a situation which has turned what was, in my view, a golden opportunity into something which is resented by many of the farmers.  How the Minister can say and believe he has a worthwhile National Agricultural Council, when half the farmers are not represented, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the Minister to seek to brush aside the influence and the organisation of the National Farmers Association&mdash;the association claims to have a membership of 120,000&mdash;but nobody can brush these factors aside.  It is most unfortunate that that whole group of agricultural influence is to be set aside by the Minister, simply because there is no real effort to get co-operation and because this large national organisation were offered the same position and status as small commodity groups in the country.  This is something which is all wrong.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be well advised, even at this late stage, to reconsider that situation, to appreciate that there is war in Irish agriculture and not peace, and that there will not be any worthwhile development here until you have full farmer involvement and full farmer co-operation at every stage.  I know that farmers throughout the country are not saints and difficulties are bound to arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this is not a <Col N="1700" /> negotiating body.  Does the Minister say, at the same time, that the farmers are not entitled to a national negotiating body?  The trade unions are so entitled; employers and industry are so entitled.  Why then are the farmers not so entitled?  It is only fair play for the farming community.  This is something which should be straightened out.  Let us have two bodies, if the Minister wants two bodies.  Finally, and most important of all let the largest and the most important industry in the country be represented on the NIEC.  Let them be taken into the national picture and see how they are being treated in the national picture.</P>
    <P>We know what happened last year. The only section of the economy which increased its output was agriculture. We had an increase of two or three per cent in agricultural production and a fall in income of about the same amount.  At the same time, we had stagnation in the other sectors of the economy and these people got a six per cent increase in income.  I do not deny that they were entitled to that increase with the increased cost of living and so on, but the fact of the matter is that the farmers' income dropped during the same period and we are surprised that the farmers start to demonstrate in a vigorous way, that they are not going to accept this sort of treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given many examples and indications of the victimisation that is taking place at present.  That is small and petty and we would do well to listen to what a parish priest, Very Rev. P.W. Davis, had to say on this whole matter.  I quote from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of May 28th, 1967:</P>
    <P>The charges of intimidation levelled at the NFA were refuted by the president of the Mayo Executive when he spoke at a meeting in Castlebar.  Very Rev. P.W. Davis, P.P., Cooneal, said no agitation had been carried out so free of incident in the country by more than 120,000 people without rules or discipline.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here and there young farmers may have lost their heads at times, but there were only a few minor incidents that <Col N="1701" /> would be quite commonplace in country dance halls.  Members of the NFA are to be congratulated on the manner in which they carried out their protest with dignity and courtesy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All farmers had serious grievances which the public did not know about, especially in regard to the composition of Boards, Father Davis continued. </P>
    <P>I need not quote further but he indicates that they have not the position as producers in their own industry they are entitled to get but he is of opinion that there was nothing but minor incidents in this whole agitation and effort to draw attention to the plight of the industry.  I should hate to see the day arrive when young farmers in the whole of their health would not occasionally lose their heads and if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries resents that in the way it is being resented at present it is too bad.  I do not think that anything like sufficient effort is being made to settle this whole difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that you have half the farmers of this country in revolt against the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government, and that is too bad and very wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the two meetings held by the National Agricultural Council.  I think it is fair to say that these two meetings were held in secrecy, a few days before the Budget.  Then we were told that the improvements which came in the Budget came as a result of the discussions that had taken place with the newly-born NAC.  Now it is really childish to build up the importance of a body that has only been in existence for a few days and that could not possibly have made any worthwhile impact on budget intentions.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries does not intend to continue telling people that the National Agricultural Council, as it is called, which is not, in fact, a national agricultural council, is bringing about any improvements <Col N="1702" /> that occur in the industry.  That is not the way to tackle it.  The Minister should resolve to settle this once and for all.</P>
    <P>I made efforts recently to get an all-Party approach to this problem.  We felt that if Party politics were kept out of this whole row, a settlement might be reached more easily.  We kept out in the national interest.  We could have made much more politics out of this.  I believe that we have a part to play in the settlement.  Among the members of the National Farmers Association are people of all politics, people supporting the Government, people supporting Labour and people supporting us.  I felt that it would be a good thing if there were an open declaration by all the Parties in the House that they wanted to see an end to this difficulty and a settlement brought about and make an approach in that way.  I believe we would get much farther than will ever be got by any single Party making an approach.</P>
    <P>That did not materialise because the member of the Government group whom I approached apparently was not free to participate.  I think it is a pity he was not.  Since that day the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Gibbons, apparently told the Press the deadlock was about to be broken but we hear today further announcements that there is no such indication.  This is a terrible pity. The time has come to blot out the past and get down to the enormous job that has to be done if we are to iron out the difficulties and if we ever hope to secure the full potential of the agricultural industry.  We will never do that unless we have full farmer involvement all the way and full farmer co-operation.</P>
    <P>If we are ever to reap the full potential of the industry, a large scale investment programme will have to be embarked on and if we are to do that very careful advance arrangements will have to be made.  Farmers need money to buy fertilisers, to improve their buildings, to improve their equipment, to do more drainage work. These are the tools of efficient farming. If we are to get the volume of production <Col N="1703" /> that it is possible to get we must get money and credit at reasonable rates of interest.  So far there has been no indication that we are getting down to this job.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave various figures for output from agriculture.  Roughly one can say that it is responsible for two-thirds of our exports.  That is more important even than it looks because any increase in agricultural production from now on means 100 per cent export because the home market is supplied.  As well as that, the import content of these exports is so small that investment in agriculture is very attractive.</P>
    <P>During the past year farmers have suffered serious hardship because of the drastic drop in cattle prices in the second half of the year.  Listening to the Minister talking about the prices of agricultural products last year generally, I came to the conclusion that he must be in cloud-cuckooland, that he must not be aware of what was happening throughout the country and that he must not appreciate that it was just impossible to sell young cattle unless the farmers were prepared to give them away in many instances. It is all right to talk about the Trade Agreement and the effects of the Trade Agreement.  When we were trying to sell our store cattle last year, the Trade Agreement was very little good to us.  According to the Agreement, we were entitled to put them in, but the British farmer simply did not want them, and when he did not want them, there was no obligation to import them. Therefore, we were left sitting.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that this Trade Agreement was a wonderful thing for this country.  I have been looking through it and I can see no safeguards at all in it for us.  There is an implied threat in various places in it that if we do not succeed in supplying the quotas mentioned steps may be taken to deal with us, but on the other hand if there are a number of things with which we are dissatisfied all we can do is have consultations and discussions on those difficulties.  There is no indication as to what will be the outcome of the discussions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> Last year was a bad year in many ways.  As I say, the drop in cattle prices was simply fantastic.  The price of calves dropped by about £15 per head. At present there is an improvement, but prices are still £10 below what they were a year or so ago.  A drop of £15 in the price of calves, as I said before, is tantamount to 6d per gallon on the price of milk on a 600 gallon cow. That is a serious blow to dairying. Even though we talk about giving an increase of 2d a gallon, we can easily see where it is lost, and lost very quickly.  Sheep prices were also down, and they were down in numbers.  The Minister spoke about high yields in tillage.  Surely that was more than offset by the drop in tillage acreage. There was a drop of 130,000 acres. That is a fantastic drop in one year.</P>
    <P>One sector of the agricultural industry in which there was a fairly considerable improvement was in milk production.  The Minister said that one of the things that hit agriculture last year was the very late and wet spring. That may be so, but there was also a very favourable back end, and milk production showed a considerable increase. The Minister put it at 14 per cent.  I did not think it was anything like that but I knew there was quite a considerable increase.  It is a tribute to Bord Bainne that while we have improved our position and become more established in existing markets, it has been found possible to secure new markets for ever-increasing and ever-growing quantities of milk products.  It is quite obvious that the export markets are being very carefully watched, and that advantage is being taken of every opportunity that presents itself.  The promotional work of Bord Bainne has been carried out with efficiency and imagination and they are succeeding&mdash; and succeeding rapidly let me say&mdash;in creating a national brand image of quality and value for more and more of our products.  Those efforts have been backed up by increased research and advisory work at the production end.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue to keep a high place in the export market for these products, unless the raw material is good we have no hope of having a <Col N="1705" /> finished product of high quality.  Therefore, those efforts must be continued and intensified.  As I say, we have every reason to be proud of the success of Bord Bainne in the marketing of agricultural products, but we have failed completely to do anything about the marketing of beef, and improving the sales of our cattle.  It is peculiar that in the whole of the Minister's statement he made no reference whatever to his intentions in relation to a meat marketing board or a promotion board which he has mentioned on occasions recently.  There is no mention whatever that I can remember in the course of his statement in relation to his intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that last year something was seriously lacking.  The farmers were advised as late as the month of May that the right thing to do was to hold their cattle and that prices would be £5 to £6 a head higher after the 1st July as a result of the Trade Agreement.  We all know what happened.  As I say, as late as May the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was not able to forecast a few months ahead.  That indicated to me that he was badly informed as to the prospects in the various export markets.  I am sure that when he gave that advice, when he told the farmers that cattle would go up by £5 or £6 per head, he gave it in good faith. I cannot imagine any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries advising the farmers unless he believed that what he was saying was true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would give me some lead as to what Minister said the farmers should hold their cattle in May last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wronging the Minister when I say he said to hold them but he certainly said that after 1st July cattle prices would increase by £5 to £6 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that he did not say at any stage to hold them in the springtime, and that what he said really meant that after the Trade Agreement the return on cattle would be worth money representative of the figure the Deputy has mentioned, <Col N="1706" /> not that the price of cattle would increase by that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice was that the whole situation in relation to the price of cattle would improve, once the Trade Agreement became operative from 1st July.  We all know, unfortunately, that the price fell absolutely to pieces from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy agree that he did not say to hold them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  As I say, the price fell to pieces, and were it not for the headage grants introduced in the back end I do not know what would have happened to the farmers. Certainly that helped to avert a complete catastrophe but, unfortunately, it did not assist the man with young stock or with stock which was showing signs of the long previous winter and had not done so well.</P>
      <P>The main feature of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion in relation to cattle was that cattle numbers would increase by approximately 33 per cent between 1964 and 1970.  As the Minister said, considerable progress was made towards this goal until last January when the upsurge in cow numbers went into reverse.  One can easily see why&mdash; because of the disappointments of the previous years.  Here we set out with the heifer scheme deliberately to increase cattle numbers.  As I say, we succeeded to a considerable extent but at the same time did nothing to set up a marketing organisation to dispose of this production.  It was still left to private enterprise to set out to find markets for this very big increase in numbers.  As well as that, the quality was mediocre because conditions were not laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The heifer scheme has been criticised by many because it was said chancers came in and got the benefit. They did, but the scheme succeeded in getting numbers up.  On the other hand no extra effort was put into the scheme to ensure that as numbers increased, there would be sufficient feed to ensure that cattle would be properly looked after.  It may be said that farmers should be able to do these things for <Col N="1707" /> themselves.  I agree that perhaps they should but there is the fact that we have not got that degree of anticipation and perfection among the farming community.  They should be warned time and again that there is little use in increasing numbers unless simultaneous provision is made for the production of silage, winter feed.  We are doing very little in that respect.</P>
    <P>One thing, however, has made an impact in that direction, the forage harvest grant.  It is about one-third only, but it is amazing the effect it has had in the area I know.  It increased the quantity of silage produced.  If that and similar inducements schemes were brought along, you would not have cattle staggering out in the spring and this glut of autumn sales that are regarded as being so undesirable by everyone and, of course, are so undesirable.</P>
    <P>The whole question of providing the accommodation for silage is quite an expensive business if it is done on the traditional lines to which we are all accustomed&mdash;a covered silage pit and covered lean-to accommodation where cattle could be in lying.  It is now accepted that considerable advance could be made if there were sufficient hard standing for cattle, if we had worthwhile grants to lay down concrete on to which we could put silage which could be covered with a plastic covering for cattle feed in the autumn.  I do not know what the grant for concrete is per square yard now.  It used to be 1/6, I think it is now 2/6.  It is a matter I omitted to look up.  If the figure given is 2/6, it bears no relation to the cost of laying down concrete.  A considerable area of this hard standing for cattle is required if we are to keep them off the land during the winter and early spring when they should be off it and if we are to get late or early grass.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed the Minister had no recommendation in regard to increased provision for winter feed.  He spoke about the desirability of marketing more of our cattle during the first six months of the year.  He also said that more of our cattle have gone this year.  So they have: farmers did not <Col N="1708" /> want to be caught out this year as they were last year and they are disposing of more cattle, and there is a better demand.</P>
    <P>At Question Time last week, I asked the Minister why cattle had dropped suddenly in price by 10/- per cwt. in the Dublin market.  This week the price dropped again.  Are we to have a tumble?  This is something the people need to know and to be warned about.  Much greater efforts are required to explain properly to the farmers why their average is in the region of 30/- to 40/- per cwt. less for their beef cattle than that of farmers in England.  I raised this earlier in the year on a few occasions and all sorts of lame excuses were offered by the Minister but no worthwhile explanation was given as to why this enormous discrepancy occurred.  It has been said by people in the trade that it was due to unevenness in the enormous supply that came in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Figures collected by the Central Statistics Office were published last February and were regarded as comparable with British figures.  They ranged from 58/- in Scotland down to £2 in Northern Ireland more than our farmers were getting.  Carriage would account for 10/- of that but the difference has to be explained by the Minister. In England and Northern Ireland, subsidy payments are direct to the farmers and so far here the Minister has refused to operate such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Some time ago he gave me the impression that he was thinking of a scheme whereby this would be possible and I was disappointed in the Minister's statement today that he made no reference to this important matter.  It just means that Irish farmers are being deprived in one way or another of £15 to £20 per head on their cattle.  Perhaps one could knock off £5 for carriage but after that the figure represents not only a serious loss to farmers but a serious national loss because of the Exchequer subsidy that has to be provided as well as everything else.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why a marketing board could not be of assistance to both processors and farmers, a worthwhile marketing board that would look after <Col N="1709" /> advertising, the flow of beef to individual markets in Britain, sea transport and general promotion work that a busy private enterprise concern appears to be no longer able to do.  When I recommend a meat marketing board, I do not lose sight of the fact that a great tribute is due to the meat trade. They have gone out for markets for considerable quantities of beef in the past and they have done great service for the country which should be recognised. Many of them operate up-to-date, efficient factories but they have no control over the less efficient and less worthwhile carcase meat exporters. The job has now got so big that they are not able to take care of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us what he has in mind for the future marketing of our cattle and beef.  I remind him that it fell into a shocking state last year and that forecasts were hopeless.  Therefore, there must be an intelligent forecasting organisation to make assessments of future possibilities.  On the present situation in the cattle trade the Minister is optimistic, certainly more optimistic than I because we have the larger numbers of cattle still on our hands.  We are bound to have a continued glut and I am afraid it is on its way.  Still, there is no indication in what the Minister told us that there will not be a recurrence of the collapse we had last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the number of cattle we exported to Egypt and also the cattle that went to Italy.  There was no mention of the famous 2,000 supposed to go to Germany.  They are obviously a dead letter.  In any case, the number was so small it was not worth screaming about.  The figure of exports to Italy escaped me, if the Minister mentioned it.  He did say the Department were hoping to improve on this and expand this export outlet.  He did not say for what type of cattle.  I assume it is for the type of cattle that have gone up to the present, cattle up to six cwt. or something of that sort.</P>
    <P>There was fairly severe criticism of the condition of some of the cattle exported.  Unfortunately, there is ample evidence to indicate that at least most of what was said about them was true. All the livers were fluked, that is, when <Col N="1710" /> they were slaughtered, and they were heavily infected with worms.  The Minister did not say he has under active consideration ways and means of controlling the great loss that occurs through fluke infestation.  I hope that very soon we will hear that a scheme is under way.  I personally think it is even more important than brucellosis, on which we have started.</P>
    <P>In regard to these quotas in the Trade Agreement, I remember two people in this House&mdash;the present Minister for Justice and the then Minister for Agriculture&mdash;telling us that what we secured for agriculture in the Trade Agreement was 100 per cent in accord with what was sought. Certainly, it does not reflect great foresight when we now see that the entire quota of beef was exported by the middle of December of last year from 1st July.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in the Trade Agreement that I can see which gives any scope for a growth factor in our exports.  There was a considerable increase in carcase meat exports last year, I know.  I hope the Minister will find a way to return to the farmers these subsidies at present being paid.  This is a source of continual grouse and annoyance.  They have a real feeling of being deprived.</P>
    <P>In relation to this appeal to the farmers to produce more cattle and to sell more cattle in the first six months of the year, an effort should be made, and we should have some announcement from the Minister, over and above exhortation, to provide a certain guaranteed price for cattle during that period.  It should be easy enough to do because I doubt very much if it would cost the country very much to do it. Occasionally there might be that drop farmers are afraid of.  It would increase the confidence of farmers.  Coupled with that, we should increase the grants for winter feed, accommodation for cattle and do something other than just exhort them to turn out their cattle in the spring.  It is serious from the point of view not only of the money secured for cattle but of the efficient working of the processing factories.  If they have not a fairly even flow of cattle, it must increase their overheads enormously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The Minister spoke about the AI stations and the percentage of cattle dealt with in this year.  Sixty per cent of our cows mated were mated by AI. The Minister mentioned there was a movement away from the Friesian and back to the Hereford.  That has happened mainly because of the difficulty of selling cattle that were not in good condition last year.  This was due to a number of factors, scarcity of feed, the late winter and so on.  I would hate to see us moving out of milk and out of milk breeds because, as we know, over 60 per cent of our farmers are small farmers under 50 acres.  If they are to get a living, they must get a living, first, from milk production.  The Minister said that, in his opinion, the whole future of the small farmers depended on intensive livestock production. I think he must base his economy on milk first.  If an animal does not pay his way as a milk producer, certainly you cannot afford to live on a dry cattle economy.  That is extremely important to remember.  The only thing wrong with the Friesian is that we do not pay enough attention to the type of Friesian we are using.  If we have the Dutch type of Friesian rather than the British, we will have a first-class store beast, but they are cattle that have to be fed well all the time.  We cannot fully impress on our farmers the importance of this type of continuous feeding at a high level, if we are to make money out of beef production.</P>
    <P>I believe we do not make half enough out of the AI stations.  We have something here we can sell to the farmers automatically, something that requires no salesmanship.  Any improvement by way of progeny-tested bulls is an improvement we have got to sell, and it happens automatically.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he was interested in progeny testing, but I think we are not making enough effort in that direction.  In the notes supplied on the activities of the Department, we are told about the number of bulls progeny tested, but we are not told about the number that are proven and the number of proven bulls without any station.  That is important.  If you have <Col N="1712" /> one of those proven bulls, the cost immediately goes up.  It does not seem to make sense that the cost should go up because we want to get the farmers to use the best bulls.  We are taking the necessary steps to make them shy away from using the best bulls.</P>
    <P>Charolais were mentioned.  I thought we did not hear quite enough about them.  The Minister did say there was an increasing demand, but he did not say to what extent.  He did not say to what extent, if any, we were trying to push Charolais and whether in fact it is worth pushing them as meat producers and to what extent.  When he is replying, he should tell us more about the Charolais and their performance to date and what the future holds as far as the investigations have gone.</P>
    <P>I understand there has been and perhaps is an export policy for bully beef and veal.  I do not know how far this has been explored or whether or not it is part of the Minister's intentions to see if anything can be done along these lines to find increased outlets for our cattle.</P>
    <P>We hear occasionally that the Livestock Consultative Council are still in existence but we very rarely hear what, if any, are their recommendations.</P>
    <P>As far as sheep are concerned, the position is that there was not only a drop in price but a drop in numbers and in the price of wool. The Minister did say that he was at present doing something about the recommendations of the Wool Committee.  I have had representations made to me by various groups of hill sheep farmers wanting to be represented on any body or co-operative dealing with the sale of wool in this country.  I hope the Minister will remember that when he is introducing any new efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>A number of producers of sheep and lambs on the hills complain that they cannot increase production because they cannot get fertilisers on the hills. This is an aspect of production that should get serious consideration.  In other places helicopters are used but they are uneconomic.  The Minister should explore for hill areas the possibility of using something like a Unimog <Col N="1713" /> for spreading fertiliser.  Production could be enormously increased if it were possible to get fertiliser on to a large proportion of hill areas.</P>
    <P>There has been a serious drop, as the Minister recognises, in fertiliser usage during the past couple of seasons.  The Minister says that there are indications already this year that there will be increased fertiliser usage.  I hope he is right in that.  In my view, the only indication of increased fertiliser usage is the increased acreage under wheat. There has never been any difficulty in getting farmers to fertilise grain adequately, but when it comes to fertilising grass, they certainly think twice about it.  If we are to increase cattle numbers as I believe we ought, if there is greater effort made to find markets for them, because our whole future, if we get into Europe, is largely dependent on cattle, efforts should be made to increase the use of fertiliser. The Minister did not tell us what he had in mind.  He is calling this year fertiliser year.  What has been done to induce farmers to increase the use of fertiliser during the present year?  We should hear more about the inducements offered because it is extremely difficult to get farmers to use fertiliser and after last year's drop in income, there is a shortage of money for things like fertiliser which, unfortunately, get only secondary consideration.</P>
    <P>There has been a serious drop in pig numbers and the entire pig and bacon industry is at a very low level at the moment.  I do not think any of the measures taken up to the present are serious enough or comprehensive enough to get the increase in production the Minister desires and the country needs and should have.  It is all right to say that the price of quality pigs has been increased by 6/- a cwt. This is not the important thing.  At all times the important thing is the relationship between the cost of feeding and the quality of feed and the price you can get for the pig and whether or not there is an economic return.  Some time ago when pig prices had reached an uneconomic level, there was nothing done to change that picture. This is the serious aspect of the situation and that is what causes the <Col N="1714" /> variation, up and down, in the production graph.  Immediately numbers are increased, the price drops.  It should be possible to give some long-term encouragement to farmers by providing that there will always be a relationship between pig feed prices and the price of pigs that will ensure for the reasonably efficient producer a worthwhile profit.  At the time that pigs were falling to an uneconomic level, a move should have been made to export pigs as pork because there was a worthwhile market in pork which I do not think was investigated sufficiently.  Numbers were allowed to build up and there was the inevitable drop in price and the inevitable export of sows.  People rushed out of pigs because they were losing money and that was the only reason they went out of production.  They will get into production again because there is a good price.</P>
    <P>We have the situation that there is a large quantity of native barley in storage and it is costing a considerable amount of money to keep it there. It would be far better to pay a subsidy of, say, £5 a ton on that barley to bring it down to the price of similar imported feeding and to give it to the farmers and get them to feed it.  It should be available at this time of year rather than have the position next harvest that the stores are choked with barley that should long since have been consumed.  The Minister referred to the large quantities of grain and feedingstuffs being imported unnecessarily. That is something I hope he intends to prevent as far as it is possible and advisable to do so.</P>
    <P>There is hardly sufficient being done in regard to the control of disease in pigs.  I have been in pig production for a good many years and I have always found that if there are pig losses through disease, it is extremely important to secure satisfactory diagnosis and to get worthwhile treatment recommendations. Serious losses can be incurred through disease.  It is one of the things that happen immediately pig numbers are increased.  A much better service should be provided on a national scale for the control of pig disease.</P>
    <P>I have always said that a real effort should be made to organise pig production <Col N="1715" /> on a regional scale and that there should be some central organisation in each production area to ensure that producers get their raw materials at the lowest possible price consistent with quality.  No effort has been made to organise pig production in that regional way and the result is that in the areas in which the Minister has expressed his interest, the poorest areas in the west of Ireland, the number of pigs being produced is only half the number produced there in 1930.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area in particular, there is a serious problem in regard to surplus milk.  This month the farmers in this area will be getting 1/11d or, if they are lucky, 2/- for surplus milk. As we know, this price is far below the summer price of milk in the dairy areas.  I am not blaming the Minister for this because I know that he is not responsible for holding up the establishment of a processing factory, but he should do something to promote this project.  A site was secured and provision made for the setting up of such a processing unit out at Bluebell. For reasons of which I am fairly well aware, this did not go ahead, but I think the people who were advising against it at the time have had reason to change their minds since.  I understand that next year the wholesalers will take only the quantity of milk they require for their business in the liquid milk trade and that there will be no outlet for the surplus milk.  This is going to be a very serious situation if we do not provide a processing factory to give this milk to the plants down the country that are prepared to accept it in a condensed form.  This is a matter of urgency for milk producers in the whole Dublin milk-producing area.</P>
    <P>The statistics supplied by the Minister to Deputies prior to this discussion are very useful, but there is something wrong with them and I just want to draw the Minister's attention to this.  I happen to have in my possession the notes for last year, and now we have the notes for this year.  In the notes for last year, we are told that total agricultural exports in 1965 were £120 million.  We are told in the notes for <Col N="1716" /> this year that the total agricultural exports in 1965 were £115 million. There is a discrepancy there of £5 million and I should like this explained when the Minister is replying, or perhaps he could explain it off the cuff.</P>
    <P>In the exports of bacon, there is a discrepancy of approximately £2 million.  It is given one year as £6.6 million, and in the next set of notes, as £8.8 million.  Again in the export of pork, there is the discrepancy as between £4.2 million and £5.5 million.  These figures are either false last year and true this year, or true this year and false last year.  It is something I should like to have explained, because it does not seem to me to be a typist's error.</P>
    <P>Mention was made, too, of the Horse Breeding Report.  The Minister's predecessor promised to start implementing this report last January or February. We are now being told that the matter is still under consideration and that more and more consultations will have to take place before any moves are made on it.  Surely the number of people concerned in this is so small that if we were actively interested in implementing the findings and the recommendations of this report, we would long since have got round to it, that is, if we have any faith in the report, and we should know by now whether we have or not?  Any of the interests with which I am in contact are extremely anxious that something should be done about it, and they have no indication that anything is being done.</P>
    <P>The brucellosis scheme, as the Minister says, is under way in Donegal.  It is going very well, and Donegal will soon be a clearance area, and the scheme will be extended from Donegal to other areas.  There has been very little brucellosis in that area and that is why the scheme was started there, which is quite right, but I am afraid that when this scheme is extended to cover other parts of the country, it is going to cost a colossal amount of money.  It may be that this is being forced upon us, but I can see that there will be very considerable losses if we have to get rid of stock that are affected with brucellosis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> I may have this impression from the fact that due to the practice of using Strain 19 all the years you get a reaction now that does not give a true indication of the incidence of the disease.  I hope that is so and that the true incidence of the disease is not represented by the degree of positive reaction that is got at the present time on testing.  I know that any pilot efforts that are being made have revealed alarming results.</P>
    <P>In regard to glasshouse grants, I have not got a copy of the scheme, but my information is that there is one-third allowed on buildings and 40 per cent on equipment.  However, I understand there is no hope of getting these grants unless you already have a quarter of an acre of glass.  I hope that is not so, but I have been assured that is the case.  This certainly does not seem to me to be consistent with helping the small producer.  If that is a condition of the grant, I hope something will be done to remove it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the necessity for licensing livestock marts.  He did not enlarge on that, but just made the statement.  However, he did enlarge on it speaking somewhere yesterday, and it seems to indicate that this is in some way tied up with the present operation of the cattle marts and livestock marts throughout the country.  If there is any necessity for licensing livestock marts from the point of view of insisting on disease control, hygiene standards and that sort of thing, this is a serious interference with the farmers' own business, and the Minister should hesitate before he goes ahead with this scheme.  It is taken at the present time as a further indication of the Minister's anxiety to break up an existing farming organisation, and this is an organisation, whether we like to admit it or not, that has done an immense amount of good for Irish farmers and which has the capacity to continue doing an immense amount of good for them.  It is wrong to do anything that might kill the initiative or interest in their own efforts and in their own enterprises, co-operative and otherwise, by taking departmental control of their operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> With regard to Angus cattle, I can remember a good way back to the time that the complaint was in the Department of Agriculture that our Angus cattle were too big for the Scottish trade and that something would have to be done about it.  The wheel has turned full circle, and now we have discovered they are not big enough. I suppose there is nothing wrong in that.  If fashions change, if markets change and if demands change, it is only right that we should be &ldquo;with it&rdquo;. I am glad that, realising the need for change, we have gone into this breed of Aberdeen Angus, designed to improve growth rates and consequently the profit from Aberdeen Angus cattle in the West of Ireland.  It was right to set up the Irish Herd Book.  I hope the breeding societies are progressing towards acceptance of cattle produced by AI.  For far too long they have stood out against these.  It is a pity they should do so because, if there is any way in which cattle can be tested, it is through the activities of the AI stations.</P>
    <P>The first item in the notes in relation to the main activities of the Department concerns the agricultural advisory service.  Too much importance cannot be attached to the advisory service and to the numbers and quality of the instructors, plus the feeding of information through An Foras Talúntais to the farmers.  If we are to get the production we hope to get, and if we are to reduce costs in the way we hope they will be reduced in order to bring our competitiveness up to the standards of the people we will have to meet and beat in the export market, one of the most important instruments we have towards achieving that end is the advisory service working as the friend of the farmer.  Recently an appalling press release was sent out by the Minister to the agricultural officers.  It was sent to the CAOs in the county committees: in that it was stated that any case of intimidation, or threatened intimidation, was to be immediately reported to the Department.  It is a dreadful development if advisory officers are now expected to act as spies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to agricultural education the Minister has said that grants are being increased in order to enable accommodation to be extended.  Attention has been called for some years past to the shortage of accommodation in agricultural colleges.  This is a belated effort. Even now we are not taking sufficient positive steps to ensure that those who want to do a year, or even two years, in an agricultural college are catered for; there is only one college in the country which provides a limited number of places for a second year. That is Gurteen.  Warrenstown used to provide a second year but, because of demand by first year students, they have had to abandon it.  The facilities were not available to provide a second year and not available, therefore, to turn out first-class people in both agriculture and horticulture.  The provision of accommodation is something in relation to which we cannot move fast enough.</P>
      <P>We heard very little from the Minister about horticulture.  I had hoped we might have heard something about the Erin Foods-Heinz amalgamation and the prospects for the future.  I saw a figure of approximately 4,000 acres in relation to this type of production; there is some prospect that that figure may be increased to roughly 20,000 acres.  I hope the Minister will tell us something about the prospects because this is something which would help to reduce the numbers leaving the land every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reference by the Minister to poultry was that there was an increase in broiler production.  Last year <Col N="1720" /> we increased the export of seed potatoes. It is really extraordinary that we can get people to produce potatoes because the price today is the same as it was 30 years ago.  Possibly mechanisation has helped.  We could, I think, do a great deal to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to the Minister to restore peace to the agricultural community and put an end to the fighting which has been going on for far too long.  I want to assure him that he will have the help and co-operation of every Deputy on this side of the House. It has been alleged, quite wrongly, that we want to keep this situation going until after the local elections.  That might have an advantage for us, but I am stating publicly now that we want to see this ended.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton has dealt so extensively with all the aspects of agriculture that I am at a disadvantage in following him.  The Minister, in my opinion, must be living in a world of make-believe if he thinks that the people, and particularly the farming community, will accept without question the rosy picture he has painted.  I was somewhat surprised by the manner in which the Minister approached his Estimate.  After 12 months of continued and unprecedented unrest in the farming community, it was only reasonable to expect that he would have given a clear indication that he recognised the serious economic and social problems confronting Irish agriculture.  There is nothing in his speech to indicate that he realises the extent of these problems or the difficulties with which the farmers have had to contend over the past 12 months.  He attempts to paint a rosy picture, making the best use of the statistics and the other information available to him in his Department. However, anybody even remotely connected <Col N="1721" /> with agriculture will be aware that the reality of the present position in Irish agriculture is far different from the picture painted by the Minister in this debate.</P>
      <P>Following 12 months of continuous unrest, during which our farmers were driven to the verge of desperation and, in an effort to make their grievances heard and to force the Government to take action, having tried all the normal channels of communication, this most peaceful, law-abiding and hardworking section of our community were forced to take drastic action and even to break the law.  The Minister would have been far better advised, and it would have been much more statesmanlike on his part, to face up to the situation and if, instead of trying to defend his attitude to and his handling of the present farming difficulties, he had come out openly and admitted that serious problems confront our farmers.  The fact that our farmers have had to resort to drastic action is symptomatic of the difficulties and the hardships with which they have had to contend.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister and his predecessor have handled this whole situation in a deplorable manner.  I am convinced that the difficulties which have come to light, and which have been so much to the forefront in the past 12 months in relation to the agricultural community, did not arise overnight.  I believe&mdash;I think it was forecast&mdash;that most of the difficulties in the agricultural industry stem from the fact that when the Government introduced the Second Programme for Economic Expansion there was no policy for agriculture.  Since the introduction and the attempted implementation of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, Irish agriculture has gone downhill rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are notable omissions in the Minister's speech.  I cannot understand why, in this document of 25 pages in which the Minister speaks glowingly of the efforts of the Government to tackle the problem of the small farmer and of western development, there is not one word about what is always spoken of whenever agriculture is discussed.  I cannot even find the word &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; once mentioned in it.  Have the <Col N="1722" /> Government abandoned the co-operative movement?  The Minister comes from Donegal, where Father McDyer has clearly demonstrated the value of co-operative organisation in helping the small farmer to survive.  Surely the Minister should not have omitted any reference to the Government's intentions regarding the promotion of agricultural co-operation?  There is reference to rationalising and to re-organisation of the creamery industry.</P>
    <P>I have suspected for a long time that much of the talk about agriculture is merely academic.  Everybody preaches co-operation: &ldquo;The farmers must co-operate. If the small farmer is to survive, there must be co-operation.&rdquo; There is nothing in this Bill to show that the Government have any plans to encourage our small farmers and our medium-sized farmers and our large farmers to co-operate.  I am beginning to suspect that the Government have entirely forgotten about and, in fact, are departing from the idea of co-operation. This is the most significant part of the Minister's speech, in my humble opinion.</P>
    <P>One would not expect to find that in Great Britain co-operation or co-operative methods are essential to agricultural production because when we turn to Great Britain we think in terms of large-scale holdings.  I have a report here from the <i>Farmers' Weekly</i> of 28th April, 1967, from which I should like to quote one or two relevant extracts. In this report it is stated that the National Agricultural Advisory Service in Britain has set up a commando unit to gather facts about farm co-operative groups as part of a large-scale national agricultural advisory service programme for coping with the boom in co-operation which is expected.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Economic pressures are forcing more farmers towards group working. This can have big benefits in cutting labour, machinery requirements, management time and costs generally. </P>
    <P>Now, here is something that I think our agricultural advisory service might perhaps try to adapt to the needs of this country.  In previous debates on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1723" /> I referred to the fact that our agricultural advisers receive no specialised training in co-operative organisation. In other words, to the best of my knowledge our agricultural advisers have not been trained to advise a group of farmers who decide to come together to work on co-operative lines.  There are a number of co-operative farming groups in this country who have proved beyond all doubt the value of farmers working together on co-operative lines but there is a difficulty in securing specialist advice on the best methods of organising these groups, how machinery can equitably be pooled, how expenses can be shared, etc. I think our national agricultural advisory service could and should examine the possibilities of farm groups, as they are called&mdash;groups of farmers working co-operatively&mdash;to see how far these groups have succeeded, where they have made mistakes and how a clearcut policy aimed at encouraging co-operation among farmers can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>One of the big snags in the advisory services is that instructors are appointed on a temporary basis at first.  I know an instructor who was a temporary instructor for ten years.  This system of appointing agricultural instructors on a temporary basis is very bad.  It leads to mobility on the part of the instructors. They have to move from one county to another and when an instructor has spent a number of years in a particular county, for example in a dairying county, he has acquired a considerable amount of knowledge of local problems, and not merely technical problems but social and human problems as well.  To secure permanent appointment he has, perhaps, to move to another part of the country where an entirely different system of farming is practised.  I know of two temporary instructors who organised co-operative farming groups of the type to which I was referring a while ago and having put in a tremendous amount of work and having been very successful in both cases the instructors were appointed permanently in another county far removed from the county in which they had been working.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> The part of the Minister's speech relating to the dairying industry is of particular interest to me as this is the type of farming practised in my constituency. The Minister's figures indicated that milk production in 1966 was substantially up and that this year it would be up still further.  However, the Minister makes no reference to certain problems which have now come to light as a result of this increase in milk production.  I have here a report from the <i>Limerick Weekly Echo</i> of 27th of this month which states that there is large scale milk dumping.  It says that thousands of gallons of skim milk are being dumped at present, much of it in the Limerick area, because nothing can be done with surplus supplies which are increasing yearly.  The report goes on to say that this year the wastage has increased considerably due largely to a decrease in the number of pigs.  Here we have skim milk being poured down the drain and a short distance away we have a bacon factory having to close its doors because of a shortage of pigs.</P>
    <P>This is a serious position.  As far as I can recall, there is nothing in the Minister's speech to show that there are any plans for disposing of the surplus of skim milk.  Numerous farmers have complained to me in recent weeks that the creameries are not taking the amount of skim milk which the farmers are prepared to give them.  It is a great pity and it is another indication of the type of agricultural policy we have had for a good number of years, particularly in recent years, whereby, as I have already pointed out, plans are made to increase production in certain lines and when production has been increased to the expected level, or higher, we are faced immediately with problems of a surplus.  As far as I can gather from the information at my disposal this is a difficulty in the skim milk powder export market. Although the progress made by the skim milk powder industry, and the milk powder industry generally in recent years has been satisfactory, we seem to have reached a limit now and other methods of utilising economically surplus skim milk will have to be devised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> In my own area, I know of no more economic method of disposing surplus skim milk than feeding it to pigs. Some months ago I submitted a memorandum to the Minister, following the closing of Matterson's Bacon Factory in Limerick, in which I expressed my concern at the fact that here we had one of the oldest established industries, an industry with an international reputation for the quality of its products, having to close down and 120 men being put out of employment for the simple reason that there was not an adequate supply of pigs to keep that factory in production.  I suggested that the Department of Agriculture and the Pigs and Bacon Commission should explore immediately the possibilities of establishing a large-scale pig production co-operative in the Limerick area.  I had in mind that in Limerick city we have one of the largest milk processing factories at Lansdowne, and that throughout County Clare there is a large number of dairy farmers and most of the creameries in County Clare are under the control of the Dairy Disposal Company.  I felt that this would be a way of ensuring that the remaining two bacon factories in Limerick would be able to continue production.  The Minister informed me that he was not satisfied that co-operative fattening units provided a satisfactory method of pig production.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, who is sitting here, knows as well as I do, and in fact knows a lot better, the example in his constituency, in the Glen of Aherlow, where co-operative pig production has been successfully engaged in.  The Minister informed me that he was having an examination carried out of the existing pig fattening units and the co-operative pig production units. There is nothing in his speech about this survey.  There is no indication of what the Minister's intentions are, beyond a mention of an increase of a few shillings per cwt in the price of pigs.  It has been proved very conclusively that the idea of organising pig production on co-operative lines is a good idea, one that has been put into practice in a number of different <Col N="1726" /> areas.  I mentioned the one in the Glen of Aherlow but I understand that there is also a very successful one in Galway. This method whereby the farmer undertakes to keep the sows and produce the bonhams and the co-operative fattening station undertakes to buy the bonhams at fixed prices could not be more rational.  I believe the only way to increase pig production is to put it on co-operative lines.  When the Minister is replying, I hope he will give us some information regarding his intention and that of his Department concerning this most important question of pig production.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that we have bacon industries closing down.  I understand a second one, in Tralee, has now closed down.  At the time of the closure of Matterson's, I happened to be in Manchester where I was invited to a reception at the Córas Tráchtála office a few days after the closure of the factory.  Chatting to some people who import food products from Ireland, I found that every one of them expressed amazement at the closing and asked what was wrong that we had allowed an industry processing raw material of the hinterland in this renowned agricultural area and producing products which are known and which some of these people had been buying for 50 years, to go by the board.  My answer was that the factories closed because we have no agricultural policy.  I feel very strongly about the question of co-operation.  I mentioned this on previous Agriculture Estimate debates.  Perhaps I have a chip on my shoulder about it but I certainly intend to continue pressing for this method of organisation as long as I am here.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made by the co-operative movement here.  We have the example of co-operative creameries and co-operative livestock marts, and there are others, but in this country co-operation seems to stop short at the farmer's gate; it has not entered the farmer's yard.  I repeat that I am convinced&mdash;and I think most people familiar with the social and economic situation in rural Ireland will agree&mdash; that one way in which the small farmers can be helped to survive is by showing them how they can <Col N="1727" /> organise themselves on co-operative lines to produce more efficiently.  This has not been done and I greatly fear, having heard the Minister's speech, that there is no intention of facing up to the situation.</P>
    <P>I have been referring to the dairying industry and I went off at a slight tangent, but I feel so strongly about the way the Government are neglecting to apply the principles of co-operation to Irish agriculture that I believe if they drop the idea we are wasting our time talking about agriculture and about western development and the survival of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Our milk production has shown a considerable increase both as regards milk delivered to creameries in 1966 compared with the previous year and the amount delivered to creameries in 1967 to date which shows a considerable increase also.  Unfortunately, just as the heifer scheme led to a chaotic situation in the cattle industry, the increased milk production is leading to certain difficulties in the disposal of skim milk.  The Minister refers in his speech to the production of quality milk and the incentives which the Government have provided and the additional incentives which are now being provided for quality milk production. He said that last year the results of the creamery milk quality grading scheme indicate that 48 per cent of the milk qualified for the special allowance in the past year as against 42 per cent in the previous year.  He says these results are very encouraging and that he expects about 55 per cent of the milk delivered to creameries will reach the requisite standard in the current year.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees on the need to improve milk quality.  It becomes a much more vital matter with the increase in milk output.  The additional 1d per gallon this year will help and the grant for milk coolers will be of considerable assistance.  The big difficulty as regards milk quality and the problem of the methylene blue test is the availability of adequate water supplies on farms. I am informed on reliable authority that no matter how high the standard of hygiene reached in milk production, <Col N="1728" /> unless the milk is quickly cooled to a certain temperature there is very little likelihood of the milk passing the three-hour methylene blue test and no hope at all of it passing the five-hour test.  In some areas the five-hour test is applied and if the milk qualifies the farmers receive an additional bonus from the processing factory concerned. We must endeavour to bring up this figure of 48 per cent for the quantity of milk qualifying.  The Minister expects that this year it will reach 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are other problems in milk production also which I am pleased to see the Minister has mentioned in this speech.  He refers to certain steps which are and will be taken to eliminate certain diseases, such as mastitis, which is a terrible scourge when it strikes a dairy herd.  In certain creamery areas forward-looking managers and forward-looking committees have been carrying out mastitis herd tests in recent times where samples are taken and analysed in a laboratory and the recommendation sent back to the farmers at a very small fee.  This is an excellent service and one which should be encouraged and assisted by the Government if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to the re-organisation of the creamery industry.  This subject was dynamite a year or one and a half years ago.  It seems that for the past 12 months very little has been heard about it.  A certain amount of re-organisation has been taking place and I believe further re-organisation will take place.  I was very critical last year when speaking on this Estimate and especially in regard to the IAOS in regard to the question of the dairy farmers who got the impression they were being stampeded into accepting something and adopting something about which they had not been properly advised and on which they were not fully informed.</P>
    <P>There is a notable change in attitude now on the part of the majority of dairy farmers and creamery committees towards this whole question of re-organisation.  It is something which will create certain difficulties, particularly <Col N="1729" /> in the matter of the Dairy Disposal Company.  I have referred to the fact that the Dairy Disposal Company do not seem to be able to compete with co-operatively-owned creamery units. The position is getting worse.  I know a case in my constituency where farmers in one townland are sending their milk to the branch creamery of a large co-operative processing unit. The farmers in an adjoining townland are sending their milk to a branch of the Dairy Disposal Company.  The farmers who are unfortunate enough to be sending their milk to the Dairy Disposal Company branch are receiving 6d per gallon less for top quality milk.  This differential is ridiculous. I cannot see why the Dairy Disposal Company which is a semi-State body, cannot be as efficient as a co-operative enterprise.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the Dairy Disposal Company, there is another industry I should like to refer to which is administered by the Dairy Disposal Company.  It is an ancillary industry which comes under the control of the Dairy Disposal Company and it is the worst example of inefficiency I have ever seen.  I do not want to mention the name of the industry for a reason that will be obvious in a few moments.  The industry I referred to has been in production since 1926.  No attempt has been made to modernise this industry or to do anything to increase production with the result that this particular industry is under the threat of closure for the past six months.</P>
    <P>I had discussions with some of the officials of the Dairy Disposal Company regarding this industry and I submitted a memorandum five and a half months ago.  I am still awaiting some indication from the Dairy Disposal Company as to what they propose to do with this particular industry.  The reason why I am not publicly mentioning this industry is that whatever little benefit this industry has would be destroyed if it were publicly known that it was in difficulties.  I want the Minister to take up this matter.  The Minister and his predecessor know this industry. <Col N="1730" /> The Minister's predecessor visited the industry some months ago.  I now want some indication as to what will be the future of this industry which employs 100 people or so.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the prospects for agriculture in the EEC.  He really stated the obvious and there was nothing really original in his speech regarding the EEC.  I believe there is a tendency to exaggerate the benefits that might be available if and when we join the European Economic Community. I believe our prospects in regard to the dairy industry will be good.  Dairy production is not merely vital to my own constituency, it is vital to the whole future economy of this country.  I understand that there are no quantitative restrictions within the EEC against imports from non-EEC countries but there is what one could call a levy or a threshold price.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Irish dairy industry will reap certain benefits in the EEC provided the ordinary Irish dairy farmer is put in the position of producing top quality milk and our processing units become fully efficient and that we can produce quality milk products which will compare with the products of other dairy producing countries.  If we can do this, I am convinced that there is a reasonably bright future for dairy products in the EEC.  There is a situation that the average price for milk at present in the EEC, if I can correctly recall the figure, is 3/2d to 3/4d a gallon.  If we enter the EEC and our creamery milk producers get 3/2d per gallon for milk, it will represent an increase of 50 per cent.  There would be no problem regarding shortage of supply or of our capacity to avail of the opportunities that will be presented there.</P>
    <P>The progress made by An Bord Bainne in the British market, particularly the Kerrygold campaign, clearly indicates that we can produce dairy products as efficiently, and of as high a quality, as Denmark or New Zealand, or any other dairy producing country.  Provided our dairy farmers are assisted in the same way as the dairy farmers of Denmark are assisted by their Government to produce quality milk efficiently, and provided <Col N="1731" /> the rationalisation and re-organisation of the creamery industry is proceeded with, I believe there is a bright future for the Irish dairying industry in the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is another problem to which very little reference is made in the Minister's speech, the question of agricultural credit.  There is considerable dissatisfaction among the farming community in general regarding the availability of credit from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I am informed that dairy farmers who went to the Agricultural Credit Corporation this spring for money to purchase additional cows, and who agreed to instruct their creamery manager to deduct monthly payments from their milk supply which would guarantee the repayment of the loan, were refused these credit facilities on the ground that they were already heavily committed. The extraordinary situation is that having failed to obtain credit facilities from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, many of these farmers went to independent commercial finance houses and in the very same conditions and terms of agreement, got all the facilities they needed, with one difference, that they had to pay probably three or four times the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where farmers who had been turned down by the Agricultural Credit Corporation succeeded in getting loans from commercial finance houses and, as a result, were able to increase their herd by five or six, or up to ten in some cases.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation will have to play a much more active part in the development of Irish agriculture.  I understand that agricultural credit here is dearer than in any other agricultural country in western Europe.  I understand the average rate of interest on loans for agricultural development in Denmark ranges from one to two per cent, and this is the average rate in most agricultural countries.  I also feel that when loans were being made freely available a few years ago, a certain amount of unwise borrowing was indulged in.  I know, from what I can gather from speaking to farmers, that <Col N="1732" /> a big problem in keeping up the repayments is the high rate of interest charged.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to examine this whole question of agricultural credit much more carefully and the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have to buck up and realise that unless our farmers get adequate credit facilities in many cases, they will go out of business altogether.  There is considerable dissatisfaction among the farming community with the attitude of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>I understand also that only ten per cent of the total number of farmers have obtained loans from the ACC. With your permission, Sir, I should like to refer to an article in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> of 27th May.  It deals with agricultural credit and says that the great majority of our farmers are in need of capital.  Yet, how many have availed of ACC loans?  The figure is not more than ten per cent. It is a remarkably low figure and is certainly no credit to our advisory services who are foremost in the campaign to get these ideas across. The writer of this article blames the agricultural advisory services for the fact that more farmers have not availed of the facilities provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Agricultural Institute.  When speaking on this Estimate last year, I criticised the Institute very severely on the ground that the vast amount of research work which was being carried out by them was not reaching the farmers.  I expressed doubt that the result of this research work was being practically applied on Irish farms or, if it were, the results were not very striking. I have since taken trouble to investigate the work of the Agricultural Institute. I may have been over-critical.  A vast amount of money is being spent on research work and I am doubtful if the results of this research are proving, and will prove in the future, of great benefit to the average farmer.  There are farms&mdash;model farms, economic research farms&mdash;test farms I think they are called&mdash;being operated by the Institute, reports of which are produced every year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> In those reports there are fantastic figures for output; fantastic figures of production per acre, <i>et cetera.</i>  But, of course, the snag is the amount of money poured into those farms by way of fertilisers, reseeding and all the modern management techniques.  While it is possible for a body such as the Agricultural Institute to engage in financial expenditure to such an extent, the average farmer could not do so. He could not possibly hope to lay his hands on adequate finance to invest the same amount of money, per acre, on his own farm.  I have no doubt that if the average farmer had the same financial resources available to him as these research stations, he would produce results.  I have been told of a case where as high as six cwts. of fertiliser per acre are applied in Golden Vale land on a certain Agricultural Institute farm and, of course, the resulting grass production is fantastic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be fair about this matter of the Agricultural Institute.  I know that in certain lines or fields of research very interesting results have been produced but I know also that in other fields of research results are being produced which have already been produced by research stations in Britain and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in favour of agricultural research but I think the Agricultural Research Institute should turn its attention more to seeking a solution, not of the technical problems of agricultural production but to the economic and social problems.  There is a rural economy division in the Agricultural Institute which has done a certain number of surveys.  Greater attention should be given to soil and <Col N="1734" /> the carrying out of surveys of land utilisation, and of the co-operation, to which I referred earlier, where a group of small farmers can combine or co-operate with one another to produce more effectively.  I do not know whether the Agricultural Institute has carried out any research into the application of co-operative techniques in agricultural production.  The Agricultural Institute has done some excellent work.  I refer particularly to the soil survey carried out in County Limerick where very valuable information was compiled over a lengthy period and placed at the disposal of the local agricultural advisory officer; but there are lines of research which are, as yet, untouched.  In some lines the surface has been barely scratched, while, in others, a considerable amount of work has been done.  Perhaps the Institute could re-organise itself and concentrate a better effort along lines which would be of more practical benefit to the farming community of this country.</P>
    <P>I was very critical last year of the work of the Agricultural Institute.  I have investigated the situation since and I agree there is a need for an Agricultural Research Institute.  I agree that very valuable work has been done by the Institute but I am wondering if research could be pursued along other lines.</P>
    <P>There is another problem we discuss quite frequently and about which doubts are expressed; that is, is there a lack of co-operation or co-ordination between the three main bodies engaged in agricultural advisory work; the Agricultural Advisory Service, the Agricultural Institute and the Faculty of Agriculture in the National University? I am told there could be far more co-operation between these three bodies.  I am told there could be greater co-ordination of the work engaged in by the three bodies concerned, that they could co-operate more effectively in channelling information to the local agricultural adviser.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
