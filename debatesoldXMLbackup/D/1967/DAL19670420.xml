      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is, and it is to that subject I wish to address myself. Let me say at the outset that I observe in this morning's newspapers what I consider to be a reasonable suggestion made for the benefit of the country and of the Government Party. Now, as we well know, no opportunity is lost by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and his colleagues to instruct their Civil Service staffs to prepare for them the lengthiest possible speeches, extolling the virtues of the Government, for delivery to an unsuspecting public on every conceivable occasion, usually after the consumption of substantial dinners. If it is not a dinner, then a cocktail party will do.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the Cabinet. So great is their anxiety to deliver themselves of these lengthy exhortations, usually directed at the workers to work harder, that no opportunity is lost to deliver them. As I mentioned before in the House, on one occasion I happened to be straying through the lobby of a certain hotel when I heard coming over the intercommunication system the notunpleasant, gentle western accents of a certain Minister indulging in the usual exhortations, and in the background one could hear&mdash;at 11 o'clock in the morning&mdash;the soft tinkle of ice against glass.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, on this occasion the Minister was declaring open a car wash. Beat that if you can for a ministerial obligation&mdash;opening a car wash. We all know why he was doing it&mdash;because the party interested in the car wash was concerned with a certain organisation to which I will come shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly. This report which appeared in the paper struck me as being very apposite in the context of the state of the country as revealed in the Budget Statement. The suggestion is that in the light of the anxiety and preparedness of Ministers to be present when industries are being opened, would it not be only right and proper that they should show a similar anxiety to be present when they are being closed? The closings of industries under this Government have assumed a significance far greater than their openings because they were more numerous within the past couple of years than was the case hitherto. I do not want to turn, as it were, the knife in the wound, by overstressing the condition of hotels which has been canvassed here pretty widely but might I suggest that the more proficient of the hearse chasers in the Government Party whose path to Dáil Éireann is dotted with tombstones might be <Col N="2084" /> appointed to the task of attending at the closing down of industries. However, that is just a thought which occurred to me on my way here this morning, having read the papers.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that in any Budget Statement some effort would be made by the Government to ensure that the ground rents legislation for which the Labour Party was initially responsible, and in relation to which I myself moved a Private Members' Bill in this House, the purpose of which was defeated by a tactic of the Minister in appointing a Commission in order to stall action on that matter, would be taken into consideration. I had hoped that the effect of the Ground Rents Bill would not be negatived in the fashion which has now become apparent according to a reply given by the Minister for Financ. Apparently persons who wish to purchase the fee simple of their property are liable to Schedule A tax. This appears to me to be the creation of an injustice for the people concerned, and a perpetuation of the evil of ground rents in another form. It has long been accepted by most Parties that ground rents, as such, have no moral justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been reduced to the hard core.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, this House which is allegedly a legislative assembly is rapidly becoming little more than a letter-writing academy, not due to any fault of the Deputies but due to the fault of the Government in permitting this to happen. I want to say as an aside that it is time, if we are to do justice to this Parliament and to the people outside, that some reorganisational steps were taken to remove from the shoulders of Deputies the colossal drudgery of having to spend nearly all their time writing letters when they should be participating in debates and giving consideration to important matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to come back to the question of ground rents. Most Parties have long felt that there is no moral basis for continuing this system. It cannot be said too often that probably the <Col N="2085" /> greatest revolution&mdash;one of the greatest in Europe and without a doubt the greatest revolution that has occurred in this country&mdash;was that achieved by Micheal Davitt when he secured the land for the farmers&mdash;not by Parnell as some people would have it but Michael Davitt and the Land League. The left-overs, as it were, of that problem are to be seen in the ground rents which operate still in the urban and municipal areas of the country.</P>
    <P>Davitt, with his tremendous vitality and genius, broke the power of the landlords. Nothing that has occurred in Irish history can compare with that&mdash; nothing. It broke the economic power of the landlords. Yet we still have to this day a situation in which people have to pay out their hard earned money in ground rents. This is a mediaeval tax upon their industry, upon their energies, toil and effort. It has long been accepted that this should not be so. It was hoped that through the efforts of the Labour Party in the introduction of the Ground Rents Bill relief was about to come. The number of people affected by ground rents is something of a post-war phenomenon. I suppose that before the last war the number of people who felt the impact of ground rents and were agitated about them was relatively small, but with the tremendous advance in house building and house purchase, the building of houses under the SDA Act which was promoted by the inter-Party Government, continued for a time and finally stopped by Fianna Fáil, a new class of people were affected by ground rents. The benefits which this legislation was supposed to confer have been vitiated by the fact that such people are now deemed liable for Schedule A tax&mdash;in other words, property tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being subjected to continuous interruptions and I can hardly be blamed if I seek to deal with those interruptions as best I can. I was very disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity of the Budget to remit this tax altogether. I do not believe it can represent any great amount of money to the Exchequer but it represents a hardship on the class of people concerned because this particular group, the house purchasers, the people who have to save money and sacrifice many of the pleasures of life when they are preparing for marriage and saving money to make a deposit on a house, are people who deserve great consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people make very little demands on the country and I feel they are very badly treated. Such people&mdash;I am thinking of the young couple planning marriage in this city and hoping to buy a house because in the ordinary course of events it is not reasonable to <Col N="2087" /> think that they will be housed by Dublin Corporation until they have a family&mdash;are facing a gangster setup. There is a combination of so-called house builders and developers who hold them up to ransom and squeeze the last halfpenny out of their pockets.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House an example of what is happening. This Budget provides me with the opportunity of doing this. A young couple go to a builder or a building company&mdash;the Minister for Local Government is fully aware of the procedure; other Members of the House more fully aware of it&mdash;because they want a house. They are offered a house in a suburban area. What is the price of that house today? This young couple are lucky if they get a house which runs to between £4,000 and £5,000.</P>
    <P>The average person seeking to purchase a house is very often a tradesman or a white collar worker who is not earning a great deal of money. The deposit which must be paid to the builder works out in the neighbourhood of £300 or £400 apart from the State grant. The total deposit will run from £500 to £600. I ask anybody to think of the effort which it takes any young couple to assemble that amount of money? I challenge any Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>To assemble it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to save that money, £600, out of a salary of £1,500 a year. The people I speak of do not earn £1,500 a year. That gives you an idea of the size of the problem. This young couple have to find £500 or £600 to deposit with the builder. Now what happens? They sign a contract. There will be small print in the contract as is usual in relation to such documents. The builder sets about building the house. The county council loan is applied for and is probably sanctioned. The builder probably has political friends who will put pressure on and make sure the grant will be sanctioned but there may be some delay in the payment of the loan.</P>
      <P>The first payment is usually made when the house reaches roof level. There is a roofing grant and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> The couple purchasing the house are, by this time, living either in a flat, if they are lucky enough to find a flat at a rent of from £3 to £5 a week in this city at present, or they may be living with the in-laws. I invite any Deputy to consider the concentration of misery that living with in-laws entails. All of us are in touch with people seeking houses. Is it not true that there seems to be some fundamental natural law which forbids the habitation of one house by two families and particularly by two women? I do not know what it may be like in the Parliamentary Secretary's area but I have discussed this with many Deputies and they say that the housing problem is aggravated by young couples having to live with in-laws.</P>
    <P>Life for those young people is pretty miserable. They are waiting to go into the house on which they have paid a deposit of about £600. What is the builder doing? He is extracting from them&mdash;I am speaking of a specific builder whom I shall name if I have to in this House because I think it is a scandalous act he is perpetrating on the people of this city&mdash;and squeezing interest out of them while he is waiting to be paid by the county council the loans and the housing grants. Even if the house is finished, this man turns the key in the lock. The purchaser is not let into the house even to inspect it.</P>
    <P>The builder concerned&mdash;this is known to the Minister for Local Government&mdash;is extracting and squeezing interest&mdash;he had not even lent money&mdash;from the unfortunate house purchaser. At the end of it all the house is standing idle. I attended a Departmental inquiry some time ago and I asked a builder who was present how many houses he had idle in these circumstances. He told me that 60 houses were finished and locked up. There was nobody living in them. That man was drawing interest from the people who had paid him the deposit. He had not lent money to them. He was waiting on this money from the county council. I ask you if that is not Rachmanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a new word. It is an old trick. Were it not for the fact that I do not want to be too personal there would be red ears around the corridors of this House this evening. I will be personal unless there is something done about it. I am uttering a warning now. There is nothing which will compel me to condone what is going on in the suburbs of this city. The Minister for Local Government with his loud moryah talk about land values is trying to conceal the facts, which is what he is doing. Building lands are at extortionate prices because racketeers of builders such as I have described are putting up the price of land. The Minister for Local Government will not believe that but I hope he will read my words. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary knows what I am referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not actually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall let it rest at that for the moment. I could not but avail of the opportunity to express my indignation at what is going on. The unfortunate young people just married and about to start a family and battling with life are finding it difficult to get a house. When they do get into their house, the repayments amount to anything from £5 to £7 a week. Imagine taking on that loan, as they do. They are looking forward to life with great hopes, but here they are cornered and trapped by those unscrupulous gangsters who are bleeding them white. It is not good enough. This Budget does not give any indication of relief for that class of person, the house purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are varying views as to the value of the rates concessions to the farmers. I am not qualified to speak about the real benefits these concessions may confer. They may be great or may be small, but I do say that the Minister in the preparation of his Budget might very well have thought about the ratepayers in the SDA type of houses who live in the suburbs of this city and in the other conurbations throughout the country. These people suffer greatly. However, the farmers <Col N="2090" /> are best able to express for themselves whether what was done for them was just or not. It may very well be that the young member of the Fianna Fáil Party who, I understand, is being groomed for the Department of Agriculture&mdash;Deputy Dowling&mdash;may give us an insight into this. I understand he is a man of very radical views, particularly in so far as the Minister's approach to the pig problem is concerned. The matter of production concerns Deputy Dowling very much and I understand that he suggested solutions to do with the crossing of pigs with rabbits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">

      <P>The Deputy is suffering from myxomatosis, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Carty, one can only say that it is groomed he should be&mdash;currycombed. To get back to the rates remission, there is an unanswerable case for relief for the kind of families who live in SDA houses, particularly those who have taken up occupation in the last decade or so. Local authorities are enabled to make a certain partial remission. They stop one-tenth of the rates per year on a sliding scale until the rates finally become fully payable after the tenth year. This system applies to families at the beginning; it starts when they enter the house. They are usually small families, perhaps with one child or no children at all, but by the time the tenth year is reached, they are families of greater size.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the matter of costs in relation to children travelling to and from school, medical expenses and wear and tear of footwear and clothing. Everybody knows that in or about that time the breadwinner is hardpressed to make ends meet and that his wife is harassed with the problem of bills coming in. I would have thought that the Minister for Finance might well have looked at this very important and urgent social problem and give some relief to those people. It appears now that you can get out of this Government just as much benefits <Col N="2092" /> or relief as may be measured against the amount of a row you kick up in the publichouse. If those people to whom I refer were able and willing to organise themselves and exert pressure as other groups of society with considerably less justification have done, I have no doubt they would be remembered in the Budget speech and would get some benefit. Perhaps that is a criticism of them more than anything else but it is something they will have to think about because I feel they are being very badly treated and made the subject, very often, of false propaganda.</P>
      <P>For instance, we often hear descriptions and see pictures painted of the great salaries being earned by people living in the cities as against those in the countryside, and how much better off the city worker is as compared with his counterpart in the country. And there are people who believe this, who think it is true; a lot of people who say it think it is true. Then there is another big group who know it is not true but pretend it is because it suits their political book. But the facts are that the cost of living today, and the problems of life, bear most heavily on the type of person to whom I have been referring, that is, the housepurchaser, or the industrial worker in the city, the industrial worker in the city of Dublin who is not given any relief worth talking about in this Budget, who has average earnings of £12 a week&mdash;that is the official figure issued from the Government's Statistics Office&mdash;and, of course, that is put very often against the alleged income of residents in rural areas on £5 a week. The Parliamentary Secretary will know better than I do whether people exist in this country on as low a figure as £5 a week and, if they do, it is a scandalous thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I can say this: there is no section of society which registers as much solid, measured, unremitting, accounted for, card-punched, work for that £12 a week as does the industrial worker. The industrial worker clocks in and, if he loses time, he loses money. He cannot just stall during the day at his leisure as do those in other occupations, <Col N="2093" /> and as is really the case, because it is a form of life I do not really fall out with since man is not an animal. But the industrial worker must work solidly during the 40 or 44 hours per week and must keep his nose to the grindstone or he will know all about it. I wonder is this true of such other sections, who make such a loud clamour? I wonder if in fact the number of hours worked by the various sections of society were examined who would come out as working hardest of all? I make a modest claim that it would be the industrial worker who is the only one I can see who must be at it all the time.</P>
    <P>As is usually the case in the unbalanced world in which we live, the criticism for what is our stated lack of production is invariably directed against the worker, the industrial worker. I notice some degree of moral courage in this matter beginning to emerge in certain quarters with the diminution of the importance of the rural vote. Politicians, as we know, particularly opportunist politicians&mdash; and, of course, every politician, to some extent, is an opportunist&mdash;lose entirely the little grain of divinity called moral courage. Some lose it to a greater or lesser extent but there has been some evidence of a little growth in this in recent years, as I say, coincident with the diminution of numbers in rural Ireland and coincident also with the growth of importance of the industrial workers and the population of the towns and cities, their importance as an electoral voting force. I will bet that when the predicted, forecast and prophesied day comes, when the completely undesirable situation will be reached that rural Ireland has only a very small percentage of the population, little will be said in this House of any account of their doing. I mentioned last night that the world trend&mdash;an undesirable one but none the less inevitable trend&mdash;seems to be towards centralisation and departure from the agricultural areas. It is easy to be sentimental about this, of course, and think of how attractive are the old whitewashed, thatched, mudwalled cabins made out of yellow marl taken out of the ground.</P>

      <P>There must be some liberality in the matter. If we discuss finance purely in a technical sense, we will get nowhere; certainly, the people will feel more disgusted with us than they now are and that is a fate which none of us wishes. Therefore, if we are permitted as we have traditionally been permitted, to talk about the various problems which afflict the country, to discuss the omissions from the Budget, what we think should be in it, as well as general Government policy, it can be said that when Deputy Jack Lynch, that very <Col N="2095" /> affable, benign but indeed worthy man, came to power and, in doing so, established himself as the only contender in a race who won backing away, a great &ldquo;lep&rdquo; forward was foretold. I was looking for this great &ldquo;lep&rdquo; forward and have been looking for it. We had at that time the conflict and the struggle for power between the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, an estimable young man, whom I will describe as an Old Guard Fianna Fáilnik and by his side that keeper of the Fenian flame&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps my methods of expression are tortuous, but I think I can bring you to a conclusion eventually. I merely want to say that is past. A great &ldquo;lep&rdquo; forward has not occurred. In fact, we might very well benefit now from a third effort in that literary country of mystery and imagination which was landmarked by the First and Second Programmes of Economic Expansion. We now need a third prophecy in collective calculation which might be entitled, if you like, &ldquo;The Thoughts of Jack&rdquo;. We need something on that line. We are getting into the doldrums. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary must feel this. He looks like a man who feels he is getting into the doldrums&mdash;politically, I mean, of course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the name to be applied to the theorising the Government have indulged in. You can grasp it, if you try, by thinking of faith healing. If you say something is going to happen, and say it often enough, be the hokey it will happen. This is the Christian Science theory. It is only this which can explain the theorems of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, nothing else. As I have mentioned many times, there is no plan in it. I do not want to bother the House by repeating myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had no mention in the Budget Statement either of a matter which is surely of vital importance, that is, the matter of redundancy and what is generally described as manpower policy. Again, this is part of this theory of growth, which is another name for political confidence trickery. If you give something a grandiloquent title, it will suggest to people that the Government really have a forceful policy and are really doing something about the problems referred to. Manpower policy: that conjures up in the mind virile, active, imaginative young men setting about the solution of the unemployment and redundancy which have been created by the closing down or reduction of industries and are about to be created in greater number, as far as one can see, as we progress towards what has been euphemistically called the liberalisation of trade, the dropping of barriers and eventual participation <Col N="2097" /> in the intensively competitive commercial world of the EEC.</P>
    <P>But what has happened in fact? There is no mention in this Budget of anything happening in regard to this question of redundancy. I feel strongly on this because it is occurring in my own constituency in the paper industry. Last year the workers in that industry, having endured a very long stoppage, were told that if they agreed to certain changes, which involved working longer hours and a completely different system of work, it would certainly mean more employment and greater security of employment. In spite of that, there is redundancy in the paper making industry in my constituency. Potez has been mentioned so many times here that it has become somewhat hackneyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even that handful will lose their jobs. That is the kind of atmosphere in which the Government are operating, that people have become terrified of losing what little security they have. God knows, it is small enough. In the Budget Statement also there are the usual vague generalisations, which can mean anything or nothing, concerning capital expenditure. The very phrase is enough to clear any Dáil.</P>

I want to suggest that there is a select group in this country, hidden, not advertised except when that is absolutely essential, who operate in such a fashion that the Government and the whole apparatus of Government are no more than a front to them for their own personal enrichment.

      <P>Sure it is. What has been done by this Department except create, as it has created, a certain degree of public unrest, public unrest to the extent that the Minister for Labour has suggested the use of coercion against the workers, and not alone has he suggested it but, to put it correctly, he has almost gone to the extent of using the already existing Fianna Fáil legislation for coercion against the workers? In regard to matters I have <Col N="2101" /> raised here&mdash;the question, for instance, of employers giving a chance of a living to disabled people&mdash;the attitude of the Minister for Labour has not been made known at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair <Col N="2102" /> appreciates my difficulty. I was talking about the Ministry of Labour and the lack of any evidence, to me at any rate, to show that it is serving the purpose for which is was originally set up. We, in the Labour Party, welcomed the announcement that the Ministry of Labour was to be established. To us, it was the resumption of a great tradition. The Countess was Minister for Labour; Mr. Joe McGrath was Minister for Labour. The idea of a Minister for Labour was dropped and was not taken up again until comparatively recently. We felt it was a progressive step. This was a young man. Surely his mind could not have been completely stultified by the impact of the flood of Fianna Fáil indoctrination? Surely he could not yet be tainted because of mixing with the inbred Fianna Fáil society? We might perhaps, see some progress. What did we get? Nothing but a series of remarks designed to intimidate, remarks made in the most comfortable and luxurious surroundings, remarks threatening what the workers would get, and they would get it in the neck, unless they toed a certain line.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the workers, I am certain that the wage earners in our society are contributing more to the gross national product than any other group. If the Minister for Labour does not know that, then it is time he learned it. Irish workers, workers anywhere, are responsible people. There has been talk about the number of days lost through strikes, and so on. Everybody deplores strikes, and no one more than we do. The people largely responsible for strikes are, as a general rule, the managers who tolerate bad labour relations. Up to comparatively recently the idea of a trade union existing in many firms was regarded as a Utopian conception, especially outside Dublin. I remember, when I was young, trying to organise the workers in a certain town&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can name them, if the Parliamentary Secretary wishes. One was in the area in which he lives. All the opposition was based on the <Col N="2103" /> idea that, if one suggested workers should be in a trade union, one was an anti-Christ. Very much so. One was out to destroy the whole basis of Irish Catholic civilisation. It did not matter if one went to Mass, or anything like that; that did not count. One was dealing with the gombeen man and he naturally had only one ambition, namely, to kill the trade union movement. But he did not succeed. No one can defeat the advance of knowledge&mdash; no one. Some of these same gombeen men are now rushing to take part in trade union seminars.</P>
      <P>With regard to the fact that there is no provision in the Budget for redundancy payments or for the retraining of workers, the situation gives cause for anxiety. Workers, as far as I can see, will be put out of employment as a result of this vaunted Free Trade Agreement which, let us face it, is no more than a second Act of Union. That is all. It is a complete recantation by Fianna Fáil. It is the quenching of the Fenian flame. Unemployment is bound to flow and there is no indication in the Budget as to how workers will be resettled. It puzzles me how any man who has spent the greater part of his life in a particular trade or industry &mdash;for instance, the car assembly industry&mdash;and who has reached middle age, or a little more, will be retrained for some other occupation. In what particular trade will he be retrained even if the opportunities are there and his services are required? We know very well that the demand simply does not exist. There are no jobs into which people can walk, much less the kind of jobs they have held for the best part of their lives. There is no opening, unless, of course, they take part in the mass emigration which has gone on. In that regard, it strikes me the time has now come at which we should rewrite, or paraphrase, Parnell's slogan: &ldquo;No nation has the right to set a boundary to the onward march of the nation to the mail boat&rdquo;.</P>

Shortly, the Irish will be able to travel to the Continent to provide, I suspect, cheap labour for the continental cartels which operate in the European Economic Community. No doubt they will be told when they are going that they are going to Christianise Europe.</P>

      <P>Let me come back to the point I was making. The Parliamentary Secretary can do what he likes with that: I am not concerned with words; I am interested in facts. The Minister for Health in his speech reported yesterday or the day before in the <i>Irish Times</i>, which is the paper I usually read, said that a comprehensive health service&mdash;these may not be his exact words; I am speaking from memory&mdash;such as operates in Britain would not be suitable here. It would not do here at all. I think he went on to suggest that it would be so enervating that it would destroy the national fibre and produced the usual arguments to the effect that such activity by the State robbed the people of personal initiative. You know the usual kind of Victoriana we get when any proposal is made for the <Col N="2106" /> benefit of a great many people. In this it is interesting to observe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I merely want to quote from it to show that all unsuspecting we have had in Deputy Flanagan the very soul of conservatism and we never thought it. One would not think that the Head of Christendom would be a revolutionary. It is not a reasonable proposition and one would therefore accept that whatever he had to say on world matters represented a fairly, shall we say, reserved viewpoint, to put it at its most extreme, a middleof-the-road political or social viewpoint. I would think it would be the most natural thing in the world that the Head of Christendom should be a conservative, but bedad Flanagan is more conservative than the Pope. In <i>Time</i> magazine, of April 7th, Pope Paul is quoted as saying in his Encyclical <i>Populorum Progressio:</i><i>On the Development of Peoples</i>&mdash;I know it sounds odd for me to be reading this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that a system has been constructed which considers profit as the key motive for economic progress, competition as the supreme lot of economics and private ownership as the means of production as an absolute right that has no limits and carries no corresponding social obligations.</P>
      <P>Did the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach take that in? It rather stymies the Parliamentary Secretary because it cuts across his deeply-held views about the obligations of private property and so on. I know very well that he, if his real mind were known, would subscribe more to the balance of what is in this report in <i>Time</i> magazine, which goes on impudently to attempt to criticise and castigate the head of Christendom for the expression of this very excellent and liberal thought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This danger of 750 out of 1,760 losing their jobs comes at the end of many years of continuous applicational effort by the Government to reduce CIE and the numbers employed in it to a shadow of its former self; this danger in spite of the fact that branch lines were chopped off left, right and centre, and that we had in occupation there an iron man who is now ironing out the affairs of RTE. When it came to the question of sacking he did not baulk. This also in spite of the assurance of the Minister for Transport and Power, who has often expressed his conviction, and expressed it as a conviction of the Government, that it did not matter what way a business was run, how much employment it gave, the main test being whether it was economically viable, meaning whether it made a profit or not. In spite of all that, the CIE workers at Inchicore, at Spa Road, are now being made to worry that they may lose their jobs. What will happen if they are disemployed?</P>

      <P>It is immaterial to me. It shows my dedication to the job that I intend to go on much further. I should like now to comment on the disastrous housing policy of the Government. Some of the Capo Mafiosi of the Mafia, the captains, the leaders of the Taca fold, are concerned with a piece of pretence known as the National Building Agency which I now propose to dissect. It is called a consortium. There are a few able and decent men associated with it but if one is to judge the rate of progress of this country on what we have seen of the production of this National Building Agency&mdash;let me repeat the phrase used by one of our most famous statesmen, another day, another time, before the emergence of either of the Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;if the National Building Agency is an example of how fast we are going to travel or how efficient our production will be, this country is doomed, as Mr. de Valera said on the eve of the 1948 election when he announced that if he did not get in the country was doomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This National Building Agency was set up in Ballymun. We have in housing in Dublin a problem far more serious than that which obtains anywhere else. Not only have Dublin Corporation to house the normal <Col N="2111" /> natural residents of Dublin, but they have also to house the fleeing refugees from the West, the South, the Midlands and the North&mdash;refugees from the effect of Fianna Fáil policy which is more deadly than Stuka bombers in some instances.</P>

      <P>They are very adaptable creatures. You would be surprised at how chameleon-like they are in their politics. They know what side their bread &ldquo;does be&rdquo; buttered on when they eventually find themselves here. This housing problem in Dublin has been aggravated by the fact that the old city within the canals started to collapse from old age. It started to disintegrate from old age. The old Georgian houses began to fall. It is over a century and a half since the days of the prosperity of their owners. As we know, they fell down upon little children in the streets and killed them. Dublin Corporation already had a very long housing list of some thousands seeking houses, and they were urged by public fears to institute a campaign for the destruction of houses the condition of which was in the least doubtful and which might at any time be thought to be in danger of collapsing. This resulted in an accumulation of housing applications to such an extent that we had 10,000 or 11,000 families on the list seeking accommodation urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people will be familiar with the expedient known as Griffith Barracks and the undesirable conditions in which families were separated. Heads of families had to live outside the barracks and the rest of the families had perforce to live in dormitories, and so on. This added to the accumulation of difficulties which surrounded this problem. This demanded urgent action. This was an emergency situation. The youngest Cabinet in Europe had the responsibility of doing something about it. I may say this situation would never have developed, were it not for the lassitude and laziness of certain Fianna Fáil Ministers who quite unjustifiably <Col N="2112" /> were put in office, and who fell asleep over their desks so far as the problem of Dublin housing was concerned, and remained like Peter Pan in that condition.</P>

It was hoped, that with the change there, with the arrival in the Custom House of my other constituency colleague and his appointment as Minister for Local Government, now at long last we might have a reasonable point of view put into operation in respect of Dublin city and Dublin county. After all, seeing that he represented Dublin county, it was reasonable to imagine that he would know the problems of Dublin county.</P>

      <P>Can I approach the subject then from another point of view? Indeed, I wish to approach it from another point of view and say that the money provided for housing in the Budget is by no means adequate to meet the problem as we see it, certainly in Dublin. I wish Deputy <Col N="2115" /> Dowling, who has now just come into the House, would consult with his co-conspirator from across the Shannon and arrange another interview with a few of his cumann friends in the Fianna Fáil Party and pretend they are a representative organisation, as he has done, non-political, and get some more money allocated for the provision of houses for the many hundreds who he must know are applicants for houses and who must wait for accommodation in the city because there is not enough money in this Budget to bring us within sight of the beginning of the end of this problem. I know Deputy Dowling does not give two hoots about those people. I know he is a cynical product of the Fianna Fáil machine and I know the very height of his ambition is to become, if he possibly can, a close associate of Cosa Nostra, the Mafia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. The proposal to make a very limited concession to the old aged in so far as bus travel is concerned is welcomed by us because, of course, we initiated it and the Government fought against it several months ago. I cannot understand why it is necessary for us to have to go to such extreme lengths to prod, push, shoulder and caiole the Government to do such a simple thing as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concession, if it can be dignified by that title, to the old aged, to be made in regard to the ESB, must, I am sure, have been a bitter pill for the Minister for Transport and Power to have to swallow. I am glad he was made to swallow it because time and time again he has shown all too clearly that his position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish people and his appreciation of the problems of the Irish people are remote. We were shown that when we <Col N="2117" /> originally put up the suggestion of free bus travel for the old aged. We see no reason why it should be limited. What advantage is there in limiting it to the valley periods when the buses are not deemed to be so busy? What advantage is there to CIE in that matter? We see no reason why it should be so. When we put up this proposal, we were conscious of the fact, and we felt strongly, that it was so small a thing that only a gross malevolently opposed political nature could have rejected it. Yet, it was rejected and here it is belatedly trotted out in the Budget. However, for these small mercies, one has to be thankful, but they are nothing compared with what is required. A much greater effort is required from the Government in so far as these old people are concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be that I will be made to appear a sentimentalist or that I am insincere in this matter. I have been speaking about these things most of my life, since I was about 16 years of age. Unlike some of the latter day halo patriots, I lost a considerable amount of time due to my political convictions. I spent my formative years travelling the highways and byways of this country organising the economically lowliest class in western Europe, the farm labourers who had no friends. I had the great privilege to work closely over many years with the late James Larkin, From him I learned and developed my political ideals and, let me put it frankly, any bias and prejudice I have. I am prejudiced in favour of the poor and the lowly and the downtrodden, and against the privileged. I have no doubt that no matter what I say in regard to these people it will be misrepresented and will be made the object of criticism by those who can see no further than the polling station.</P>
    <P>This Budget is fairly described as one designed to capture the maximum number of votes at the coming local elections. That is an understandable political exercise. No matter what Party are in power, they would do that, I suppose, except that it would not impinge in any way upon the general <Col N="2118" /> welfare and the problems of the nation. That is how I feel about it.</P>
    <P>If we are to get a solution to the great problems which beset us, and to the far greater ones confronting us, we need a far more radical approach to our economic state than we now have. A conscious organisation of society has been given as a definition of socialism&mdash;the conscious organisation of society. The thing should not be left to happen in a haphazard way. Man should at least control his own destinies to the extent of providing against bad times. The weaker sections who cannot help themselves should be enabled to help themselves to work for a living.</P>
    <P>This Government will not provide that. It is obvious to me that there is not the divine fire which brings about social change in the magnitude which certain situations demand. At times, indeed, the Government give the impression of being more of a flyboy of a Government than anything else, people who are more concerned with the capture of position than with the fate of the country. There have been jokes and exchange of pleasantries and unpleasantries, and insults perhaps, but most of us started out in the first place with the idea of doing good. For many, of course, the idea disappeared along the way and the determination became to do good only for oneself, but not everybody has lost the zeal which first provoked him into taking an interest in the welfare of his own people. Fianna Fáil as a Party are in the years of decline, whether they know it or not.</P>

I regret very much these unseemly interruptions. I believe Fianna Fáil are in their decline: I believe this to be true. I do not think that it is in the nature of things that a monopoly Party can last for ever. I never believed in the Thousand Year Reich.

      <P>Apart altogether from the double talk we have heard from the Labour benches and the ranting about the Budget by Fine Gael, we should examine this Budget by the yardstick the community will use to examine it and see what it is and what it means for them. The first reaction of the public to a Budget when it appears is: what extra taxation does it involve? That is, of course, a natural reaction: has income tax been increased, has the pint gone up, and so on? That is what they look for in the paper when the first report of the Budget appears, or when they hear it on the radio. In this Budget the increase in taxation has been purely minimal: 2d on the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes, a penny on the pint&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no increase in taxation, no increase in turnover tax, no increase in the wholesale tax, but that purely minimal taxation increase to which I have made reference and, for that minimal increase&mdash; and I say that advisedly, it is a minimal increase in taxation&mdash;there have been wholesale concessions to practically every section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2121" /> Dealing, first of all, with income tax, a very big concession has been granted &mdash;one, of course, that has often been sought by different Parties in this House&mdash;to those who have heavy medical expenses. No allowance was made in the past for hardship of that kind; you could get no relief in your income tax claim for money spent by way of medical expenses. That point has now been conceded and that, of course, must appear on the plus side of the Budget.</P>
    <P>There is greater relief for a taxpayer supporting, or helping to support a dependent relative; that is something everybody has pressed for for many years. There is an increased allowance to those who have to pay income tax for children under 11 years of age, which will mean, in the case of a taxpayer with a big family, considerable relief. I met somebody here in this House who told me that to him alone it would mean about £70 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but the Parliamentary Secretary said this man told him it would mean an increase of £70 a year to him. That would mean he would have to have ten or 11 children under 11 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Six children under 11 will mean £66; these are the figures he quoted to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, in areas like my <Col N="2122" /> own&mdash;where it is rather difficult to induce manufacturers to expand and extend their businesses&mdash;increased tax allowances are being given for new machinery, to encourage them to modernise plant and all the other factors which will enable them to expand their businesses.</P>
    <P>I have listed those things, as I see them, in the Budget&mdash;that is the fifth item of particular concern to the taxpayers. Then I come to something we have not adverted to enough, the 5/- a week increase for non-contributory old age pensioners, widows, and recipients of unemployment assistance. Other concessions have been granted to similar social welfare beneficiaries, those who draw the infectious diseases allowance, the DPMA, and all the other benefits administered by local authorities. But the kernel of the Budget which has appealed to me is the fact that the Minister showed great consideration for the old people, the old age pensioners who are living alone, often lonely and in remote places, by his decision to grant them free electricity and transport, nor has he forgotten other elderly people, retired public servants like national teachers, who worked for so many years and had to retire on low pensions based on the salary they were earning before their retirement, to whom he has seen fit to give a 12 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>In particular, the relief to the extent of £5 million granted to the farming community is something with which we are all very happy. I am happy with it, not because it affords any great relief to the larger farmers but to the small farmers, most of whom live in the western areas. There is to be total derating for all landholders with a poor law valuation of £20 and under. The relief has been scaled to help farmers up to £33 valuation on land. In my county 90 per cent of the farmers are under £20 valuation. While there are some over £20, the percentage is small. I heard a Fine Gael Deputy say in the House yesterday that he did not think the relief would be very considerable. I regret to say the rates in my county are <Col N="2123" /> running very near £4 in the £. To grant total relief to a farmer of £20 valuation means the sum of at least £16 per year.</P>
    <P>It is good to think that many of the reliefs granted down the years to farmers, particularly small farmers, were granted by this Government. Away back in the past, when there was a clamour from the farmers, a Cumann na nGaedheal Government decided to grant relief. Money was scarce at the time and the relief they saw fit to give was 2/6d in the £. That meant a lot to the big farmers at the time. Indeed, the greater benefit was enjoyed by the richer farmers. A man with £20 valuation at the time got 20 halfcrowns, while the man with £400 valuation got 400 halfcrowns, which in that period was a considerable sum. The pendulum is now swinging the other way and relief is being conferred on the smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>Another matter which affects the worker, particularly the rural worker who has a small holding and a low valuation, is the abolition of the employment period orders. Concessions also have been granted to the rural community in respect of milk and an increase in the guaranteed price dead weight for pigs.</P>
    <P>But the part of the Budget that appeals to me, as one who lives in the West, is that our area has been designated a special development area. We hear a lot about the flight from the West, saving the West and all that has been done to allay the decay of the West. In this Budget a particularly vigorous policy has been indicated and a programme will be embarked on to take practical steps to save the West. These practical steps mentioned by the Minister in his Budget Statement are of great importance to that part of the country stretching from the northern tip of Donegal to the southern tip of West Cork.</P>
    <P>A number of promotional efforts have been indicated by the Minister and money has been allocated for the purposes of these projects. It is all right to say we will do this, that and the other, but in his Budget Statement the <Col N="2124" /> Minister has indicated in a positive way the steps to be taken to help save the West and has allocated money for them. The pilot areas are to be extended. We already have a pilot area in my county at Clonberne. Now it is proposed to establish a number of pilot areas. This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that, in co-operation with the Minister for Lands, a big settlement programme will be started to consolidate holdings, to make them viable and at least to bring them up to the standard of an economic holding. This is a very big problem in the west of Ireland. The farmers with scattered holdings &mdash; patchwork quilts, as they are called&mdash;represent a problem continually demanding the attention of the Land Commission. Oftentimes a man has to travel half a mile or a mile to portion of his holding separate from the rest. That an attempt should now be made to resettle these holdings, to get the consent of the landowners affected and to acquire land where necessary will help to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated a renewed interest in industrial activity in the West. There is particular emphasis on smaller projects based on local skills and requirements to keep industrial activity alive. There are craft industries, such as boat-building, which may be peculiar to a particular area. While these industries may not be considered large by people in other parts of the country, they are very important to areas like Galway, Mayo and Cork, where certain skills have grown up, where there are families noted for boat-building and the making of certain types of furniture. These should be encouraged to go ahead with their work and helped where necessary by way of capital assistance.</P>
    <P>This is a step in the right direction. In the West we cannot always hope to have vast industries giving employment to great numbers such as exist elsewhere. But a start can be made with the smaller local industries, which can be promoted and helped when they are not doing as well as they should be doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> The biggest break through will be in tourism. The remoter areas of the western seaboard are noted for their beauty. While God did not give them very good land, He gave them a very beautiful countryside. Full use must be made of the advantage by the development of tourism and the provision of tourist attractions over and above what they already have. Many people who come to this country like to visit the West, places like Galway, Cork and Kerry and the other areas renowned for their beauty. However, they find to their disappointment that the services which should be there are not there. There is an absence of suitable hotels. The roads are oftentimes very bad, and all the other things that discourage tourists from visiting these remote areas are there.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement has concentrated&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;on providing more and better accommodation for our visitors. He mentioned the farmhouse accommodation scheme which will be a valuable source of supplemental income to people who have or could have accommodation for tourists. The Minister will be providing for toilets, for extra rooms and all the other facilities that are demanded in rural Ireland, particularly west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is preparing this scheme in consultation with Bord Fáilte, he should get them to rid themselves of these grandiose ideas they have about hotels. They are absolutely stupid in their approach to this problem. Most of the people who come to this country are not looking for palatial hotels and the excellent services which are to be found in other countries. They like a plain hotel with cleanliness, good accommodation and good food. That can be given in Ireland if Bord Fáilte adopt a more rational approach to the problem than they have been doing in the past.</P>
    <P>The small family hotel should be encouraged by Bord Fáilte. The standard required, while high, should not be as high as that which they insist upon in relation to big hotels. The big hotels are very well able to manage for themselves. Let Bord Fáilte get <Col N="2126" /> down to the question of farmhouse accommodation and the provision of more and more small family hotels catering for the ordinary tourist who comes to this country and who neither can afford nor wants anything swanky or luxurious.</P>
    <P>In connection with the farmhouse project for which provision is being made in the Budget, I would appeal to the Minister to see if Bord Fáilte could help a special type of catering accommodation that is being given in my constituency, and I feel sure this would apply to many of the western areas. We have on the roads during the summer months a large number of hikers. Most of them are on their way to the local An Óige hostels which are located in very scattered places; at least it is hard to get from one hostel to another in the course of a day if the hiker is not lucky in getting a lift as he oftentimes does. Many owners of houses, especially big farmhouses, while they would not like to go into the farmhouse accommodation scheme are in a position to cater for hikers by providing bedrooms, kitchen facilities and ancillary services, while at the same time allowing the hiker to do his own cooking and provide his own meals.</P>
    <P>There are two centres quite near me where the owners allow hikers facilities of that kind. It would be in the interests of Bord Fáilte to give some attention to that problem. They could provide the owner of such a house with grants, say, for bedding and beds, kitchen utensils, and other facilities of a simple kind that will be of great help to the hiker when he is making his way to another hostel. After all the hiker spends money in the country and contributes to the solution of our balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the concession that has been granted to the small farmer, the derating of the first £20 valuation, I am coming across an extraordinary situation in my part of the country. A new breed of landlord appears to have come on the scene. This new landlord, while bemoaning and complaining about all the money he is losing on farming, buys up every available farm in the locality, if he is allowed to do <Col N="2127" /> so. The more land he buys, according to himself the more money he is losing. I feel sure that many rural Deputies come across that type of gentleman. I urge the Land Commission to have a good look at this problem when they are dealing with the land resettlement question as mentioned by the Minister in his Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>The agitation, the strife and the disorder which these people are trying to engender, particularly among small farmers, are no help to the Government, nor indeed could they be of help to any Government. If they are losing money as they say&mdash;most of them are big farmers&mdash;why do they not offer their land to the Land Commission or dispose of it otherwise if they so wish? Let them give the land to the small farmer who will work it. There are many working farmers in my part of the country who are short of land and particularly short of arable land or land fit for tillage.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is to be congratulated on this Budget in so far as it has meant a very small increase in taxation and fairly substantial benefits. The benefit which is of most interest to me is the programme he has announced for the development of the West. The Minister also deserves praise for the display he has given of social conscience, particularly in relation to the aged, those living alone and those who are disabled. He has made an attempt to stabilise costs, to prevent them spiralling and causing inflation. He has stressed the point that any increases sought in incomes must keep pace with increased productivity.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to denounce the Budget as a bad Budget. Those who indulge in tactics of that kind must be adepts in the art of selfdelusion. Ask ordinary people throughout the country, the small farmer and the worker, is this a bad Budget? Ask them to weigh the increases in taxation against the undeniable advantages that will accrue and, by that yardstick, judge whether this is a bad Budget. While Opposition Parties may have succeeded in deluding themselves into the belief that it is a bad Budget&mdash;as <Col N="2128" /> an Opposition, they have, I suppose, to say that&mdash;it is another job to convince the people generally that it is a bad Budget.</P>
    <P>The problems that affect the West are peculiar. The difficulties that arise there are associated mostly with the type of land there and the fragmentation of holdings. Life generally in the West is difficult for many people, but that an attempt should be made to alleviate the position is praiseworthy. This is certainly a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>The Budget is normally regarded as the economic yardstick by which to measure the strength of purpose of a Government in relation to the economy generally. It is to be noted that our present Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, is a pop fan. He was among the people who received the returning Eurovision second prizewinner and, in the context of pop, we could legitimately describe his Budget as a Mary Poppins Budget, sung to the popular tune of &ldquo;A Spoonful of Sugar Makes the Medicine go Down&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have chosen my tune: the Deputy can choose his own. Why do I say &ldquo;A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down&rdquo;? Because I will approach this Budget realistically. I shall ruthlessly point out its defects. Credit is to be given for an adroit political concept in relation to this Budget. Whatever else we may accuse the Minister for Finance of we cannot but admit that he has a good deal of political perspicacity and skill. Like Mary Poppins, out of his bag he has distributed little palliatives in a number of directions. I say this without <Col N="2129" /> any political bias. All of us must be conscious of the fact that the time was well-nigh past when social welfare recipients should be looked after and I believe there would have been no cavil had they been looked after better because, while the 5/- may be extremely valuable, it is still a rather inadequate pittance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about what we gave. I was never responsible for giving any of it. If I had my way, these people would be the first to be looked after properly, irrespective of popularity polls. I have never been afraid to advocate their case in and out of government. I do not think there is any room for boasting that they were given 5/-. I would be equally enthusiastic in supporting an increase of 10/- because no class in our community needs a realistic appraisal of their difficulties more than social welfare recipients do. There is a good deal of satisfaction to be found in the fact that at least some recognition has been given to lowly-paid pensioners. Deputy Carty, the Parlimentary Secretary, knows as well as I do how heavily the burden lies on the lowly-paid and older sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These increases are, in my opinion, palliatives in an effort to cover up in this budgetary instrument the continuing economic difficulties and ailments from which we suffer. Because certain concessions are given, we are, apparently, to be asked to forget the effect of iniquitous taxes, like the turnover and the wholesale tax, which are now becoming a copperfastened feature of our tax-gathering. We are meant evidently to forget the difficulties that have arisen in our economy because of wrong concepts in taxation and wrong directions in development. We are inclined to forget that our unpaid taxgatherers are still being penalised and that various sections of the community are still carrying more than their reasonable share of the taxation burden. It appals me that there should be such atrophy, such a lack of imagination in tax conception that we have <Col N="2130" /> to go back once more to the hardy annuals of beer and cigarettes to get additional revenue.</P>
    <P>This is as good a point as any at which to remind the people, through this House, that part of the money now available to give the reliefs is available because, as the Taoiseach admitted here, there was gross underestimation by him as Minister for Finance, and by his advisers in the tax-collecting department, as to the probable yield of the wholesale tax over a couple of months.</P>

      <P>I have a deep-seated objection to the type of mendicity successive Fianna Fáil Governments are creating in our society. They talk about the repeal of the order to enable more and more people to draw the dole, making mendicants out of decent, respectable small farmers. I am always appalled when decent people are reduced to the level of mendicants, drawing sops and doles, when an integrated land development should have been conceived years ago for our agricultural community in the West and in the area I represent. There is no good in talking about 1d a gallon here, a subsidy for milk coolers, an incentive bonus for milk, unless we can get the fabric of a progressive plan that will show a steady rate of investment in agriculture and a regulated, properly conceived escalation into the type of production and the type of economy that we really need in relation to our agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent, thanks be to God, some of the finest small farmers in the whole of Ireland, proud of their tradition, with generations of evidence of their capacity for work. We understand what the nature of our ailments is. It is time the Departments and the Government opened their eyes to the fact that there are certain zones in Ireland where <Col N="2131" /> experience and knowledge have proved conclusively the need for integration, have proved that in an area like southwest Cork, milk, pork and now this new vegetable growing scheme must be integrated and that you have to plan on the basis that because the units have to be comparatively small, they can have only the optimum quality of stock in cattle and pigs and the maximum type of vegetable yield from their soil to make it possible to make these holdings a practical economic reality for the people working on them and getting their living thereon.</P>
    <P>That is the cavil I have with this Budget. God knows there is none of us but is glad to see the farmers getting a limited relief and glad to see that it is now mainly directed, for this year anyway, towards the smaller elements of our farming community but it is the lack of hope and the lack of concept and progressive thinking that have been appalling me over all the years I have been in this House fighting the cause of the small farmer. I want to see a realisation of the necessity of investment and the proper progressive trend towards it.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour, and have never been afraid to say so, of seeing our holdings brought up to a more practical, realistic, economic level but I am not unconscious of the nature of the problem. Bad and all as it is in south-west Cork, where the holdings may average from 25 to 40 acres, it is an appalling problem in the West. It is one I spoke of in this House 20 years ago and made a statement which I now repeat: you can only face the problems of these areas by realising that you have to pour tremendous investment into them or face the reality of their decay.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be able to say that where tourism is concerned in west Cork, for a number of years they have been developing the realistic type of holiday that does not envisage penthouses in luxury hotels but envisages the need of what we find to be the best tourist of all, the English tourist travelling in our area. He seeks only cleanliness, reasonable comfort, good plain <Col N="2132" /> food and hospitality and the integration of the people to enjoy his holiday. We cater for that type of thing extensively. I would like to have seen the Minister giving the type of direction that would stop the building of luxury hotels and give the small hotelier greater encouragement in the more remote areas to build up and extend that type of family hotel for which many of our small seaside resorts have become famous and which provide the type of holiday most of our visitors really like because of its simplicity and its contrast to their normal way of life. That is another integral part of the economic plan if we are to save the congest areas. It is the negative approach of this Budget to those type of problems that are now beginning to stick out like a sore thumb or the nose on a person's face that is appalling me.</P>
    <P>I may not have the type of economic mind that chases flippertygibbets or reads into blue books something that is not there. I do not care what the Government call it but plans for economic development that have no reality in fact or no deep-seated affinity with our people are all cod. The sooner we stop talking about first or second programmes for economic expansion, blue books, pink books or green books and get down to appraising the real situation we must face the better. We are told that the flight from the land is a continuous trend and that we can expect more and more defection from rural Ireland in the course of the next number of years. Then it becomes all the more incumbent on the Government to ensure that the tremendous contribution which agriculture makes to our whole economic being is properly preserved. We will have to have in rural Ireland the type of planned economy that will ensure stability and worthwhile returns for the people who are going to stay on the land to work it and to carry the backbone of our exports.</P>
    <P>Let the economists, the great Whitakers and the rest of them, talk as they may about escalation in industry: the backbone of this country is still agriculture. If we are looking into the future in which we have either to integrate into a greater Europe or the Six, <Col N="2133" /> our capacity in the agricultural field will have to be keen, our production will have to be highly competitive and our quality superb if we are to survive. Any of us, even though we may not be in some modern schools of economic thought, realise that any serious setback in agriculture could be disastrous to our whole balance of payments and our whole economic situation.</P>
    <P>To talk of this Budget as a good one in that context is nonsense. It is a good Budget in one way only, that is in that, thanks be to God, after year upon year of bludgeoning the taxpayer, for the first time Fianna Fáil have seen fit to give certain reliefs but even at that an arbitrary figure was picked for over-estimation. It appeared at the close of the financial year as if we would have a much more substantial surplus than was ultimately revealed. A fortnight before the close of the year it seemed evident that the surplus would be £3.4 million, or something in that region, but two days after the account closed, it was down to £0.8 million. We then take an arbitrary figure of £4 million for over-estimation and clap on 1d on the poor man's pint and 2d on his cigarettes. This gives us a sugar distribution among a wide range of people which sets up a screen to cover the ineffectiveness of the Budget.</P>
    <P>I have always said that if taxation has to be raised for progressive, well thought out schemes of development, it is the duty of responsible Deputies to see that the money is voted and it is the responsibility, in a national sense, of every Deputy also to see that such schemes are given the support and impetus they require. I am saying in a deliberate way that many of the problems between our agricultural organisations, much of the dissension, unrest and unease in agriculture, can be dissipated at any time if the agricultural community can be given a sense of security, if the Government can show some real concern by the production of well-conceived, progressive plans for the development of this industry.</P>
    <P>We are up against the perennial problem that we have not got yet what we should have got years ago, full <Col N="2134" /> replacement stock for the bad cow. I have recollections of Deputy Dillon thundering in this House a truism we have lost sight of, that it takes as much, if not more, to feed a bad cow as a good cow, and it is becoming inevitable that where you have the mixed farmer with a certain number of cows, a certain number of sows and running a small acreage to produce silage and mixed grain for his own use, we must have the ultimate quality in stock for him if his holding is to become economic.</P>
    <P>That is what I cavil with in this Budget. That type of thinking and effort are not here. I know the young Parliamentary Secretary sitting opposite me has the same kind of outlook as I have, that he wants this type of small farmer&mdash;he represents quite a number, though there are some big farmers in his constituency as well&mdash;to get something more than sops, doles and increased mendicity. This type of small farmer wants right thinking, cohesive planning. It should have started years ago.</P>
    <P>We are told sometimes that we are on the brink of Europe, that the time is now and there is greater urgency than ever that the Budget should cater for initiation of these plans. This Budget shows some effort, but only in an expediency way, to deal with the problems of the congested areas, of the small farmers in the congested areas. I know that the temporary benefits of the 1d increase in the gallon of milk, the further increased bonus for quality milk and the grants for coolers are of immediate benefit to the people I represent but it is only an expedient, a stopgap effort. It would be far better for the economy and for all of us if there were a planned, progressive effort at real investment in agriculture, a plan that would keep stability in prices and give some kind of hope and earnest belief in our future, particularly in the many parts of Ireland where farms are small and where the question of resettlement in bigger farms is at best a long-term policy.</P>
    <P>Mind you, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was in earnest when he referred to the Land Commission and what they do. I have long <Col N="2135" /> experience of the Land Commission and I am quite sure that in the next century somebody will be able to point to things they have done, but I know many things they commenced before I came into this House which still are not done by them. To suggest there might be any great speed in the creation of viable holdings in the West by way of resettlement is self-deception of a serious nature.</P>
    <P>My cavil with the Budget from the point of view of agriculture is that it has no real norm of hope or no sense of the parental interest which the Government should show. Apart from dealing with the problem which was brought to their notice forcefully by the pickets outside the Dáil and by people sitting on the steps of Government offices, they have not got to grips with the situation with any sense of reality. Fundamentally, the fault is that the Government are not thinking broadly enough in the atmosphere of 1967. Whether the Government know it or not, this is 1967 when we are at a stage, whether we join the Six or some more extended form of a united Europe, when things will become more difficult, more competitive for us.</P>
    <P>I have always felt deep-seated sympathy with the workers of this country and I have complete sympathy with the towns' point of view that this Budget is a disaster because of its lack of impetus for the drive to rehouse our people, particularly in the metropolis and in the municipal areas throughout the country. There is nothing in the Budget to give impetus to the housing drive in places like Dublin and Cork where there is a huge backlog of unhoused people. There is nothing in it to indicate that the Government will act, even though we hear speeches from various Ministers condemning the exorbitant cost of building land, condemning rings who are buying the land up and exploiting the people who have to go to builders under the SDA to get housing.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Budget to impose Government curbs, Government restraint, on this type of gangsterdom, because that is what it is. I shall not <Col N="2136" /> enter into the merits or demerits of the various Fianna Fáil associate bodies. Speeches should be followed up by action. If the Minister for Local Government is sincere in his recent utterances, and the Taoiseach is sincere in his recent utterances, I should like to see some curb put on these facets of hardship for the ordinary people. There is no good in looking for restraint in various fields. There is no good in pointing the finger at the worker and telling him he is to work harder, and stop looking for certain types of increases, while there is no curbing of Government expenditure and no curbing of increases in certain spheres of administration.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Budget to show that the Government are in earnest about tackling the problem which has become a tremendous bugbear in the minds of the people, and is of tremendous concern to Deputies who take each financial year seriously, that is, the fantastic increase in administration costs, and the fantastic extra burden of increases given to people in the public service, or the semi-public service. No one wants to deny that these people may be entitled to them, and that there may be justification in their claims, but there is no indication in this Budget that the Minister is coming to grips with what this annual escalation means for the taxpayer or with adjusting the extraordinary proportion of administration costs against the effective investment element even in our capital programme.</P>
    <P>When one sits down and analyses our capital programme, one is appalled at the percentage which is dissipated in administration costs. For that reason I say this is a bad Budget. I am not the type of person who will deny that some people have benefited under this Budget. I am glad they have, particularly in the lower pension groups, and in the social welfare groups, because it is long overdue to them. I am glad to see certain reliefs given under the income tax code. For a long time I have been an earnest advocate of the reliefs given under this heading in relation to the burden that hits the middle-class worker, the white collar worker, and the person who has <Col N="2137" /> no protection because of illness in his family. I am glad to see the reliefs given in relation to children. I am glad to see a continuation of the relief in the upward bracket for children going to secondary school.</P>
    <P>These are practical but small helps given to a wide section of the community but given by Fianna Fáil in the context of the local elections next June. Apart from seeing their political sagacity, we must remember that this may be the forerunner of another mini-Budget in the fall. This Budget is so conceived and designed that if anything practical went wrong, it could go out of balance and into chaos without too much difficulty. We have known that to happen before under this now allegedly benign and benevolent Government. We know perfectly well that they have a history of two Budgets a year for a number of years. I am hoping that is not going to happen. I am not attributing that motive to the Government but I am saying that this Budget, in its wide distribution of small palliatives, and particularly in its wide diffusion of small palliatives in rural Ireland, must be designed and cleverly designed to give the biggest possible impetus to the local election candidates. It will be very interesting to hear the many exaggerations and distortions which some of the reliefs will get outside the chapel gates between now and 25th June.</P>
    <P>Taking the situation by and large, there is a sense of relief in the country that the people are not being bludgeoned down again, as it was suggested at one time they might have to be, by a heavy incidence of increased taxation. Where is the injection of virility and purpose in this Budget? Where is the incentive to the industrial investor and to the expansionist in this Budget? It is not there. This Budget is completely negative in many ways. It is positive in the benefits which some people make capital out of, because after years of training the Irish people in mendicity, Fianna Fáil find it very effective at local elections time to give palliatives to this class of people. I have no hesitation in saying this. In my area people would far sooner see <Col N="2138" /> an integrated and co-ordinated plan for making their farms secure and their markets secure than any sops by way of dole or temporary expediency grants to get them over temporary difficulties.</P>
    <P>For too long in my view, under all Governments, agriculture has been the plaything of politicians. For too long we have heard lip service in this House about the farmers being the backbone of our economy. It is time for the Government to start thinking on the basis of the real value of agriculture to the nation, and of our debt of gratitude in perpetuity to the people who work the land of Ireland and keep our economy viable. It is time we realised that the more investment we put into the six inches of top soil, and into the quality of our cattle, pigs and sheep, and into the excellence of our vegetable products, the better. The sooner we get down to giving agriculture its fair share of national investment, the sooner we will reach the day when we can have Budgets which will give the people not only reliefs that are long overdue and an adjustment in the burden of taxation, but instruments of practical advance in the nation's economy and an assurance that an Irish Government is a worthy steward of the national finances for the advancement of the people generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start off by congratulating the Minister for Finance on his foresight and sympathetic approach to the many problems which we have today and which are likely to be here for quite a substantial time to come. His action has created a further upward spiral in public confidence in this Government. His recent action, his recent concessions to the weaker sections of the community, have been welcome. It would seem that the only people who disagree with the Budget in any shape or form are the Opposition Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand why the Opposition Parties disagree with this Budget. The reason they disagree is that they are only anxious to draw in so many red herrings and suggestions to damp down or in some way to take from the assistance and the contributions made by the Minister and the <Col N="2139" /> Government. We all hope to see from time to time more reliefs and assistance given to those people. We hope to see them given to a much wider section of the community. In Fianna Fáil we are desirous that this situation will continue until such time as we have brought about a situation whereby no further assistance is desirable or necessary.</P>
    <P>We understand that in order to bring about the reliefs which are necessary, there is another side to the problem which is almost forgotten by the Opposition. They conveniently forget the question of providing the necessary finance to give these concessions and reliefs to the weaker sections of the community. While they continue to deplore the lack of assistance or the lack of concessions, at the same time they are not prepared to support the necessary financial provisions in the Budget for giving the concessions given this year. In that way it can be said that the Fine Gael Party on this occasion who voted against Financial Resolution No. 3 gave a clear indication that they were not prepared to support the provision of the necessary finances to enable the various concessions to be given.</P>
    <P>The care of the aged has got lip service from many people for a long time. Now we arrive at the situation where something concrete is being done. A clear indication has been given by the Minister and the Government that those reliefs are being given to the weaker sections of the community. During the Budget speech. I watched members of the Opposition Parties, and as the Minister read out the different concessions to be given, they sat further down in their seats. By the time the Minister had concluded his speech, it was difficult to see any heads visible in the Opposition benches.</P>

      <P>As the Minister indicated, the widow will benefit by further concessions. Again, there was deep depression in the Fine Gael benches, and indeed also among the Labour Deputies who nevertheless had the courage to support the Financial Resolution to provide this money. The orphan is another person provided for under the concessions given by the Minister. The Government decided that those concessions could be given in this year's Budget. Again, it was the Fine Gael Party, by their failure to support the Financial Resolution necessary to provide the money, who voted against the widow, the orphan and the old age pensioner. We know the reliefs given are limited this year but we hope that in time to come we will give them many more concessions. I am quite sure that as long as the Fianna Fáil Party are in government very many more reliefs will be given to the widow, the orphan and the old age pensioner. The unemployed were not forgotten, either&mdash;they received the same increase. Of course, the Fine Gael Party, by going into the division lobby and voting against the Financial Resolution voted against any increase for the unemployed man.</P>

      <P>The increase in the allowance for children is another indication of how we are trying to help <Col N="2144" /> those sections of the community who are most deserving of relief of one kind or another. We must be prepared to face up to our responsibilities if we want to see these things done. The one contribution you could have made was to support the Financial Resolution giving those things. It would seem from the Fine Gael attitude that they might have been prepared to give the old age pensioners 1/- and the widows and orphans 1/- but they were not prepared to support the concession in full. They believe that we are giving the widow, the orphan, the old age pensioner and the blind too much money but we will give these increases despite their opposition and we will also give the increase in the allowance for children. Income tax relief for medical expenses was another concession which got lip service.</P>

Neither are they prepared to give concessions to the small farmer nor the increased personal allowance. The Labour Party at least supported what they were called on to support. They believed that the money was required and even if it were not enough they were prepared to lend their support to the necessary taxation which would be taken off this very deserving section of the community whom the Minister for Finance saw fit to assist in the Budget. The Minister has not only been thanked here but people outside, not members of our Party, have, since the date of the announcement, conveyed in one form or another their appreciation of the Minister and the Government in meeting those people who are deserving of consideration.

      <P>Deputy Ryan spoke about the terrible situation of Dublin housing. Quite recently Dublin Corporation discussed this matter in a great deal of detail. We spent five hours examining the estimates of Dublin Corporation Housing Committee, the future of the housing situation <Col N="2148" /> and the housing programme in Dublin. But Deputy Ryan and no other member of the Fine Gael Party thought it worth his while to come along to that meeting of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation&mdash;the largest local authority in the country&mdash;to discuss the housing problem, or the future development of housing in Dublin. That is the interest the Fine Gael Party have in housing the citizens of this city: not one member of the Fine Gael Party came to that meeting to discuss the future and the progress of Dublin Corporation in relation to the housing problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had a meeting of a committee of the whole house to discuss this great problem of the housing. Again, what happened? Was Deputy Ryan there? No, Deputy Ryan was not there. As a matter of fact, I am quite sure Deputy Ryan will say: &ldquo;I am not a member of the Housing Committee, so I did not attend the housing estimates meeting,&rdquo; but he did not attend the other meetings and only two other members of the Fine Gael Party thought it worth their while to discuss any particular aspect of Dublin local authority problems, one of whom is a doubtful member of Fine Gael, a man who has been in and out for some time, and it is doubtful if he will contest the next election as a Fine Gael candidate. He was one of the Fine Gael Party present; there was also a lady member of Dublin Corporation who <Col N="2149" /> attended. Only two out of ten attended any estimates meeting of any of the committees of Dublin Corporation, so as far as local authority problems are concerned. Let no member of the Fine Gael Party in this House indicate that Fine Gael have an interest in them; they have no interest whatsoever.</P>

When Fine Gael Deputies want to find out what is happening in the local authorities of which they are members, they have to put down questions in Dáil Éireann and try to extract from the Minister for Local Government how the problems are being handled in their areas because they seldom attend meetings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne spoke at length about the terrible situation in relation to housing in Dublin. Of course, most Deputies are out of touch with this expanding city, with the increase in population which will inevitably take place in a living city. We <Col N="2150" /> are conscious of that; we know that the fluctuation in figures for housing, employment and industry should be related to a developing city and a developing population.</P>
      <P>We know that at a recent meeting of Dublin Corporation, a committee of the whole house, which no Fine Gael member attended, discussed the provision of sites for local authorities and the provision of buildings in Dublin city. At this meeting the City Manager outlined in great detail his desire to meet the problem existing in relation to housing, so that Dublin Corporation would make available, in addition to the ordinary building programme, sites for sale in the city area, and make further land available over a period of five years, to ensure continuity of the building programme, outside the scope of the local authority, and to ensure for the next five years that there would be in Dublin a future for building workers. This meeting discussed in some detail the various schemes the manager had in mind in relation to the provision of sites and services and to the co-ordination of effort necessary between the three local authorities in Dublin. I am happy to say that the manager secured the agreement of the people who had seen fit to attend, or who had the interest of the future needs of housing in our city at heart which he desired in his wish to discuss with other local authorities the necessary means for co-ordination of effort, so long lacking in our city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael members who spoke at great length about the terrible situation existing in Dublin were not present to back up the criticism they so freely gave in this House. The building workers in this city have no need to worry over the next five years if the necessary support is forthcoming from the various Parties for the City Manager. The aim is to bring about a situation in which sites will be made available in a short space of time and at a reasonable price, that the local authority would force down the price of sites, which at present are abnormally high&mdash;some of them, no doubt, are in the hands of racketeers&mdash;and bring about a realistic situation so far <Col N="2151" /> as future building in this city is concerned.</P>
    <P>It was stated that we are not catering for the needs of the people and that the building programme was at its lowest ebb. Recently the City Manager indicated that, in addition to the corporation's programme, 1,450 sites would be available for private development. These sites were in the possession of the corporation and would be made available to organisations and individuals, people on the approved waiting list and corporation tenants for the purpose of building their own homes. In addition, we have in progress 2,589 dwellings in Ballymun and a further 636 were under construction at the end of March. In Coolock-Kilmore, we have the erection of 222 houses and tenders worth £500,000 were accepted at the last housing committee meeting.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been sought for the erection of 288 tenant purchase type houses. Tenders have been invited for the erection of 116 at Coolock-Kilmore. Site development work is in progress at Coolock-Kilmore on one area with 140 sites, another area with 150 sites and another area with 133 sites. At last Friday's meeting of the housing committee, approval was obtained from the Department of Local Government for lay-out plans for Poplar RowSpringarden Street; Lower Dominick Street, section two; and St. Vincent Street South-Clanbrassil Street. The people who attend the meetings of the corporation are aware of our longterm housing programme, but some members of the corporation have to put down questions in Dáil Éireann to find out what is happening in City Hall. Reading their comments makes one feel very depressed. I suppose these people, who did not attend any of the estimates meetings or the committee meetings, will have the audacity to face the public and ask for re-election to Dublin Corporation. I only hope they contest the election in my area.</P>

      <P>At column 2053 of the same volume, Deputy Larkin goes on:</P>
      <P>The first step required the cutting out of the new contract for the Finglas area. That has been approved by the Minister, but now we will have to tell the contractor: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot continue with this contract now.&rdquo; That involved a reduction of £61,000 in the estimate. The next item was in reference to the direct housing scheme for the Finglas area. That scheme was not to be proceeded with either. It was also suggested that there should be a gradual diminution in employment on direct labour housing schemes and a gradual laying off of the workers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the widespread public dismay at Government intervention in a purely internal matter concerning Radio Telefís Éireann and the fact that professional journalists and others concerned in a communications medium are the best judges of an item's news value, he will reconsider his recommendations to Radio Telefís Éireann that a television news crew should not be sent to report on events in Vietnam.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2155" /> The only occasion on which I made representations of the kind mentioned was when I recently informed the Chairman of Radio Telefís Éireann that, in the opinion of the Government, the best interests of the nation would not be served by sending a news team to Vietnam, as proposed by the Authority and that such a visit would be an embarrassment to the Government in relation to its foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I am not aware there is any widespread public dismay at the decision of the Authority to drop this project following its consideration of my representations. I cannot agree that the matter was a purely internal one concerning RTE or that it was merely a question of professionally assessing the news value of the proposed assignment. I see no reason to alter my original view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is continual Government interference with Telefís Éireann by verbal directions being given instead of, as stipulated under the Act, a written direction being given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that emphatically. There was one occasion which was highlighted here and on which the Minister made certain representations in relation to the presentation of a news item. That is the only occasion of which I am aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Taoiseach that on this occasion the direction was not in writing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it was not a direction. It was a conveyance of my views, on behalf of the Government, direct to the Chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that fully. If after my views were conveyed to the Chairman, he conveyed views other than those back to me, then it would have been a matter for consideration <Col N="2156" /> whether the terms of section 31 should be invoked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied on this particular matter, which can only be regarded as an interference with the objective reporting by RTE of a news item as distinct from other material? In the Act it is laid down that where news is reported, Radio Telefís Éireann will report it in an objective way. Further, is the Taoiseach aware that as a result of this interference, a film programme was since broadcast by Radio Telefís Éireann from some other source&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a question of objective reporting. There have been very few incidents or occasions in the world that have been more fully reported than has the Vietnam war. As stated by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> correspondent, it has received massive coverage by the wellknown news agencies, and all these are highly regarded as being objective news media. Therefore, I do not think there is any question whatever of the Irish people not being fully informed about what is happening in Vietnam,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach refers to this being or not being in the best interests of the country, does he mean the visit of the RTE team to Vietnam or the showing of the film in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Radio Telefís Éireann Authority is, as we describe it here, a semi-State body. If a team representing Radio Telefís Éireann went to Vietnam, the peculiar character of a semi-State body, as we know it, could well be misinterpreted all over the world. I understand that it was the intention of RTE to sell whatever film or coverage this team might have had on Vietnam, presumably to any customer who would come along <Col N="2157" /> and offer to buy it. These customers might well be people who had a particular interest, opposed, perhaps, to one side or the other, and there was a great danger that the people in those countries who might buy that film would present the news or whatever items RTE would have given them in a slanted way. As I said, there is a danger of the misinterpretation of the functions of a semi-State body <i>vis-à-vis</i> the governments in other countries in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it necessarily mean that this country is pro-North Vietnam because RTE bought and presented the other night a Polish film on North Vietnam and the war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not produce that film. It was relayed to our screens. Surely there has been a plethora of films on RTE for the past two or three years? Every evening we look at RTE we see coverage of the Vietnam war. Every day we take up the newspapers we see full and objective coverage of what is happening there. Surely the people of Ireland are fully informed on that subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, due to the interference with RTE news reports, it is not a semi-State body any more, that it is a State body controlled by the Taoiseach and the Front Bench? I believe the Government are walking right through the Broadcasting Authority Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Taoiseach's emphatic denial of interference by the Government with the Authority, is the Taoiseach aware that when a major housing scandal, which has taken place in his own constituency in Cork, was to be exposed on a television programme known as &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo;, this item was deleted from the programme after a telephone call was made by the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Brennan, on either 12th or 13th December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I should like to answer it fully and explicitly. There are proceedings pending in relation to the building of houses in Cork. RTE had the intention of covering that question in the programme &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo;. It was conveyed to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that some of the people who were being interviewed in that programme and whose views would have been presented were people who had already submitted statements to the Garda authorities in connection with a pending prosecution. The Attorney General informed the Minister that, in his view, the presentation of statements by these people on Telefís Éireann would prejudice the prosecution. That information was conveyed to RTE and, I think, quite rightly in the circumstances, they decided not to proceed with that part of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the serious aspect of this matter is the reflection on the <i>bona fides</i> of the RTE cameramen and news reporters? Assuming that the photographs taken or the news coverage provided could be regarded subsequently as being not in the best interests of this country, it would then be open to the Taoseach and RTE to prevent the dissemination of such a film. What has happened now is that we have had shown by RTE a film from an outside source completely, and we have prevented our own cameramen, whose <i>bona fides</i>, accuracy and objective photography are regarded highly by everybody, from reporting on this matter, leaving aside entirely, which might be a legitimate view, the cost of sending a team to Vietnam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer the first part of Deputy Cosgrave's question. There was no intention whatsoever of casting any <Col N="2159" /> reflection on the ability or the objectivity of the team that would have been sent to Vietnam; on the contrary, I have every confidence that they would have reported back as objectively and as fairly as they possibly could in the circumstances. There was a difficulty involved that in visiting one side or the other of the area of conflict, as the Minister for External Affairs has said, they could easily have been brought on a conducted tour. Even allowing for all that, if this news were sold to other countries, we would have no control over the manner of its presentation, and, as the Deputy knows well, these things can be cut and edited to suit a particular public, once the intention was to sell it, and that was put forward as a means of offsetting the very high cost involved in the mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the matter of the Cork housing was not <i>sub judice</i> then and is not <i>subjudice</i>  now, would the Taoiseach tell us, if this matter is being investigated by the Garda, what action has been taken against the people concerned in Cork? Have any proceedings been taken against them by the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, that is not relevant, but the fact is the Garda authorities in Cork have been making inquiries of the people directly involved in this matter. They have taken statements from them with a view to having them put in evidence when a prosecution takes place. The Attorney General is processing the necessary formalities with a view to a prosecution and no matter what the Deputy thinks these people whom it is intended to prosecute are entitled to the fullest defence the law can give them at this stage; they are entitled not to have their case prejudiced in any way by a presentation of any side of the case before the case, on Telefís Éireann.</P>

It would be regrettable surely if it were left to the good office of the <Col N="2161" /> British Government to see that discrimination is put an end to in that area. The Taoiseach will agree, I think, that he should not make it appear that the support of this Administration is behind the Unionist Administration in the Six Counties, and that is how it might appear since no progress apparently has been made in ending the existing discrimination since the meeting between the exTaoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and Captain O'Neill.</P>

There was a brief mission of the CDU composed of members of the British Labour Party, which seeks to get evidence, in particular, of discrimination in Ulster. They will report back to their Prime Minister and to the Home Secretary. In the first Press conference I had on my appointment as Taoiseach, I stated publicly that I understood there was discrimination in the Six Counties, that I was glad steps had been taken by the Six County authorities in one respect, at least, to remove that discrimination&mdash;I was referring, in particular, to certain franchises in the general elections&mdash;and that I hoped this was only the beginning of the removal of all other discrimination in the North.

      <P>The position in this regard is that unless the existing members of the pension schemes were prepared to agree to an amendment of the scheme to provide for an increase in the rates of pensions payable to existing pensioners, the full cost of any such increase would have to be borne entirely on an ex gratia basis by CIE.</P>

    <P>764 schemes were authorised for execution in the 12 months ended 31st March, 1967. The figure for schemes <Col N="2167" /> actually completed within the year is not readily available but it may be taken that it corresponds closely to the number of authorisations.</P>
    <P>There were approximately 1,200 outstanding applications at 1st April, 1967. The number of these which will be carried out during the current year will be determined in the first instance by the lodgment of local contributions and cannot be closely estimated in advance. It may be assumed, however, that approximately the same number of schemes will be authorised as last year. Furthermore, some of the applications may be eligible as minor employment or bog development schemes.</P>
    <P>In general, the order of priority in the issue of offers of grant is the date of receipt of the application. The order of priority for the issue of the final authorisation to proceed with the work is the date of lodgment of the local contribution.</P>

      <P>My Department is already committed to the gradual opening up of State forest areas, where suitable conditions exist, for recreational use by the public. Proposals have been formulated for some areas in the Dublin and Wicklow region and, subject to agreement with other bodies concerned, progress may be expected this year.</P>

      <P>In a number of areas they are. For example, there is the forest area in County Dublin popularly known as the Hell Fire Club area. The position has been examined in conjunction with Bord Fáilte. There are discussions going on with the county <Col N="2173" /> council. The public are admitted there on foot. Horseback provides some difficulties where the roads are not suitable. We must bear in mind young forests where vegetation has not completely been cut down and there is the danger of fire. However, generally speaking, it is the policy of the Department to open up these forests to the public in so far as they can do so.</P>

      <P>The Garda are of the opinion that gang warfare as such is not a serious problem in Dublin, though outbursts of violence and disorder occur from time to time on occasions when young persons congregate for recreation or some other purpose which is not in itself unlawful.</P>
      <P>Garda foot and radio-equipped mobile patrols are constantly on the alert to deal with incidents of disorder and violence and where trouble is anticipated at particular places or in particular areas over particular periods special Garda arrangements are made to meet any situation that may arise. Ordinarily, the number of mobile patrols are increased during each week-end period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda play a very active role in helping to prevent and control juvenile delinquency of all kinds. They take an active part in the formation and running of youth clubs both in Dublin and provincial centres and <Col N="2179" /> they operate a juvenile liaison scheme whereby contact is maintained with young offenders who commit trivial or technical offences. The Garda deal with their problems in a sympathetic way and help them by advice and example from getting into further trouble.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a copy of the statement in relation to this matter made by me on Tuesday, 18th instant.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IN DUBLIN</P>
      <P Just="Center">Statement of Minister for Education 18th April, 1967.</P>
      <P>I have asked you to meet me so as to issue through you, representatives of the public press, the following statement in relation to University education in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Everybody, I think, will agree that the university situation in Dublin is far from being satisfactory. We have here in the capital city of a small country what are to all intents and purposes two separate and very differently constituted university institutions, each endowed in major part by the State, but each ploughing its own furrow with virtually no provision, formal or even informal, for coordination of their efforts or the sharing by them of what must always be scarce but very valuable national resources. Those resources comprise knowledge and skills of the highest quality, accommodation, equipment and material generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as the financial support of the State for what are in essence two competing institutions was not in the circumstances unduly great&mdash;although in fact, apart altogether from capital provision, it stands at the moment at over £1,400,000 annually&mdash;the position could be tolerated. Now, however, that university education, with its rapidly increasing student numbers and as a consequence its increasing requirements in staff, accommodation, equipment and material, will be making very much greater demands than heretofore on the Exchequer, clearly the State cannot continue and cannot be <Col N="2182" /> expected to continue to subsidise any avoidable duplication of university services which merely adds to the cost and lessens the educational efficiency.</P>
    <P>This is for several reasons an opportune moment to call halt and assess the position. In the first place, there is the general prospect, to which I have referred, of a vast increase in student numbers, with a corresponding increase in expenditure on university provision. Secondly, the Commission on Higher Education has just issued a Summary of its Report and Recommendations. Thirdly, the issue has already come to a head this year by way of university building claims to cater for the increasing demand for places.</P>
    <P>Let me begin with Trinity College. Trinity, in its capital claim submitted in relation to 1967-68 and succeeding years, seeks a State grant of almost £2½ million. The bulk of the claim is based on a decision taken by the College authorities last year to raise their ceiling of students from 3,000, which corresponds with the College's present capacity, to 4,000, provided that the additional 1,000 students come from any part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The College's number of students in 1965-66 was 3,327, comprising:</P>
    <P>From Ireland, 2,085, of whom 741 were from the Six Counties; from Great Britain, 947; from elsewhere, 295, including 30 from the Continent, 34 from the USA, four from Canada and one from Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the claim for almost £2½ million capital comprises £307,000 for scientific equipment; £812,000 for new buildings to house Engineering, Mathematics and some sections of Physics; £306,000 for a new building for Biological Sciences; £740,000 for the first of two Arts blocks and £46,500 for renovations and conversions in the School of Medicine.</P>
    <P>Now I do not deny that the additional accommodation and other facilities would undoubtedly be needed if the ceiling were to be 4,000 without any reference to the origin of the total of the students comprising that figure. I would, however, have expected that in any circumstances a decision to increase by 1,000 beyond capacity would <Col N="2183" /> not have been made without the prior sanction of the State, which must pay the piper in respect of all the capital building concerned and also the major part of the consequential staffing and running expenditure. I would also have expected that this decision would not have been made at a time when Trinity still had over 1,200 non-Irish students. At present the State's annual expense for non-capital purposes in Trinity is about £170 per student, which means that in effect it would be called upon not only for the proposed additional, and later no doubt further additional capital expenditure, but also for a further non-capital annual expenditure of at the very least £170,000.</P>
    <P>Let me here digress for a moment in order to state clearly and unequivocally that I am strongly in favour of a leavening of non-Irish students in our universities. An admixture of foreign students is a healthy thing in itself and moreover is in accord with the best Irish traditions. Ever since Colmcille left Ireland for ever in 563, Irishmen have been striving, as far as circumstances permitted, to make some return of the debt they owe to the rest of the world. In early times we not only sent missionaries throughout the Continent, but received here in our schools many scholars and students. In more recent times our people, both clerical and lay, have gone out to the ends of the earth to make return likewise. Now again also we have students from the ends of the earth seeking skills and training here which are not available to them at home.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we Europeans, who through the action of Providence and not, I should say, through any merits of our own, owe to Ancient Palestine, Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome our flying start over the rest of the human race in almost everything that matters, owe in turn to the developing countries of today, to Africa, Asia and Latin America, a sharing with them of that priceless heritage.</P>
    <P>I favour strongly, therefore, our receiving a reasonable number of foreign students, but consider that it is unhealthy, both from their point of view and ours, that there should be any <Col N="2184" /> large block of them, and especially a large block from any country already developed, in any particular College, with almost none in the others, as is the case at present. They should be more evenly distributed throughout our Colleges. Furthermore, in the future arrangements, which I shall adumbrate in a moment, I would hope that foreign students will not have to be subject to any extra charge.</P>
    <P>To return to the claims for capital subsidies. Side by side with the Trinity claim for over £2 million as a start, the Government, by reason of the prospective vast increase in student numbers, is inescapably committed to an eventual expenditure of over £2½ million for the new Art and Administration Block in UCD; for £1.2 million for the Students' Building there; and for an eventual £1 million for the new UCD Library; together with a vastly increased consequential annual expenditure. All this is apart from the prospective State expenditure, capital and current, in the other university institutions, whose claims, if not amounting to the Dublin figure, are equally compelling.</P>
    <P>Again, we must not forget that there are legitimate and pressing claims from educational sectors other than the universities. The scheme for free second level education which begins in September next will call for its quota of millions. Then we have our primary system, with its need for hundreds of new schools; then the secondary and vocational schools, with their immense capital and current needs; the Training Colleges; the call for more and more audio-visual aids, including an extended use of television; the necessity for a very great deal more educational research; and of course the many findings of the Survey, <i>Investment in Education</i> and of the Commission on Higher Education are already knocking at the door. We are already spending on education much the same proportion of our national income as are the other western European countries. Soon, indeed, we shall outpass most of them in that regard. To my mind this will be very proper, as a small and poor country cannot afford not to spend more on education than a richer one. <Col N="2185" /> The sad aspect of the matter, however, is that while we probably are, and certainly will be, spending proportionately more on education than the other western European countries, our national income is lower per head than that of most of these countries, so that we shall in fact be providing less money per head for education than they. These are points that are seldom adverted to in the comparing of our educational system with others. The answer is that if we want still more education, we must have increased productivity. But while it is clear that increased productivity is what is basically required I am convinced that the prerequisite for this is more and better education. The interrelationship of productivity and education, is not, however, a vicious circle, but rather a coiled spring.</P>
    <P>I am straying a little from my subject, but what I have been saying needs to be said and reiterated, if we are to see our educational commitments in proper perspective.</P>
    <P>To return to expenditure at university level, we have three alternatives. We could continue to subsidise duplication, but this would simply be beyond our resources. We could arrest the growth of university education by maintaining it at the barest life-line. This cannot be thought of, for it would mean stagnation or worse. If a modern university is to avoid continual loss of staff and frustration generally, it must endeavour to expand its facilities to meet demand and must continually further equip itself humanly and materially to handle a rapidly increasing store of knowledge. Indeed, it must itself add to that store. This is especially so, of course, in relation to that very expensive sector, Science, but it applies also to the traditional Arts and Commerce subjects, Modern Languages, History and the like. Any university which would be prepared to sit still in the face of the rapidly changing world of today would not be worth its salt and in fact in modern conditions would be doomed. In turn, the atrophy and slow death of our university institutions, which are the fount and source of the country's advanced knowledge and professional skills, <Col N="2186" /> would simply mean that Ireland would have no place in the world of the year 2000, which is not so very far off.</P>
    <P>There remains only the third alternative, a joining of forces with a view to the obviating of all unnecessary duplication, with its consequent financial and educational loss.</P>
    <P>That such duplication has existed and still exists is of course the fault of no particular institution. In an address of the 10th September last to the National Union of Journalists it fell to me to point out that &ldquo;our present university set-up is a legacy of history &mdash;and history is a stubborn wrestler&rdquo;, but that until the Commission on Higher Education should speak my lips were sealed.</P>
    <P>Silence did not, however, forbid the devoting of thought to the problem that lay on my desk in relation to the financial year 1967-68, namely, the in essence competing claims of the two Dublin Colleges. The major part of the problem had been with the Department from the previous year, awaiting the Report of the Commission. No Report from a Commission, however, even were that Commission one of angels, could be expected to produce a simple and easy solution.</P>
    <P>It seemed useful, therefore, as the matter was more and more pressing, formally to bring the situation before the Government. This I did in December last, with a view to exploring how best to rationalise the university position in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government, while appreciating on the one hand the urgency of the matter but on the other that the Commission was expected very shortly to report, felt it would be proper to await the views of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Now that a Summary of the Commission's Report has been issued, it emerges that it does not contain any recommendations for the establishing of a formally defined relationship between the two Colleges. Before proceeding, however, let me here thank very sincerely the Chairman and members of the Commission for their labours. I have seen the larger part of the Report proper and when it appears it will be evident from it that profound thought and very considerable energy <Col N="2187" /> have been bestowed on what is an extremely complex and wearying task. The members of the Commission, too, were caught in the web of history and, if, as was to be expected, their findings do not please this interest or that they have none the less served the nation truly and well.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, in this particular problem of university education in Dublin, while recommending all possible co-operation between University College and Trinity College, they feel that each of these institutions should continue as an entirely independent entity without any formally established relationship between them, it was perfectly open to them to proffer that counsel.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have given, however, the Government consider that the public interest demands the establishment of a formal relationship between the two Dublin Colleges. The Government have accordingly authorised me to announce that it is their intention to proceed on the lines of my proposals of December last. Those proposals were framed on the basis of there being one University of Dublin, to contain two Colleges, each complementary to the other.</P>
    <P>The two Colleges would be founded on the two existing institutions, University College and Trinity College. One University in Dublin would involve one University authority, statutorily established on a democratic basis, with a subsidiary authority, similarly constituted, for each of the two Colleges. In the matter of the identity of each College the feeling of the existing authorities will be given the utmost weight. I may add that I have this morning informed the President of University College and the Provost of Trinity College of these proposals.</P>
    <P>This moment is not without its solemnity. It marks the end of an era in the long story of university education in Ireland and also, it seems to me, in the history of the country itself. Each of the institutions concerned has had a remarkable past and each has played a part of the highest importance to Ireland. Trinity, the  , when founded more than <Col N="2188" /> three and a half centuries ago, was intended to be one of a number of Colleges of the University of Dublin. It is late in the day, but not too late, for it to become so.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period it has produced a number of alumni whose fame has shed lustre not only on their College, but also on their country, in every part of the world&mdash;Swift, whose tercentenary, just now being celebrated, has attracted scholars from near and far, Berkeley, Goldsmith, Burke, Hamilton, to mention but a few. More important perhaps to us than even the world wide renown of these is that in every generation since Swift, Trinity College has produced from the ranks of the ascendancy a number of champions of the oppressed majority, some of them even becoming its leaders. The names of Swift himself, of Berkeley, Burke, Grattan, Tone, Emmet, Davis, Hyde and many others are sufficient evidence of that.</P>
    <P>There may be those who will feel, mistakenly, that under the new arrangements something of &ldquo;that which once was great has passed away.&rdquo; It is to be noted also however&mdash;there would be no point in ignoring it&mdash;, that the College as an institution was for long the pillar and prop of the oppressors. This is to be noted, but not remembered. The past in that regard is past. Besides, Trinity is not going to pass away. It will be merely taking the final step across the threshold of that mansion to which it properly belongs, the Irish nation. I think I may say sincerely that Ireland will welcome Trinity's final entry into the fold with all her history on her head, as in the words of John Kells Ingram, she has caught to her breast Dane, Norman, Old English, New English, Huguenots and many others.</P>
    <P>On such an occasion one cannot help thinking it a pity that when in 1908 an opportunity occurred for Trinity to enter the new university complex which was then being established here, she was guilty of what might be termed the Great Refusal. It would be totally unjust of anyone to blame the present authorities and staff of the College for that attitude of sixty years ago and I do not do so. On the contrary, since <Col N="2189" /> that time, things have, as the poet said, &ldquo;changed utterly&rdquo;, in Ireland and in the world. The present moment is in my belief a most auspicious one for a reversal of the 1908 decision.</P>
    <P>University College, too, although it is only a few years since it held its first centenary, has already carved out its special place among us. Founded by the Catholic Hierarchy in 1854 as the Catholic University of Ireland, its first Rector was the illustrious John Henry Newman, that lord of language and ideas whose lectures on &ldquo;The Idea of a University&rdquo;, first delivered in Dublin, are more and more studied in every university in the world. Following the Catholic University's weary &ldquo;struggle with fortune&rdquo;, as it was called at the time, it survived as University College under the prudent direction of the Jesuit Fathers under whom it held its own and more than its own academically, but without State support, till in 1908, when it received statutory recognition as a Constituent College of the newly established National University.</P>
    <P>In its time it has numbered among its alumni or staff those great scholars Eugene O'Curry, Father Edmund Hogan, Eoin Mac Neill and Douglas Hyde, the last two joint founders of the Gaelic League and Mac Neill the founder of the scientific study of our early history.</P>
    <P>Later it gave us Pearse and Mac Donagh, who might be said to have stepped straight out of its portals into history. University College can claim too the name of Kevin Barry, which is graven in the hearts of the Irish people, and many other such who played a valiant part in the struggle for independence, not forgetting our present Uachtarán.</P>
    <P>Since 1916 its special function has been to give our country the larger part of its teachers, scientists, engineers, doctors, dentists, architects, administrators and other professional experts, as well as its quota of public men, whose services have over the past fifty years been increasingly required in the building of the new Ireland.</P>
    <P>There may be some also to deplore that it has not been seen fit to give University College the status of a <Col N="2190" /> separate University, such as Newman dimly foresaw. To those I would say that to form a part of the University of Dublin is a destiny which will eventually add greater prestige to University College than if it were to stand apart on its own. At any rate, the basic economic and educational facts of the case insist on the complementary position which I have outlined. The statutory arrangements will, of course, only lay the structure on which that complementary position will be achieved. The Commission on Higher Education has forecast that we may expect some 26,000 students in higher education by 1975, of whom about 23,000 will be attending university. At the moment our university student figure is about 16,000 and despite any damming of the torrent which may be achieved by such measures as two Honours in the Leaving Certificate for university entry, my personal forecast would be something like 27,000 and not 23,000 university students eight years from now.</P>
    <P>At any rate, clearly now and not 1975 is the time to try to rationalise the position. There are many obvious ways in which this could be done. Why, for instance, should the State have to pay University College, Dublin, £160,000 annually and Trinity College £86,000 annually towards the support of two distinct Veterinary Faculties, when these two Faculties annually produce about 45 and ten Veterinary graduates respectively? Would not it be well if these two Faculties could be merged in a single institution? In the field of dentistry, thanks to the Government's action, the clinical teaching is given by all the staff, in the case of three Colleges, to all the students. Would it not be very desirable to bring about an arrangement whereby the pre-clinical dental students would be catered for in similar fashion?</P>
    <P>In University College, Dublin, there are about 900 Science students, with about 900 more from various Faculties who take Science in their first year only. In Trinity there are about 300 Science students. Would it not be more economical for all these to be taught under the one roof, <Col N="2191" /> so to speak? I do not say that this can occur by October next. The switchover would take some years, but it is a target which we must set ourselves. Similarly in Medicine, similarly in Arts, the two other large Faculties, need there be unnecessary duplication of staff, duplication of building, duplication of equipment? These are the kind of things I have in mind when I speak of the two Dublin institutions being complementary to each other. If I am asked can the thing be effected, my answer is that, given the will to do it, it can be done&mdash;and I have no reason to think that the will shall not be forthcoming. There will be difficulties and there will still be some overlapping, but the whole thing cries out for some kind of complementary allocation.</P>
    <P>It may also be asked would not such a coalescence of staff of this Faculty in one College and of that Faculty in another College be a case of overstaffing. As it happens, it would not, for, as is well-known, our university staff-student ratio is very weak compared with that obtaining in, say, Britain. In University College, Dublin, it stands at about one member of the staff to 22 students and in Trinity at about 1:16, whereas in Britain it is about 1:8. Even, therefore, it the staffs of the two institutions were to coalesce in any Faculty, the staffstudent ratio there would still be far from the optimum. The severest demand on any university today is the maintaining of international standards and in the long run the standard of any educational institution will depend on the numbers and quality of its staff. It is for us to be thankful that if our staff-student ratio is low, at least the quality of our university staff is high generally.</P>
    <P>In this matter, therefore, as in many others, what makes economic sense makes educational sense too. The collaboration in one Faculty of the staffs of two existing Faculties cannot but contribute greatly to the raising of standards. Similarly, in research in which sector there is relatively a good deal of leeway to make up in all our Colleges: this was in large part due to <Col N="2192" /> the heavy teaching load, due to shortage of staff. There, too, accordingly, we may expect a great advance.</P>
    <P>In passing, it may be mentioned that the finding of qualified staff for our university institutions is going to present us from this on with a very serious problem. For my own part I would have good hopes that under the new <i>régime</i> the most brilliant of our own postgraduate students would be carefully nursed so that when the time would come for them to seek a teaching post they should feel that their rightful place is in one of their own Irish university institutions. I believe that the proposed arrangement will contribute greatly towards that end.</P>
    <P>I have treated mostly of the economic side of things and of training for the professions. Let it not be thought that for that reason the purely educational aspect of a university's functions is regarded by me as of little account. Far be it from me to convey that impression. We are all to some extent followers of Newman in the belief that a university has something more to give its students than mere training. If it is true to itself, it should also give them that indefinable thing which might be called quality. I believe firmly that the new University of Dublin will be better able to give its students &ldquo;quality&rdquo;, in the best sense of the word, than could, under existing conditions, either of the existing Colleges.</P>
    <P>Finally, but by no means least in importance, the new University of Dublin will not be &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; denominationally, but multi-denominational, with the fullest respect and recognition for all denominations of students and the fullest mutual respect among them for each other. &ldquo;Neutralism&rdquo; in relation to what happened two thousand years ago in Palestine would not have been and is not a concept that would have any appeal for the vast majority of Irish parents, whatever their denomination. In the future University of Dublin there will be provision for both Catholic and Protestant Schools of Divinity or Theology. This was not permissible to University College under the 1908 Act.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are at the opening of a new era in higher education. <Col N="2193" /> This national problem which has been with us for many generations needs only good will for it to be solved satisfactorily. I am confident that that good will shall be forthcoming and that the present is the ideal moment to evoke it.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister anything to add to that statement? Will there be any real progress? There is still quite a lot of mystification about this amalgamation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time, Deputy Dillon mentioned that an abundance of houses was available for workers when the inter-Party Government left office. I want to quote now from volume 160, column 2060 of the Dáil Debates for 6th September, 1956, the week before the bottom fell out of the last inter-Party Government's world. Deputy Larkin said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything to be pleased about when an essential building programme is being held up. People living in clearance areas, families suffering from TB and <Col N="2197" /> families living in overcrowded conditions will have to wait for this essential building programme.</P>
    <P>This gives a clear indication that Deputy Dillon does not know what he is talking about, that he has been misled by some of his Party and that he was out of touch with the situation in 1956. He was out of touch, as were all the other members of the inter-Party Government at that time. He, and other Members, have repeatedly come into the House during debates on the housing situation and claimed that there was an abundance of houses available when they left office. However, in the week before they left office, on the last occasion when they had an opportunity to discuss anything, Deputy Larkin told us that people were living in overcrowded conditions and in slum areas and people who had TB were not housed as a result of the hold-up in housing at that time, as I previously indicated quoting from this very valuable document, Volume 160 of the Dáil Debates. I imagine it should be sold out within the next week, if not already sold out. It is a best seller.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from it again. At column 2060, Deputy Larkin said:</P>
    <P>The picture facing us in Dublin this year is not too pleasant. The number of houses completed in the period from 1st April, to 31st October last year was 644: this year the number is 449. The number of men employed on housing, housing development work and allied occupations in Dublin city last year was 2,199: this year the number is 1,854. Bear in mind also the fact that last year's figure represented a 50 per cent reduction on the employment in 1951.</P>
    <P>That shows the dismal failure at that time of the inter-Party Government whose members now try to claim credit for leaving behind them 1,500 houses. No doubt they had 1,500 casual vacancies which occurred from time to time during their period in office when building workers were forced to emigrate. We had 1,500 broken homes which were the responsibility of the gentlemen we read so much about in this particular volume, the gentlemen in the inter-Party Government.</P>

I read something recently about his responsibility in the 1950s for the famous hen bird. He is supposed to have sentenced the poor old birds to death. Departmental funds were used to publicise the death sentence on the old birds. The advertisements were in Irish. Did he produce a bilingual bird, I wonder?</P>

      <P>Last week Fine Gael went into the lobbies to vote rejection of the Resolutions to provide the necessary money to help the old age pensioners, the widows, the orphans, the unemployed, the blind and the disabled. They voted against free transport for the aged. Did their action mean they would like to cut the increase to those old people to a shilling or does it mean they would not give <Col N="2203" /> them any consideration at all? Do they agree that the old people should be given free transport? These people got an electric shock from the Minister when he announced free electricity for the aged.</P>
      <P>This time next year, when the Minister has had time to settle in, I know he will give further consideration to the claims of the most deserving sections of the community. He is a man of initiative and of great understanding and sympathy. I am glad to be a member of a Party who have given so much thought to the problems of the aged and the disabled, not only in lip service but in actual contribution.</P>
      <P>In Waterford recently I saw wonderful progress in the development of the industrial area. It will give much needed employment to industrial workers. This is in addition to the employment available at Shannon where so much money has been spent in recent years on adaptation. In the Capital Budget, we find there are now 15 manufacturing firms at Shannon and that there are 3,827 persons employed. The total number of dwellings completed comprise 318 houses and a considerable number of flats and a scheme of 135 houses will be completed this year. That shows the development situation in relation to industry in that part of the country, though we hear so much being said about the neglect of the West. In Galway, too, the industrial area is being developed which will provide further employment for our workers and further accommodation for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also taken revolutionary and progressive steps in relation to education. A considerable amount of money is being provided for education, creating opportunities now that never before existed for children. New horizons are opening up for our children, new opportunities which were never before dreamt of. I am sure the people will gladly meet any demands made on them in this respect. I wonder will Fine Gael enter the lobbies to vote against it, as they did against our provisions for the old age pensioners, the widows and the orphans? We will not be impeded. If you want to make <Col N="2204" /> a name for yourselves, do not forget to come with us into the division lobbies, and then you can take credit for supporting in some way the necessary measures to provide taxation. The public will not think any the worse of you.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That was that part. In relation to the Department of Labour, the Government have expressed in concrete terms their desire to see Irish workers properly cared for and properly catered for. This is expressed in the development of the Department of Labour and by the exercises that will be undertaken by that Department. As we read through the Estimates, we find that new ground is again broken. This office will provide the services already outlined by the very able Minister for Labour in relation to redundancy, training schemes, resettlement allowances, research and career information. All these are very important to young people. With career guidance on leaving school, they will be equipped and advised on how best they can fit into the new world of tomorrow. They will not be left to make their own decisions and to be led into dead-end jobs which perhaps offer a higher financial award for a given period than some better-class jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish workers very much appreciate the effort of the Government in bringing about this situation in order to ensure that the problems of the future will be tackled in a realistic manner. There are already various aids for Irish workers in relation to conditions of employment, holidays with pay, industrial injuries and wet time. When a worker is retired, he has the benefit of the contributory old age pension. There is also an increase in that pension. We hope that in the future this will develop twofold. There are still some ruthless employers who fail to give their employees proper conditions by way of retirement gratuities, allowances, or pensions. We trust that the various organisations which cater for workers will endeavour to see that <Col N="2205" /> after their period of service, the workers are properly rewarded. The Government will supplement this by whatever increase can be given by way of social welfare or social insurance.</P>
    <P>The development of the Department of Labour is a very important aspect from the point of view of the workers. I hope that in the years to come the Minister will give whatever assistance he can and that he will not impede this development in any way&mdash;I know he will not&mdash;so that the worker can feel secure from the day he enters employment. Our aim is to make the workers feel secure so that if a man becomes redundant, he can be assured that irrespective of whatever political party or union he is a member of, he will get redundancy payments, and need no longer be guided by people who claim that they look after their own members having regard to the subscription requirement I mentioned previously. It is important that a man should be protected so that if a slump comes in his industry, he will have a period of retraining, and get a financial return during that period of retraining and then be resettled. It is important for a man to know that if he becomes redundant in a particular concern, a service will be available to retrain him for the future. This has brought great satisfaction to the great bulk of the Irish workers who feel that we have here a Government who are prepared to cater for the worker in realistic terms and to ensure that his future is safeguarded. He no longer has to worry about the boat. We have now reached a situation where if a man becomes redundant and if he has to move from his place of employment to a new area, he will be assisted financially by the State.</P>
    <P>The fact that the State is making the necessary arrangements on the question of career guidance is important. I am also glad to know that disabled persons will also be retrained. There is an increase from £80,000 to £250,000 in this section. Disabled persons will be trained and placed by the placement service. All these things show that the Government are understanding and have given detailed consideration to the problems of the future. The Government <Col N="2206" /> are aware of the pitfalls. Unfortunately on too many occasions men were kicked out of employment by Government direction under an inter-Party Government and they received no redundancy payments or any payments whatever, and had to take the boat to distant countries.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister, as I did at the outset, on his wonderful contribution. He can be assured that the public at large are in sympathy with him and are prepared to make the contributions he asks for by way of increased taxation. It would seem that the only people who have any doubts in their minds about these contributions are the people in the other two Parties in the Dáil. The Labour Party have criticised the Budget, although they voted for it. They cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the statement by the previous speaker about the political levy by any union. I have always abided by the rules of this House and I intend to abide by them. That precludes me from saying that the Deputy told a deliberate lie. I will, therefore, attribute his statement to ignorance of union rules and procedure. Every trade unionist who reads his book of rules knows exactly what the position is. Possibly the kind of trade unionists in the Fianna Fáil Party do not bother to read their book of rules. Therefore, it is not surprising that statements such as those made by Deputy Dowling are made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those statements are made in complete ignorance of the facts of the situation. A voluntary contribution is made by all members. Before I leave that, I want to say that it is not too <Col N="2208" /> peculiar to have an attack on the trade union movement or an attack on trade union leaders coming from the Fianna Fáil benches. It is not the first time this has happened and we know it will not be the last time.</P>
    <P>Now, to get to the Budget. Over the past week we had Government speakers telling us what a wonderful Budget this is. They maintain that it relieves distress, that it takes away hardship and generally does good. I want to pose a question. If we accept for a moment that this is true, who was responsible for the hardship and the distress which sections of people are suffering today? Was it not the Government who through their lack of policy down the years caused all this distress and hardship to our social welfare recipients and people on low wages generally?</P>
    <P>Government speakers now expect the people to thank them for a very slight relief of the distress which the Government, by reason of their policies, have caused those same people. Over the past 35 years Fianna Fáil have been in office for almost 30 years. During most of that period they enjoyed an over-all majority. In spite of all those advantages, in spite of all the speeches we hear today, we still have a very high level of unemployment, a very high level of emigration, a very low level of social welfare benefits, a very low level of industrial expansion and very slow progress in housing and other amenities.</P>
    <P>Progress over those years has been very slow. All the progressive countries in Europe have gone ahead, both socially and economically but this country has always lagged behind. We continue to lag behind after almost 30 years of Fianna Fáil Government. Of course, the Government got to power simply and solely on the promise that they would provide more jobs. They have managed to keep in power by the continuation of that false promise at every subsequent election. The fact remains, however, that employment has steadily gone down, particularly in the last few years. The number of people at work has decreased during those years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2209" /> Many speakers from this side of the House made reference to the two Budgets of 1966 and the extra taxation imposed on the ordinary people in those two Budgets and the fact that they got practically no reliefs. I want to refer to an attempt to introduce a third Budget last year. This was an attempt by the Minister for Local Government in another way to raise extra revenue. He had the idea that the tenants of corporation and council houses should pay more rent. He window-dressed the demand for more rent with a promise that the money would be used to provide a cheaper house for people who could not afford the high rent. This was all very good in theory, I suppose, but it was nothing more than an attempt to introduce a third Budget in 1966. I am glad the Government realised that the old age pensioners and people in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance could not afford to pay increased rent, but it was a very deceitful way to try to fool these people into paying higher rents. It was deceitful to go about it in this manner. The only aim the Minister for Local Government had was to provide extra revenue, extra taxation, not by increase in rents if you like, but it was an extra tax on people who live in council and corporation houses. If the Government are really worried about the rents that old age pensioners and other social welfare classes have to pay for houses, they should increase the benefits accordingly. The level of social welfare benefits should be such that tenants of local authority houses, and, indeed, tenants of private houses, if they are sick, unemployed, or if they are old age pensioners, should from the money they receive from the State be in a position to pay the rents and provide themselves with proper shelter.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to make the level of pensions such that it will give these people the necessary money to pay reasonable rents. The Minister for Local Government, or any Minister of State, should not be trying between Budgets to raise extra revenue by putting extra taxation on workingclass people who are already heavily burdened with direct <Col N="2210" /> and indirect taxation. No attempt should be made to put this extra taxation on them. It has succeeded, unfortunately, in some counties and there are occupiers of workingclass houses paying up to £1, and in some cases more than that, increase in rent as a result of the policy of the Minister for Local Government with, I assume, the sanction of the Government.</P>
    <P>This policy has now been laid aside because of the forthcoming local elections. I want an assurance from the Minister for Finance that if he does not introduce a second Budget this year none of the other Ministers, either the Minister for Local Government by way of demand for increased rents or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by way of increased postal charges, will come to this House before the end of the year looking for more money.</P>
    <P>The proportion of taxes now being paid by social welfare recipients and the lower paid groups has gone up substantially in the last few years, but the benefits accorded to them have not been in keeping with the increase in the cost of living, which, in turn, has been brought about mainly by increases in indirect taxation. If the Minister in this Budget appears to help the weaker sections and appears to relieve distress, I would ask him why should there be a weaker section. Who made weaker sections in our society? Who created the distress which we have now to try to alleviate?</P>
    <P>There are a few of the Budget proposals to which I should like to refer. The medical expenses relief is welcome, but I wonder does it really go far enough. I know it is difficult to do all that is required, but I also know of single men with wages of from £8 to £9 a week who have been refused medical cards and who cannot get free medical services. If these people run up a bill of from £30 to £40 a year will they get any relief for these medical expenses? The single man with from £8 to £9 a week cannot get a medical card. If he runs up a bill of from £30 to £40 a year and he is also paying income tax, will he get relief for these medical expenses?</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister, in future Budgets, to take steps to improve the start now made to grant relief in respect of medical expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relief for dependants is welcome but, here again, it is not good enough. We have a campaign at the present time by the Minister for Health and by local authorities&mdash;a good campaign &mdash;to encourage old people to remain at home, to remain out of county <Col N="2213" /> homes and hospitals. The Minister for Finance could go a little further to help in this campaign by having another look at the relief granted to people who keep dependants.</P>
    <P>The extra relief for children is also small because it is of no benefit to the worker on a low wage. It will benefit only the salaried man who has a comfortable wage. Efforts should be directed towards helping the man who is on a low wage. The relief proposed for people in managerial positions and other executives is, I suppose necessary, but there are other fields of activity in which people are engaged and in which they should be encouraged to remain. This should also be looked at, with a view to giving them some extra tax relief. I do not think the Exchequer will lose much by the relief granted to those salaried people, because, possibly, what the Minister loses one way he will get back in another, through indirect taxes on various popular commodities.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from these reliefs, I should like an assurance from the Minister that the 5/- increase in old age pensions, disabled persons maintenance allowance, <i>et cetera</i> will not affect home assistance payments already being paid to those people. It has happened in the past that every time these particular classes got an increase of 5/- &mdash;which was at local authority level&mdash;this 5/- was deducted from the home assistance being granted to them. It has created a serious injustice down through the years. I should like an assurance from the Minister that the home assistance payments being paid to people who require them will be maintained at their present level, even when this 5/is granted.</P>
    <P>This is most important, and I think the Minister should give us an assurance so that we&mdash;as Deputies and other people, as county councillors&mdash; will not be fighting with county managers, home assistance officers and other officials about this matter, that we will not have to waste the time of this House asking questions here of the Minister for Social Welfare later on in the year. The matter should be clarified at this stage, so that the <Col N="2214" /> increase will not interfere in any way or be taken into account in determining home assistance allowances. I hope the Minister will give that assurance because I can tell him, if he does not, there will be many questions asked in this House, a good deal of agitation at local authority level, and a good deal of hardship caused to the people concerned. But I think the Minister is clever enough to appreciate it is local elections year and that these could become very involved if some steps like this were taken. Then again, of course, the local elections will be over and done with when the people start getting their 5/- and if and when the 5/- or 2/6d home assistance has been taken from them.</P>
    <P>I want to refer at this stage to the general position in rural Ireland. When I talk of rural Ireland, I mean the country places, small towns and villages in the heart of this country. These areas particularly have suffered over the past number of years. Just before last Christmas, grants were given&mdash;as had been the case always&mdash; to local authorities to carry out special employment works. The notice issued to local authorities by the Department with these grants, said they were to be devoted to urban areas, that there was no money available for the rural areas. This has caused further hardship in rural areas; it has caused more unemployment and has also helped in the present denuding of the rural areas.</P>
    <P>We have had also in the past number of years a lack of new houses in rural areas. I shall not go into this in great detail because it has already been dealt with adequately&mdash;not alone lack of houses but lack of money to repair local authority houses. The extent of the damage done to health and to property as a result of the failure of the Government to make money available to do necessary repairs to local authority houses will never be known. Water and sewerage schemes have also been held up. We hope these schemes will be speeded up, now that we are assured by the speakers on the opposite side that everything is going well.</P>
    <P>There is another grave matter of discontent in rural Ireland, that is, the <Col N="2215" /> failure of the Government to provide money to repair roadways and cul-desac roads. People living in rural Ireland were called upon&mdash;in one of the Budgets of last year&mdash;to pay extra taxation on their cars, of 25 per cent. They, in common with their city folk, had to pay that extra 25 per cent, but they, not in common with their city folk, are expected to drive on roads full of potholes, roads which, in wintertime, are as soft as quicksand and, in summertime, one cannot see for quite some time after a car has passed because of dust. County councils have been doing their best to provide this very necessary amenity for people living in rural areas but the Government have repeatedly turned down appeals for any additional money for this work in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is also a slow-down in the provision of ESB supply to certain rural areas. People who applied in the past 12 months have been told by the ESB that, due to certain circumstances, they cannot provide the capital to connect their houses and they do not expect to be in a position to do so for anything from two to three years. This has been the stock reply to quite a number of people in my constituency who have applied for this essential service. They have been told they will have to wait two or three years. This is another cog in the wheel that turns to depopulate rural Ireland. Steps should be taken to make capital available to see that people who require electricity will get it within a reasonable time, without being told there will be a period of two to three years before it can be supplied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to it as one of the hardships the people of rural Ireland are confronted with today by reason of the failure of the Government to provide the necessary capital to carry out these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like again to ask the Minister to tell us what definite hopes he <Col N="2216" /> has for the future. This is a time of suspicion as far as ministerial statements are concerned. In early 1965, when a general election was pending, the Government successfully kept from the people vital information concerning the economy. I suppose, knowing Fianna Fáil, we cannot blame them for that, because it would most certainly have affected the outcome of that election, had the people known, when voting early in 1965, the exact state of health of the economy. Unfortunately for the people, they discovered only after the election how the economy stood.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by asking the Minister to give us an assurance that the economic trends, which are less unfavourable now than they have been for some time past, will continue in that direction. I hope we will not be back here before the end of the year discussing another Budget. As it happens, the Minister for Finance is not the only Minister who can bring in a measure that results in increased taxation and increased costs for the people. Not alone should we have an assurance from the Minister but we should have an assurance from the Government as a whole that this will not be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened for the past week to Fianna Fáil Deputies throwing bouquets at the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy is going to join them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard Deputy Dowling today. From his speech, one would gather that anything ever done in this country was done by Fianna Fáil. He mentioned the number of years they have been in office. The Minister has remarked that I was going to join in distributing bouquets to him. I have no intention of doing so because I think the Minister's task this year was an easy one, for the simple reason that his predecessors, the Minister for Finance before him and the various Ministers for Finance in his Party over the past number of years, have put their hands deeper and deeper into the pockets of the taxpayers. <Col N="2217" /> Surely, having scraped the bottom of that pocket, there was no alternative for the present Minister, especially in view of the forthcoming local elections, but to bring in an election Budget? I am convinced that the Minister's predecessor budgeted for a surplus last year. By any chance, would the present Minister be budgeting for a deficit? I would be very interested, as would, I am sure, the general public, to hear the Minister give a guarantee there will be no supplementary Budget within the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>Three years ago in this House, when the then Minister for Finance, now Senator Ryan, introduced the turnover tax, we were told that the old methods of taxation were obsolete and that we would have to turn to new types of taxation; but in every year since the turnover tax was introduced, we have had successive Ministers for Finance going back to the old methods of taxation. Not to mention last year, this year we see the Minister putting increased taxation on the workman's pint and, of course, we have the old annual tax-spinner of the increase on 20 cigarettes and on tobacco.</P>
      <P>I admit certain increases have been doled out in social welfare benefits, but surely these increases, which will be doled out after the local elections, are very small when we think of the recent steep increase in the price of bread, which passed practically without comment. Bread is the daily food of each and every one of these people who will get this small benefit. If we assess the increased cost per week to an old age pensioner of his bread together with the taxation put on his pint by this Budget, how much will that man gain by the meagre increase being doled out to him by the Minister for Finance? It was the least the Minister might do, and my only regret is that it is not half enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on the subject of social welfare benefits, I should like to know what the increases will be in the insurance stamp. I should like also to refer to the question of national health insurance benefit. There is a general complaint that if a person becomes ill and is, or should be, in receipt of <Col N="2218" /> national health insurance benefit, in most cases the people are back at work before they receive payment. I have heard of numerous cases where it was two to three weeks before they were paid. It might be no harm if the Minister drew that to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>As I said, from some of the speeches from the opposite benches, one would think everything in the garden was rosy. I am not quite sure what the employment position is in Dublin city, but I can say without fear of contradiction that over the past two months in my own area and in my own town, Carlow, I have never seen such widespread unemployment. It is pitiful to pass up the street each day and see the queue outside the labour exchange. I do hope the announcement made in the House a few weeks ago in regard to Heinz and Erin Foods will in some way help to relieve the unemployment position in the area.</P>
    <P>Some reliefs have been given in this Budget. Roughly £5 million is being given to the farming community. This is a very small contribution, but I am convinced that were it not for the pressure of public opinion, even this meagre £5 million, when you take it over the whole country, would never have been given. We do realise that there is a derating of agricultural land up to a limit of £20 valuation and on a gradual scale up to £30. We are glad to see that the Minister has taken note of the proposals which were announced not this year or last year but years ago in the Fine Gael policy. He has also taken note, to a limited degree, of our policy in regard to income tax allowance for medical expenses in respect of a sum of £50 and over. I did hear the Minister say this was the recommendation of the Commission, and I take it that was the reason for taking the figure of £50. I would be interested to hear if it would have cost the Exchequer much more if the Minister had gone over the limit of £50.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I do agree it is some relief. It is a step in the right direction which has been advocated in this House for the past four or five years or more by Deputy Paddy Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2219" /> I am glad to see the Minister has taken note of his recommendation in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the derating of agricultural land. There appears to be no relief whatsoever in this Budget for the small shopkeeper, for the person in the urban area who, just as much as the person in the rural area, year after year, has been burdened with increasing rates. Throughout the country this year rates have reached an all-time high. It is practically impossible&mdash;and I am sure there are very few would dare to contradict me when I say this&mdash;for the ordinary shopkeeper to carry on any business due to the increase in rates, the increased cost of living and the competition from various combines. It is regrettable that these people should fade from the business life of this country and the Minister should have given some relief to them in his Budget.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity during the Budget debate of referring to housing. I am convinced the housing drive is not at all what it should be. Not alone in my own county but right through the country and here in Dublin it is impossible for people to get houses. There are waiting lists in every urban and county council. Young people intending to get married and married couples find it is impossible to get housing. In my own town, we are going ahead with a scheme but that scheme will cater for only 55 to 60 families and there will still be 100 to 200 families waiting for housing. If we cannot put people into proper housing we are wasting our time talking about social justice and all the rest of it. One of our first duties is to ensure that our people are properly housed. I know a family consisting of father, mother and one child who for the past 12 months have been sleeping on a mattress on the floor of an urban council house because they cannot get housing. Even at that, they are not high on the priority list.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the increases given to social welfare recipients are practically negligible <i>vis-á-vis</i> increases in the price of food and increased taxation which directly affect <Col N="2220" /> these people. When the Minister comes to conclude I hope he will be able to give the House a guarantee that there will be neither a mini nor a supplementary Budget within the next 12 months. I should like to hear that guarantee given before we enter on the campaign for the local government elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry. I should like to inform Deputy Governey that the increases in social welfare and other benefits under this Budget will amount in a full year to £6¼ million. That is a sizeable sum. Since 1957, we, in Fianna Fáil, have had a tradition of giving increases to the social welfare classes and the record, I think, is pretty high. These people are the less well-off sections of the community. Fianna Fáil have never neglected them. We have always done our best when we had the money, as we have it here, to improve their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Governey and other Opposition speakers claim that everything in this Budget is part of the policy adumbrated by them. It reminds me of the cartoon in last Sunday's <i>Independent</i> in which everybody is claiming something as part of his policy. In the past six months, I have not heard any member of the Opposition calling for the derating of agricultural land, increases in social welfare benefits to a particular figure, or taxation relief in regard to medical expenses. These ideas were thrown out on occasions years back. Sometimes people throw out a great many ideas in the hope that some will come to fruition and they can then claim credit for them. During the past six months, when the Minister and the Government <Col N="2221" /> were seriously concerned as to what they would do in this Budget, what relief should be given and what taxation imposed, there was a paucity of ideas from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>This Budget, I think, took most of the Opposition completely by surprise because of the reliefs given and the wide field covered. The tax on cigarettes and beer will bring in something short of £3 million. The Minister is giving out three times that by way of relief. This Budget is the fruit of the wise policy followed over the past few years.</P>
    <P>There was little talk in recent months about derating. Land under £20 valuation accounts for 75 per cent of all the land of Ireland and another ten per cent practically comes in under £33 valuation. The small farmer realises this is a tremendous relief to him. Rates have always been the bugbear of the small farmers. I doubt if derating was mentioned once during the past 12 months. The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing in something welcomed throughout the entire country. Constituents to whom I have been talking are very pleased indeed.</P>
    <P>The relief in connection with medical expenses is very welcome because medical expenses constitute a hardship for quite a number of people in the middle income group. There was no tax relief whatsoever for them. I know, from making representations in regard to bills for medical expenses to local authorities, that quite a number of people will benefit from this concession. It is very welcome because it was hard for those people to pay out of their own earnings and there was no relief whatsoever in income tax. I believe this is a very welcome thing in this Budget.</P>
    <P>Bringing the dependent relative allowance from £120 to £140 is particularly welcome because it brings in all people who have an income under £2 12s. 6d. a week. A person can claim a dependent relative allowance for anyone under that figure. That ensures that a widow's son can claim for his mother.</P>
    <P>Deputy Governey said that there was <Col N="2222" /> a need for a housing drive. I am surprised to hear that. For the past few months, I know that every county council is making a tremendous effort in that direction and I am sure Carlow is no different from Kildare. In Kildare, we have practically 400 houses advertised and about 300 of them have been started since January. Therefore, I am at a loss to understand why Deputy Governey says that. I know that if local authorities send housing schemes up for sanction, in some cases it is only a matter of days, or certainly only a few weeks, until they are back with the local authority with the necessary sanction. They can then go ahead and advertise for builders.</P>

That is a big change, we know. It just shows how anxious we are to get on with the housing drive. In the two counties with which I deal, I find that the schemes are coming back and <Col N="2223" /> going ahead straight away. We have schemes of houses going up in Kildare and in Maddenstown in the Curragh. There are over 200 new houses being started in Newbridge, and a new scheme in Naas. They are four main ones. There are smaller schemes in Sallins which have been started since 1st January. If the other counties follow suit, we will have plenty of houses in the country. We will probably never do away with all the needs. There will always be a delay before we can fill the needs of everybody. If one is building a house one must wait a few months for it. The same applies to the local authorities.</P>
