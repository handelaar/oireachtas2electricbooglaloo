    <Title>Livestock Marts Bill, 1967: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 2, line 15, after &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy M.J. O'Higgins).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in the definition of the business of a livestock mart, the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;.  To that amendment the Minister has objected on the ground that the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo; are too vague.  There is a fundamental flaw in this whole Bill which derives from the fact that this Bill was not drafted with deliberation to achieve a certain purpose.  It was drafted precipitately in pursuit of a silly personal vendetta by the Minister against the National Farmers Association. Therefore, at the crucial point of preparing a definition section the <Col N="360" /> matter of defining what exactly it was sought to control under this vendetta Bill presented a problem which had to be solved by the draftsman in a very limited time and so we have the business of a livestock mart defined as the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.  If you adapt a place for that purpose you automatically are deemed to be a person engaged in the business of a livestock mart and thus come under the control of sections 2, 3 and the subsequent sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The problem arises at once as to what the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, in fact, covers and we have heard it suggested from the Fianna Fáil benches that it might cover a field.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach pointed out that you could not construct or reconstruct a field and for that reason he argued strongly against a previous amendment suggesting the insertion of these words.  But, remember that if you are deemed to have adapted a field, you are prohibited thereafter from selling cattle not only by auction but otherwise, that is, by hand, in that field.</P>
      <P>We have had an analogous piece of legislation in this House relating to auctioneers but that piece of legislation was drafted prudently and after due deliberation.  Do not let the House forget that, as a result of that, the Auctioneers Bill, which covered a vast business which is represented in every town and city in the country, passed through the House virtually without any division.  There was some discussion in Committee but in each case any amendment proposed by the Opposition resulted in a substantial consensus where it was adopted in part or in whole by the Government, and at the conclusion of the debate, there were mutual congratulations that the discussion here had provided a better Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to ask ourselves, under the Auctioneers and House Agents Act of 1947, what is a licensed auctioneer, we find in section 2 the expression &ldquo; `licensed auctioneer' <Col N="361" /> means a holder of an auctioneer's licence&rdquo;, and nobody comes under the scope of this Act or the subsequent Act which was recently passed in the House except a person holding an auctioneer's licence.</P>
    <P>Most of the Deputies, even those who came into Dáil Éireann only at the last general election, will remember that when the Auctioneers Bill of 1967 came before the House, the Second Stage passed in an hour and a half. On the Committee Stage, no dissension or prolonged argumentation arose, and the Bill took three hours of the House's time in totality.  The reasons were obvious.  Everybody knew precisely the scope of the business with which we were dealing, the people who would become subject to the Bill.  There was only one issue in doubt and that was whether the Bill would include control of what then was coming to be known pretty generally in 1947 as an evil institution.  We removed that doubt very simply by the first paragraph of section 2 which stated:</P>
    <P>(i)  In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;auction&rdquo; includes a Dutch auction and the word &ldquo;auctioneer&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>Here in this Marts Bill we face the situation that nobody in the House knows, including the Minister, who will be deemed to be a person engaged in the business of a livestock mart or what premises will be deemed to have been adapted in such a way as to make the owner thereof a person engaged in the business of a livestock mart.  We regard the Bill as evil and we shall repeal it in due course.  But <i>ad interim</i> we think it is very unfortunate that a piece of legislation of this kind pours petrol on an inflammable situation which we have consistently worked to damp down and control.</P>
    <P>Is there anybody in Ireland who wants this Bill in its present form? There may be odd individuals in the country who think that the business of a cattle mart, as we understand it, should be in some measure controlled or directed by the Department of Agriculture.  I doubt very much if there is anybody in Ireland who wants a situation created in which virtually <Col N="362" /> everybody who buys or sells a beast may be brought under the control of this Bill, depending on whether the Minister will make exemption orders subsequently under a later section of the Bill.  I do not believe there is any living creature in the country who wants this Bill on its merits, or that there is any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who wants it on its merits. I believe the Minister wants it because he has got thick, in the North of Ireland sense of that word, and certain members of his Party feel that once a member of the Fianna Fáil Government has brought a Bill before the House, they have an obligation to fight it out and support him through thick and thin, right or wrong.</P>
    <P>We have sought in the definition section to limit effectively and by the words of the statute the scope of the expression &ldquo;the business of a livestock mart&rdquo;.  Some new Deputies who are unfamiliar with the procedure of legislation may take scandal in the fact that a responsible Opposition should spend days debating a definition section; they may have the feeling that even if something is wrong here it can be put right hereafter.  They ought to realise&mdash;this is as good a time as any for them to learn &mdash; that the whole purpose of a vigilant legislator is to secure that the Bill, when it leaves this House, will give the Executive, that is, the Government for the time being, the powers the Oireachtas thinks the Government ought to have and no more.  It is the function of the Oireachtas to be vigilant to see that the Government do not come in here and get the omnibus general authorisation to do as they please, even though they give an assurance: &ldquo;We intend to be good boys and to use this with prudence and discretion.&rdquo;  I do not believe this Government are capable of using anything with prudence or discretion, but even if I thought they were a Government who were both prudent and discreet, we would be abdicating our function if we left them with powers we do not think they ought to have or they ought to exercise.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the case: &ldquo;You cannot give me the powers I ought to have and that I need to have to <Col N="363" /> implement the Bill unless you give them to me in the omnibus terms of the definition section I have submitted to the House.&rdquo;  We have proposed seven alternative methods of limiting the omnibus character of the definition section, not in the hope of improving the Bill, because we do not think it can be improved, but in the hope of giving the people the certainty as to who is subject to its provisions and, what is much more important, in order to make it as clear as crystal to the judiciary who is subject to the penalties and sanctions of the subsequent sections if hereafter the Minister should bring proceedings against any individual under the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill at present reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction;</P>
    <P>Does anybody here believe the Minister or the Executive should exercise the powers under this Bill against anybody who does not provide, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted and &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo; for the sale of livestock by auction?  I do not believe there is a Deputy here who thinks the powers of this Bill should be used against anybody except somebody whose place could be properly described by the phrase &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo;.  The Minister says it is vague. Can it be as vague as the words &ldquo;providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It means it comes under the provisions of the Bill even before it is used, if it has been adapted for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Adapted and habitually used&rdquo; would be better still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth throws a <Col N="364" /> floodlight on this.  The place is adapted but it is not being used for the auctioning of livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be licensed before it is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  It is reported to the Minister that Deputy Booth has adapted his premises for the sale of livestock by auction.  Deputy Booth says to the Minister: &ldquo;I never asked you for a licence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning authorities would have advance notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  The Minister's officers come to the Deputy's premises and a man meets them at the gate and says: &ldquo;Good afternoon, gentlemen, what can I do for you?&rdquo; They say they are officers of the Department of Agriculture and produce their identity documents and say: &ldquo;We are here to inspect your premises.&rdquo; The man says: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; They say: &ldquo;Because you have adapted them for the sale of livestock&rdquo;.  He replies: &ldquo;What about it?  Is this not a free country?&rdquo; They say: &ldquo;Of course it is&rdquo;. Then he tells them: &ldquo;You can go away.  I am conducting no livestock auctions and I have not sought a licence.  What business have you here?&rdquo; Does Deputy Booth agree that he is entitled to deny entrance to the officers of the Department of Agriculture if he has not sought a licence, if he has conducted no sale?  The officers say to the man: &ldquo;No, we are not going away. Look at section 1 of the Act.  It says: `the business of a livestock mart means the business of selling livestock by auction', but that is not all it means. It means providing for the sale of livestock by auction or otherwise.  We heard you sold a cow here yesterday.&rdquo; The man replies: &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me I cannot sell a cow in my own yard?&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;because you have adapted the place for the sale of livestock by auction.  You did not apply for a licence but you sold a cow. Now we are coming in to inspect your premises and to prosecute you because you have done that on your premises which you are not entitled to do.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose Deputy Booth were entitled <Col N="365" /> to say: &ldquo;I do not come within this definition at all and if you want to say that I come within the ambit of the Bill as a result of certain alterations I have made, you must establish not only that I applied for a licence and got it &mdash;which you know I have not done&mdash; but you must also establish that, having adapted the place, I have habitually used it for the purpose of conducting auctions of livestock&rdquo;.  They may then say to him: &ldquo;You are trying to insert the thin edge of the wedge, Mr. Booth. You must come under the control of the Livestock Marts Bill because the Minister is particularly concerned to ensure that places adapted for the sale of livestock by auction will not be used for the sale of cattle by hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy means that you must break the law first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Unless you are at variance with the law, the executive officers of no Department of State have any right to enter your premises.  Surely Deputy Booth is entitled to prune his roses without the horticultural officers of the Department coming along to see how he is doing it?  If they did, the Deputy would surely be entitled to say to them: &ldquo;Go to blazes.  There is no regulation requiring me to prune my roses in accordance with the directions of the Department of Agriculture.&rdquo;  We would all agree that the horticultural officers of the Department could give Deputy Booth or myself invaluable information about the pruning of roses, and if I were the Minister for Agriculture and these officers came to me and told me that they had offered their assistance to Deputy Booth and that he had told them to go away, I would telephone Deputy Booth and say: &ldquo;Mr. so and so journeyed out to your house to give you the benefit of his advice in regard to the pruning of your roses. How did it happen that you insulted him?&rdquo; Deputy Booth would probably reply: &ldquo;He did not do that at all, Minister.  If he had come to the house and said: `May I be of any assistance to you, seeing that you are an enthusiastic rose grower and I would like to help?  Perhaps there are some hints we can give you', that would be all right. <Col N="366" /> He did not do that at all.  He came to my gate.  He produced his identity card and said: `I am an officer of the Department of Agriculture and I am going to inspect your premises.  I want to inspect your roses'.  I said: `Go away and inspect your own roses' and I put him out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fascinating thing is that when Fianna Fáil Deputies begin to understand what our amendments to this section really involve, they are all for them.  I cannot acquit Deputy Booth as he is here long enough to understand the problems with which we are confronted. I do not blame some of the younger Deputies who came in only at the last election and who are bewildered and do not know what we are up to, but Deputy Booth should be aware that we are trying to introduce into this definition section a provision that leaves somebody who is not, in fact, in the ordinary commonsense meaning of the word, in the business of a livestock mart, in a position to stand at his gate and tell the officers of the Department or any other representative of the executive: &ldquo;I do not give a damn what documents you produce.  Clear away from here.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>But the person must be in the business of providing a place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but when you come to find out what is being in the business of providing a livestock mart, how is that defined?  It is defined not only as the business of selling livestock by auction&mdash;that is only one part of it; that is understandable to everybody but it goes on to say: the business of a livestock mart is providing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>No, &ldquo;the business of providing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy got the Bill before him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 14, you must draw a line.  The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; separates the two definitions <Col N="367" /> of the business of a livestock mart.  The first definition is that it means the business of selling livestock by auction.  That is clear.  Now draw a line after that and then there is the other definition which says that it means providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no line, or even a comma, after the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now I understand. Deputy Booth does not understand the section.  What Deputy Booth wants to say is: &ldquo;I am in favour of the first simple definition which is the business of selling livestock by auction&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is also cockeyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed about that, whether it is cockeyed or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Dillon is on his feet he might deal with this too.  The seller is the owner of the beast, the vendor.  That is why I say the first part is cockeyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the second part of the definition.  If you never engaged in the business of selling livestock by auction, you can engage in the business of holding sales of livestock by auction or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>You are engaged in the business of providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The business of livestock marts providing for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;business&rdquo; qualifies both phrases.  It means the business of selling and the business of providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The business of selling <Col N="368" /> livestock by auction or providing for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction. All we are trying to secure is that we ought to say, instead of what is in the Bill, providing for the holding of sales of livestock by auction a place adapted and habitually used for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
      <P>If an officer of the Department comes into the Deputy's premises adapted for the sale of livestock by auction he is in a position to say: &ldquo;You have habitually used this for that purpose and you have got to face the fact that you are now subject to the terms of the Livestock Marts Bill and you are not entitled to sell livestock by auction on those premises&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>At what stage, if the man has already been selling do you say: &ldquo;As and from this date you have been habitually selling.  Up to last week you were not but this week you are&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect a reasonable officer from the Department to say&mdash;mind you, that is an assumption but I would expect most officers of the Department to say this&mdash;that as he had not been habitually selling livestock, it is all right, and he would walk away.  He would then say that it would suit the Department's officers to keep an eye on that premises so that they would know what was going on and they could see if he was habitually selling livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a definition of &ldquo;habitually&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Booth went on the batter once a year, would I think it conformed with charity, not to speak of justice, if I described him as an habitual drunkard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose Deputy Booth were whipped into the House to vote, as we all are, and judging the situation that there would be no division before 9 o'clock, he left with Deputy Carty a note to say: &ldquo;Ring me at 67342 where I am visiting a sick friend if <Col N="369" /> there is a sudden division&rdquo; and then slipped out to the Savoy Cinema and left his name at the door.  The phone rang and then it was flashed on the screen: &ldquo;Would Deputy Booth please come out to the door.&rdquo;  He was then told that there was a call from Deputy Carty to ask if Deputy Booth would come back as there was a division on. Deputy Carty would say: &ldquo;When I rang the number, they said it was the Savoy Cinema, and I said `Get that fellow moved out of that'.&rdquo;  Deputy Booth would say: &ldquo;It does not matter whether it was a sick friend or not, I am here now.&rdquo;  If that happened once a year in justice, never mind charity, surely I could not describe Deputy Booth as an habitual liar?</P>
      <P>We have to be reasonable.  The language of legislation need not be utterly foreign to all common sense in order to have legislative meaning.  We all know what &ldquo;habitual&rdquo; means.  Mind you, I do not deny that the use of the word &ldquo;habitual&rdquo; could conceivably bring in one-tenth of one per cent of borderline cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not eliminate the uncertainty which the Deputy is trying to get away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not, but I say without hesitation that, if there is this extraordinary borderline case in which the whole determination rests on the interpretation of the words &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo;, decide in favour of the defendant. That is the whole problem here. Are we going out with a fine comb to go through the population to secure victory for prosecution, or as the Minister says, is the Department of Agriculture concerned to go out and tell farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember very well exactly a parallel case arising when it was sought to control the illegal curing of bacon just after the War, in 1948&mdash; precisely the same as this.  There were certain people who were licensed to cure bacon and certain persons who were licensed pork butchers and then there were ordinary pork butchers.  The licensed pork butcher had the right to pickle pork if it was threatening to go bad, to keep it, but he must not make bacon.  The only person entitled to <Col N="370" /> make bacon was the licensed bacon curer.  We had to confine it to them because we were rationing bacon.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was put to me: &ldquo;Let us go out and catch this person. Let us get the plain clothes gardaí to go out and seize the premises&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;You know well who is at this business. Get the largest member of the Dublin Metropolitan Garda and tell him to go down to that premises.  Stand him directly in front of the premises at 8 o'clock every morning and let him tramp up and down outside, shaking the windows with the weight of his footsteps.  I do not want to prosecute everybody but I want to fix them with notice that they are not going to get away with murder&rdquo;.  There was only one person who was prosecuted and that person was one of my youngest political supporters.  She was carrying on the illegal curing of bacon.  God bless her, she is in Heaven now and despite this, she said: &ldquo;He is still the best Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;.  She was a true-blue, and I like true-blues.</P>
    <P>My purpose was instead of catching people, to notify them that we were on to what they were up to and they were to stop.  If they did not stop we could go in the back door or the front door and get after them.  We had the whole situation controlled within a month.  I do not believe there were two prosecutions.  All we are trying to seek here is that we will have a definition of the business of a livestock mart which will not leave Deputy Booth, with all his experience in this Dáil, in the position in which he will not know whether he is obliged to open his gate and reluctantly admit an authorised officer of the Department or not.  Is that an unreasonable stipulation?</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth asks: &ldquo;What do you mean?  Do you mean regularly used in the past or regularly used in the future?&rdquo; I say I mean &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo;.  If there is any doubt about this, do not trust me: put a large member of the Garda Síochána walking up and down outside the premises and it will very soon become manifest whether the owner of the premises is habitually using them for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> The whole thesis of the Government is that a person has adapted his premises which involves some expenditure, presumably, which involves some prospective user of the premises.  In the name of Providence, why should we assume in reason that a person, having adapted his premises for the conduct thereon of the business of a livestock mart, should padlock the gate and never use it again?  If this is the intention, why the hell was it ever adapted? We are used to this ridiculous situation that the Minister sees in the words &ldquo;habitual use&rdquo; an element of doubt which would provide an insoluble administrative problem.  What is the problem?</P>
    <P>By his powers of observation to determine, does this man intend habitually to use these premises for the sale of livestock by auction?  Would any Deputy tell me, if that is not the person's intention, what the blazes did he adapt the premises for.  Was it for fun? Was it because he was avoiding income tax?  Was it because he liked the appearance of cattle pens round the house?  Was it because he wanted the fun of negotiating with the planning authority?  Unless you assume that we are about to deal with lunatics, there can be no doubt or question that the acid test of whether a man is engaging in the business of a livestock mart will ultimately pivot on the question of whether he habitually uses the adapted premises for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
    <P>It is a bad thing, Sir, to be faced with the fact of the refusal of an Irish Minister even to discuss any evidence of understanding or desire for compromise evidenced by the amendments put down by the Opposition of this House, which gave rise to a situation in which we are faced with the fact of closure and the guillotine this evening. I concede, Sir, that the kind of proceedings that we have been engaged in in the past three days of tendentious and endless debate causes me some distress.  I asked myself last night after this House adjourned: &ldquo;What is the reason for this?  Why are we locked in this extended discussion; why are we <Col N="372" /> talking in terms of closure and in terms of a guillotine?  When did this happen before?&rdquo; As people grow older, they tend to become more preoccupied with history.  The last time anybody belonging to me engaged in activity of this kind was in the British House of Commons when we were fighting a Coercion Bill.  The antagonists were Buckshot Forster, a poor old Yorkshireman who did not know anything about this country, who did not understand it, but who was doing his duty according to his lights.  He was put out and rejected under the pressure of protracted debate.  They called it obstruction in those days.  The next time it was used was to challenge Bloody Balfour who hated this country. He was a member of the Salisbury family and he hated our people.  He despised them and he believed that you could not deal with the Irish people by the ordinary process of legislation.</P>
    <P>It suddenly struck me that here is the key to the problem confronting us in Dáil Éireann today.  We are not dealing with ordinary legislation.  We are not dealing with the kind of Bill that ought to be before Dáil Éireann at all. We are dealing with the same kind of legislation as Balfour sought to invoke against our people because he hated our people.  Because the Minister for Agriculture hates a particular farming organisation in this country, this Bill is directed against that organisation.  That is why there is no reason; that is why there is no argument; that is why there is no dialogue between us.  It does not matter that we propose to limit this Bill to the purpose for which it is alleged to be introduced.  The fantastic fact is that the Minister himself comes of the very kind of people that Bloody Balfour persecuted and evicted and destroyed.  Having attained to ministerial office in his own country, he is actuated by the same vindictive hatred that sent Balfour down the road he travelled.</P>
    <P>Is not that a deplorable situation? Mind you, the Minister was born not so far away from some of the bloodiest evictions that took place in the country.  It ought to be in his blood <Col N="373" /> to repudiate the methods and motives of men like Balfour.  Let him examine his concience.  He has reduced the situation here in Dáil Éireann to the situation in which the British House of Commons stood 80 years ago.  Mind you, the most informed observers of the contemporary scene in 1887 said these people were battering their heads against a stone wall, battling against the power of the British Empire.  Where is that Empire now and where are the sons of the men who were battering their heads against a wall 80 years ago? We are here running our own country. Should we not be worthy of that freedom?  Should we not show the world that we know how to run it, that we know how to differ with dignity, that we know how to resolve our differences with dignity and that we know how to legislate with propriety?</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I am trying to cure a definition section of this Bill.  We are now in the third week of July.  Why, why?  I want to recall this to the House, because it is very relevant to this amendment, which I believe to be an eminently reasonable one, one which would in no way embarrass the Minister in the implementation of the rest of the Bill, from which I emphatically dissent.  Judgment has been passed upon the rest of the Bill by the Second Reading division.  Why are we here?  I want to voice this objection; Deputy Tully is here now and he can correct me if my story is untrue.  But I want to voice this complaint now, so that Deputy Seán Lemass can repudiate it if I say anything which is not strictly accurate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, Deputy Tully, Deputy Sweetman and I met Deputy Seán Lemass and Senator Ryan. Deputy Seán Lemass, who was then Taoiseach, asked us if we would collaborate with him to ensure that we would not have these tag-end debates at the end of a long session because, he said: &ldquo;I do not think you can get useful legislation out of that; everybody is tired; people tend to get irritable and generally it is desirable to avoid it.  I suggest to you that what we should try to do is to get the important legislation, about which we <Col N="374" /> may have fundamental differences, in between, say, October and February, and then from February to the end of the session, dispose of the finance business of the House, on the understanding the Government will be free to ask the Opposition to take, in the concluding stages of the session, either a Bill which is one of manifest urgency &mdash;which the Government certify to the House they cannot get on without&mdash; or else a Bill we are all agreed will go through in a day as there is nothing in it&rdquo;.  Is that a fair report of what was said?</P>
    <P>We said: &ldquo;We think that is a reasonable stipulation&rdquo;.  We sat down with the then Taoiseach and Senator Ryan and, as you know, Sir, the Standing Orders were changed in relation to taking divisions on Estimates and in a variety of other ways; I do not want to trespass on your patience by going into the details of all that. But all of the discussions and agreements entered into with the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party with the Fianna Fáil Party were founded on the undertaking of the then Taoiseach.  I think Deputy Tully will confirm this, that the then Taoiseach said he would not introduce into the end of the session contentious legislation, unless he felt constrained to say: &ldquo;The Government cannot carry on over the recess without it&rdquo;.  And we said that if it were of that character&mdash;if there were a war pending, an urgent problem of rationing, or something of that kind&mdash;and the Government said they could not carry on during the recess without it, we would agree, provided it was an exceptional case and they would be justified in bringing it in.  We said: &ldquo;If there is a Bill to facilitate a municipality in carrying out something, about which there is a consensus of agreement, a Bill which would go through in half an hour, bring that in &mdash;that is all right&mdash;but any Bill of substance, which you learn at Second Stage is one of deep contention, will be left over until the autumn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, if this discussion has been difficult, protracted, and intractable, it is for the reasons foreseen and provided against by the Leaders of the principal <Col N="375" /> Parties in this House.  It was in order to avoid this kind of situation that the Standing Orders were amended to produce the pattern I have described.  If there is a scintilla of inaccuracy in that story, I invite Deputy Seán Lemass to intervene and correct me publicly, but I know he will not, because these facts are literally true.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to ask the House again, Sir, in the knowledge of the circumstances in which these agreements were entered into, in the knowledge that we have been here now for days trying to determine the scope of the application of this proposed Bill, in the name of commonsense and reason &mdash;bearing in mind that the Minister has told the Leader of the Labour Party in an exchange across the floor that by the time he has made all the regulations, all the exemptions and so forth he intends to make under the Bill, it cannot operate fully certainly until the first day of next year, and with regard to certain other provisions, cannot operate until the Bill has passed the Seanad and has been signed by the President, if and when it is&mdash;why was it brought in a week before this House was scheduled to adjourn?</P>
    <P>Is it unreasonable for me to say it was brought in for an ulterior motive? Is it unreasonable for me to assume, in the difficulties in which we find ourselves involved in trying to bring this definition clause into a condition which is in any sense acceptable to the Opposition Parties in this House, that it is because it was brought in precipitately, without due deliberation, and without adequate thought or foresight? Is it unreasonable for me to add that the present Taoiseach&mdash;and I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to direct the Taoiseach's attention to this fact&mdash;is the successor of Deputy Seán Lemass? I do not think I am unfair in saying that he is bound by the undertakings given by Deputy Seán Lemass to myself, as Leader of the Opposition, and to Deputy Corish as Leader of the Labour Party.  We have performed our part of that bargain, on the assumption that the liabilities undertaken by Deputy Seán Lemass, as Taoiseach, <Col N="376" /> were automatically accepted by his successor, Deputy Jack Lynch.  We have performed our part, by facilitating the handling of the finance business of the House.  Does he perform his part by sanctioning the submission of a Bill of this character to the House at this stage of the parliamentary session and which meets the kind of opposition he was forewarned it would meet, when it runs into the difficulties we warned him time and time again it would meet? Does he think he is fulfilling his part of the bargain when he announces they will put through the Bill?</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, this is our Parliament.  We can run it with dignity and decency and, mind you, these are not easily definable things. But there is not a man or woman sitting here in this House who does not know what dignity and decency mean.  We can run it with dignity and decency, or we can run it like men and women berserk.  The present proceedings are appropriate to men and women gone berserk.  They are that because they are being run in direct violation of procedural arrangements arrived at between all sides in this House, for the express purpose of avoiding the possibility of our drifting into such a situation as we are now in.</P>
    <P>I know that when people's face, in the oriental sense of that word, gets involved, it is very often difficult to adjust, and there are certain people who feel that any adjustment of that kind would involve a degree of humility which is inconsistent with their public image.  Humility with dignity never belittled any man.  I am putting it to the Parliamentary Secretary now and I have a right to charge him to convey that message to the Taoiseach. These proceedings are in direct violation of the honourable undertakings personally given to me and to Deputy Corish, to Deputy Tully and Deputy Sweetman by the Taoiseach and Senator Ryan.  They ought to be stopped. This issue can be raised again in the autumn.  We will debate the Bill then energetically but it can be disposed of by the ordinary processes of this House.  The alternative is that in violation of the Taoiseach's pledged word, you will move the steamroller. <Col N="377" /> The Fianna Fáil Party now have a clear majority in this House.  It is an ugly operation.  It will be very exhaustively debated before it is allowed to roll.  It will be resisted at every revolution of its wheel.  It will do the House no good; it will do the country no good; it will do the Deputies, who, after all, represent our people, no good if it is allowed to roll on to the end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that this amendment is for the purpose so succinctly stated on the face of it. Deputy Booth was in some difficulty as to a definition of &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; but I take it to be <i>simpliciter</i> the alternative to &ldquo;casual&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-habitual&rdquo;, and we are well aware that in relation to the volume of legislation we have, where definitions of this nature are left to unknown authorities or unknown definitors in some well concealed office of some Ministry, we never get the type of answer that legislation originally envisaged.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any reason why the Minister cannot accept an amendment like this, which is designed for the purpose of clarification and which will make interpretation very easy in the ultimate working of the Bill and the regulations appropriate thereto.  While, like my colleague Deputy Dillon, I abhor the whole esoteric principle behind this Bill, I think it is incumbent upon us as an Opposition to try to make it, bad as it is, a bit better, if the processes of parliamentary procedure, properly used, can so do.  I must confess that I frankly have great admiration for the deliberation and consistent effort that is being made by my colleague, Deputy Dillon, in relation to getting clarification, <i>simpliciter</i>, into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is becoming more and more evident, particularly in the shade of the guillotine&mdash;I was unaware that my words of wisdom were not being picked up by the sound system&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it as well as I do, that but for the affronts to the newly-found arrogance of this newly-found Minister for Agriculture, we would not be involved in this acrimonious, tendentious, unnecessary procedure of thrust and parry at this time <Col N="378" /> of the year.  I was not aware of the agreement arrived at between the Leaders of all Parties in this House with regard to the manner in which business would be dealt with at this stage of a session until we were addressed in such a clear-cut manner by our colleague, Deputy Dillon, who made the agreement when he was Leader of the Opposition.  It does seem to me appalling that we have reached the stage in the exercise of our democratic rights at which a Government, at the whim and caprice of a Minister who wants to carry his vendetta against an organisation too far, allow this complete breach of faith and privilage.</P>
    <P>I can see, as I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary, who is aware of certain types of <i>ad hoc</i> sales and the difficulties that can arise in particular areas can see, that if there is not a definition of &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; and if there is not the inclusion of this phrase &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo;, the net of administrative interference and the rope of red tape will put a stranglehold on many of the traditional and ordinary activities in the sale of livestock today.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the belief, and always have, that we have far too much direction, far too much control, in the wrong direction in this country and not proper and effective control in many of the things that are needed far more urgently than the question of cattle marts or indeed the question of any transfer of livestock in the agricultural industry.  However, I believe that for the protection of the farmers, for the protection of the owners of the marts, for the protection of the people who will have recourse thereto in the course of their ordinary business, it is incumbent on us as a Parliament to try to restrict, as far as is possible, the invasion of bureaucracy and control and to try to make this Bill an understandable one in which the limits of interference will be firmly set, so that we will not have a repetition of the exuberant, ebullient statement of a former Minister for Agriculture who, one time, was going to knock down the ditches, level the fences, drive his tractors through the farmers of Ireland if they would not do his bidding.</P>
    <P>The day for that type of coercion is <Col N="379" /> gone and Irish people can be glad of the fact that they have the Fine Gael Party here to fight, line by line and section by section, this iniquitous piece of legislation, in an effort to preserve what we can of the rights of Irish farmers to control their own business, to maintain their normal way of life and to carry on.  But we are here faced by this blank wall&mdash;surrounding as it does a vast area of ignorance in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;of opposition for no other reason than the fact that the pattern has been set: &ldquo;Whether they are right or wrong, boys, we will not give them a line of an amendment; we will accept nothing, no matter what case in logic and in sanity can be made for it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a sorry cross to be placing on the farmers' backs simply because the farmers, in their organisation and manifest strength, are making demands for consideration of difficulties that exist in the general agricultural economy.  Take the whole pattern of the discussion on this Bill. Take the whole threat of steamrolling; take the whole concept now of the Minister saying: &ldquo;It will go through now.  I do not care when it comes into operation.  It may not come into operation until next spring but it will go through now because I, Sir Oracle, say it will go through.  It will go through without any rational approach to reasonable amendments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The simple amendment we are now discussing, in normal circumstances, would be non-controversial because surely to heaven we are not to have capricious interpretations of &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; or of what is the extent of a sale necessary to catch it in the net of the Minister's regulations?  Surely a place temporarily adapted for the purpose of an expedient sale, maybe used once or twice, should not be caught in this net, but if you put &ldquo;habitual&rdquo;, then that type of non-habitual use cannot be caught within the regulations which we know will fall in sheaves if this Bill passes?</P>
    <P>Why not accept this amendment? Why have continuous argument over it? <Col N="380" /> We had a long-drawn-out argument on an amendment to the same section through which we sought the simple exclusion of a wide area which we considered would be caught by the use of the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;.  Now we want to limit in an effective, intelligent way, the scope of this Bill in regard to <i>ad hoc</i> or unusual types of sale that may arise from time to time, and because we do this, we cannot get <i>simpliciter</i> the expression &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; put into the section.</P>
    <P>It should be quite possible, as has been done in relation to &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; in a case in which a person does an occasional transaction outside his normal business sphere.  It is only when that person does it with regularity, in a manner that could be described as habitual, that he comes within the net of the Revenue Commissioners. Apparently this Minister wishes to become a little Sir Echo, a bombastic little boss over the whole agricultural community, who wants to invade every facet of their activity so that he can say: &ldquo;You will do no buying or selling of livestock throughout the length and breadth of Ireland unless you conform with the regulations designed by me, Neil Blaney, Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;; and the Statute Book will become accursed by this futile, fruitless, contentious legislation because of the whim and caprice of the man who is not prepared to accept the most reasonable argument in support of a most reasonable amendment.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Dillon has rightly explained to the House, we in these benches, by putting down these amendments to the definition section, have been endeavouring to have this Bill discussed in isolation from the background of hatred and of deplorable Government-farmer relations from which the Bill has emerged.  This task has been rendered extremely difficult because in fact we are discussing and debating this whole measure with ourselves, because all the Deputies on the far side of the House are obviously under order to keep silent.</P>

We have had three Parliamentary Secretaries assisting the Minister and they, too, have all been silenced.  We cannot get an answer from them to a simple query because obviously the order is: &ldquo;Do not talk because there is nothing you can say in defence of the Bill and if you open your month, you will put your feet in it.&rdquo;  Any of them who has broken that silence has almost agreed with us that this definition section is quite impossible to understand, that it is quite vague and open to many different interpretations.</P>
      <P>We were accused last night by the Minister of keeping this House unreasonably in session beyond the normal period.  I was glad to hear Deputy Dillon this morning explaining in such detail the important agreement that had been reached, at Taoiseach level, with the Leaders of the other Parties not to have contentious legislation of this kind introduced at the end of the session.  It is obvious to all now that the Government have welshed on their own arrangements, the arrangements they sought from this House and from the Leaders of the Opposition Parties.

      <Col N="384" /> But nobody has spelled out what that means either.  &ldquo;Fit&rdquo; is a word that is almost, if not fully, as ambiguous as the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Fit&rdquo; is according to the eye of the beholder.  What you might think fit, I might not think fit. I would probably be more familiar with the requirements of a livestock mart than the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth said it would be obvious to anyone that, if a place were adapted for the business of selling livestock by auction or otherwise, it could not have reached that point without planning permission.  I was here when that statement was made.  I was surprised that Deputy Booth was not aware there is such a thing as exempted development.  In my view, anybody in this country is free to put up a farm building in any part of rural Ireland that is 100 feet from the road without permission from anyone.  That is as I know the planning legislation.  Therefore, that rules that out.  In addition, anybody is free under that legislation to erect a fence of a certain height.  I saw that proved: I saw a fence nine feet high erected.  I saw the local authority defied on it since that planning legislation came in.  Nobody can tell them to take it down.  We know that a corral for cattle&mdash;let it be called a ring or, as Deputy Harte says it is called in Donegal, a circle or whatever way we describe it&mdash;can be erected without planning permission. That disposes of what Deputy Booth said earlier that we could not have a place properly adapted for the purpose of selling livestock by auction or otherwise without getting planning approval.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; has caused endless trouble and endless concern because no one is able to confine it and no one is able to explain the limits to which the law can go. I believe it is there deliberately because the Minister wants it there.  The draftsmen are good civil servants and they do what they are asked.  They have provided exactly what the Minister wants: he wants limitless power.  He is in a great hurry and his impatience was <Col N="387" /> obvious here yesterday evening.  All he wants is to get his way.  He knows that, if this definition section is left wide open, as it is at the moment, then he will have complete ministerial control under the other sections and, if he says something is wrong, or something is not permissible, then that something will be wrong and not permissible.  The simplest sale, wherever it occurs, will come within the provisions of this Bill. The Minister will be in the clear.  He will have absolute power over those who produce livestock of any description and who want to sell.  This is a freedom of which the farmers will not allow themselves lightly to be deprived. Even if this legislation goes through, there will be more trouble in the country. This is being used as a weapon to hammer the farmers even more than they have been hammered in the past 12 months, and we have had more than enough of that.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, have an obligation to examine every line of this unwanted piece of legislation in order to see in what way it can be made less objectionable.  It can never be acceptable to the farmers and not one voice has been raised in favour of it.  Nothing has appeared in the public press or in the farming journals to show that this legislation, however it comes into force, is wanted.  In fact, there have been serious objections by all the organisations concerned and there has been no back-tracking on those objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to have this definition section unambiguous and we have put down a series of amendments to achieve that.  This amendment asks that after the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo; be added.  If this is done, only the established livestock mart can be caught and the ordinary innocent sale at the side of the road, in the farmer's yard, on the fair green, or elsewhere, will not be caught in this legislation.  It is obvious from the Minister's intervention last night that he has no intention of accepting any of the amendments; neither has he any intention of seriously considering these amendments.  He wants the Bill rushed <Col N="388" /> through the House, bulldozed through, and, for no other purpose, but to oppress the farmers still more.  We have indicated the many ways in which this definition section could be improved and by which its application could be confined within what might be regarded as reasonable limits.  We ask the House to accept this amendment.</P>

Perhaps he will come back armed with one.  In the meantime, I have to try to give my own simple interpretation of what it means.  The definition section relates to &ldquo;at a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction,&rdquo; and the amendment seeks to insert the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo;.  I think we are not introducing a word that is unknown to this House, a word unknown to legislation, when we suggest the insertion of the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; here.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I do not know.  Here is the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo;.  We could take as an example a man by whom the Irish language is habitually used.  That is a simple example of the use of the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; without any elaboration whatsoever.  It is not an ambiguous or indeterminate term, as the Minister stated here last night.  There is nothing indeterminate about the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo;. It may be indeterminate in relation to time but that is a simple matter of agreement.  However, it is submitted by us that the word &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; is not indeterminate in purpose or intent, or in respect of the activities it is intended to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued on this amendment that the use of &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; is superfluous.  It may be argued that in the definition the words &ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; suggest or imply habitual use, but beyond a suggestion, or at most an implication, that is as much as you can read into the expres-he <Col N="390" /> could do no more.  Failure to accept sion.  We are attempting by our amendment to make the situation firmer.  It affirms habitual use.  It is a concrete statement and we know exactly what we are talking about.  We are not leaving in any ambiguity about the business of a livestock mart.</P>
    <P>The Minister is endeavouring to extend the scope of his operations to all forms of sales.  An analogous situation would be if some regulations were drafted about the manufacture and assembly of motor cars.  This is a subject in which Deputy Booth would be interested.  If the terminology suggested that that was what was intended but in the definition the Minister introduced a broad difference which was obviously calculated to cover not alone the manufacture and the assembly of motor cars but every operation in every garage and petrol station, the first person to object would be Deputy Booth.  The first person to point out the irregularity as between the terminology and the definition would be Deputy Booth, and he would be right. However, when it applies to a mart, to the agricultural industry, Deputy Booth is strangely confused but not silent. Every time he speaks he shows that clearly he is in the position of a man battling with his own conscience, on the one hand, and his loyalty to his Party, on the other.  I am sure a similar battle is going on in the minds and hearts of many Deputies on the other side.</P>
    <P>I said last night that by these amendments we were endeavouring to save the Minister from himself.  We are also endeavouring to save the people from the Minister.  Whether this amendment goes through or not will not matter in the initial stage.  In the early stages, the Minister will try to operate this Bill on the lines of what it purports to be, a Livestock Marts Bill.  He will endeavour to secure that all the marts will conform with any conditions he may lay down.  He will not interfere with existing fairs in areas in which there are no marts.  If our amendments are accepted, that is what he would do, and what he would have to do, and <Col N="391" /> these amendments extends his power.</P>
    <P>I see the difficulty confronting the Minister and I appreciate his reasons for refusing to accept the amendments. In his present dilemma, with his present obsession in regard to the NFA and kindred agricultural organisations, he foresees a position of frustration every time, sometimes when perhaps it is not there at all.  I wonder if he introduced a simple Livestock Marts Bill, what would the farmers do? Would they refuse to send their stock to the marts once he puts his hands over these institutions?  Would they say: &ldquo;We will not sell our cattle under these conditions; we will sell them at a fair as we did ten years ago&rdquo;?  There is where the difficulty arises and there is where he wants to extend his power.  He wants this power outside and inside the marts.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite prepared to adopt the less contentious role of trying to put his wishes into operation through the marts, and through the marts alone, in the first instance, but this measure unamended would give him the alternative of proscribing and controlling all sales activities.  If there is not agreement that this amendment should be accepted, then the Minister can in any part of the country where marts are in operation say: &ldquo;These are my regulations and I will largely control the sale of cattle in all your marts.&rdquo;  It may be a private mart or it may be a co-operative mart and he will ask them: &ldquo;Are you agreeable?&rdquo; The proprietors or the farmers may be agreeable or they may not.  If there is no alternative to selling their cattle through the marts, then when the initial resistance wears down, some farmers will come and sell their cattle in the marts.</P>
    <P>Michael Murphy down the road will demur for a while&mdash;he is not NFA or Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or Labour; he is just a quiet man who keeps to himself, but he may have to take his cattle a distance of 60 miles to sell them.  He does not want to appear at the marts because of the atmosphere but he will go to his neighbour who is going to the mart and ask him to <Col N="392" /> take his three or four cattle to the mart because he does not want to go in present circumstances.  This is the way in which the Minister hopes the marts, after the initial objections, will come into operation.</P>
    <P>That is the easiest road for the Minister to take to gain his ultimate objective of getting control of the livestock industry, which is the long-term objective.  The NFA declaration of intent to set up their own marketing board will be largely circumvented by the long-term ambition of the Minister to control the livestock industry.  If he can do it by that more simple method, I believe that is the method he will choose, but that may not happen and the Minister knows it.  The farmers may say: &ldquo;We will have nothing to do with these marts and we will go back to selling our cattle at the traditional fairs.&rdquo;  If this amendment fails, can they do it?  Similar amendments have failed already.  The Minister's power will extend outside the marts and he will be in a position to proscribe any fair and he can make a good case.  He can say: &ldquo;I will not put back the clock.  It is imperative, now that we are entering the Common Market, that we should have the most modern methods for the disposal of agricultural stock.  I will not put back the clock.&rdquo;  He could make a very good case and the farmers in that area would be forced to sell their cattle in marts which would be the Minister's marts largely.</P>
    <P>That is a hard road, and it is the road the Minister may be forced to travel.  Obviously he is prepared to travel that road to achieve his ultimate purpose, control of the livestock trade, control of the marketing by farmers of their own produce.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I will try.  This amendment is an attempt to rationalise this Bill.  It is an attempt to bring the Bill into conformity with its terminology, with its Title, with its preamble.  It is an <Col N="393" /> attempt to limit the Minister's power to what appears in the Title of the Bill. Surely that is a logical and necessary exercise?  Surely it cannot be contended that we are wasting the time of the House by asking Deputies to behave in a logical and comprehensible fashion?</P>
      <P>I do not believe the farmers should be obliged to deposit their produce at their gates, and thereafter have no say in its disposal.  I believe the farmers who produce our agricultural produce are entitled to follow that produce to the consumer's breakfast table.  Any man in the city, in industry, would take the same view.  Would a man in the business of the assembly of motor cars feel inhibited if he were told he had no right to follow through to the purchasers, that his job was to produce the motor car and deposit it at the gate and allow its distribution to be entirely the business of a Minister of State, or a semi-State body, or a nominee of the Minister?</P>
      <P>This amendment is an expression of our opinion that if a farmer in a certain locality is not satisfied with the local mart, he should be empowered to sell his cattle in some alternative fashion.  It is an expression of our belief in the fundamental right of a farmer to have a reasonable opportunity of disposing of his own stock. Failure to accept this amendment will mean that the disposal of the farmers' produce, cattle, sheep and pigs, will ultimately be under the control of the Minister and, so far as the farmers are concerned, their only function in the matter will be to produce the article and deposit it at their farmyard gates.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Chair would be the first person to agree&mdash;if many other Deputies would not agree&mdash;that the producer of any article has a fundamental right to have a say in the ultimate distribution of the article, whether from a farm or a factory.</P>

Are we to be told in 12 months' time, perhaps in six months' time, that all these amendments which we introduced were unnecessary, that the insertion of the words &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo; and the other five or six amendments were unnecessary, that now one can see the Bill in operation and there is no outcry, everything is peaceful?  That may be said in three months' time or six months' time but if the Minister is thwarted in his ultimate ambition, his ultimate purpose, which is to get control of sales of livestock in this country, then you will not answer me that question; then you will sadly come to realise the significance of these amendments, the purpose behind them.</P>
      <P>We are attempting to control the Minister, to limit his activities to the livestock marts.  If he must commit an evil, let the evil be as small as possible. The Minister wishes to have a second shot in his locker and the second shot in his locker is to leave this definition ambiguous so that when he has dealt with the livestock marts, if the farmers rebel and try to sell their produce in any other way, if they retreat from the marts to the market squares and fairs, he can follow them into the fairs and market squares.  That is Part II of the Bill and that Part II is not written in the Bill.  It is written by omission.  It is written by having a definition ill-defined.  It is in this regard that we have put down the six or seven amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend for one moment that there is a tremendous difference between one amendment and the other: there is not any great difference between them.  The fundamental objective of each amendment is the same.  If we happen to speak on each amendment, then, in the necessary order of things, inescapably, there must <Col N="396" /> be some repetition because the fundamental objective and the fundamental purpose of each amendment is the same&mdash;an attempt to limit the activities of the Minister to as little as we can.</P>
    <P>I believe the Title under which this Bill is put before the House is intentionally dishonest.  Let the Minister have his definition but, at least, let him be honest enough to stop calling it a Livestock Marts Bill.  Let him call it what it is and what it will ultimately be if he meets with sufficient opposition&mdash;a livestock Bill.  That is the ultimate purpose and that is the ultimate objective, based largely upon a vendetta which the man has allowed to grow and fester in his mind over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing what power does.  It has strange implications, strange effects upon the human mind. Deputies on the far side of the House, sitting in the background, do not understand the effects which power has upon the human mind because they never had power.  The poor creatures&mdash;hay-straw, hay-straw, hay-straw&mdash;that is as far as any one of them will ever get.</P>

Perhaps, at the eleventh hour, they will give us the benefit of their views?  So far, we have not heard a word from the Deputies opposite.  With the exception of Deputy Booth and Deputy Cunningham, not one Deputy on the opposite benches has risen to defend his Minister.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to say he agrees with me, but <Col N="399" /> what I do expect him to say is: &ldquo;These words do not exclude anybody whom I wish to be excluded, but if you want them, add them.&rdquo;  What is the use of saying to me: &ldquo;I can see the principle of your argument for the inclusion of the words, but I ask you if their omission will do any harm.&rdquo;  I do not expect the Government to agree with me.  All I am expecting them to say is: &ldquo;We do not think the words will do any good, but we agree with you that they will certainly do no harm.  If you attach so much importance to them, put them in.&rdquo;  Is that reasonable or not?  Is it not the sensible way to conduct parliamentary business?  Deputies ought to examine their consciences in respect of supporting a Minister who says: &ldquo;These words will do nothing to exclude from the ambit of this Bill anybody whom I think it is necessary for the purpose of the Bill to include, but I will not put them in because you propose them.&rdquo;  Where does the responsibility for obstruction lie if that is the Minister's attitude?</P>
      <P>We attach great importance to this Bill and we have offered several alternatives which go part of the way to meet our anxiety.  What is the point of saying that we legislate by parliament if we claim the right in parliament to legislate by order?  What is the point of going through the farce of bringing in a Bill described as:</P>
      <P>An Act to provide for the control and regulation by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of livestock marts and the sale of livestock at such marts and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
      <P>Be it enacted by the Oireachtas as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of enacting something by Oireachtas Éireann if all the views of the Members of Oireachtas Éireann are to be treated as of no consequence?  I could quite understand the Minister's position if he said: &ldquo;The introduction of these words would be fatal to the purpose of my Bill.  It would introduce an element of <Col N="400" /> uncertainty and ambiguity which would make the administration of this legislation utterly impossible.&rdquo;  He does not say that, because he cannot say it.  I say there is unanimity about this that nobody who is not habitually engaged in the sale of cattle by auction ought to be deemed to be engaged in the business of a livestock mart.  If the Minister simply says: &ldquo;No, I will not have it&rdquo;, then I say the Minister is simply turning parliamentary procedure into a farce.</P>
    <P>Suppose the sanctions of this Bill are invoked against an individual after the Bill has become law and the individual says by way of defence: &ldquo;I am not engaged in the business of a livestock mart,&rdquo; and the Minister says: &ldquo;You are, because you have adapted your premises.  You have provided, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted&mdash;and you have habitually used it&mdash;for the sale of livestock by auction.&rdquo;  The defendant replies: &ldquo;I admit it is manifest to anyone who goes to the premises that I have adapted them for the sale of livestock by auction, but I deny that I have habitually used it or that I will habitually use it.&rdquo;  The Minister brings him to court and says: &ldquo;The officers of my Department have seen this premises used on the first Monday of every week&rdquo;&mdash;or on the first Monday of every month or on every quarter day&mdash;&ldquo;for the sale of cattle by auction.  The burden of my complaint against the defendant is that though he is habitually using the premises on the first Monday of every week for the holding of cattle auctions, he has now started admitting quantities of cattle and selling them by hand, and that is a procedure which would render the enforcement of the provisions of this Act nugatory and ineffective.&rdquo;  The judge has to determine whether this man has engaged&mdash;here is the nub of the whole question&mdash;in the business of a livestock mart.  If he has then he is subject to be the provisions of this Act.  If he has not, then the Minister's case against him must fail.</P>
    <P>The Minister agrees with that, and says: &ldquo;I have established, and he admits, that he has adapted his premises. The only issue joined between <Col N="401" /> us is: `Does he habitually use them?' &rdquo; and the district justice says: &ldquo;He has used them every quarter day.  I think that is habitual use.  Accordingly, I find that he is in the business in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  But in those circumstances there is an element of ambiguity.  It could be argued that four sales a year is not habitual use and therefore I dismiss this case under the Probation Act.&rdquo; However, let that man be fixed with notice that hereafter this is &ldquo;habitual use.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There comes another man in another county and it is proved that he uses the place on the first day of each week. The district justice says: &ldquo;You admit you adapted your premises.  You admit that you have sales every week.  Get out: do not pretend to make the argument that this is not habitual use as everybody understands it.&rdquo;  A third case might arise in which a man admits that he adapted but that he only held a sale on the first Monday of every month.  Can anybody doubt that any rational judge would say: &ldquo;You are holding a sale on the first Monday of every month.  Is that not habitual use according to any criterion? Get out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I admit that no matter what definition you get, there will be the marginal case but let it be decided in favour of the defendant.  We do not want to catch marginal cases: we want to control the business of conducting a livestock mart.  We do not want to catch a man who is not in the business of conducting a livestock mart and who sells cattle by hand on his premises.</P>
    <P>Now we arrive at the question which I think the three Deputies sitting opposite me, one from the city and two from the country, are beginning to ask themselves, if they would really admit it: does the Minister want to catch people who are not manifestly in the business of a livestock mart? Do the Deputies know the answer to that question themselves?  Are they now beginning to understand why we want to amend this section?  We want to know now with precision and determination, and in the terms of the Act <Col N="402" /> when it comes to be an Act, who is precisely to be subject to its terms.  I do not think Deputy Dowling knows or Deputy Allen knows, or the latest young recruit sitting between them knows whom the Minister does want to control.  That is the whole argument we are making here, that we do want to know with precision.  I think that in their hearts these Deputies agree that we ought to know but they are prepared to make an act of faith in their own Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy never made one of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I implore the Deputy not to interrupt or I shall say something rough which I shall regret.  I do not think any of us ought make an act of faith of that kind in our own Government, whether we are in the Party supporting that Government or not.  We do not live in a State where legislation is by decree and we have no intention of emulating the example of the French Chamber of Deputies.  They have had that issue put squarely to them.  The Government of General de Gaulle have said to the Chamber of Deputies that for the next four months, within certain limited spheres of legislation, authority to govern by decree is required.  The French Chamber of Deputies have conceded that and the Republic of France, within the certain limited spheres of legislation, is being governed by decree because the President of France says that the economic emergency is sufficiently acute to justify that requisition being made on the French equivalent of Dáil Éireann.  I do not think there is any situation here to justify such a requisition on Dáil Éireann.  The whole basis of our case is that the Minister has got into such a state of mind as a result of his quarrel with the NFA that he wants to have what is substantially power to legislate by decree.  He wants a definition so wide that if he is so disposed, he can apply the terms of this Bill to almost anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling finds that hard to believe but I think he will agree that Deputy Carty did not come down in yesterday's shower.  He is a national <Col N="403" /> teacher who has lived all his life among the people in the country and who knows the way they live and think.  At an earlier stage of this Bill, we had an analogous amendment in which we suggested that the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; should be put in, but Deputy Carty said: &ldquo;You cannot construct or reconstruct a field.&rdquo;  Does that register?  There is this difference between Deputy Carty and Deputies in the back benches of Fianna Fáil that Deputy Carty was at the Government meeting when this Bill was discussed. He was there when this whole business was argued on the Government agenda. He knows what went on there and none of the Deputies in the back benches of Fianna Fáil and none of the Deputies on this side knows what went on at the Government meeting.  Do not forget the significance of this.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Allen think the terms of this Bill should apply to a field? Does Deputy Dowling think so?  I am opposed to the whole Bill, but if it is to function and if it is to be administered, I am prepared to concede that if a field is adapted and habitually used for selling cattle by auction this Bill should apply.</P>

All I am trying to establish is this.  The meaning of adaptation is gone unless the Minister can establish that the place is habitually used for the purpose of auctioning livestock.

      <P>We cannot.

The words the Minister used constitute the strongest measure of objection.  Those words do not eliminate the uncertainty of this situation. We all here believe that they will provide against the possibility of what the Deputy describes as a fantastic concept &mdash;the Minister or his officers going into a premises when, in fact, the business of a livestock mart is not being conducted there at all.  Why can we not write that into the Bill?  That is what we want to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the Deputy and I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who is a shrewd boy sitting on the Front Bench will agree with me.  I would have said much the same thing as the Deputy is saying when I first came into Dáil Éireann.  Why should you legislate on the assumption that the Minister is going to act unreasonably?  My action would have been precisely what the Deputy's now is but what you have got to understand when you have some experience of government is this.  Our function is entirely different from the function of the Minister.  The Minister has two jobs&mdash;one as a member of Dáil Éireann and the other as a member of the Government, the executive head of his Department&mdash;and he has got to do the day-to-day work of the Department.  Our job is to give him the powers necessary effectively to carry out Government policy but only those powers.  Otherwise, why not pass an Act of Parliament to say that the Minister can do anything he likes to anybody engaged in the agricultural industry?  Then why should you think he will not do anything out of the way?  The whole business of Parliament is examining Bills brought forward by responsible Ministers on behalf of the Government to see that the appropriate limitations are put into them to prevent the possibility of the present or any future Minister, whoever he is, having powers conferred on him by the Oireachtas which he can use in any way he chooses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have got to proceed without reflection on the Minister or without saying that the fellow is going to go daft, on the assumption that you will give no Minister wider powers than are requisite for the purpose which the Bill is designed to achieve.  The whole argument which has gone on here today arises very largely out of the vision of the shrewd Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  Neither the Deputy nor I want to give the Minister the right to go into a man's field to control the selling of a cow or a bullock there.  Therefore, we said that no matter what business he carried on in the field, unless he had been using that field for the purpose of selling <Col N="408" /> livestock on that occasion, it does not come within the ambit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Surely before an amendment of that kind pressed strongly on the Government is rejected, it is incumbent on the Government to tell Dáil Éireann why the introduction of these words has to be resisted?  I would ask any open-minded Deputy if anybody on the Government side of the House has given any tangible reason.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary for touching his heart.  Mind you, when you flatter two young lads like Deputy Foley and Deputy Allen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary accuses me of bringing in personalities and that I am denigrating young Deputies.  That is not so.  I say I am perfectly entitled to express satisfaction with two young Deputies like Deputies Foley and Allen who invited me to elucidate their inability to understand my amendment.  In the course of the exchanges between us, it became manifest that both of them were in favour of my amendment.  I do not blame them, but when they felt that the bonds of argument restrained and restricted and finally silenced them, the two boys got up and went out to get lunch, and who would blame them?  I know it to be the express procedure that when Government Deputies get involved in an argument and find the argument gets beyond them, their natural instinct is to get up and go out.  I know the natural reaction of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach when he puts <Col N="409" /> his foot in it is to illuminate the whole scene by his gesture of throwing his hands in the air and saying: &ldquo;Now, do not be getting after me; I only came in to fill a gap for somebody else here.&rdquo;  If he made a point his humiliation would not manifest itself at all, but when he sees that he has yielded a point which the Opposition sought to make, he knows how to get out of that situation with the best.</P>
      <P>Mind you, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture would do well to invite the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to sit there beside him, and watch an old and slippery operator at work.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture not to fall into the error of thinking he has nothing to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government for the light he has thrown on this amendment.  He has done as much as almost any other Deputy to manifest the need for this amendment and I think the two young Deputies, Deputies Foley and Allen who fled recently, were profoundly influenced by what the Parliamentary Secretary said until Deputy Foley asked: &ldquo;Who would imagine the Minister would be so daft as to go into anyone's field?&rdquo; I reminded him that the Parliamentary Secretary wanted to clear the path into the field and it was in realisation of that deplorable fact that Deputies Foley and Allen fled the field and left it to more experienced men to hold the fort as best they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary, or from somebody speaking on behalf of the Government, whether there are any further words of limitation which they are prepared to accept to meet our view.  We hold the view most strongly that the definition section as it at <Col N="410" /> present stands is far too wide.  We have offered seven alternative limitations.  Is there anyone who will go part of the way to meeting our reservations about this section?  Has the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government any alternative proposal to offer, the change of a word or a comma or a sentence? If that is their view, this is the beginning of a long, hot summer, with all the implications of that phrase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words at this stage in connection <Col N="412" /> with this amendment.  There is so much wrong with the definition section in this Bill that the only thing to do is to scrap it and try to start again. But we are at the moment endeavouring to rectify it to some extent by ensuring, so far as we can, that this definition section will apply only in respect of places habitually used for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>
      <P>I gathered from an interjection by a Fianna Fáil backbencher that he seemed to regard the acceptance of this amendment as precluding the establishment of further livestock marts.  I want to correct that impression, because it seems to be an impression some Deputies have got in connection with this Bill&mdash;that if you exclude the operation of the Bill from a particular place or a particular category of people, you are in some way doing an injury to the people concerned.  I want to make it clear that the position is quite the reverse: the more people and the more places excluded from the operation of this Bill, the better it will be for these people.</P>
      <P>Very few, if any, will want this Bill applied to them, because the Bill is not something which confers a benefit. The Bill is restrictive, containing penal clauses, if there is a breach or an offence committed under it.  The whole purpose of this amendment is to confine the operation of this Bill to places which are adapted and habitually used for the sale of livestock by auction.  In my view, the entire definition before us in this section is faulty and captures what was not intended to be captured by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already discussed other amendments designed to modify and limit the application of the scope of this Bill.  Reference has been made already to the fact that we have here in this section a double-barrelled definition. The business of a livestock mart means, firstly, the business of selling livestock by auction.  Even that portion of the definition, to my mind, is cockeyed because, remember, when a sale by auction takes place, the person selling is not the auctioneer.  The auctioneer is simply the agent for the <Col N="413" /> seller or vendor.  The person selling is the farmer who owns the livestock and, even under the first part of this definition, any farmer who sells livestock, who brings in his livestock to an auction for sale is deemed to be engaged in the business of a livestock mart.  I am quite sure that was never intended.  The whole thing is quite cockeyed and the only way out is to get away from that definition completely and bring in something new.</P>
    <P>For the moment, we are concerned with the second part of this definition section which concerns places wherein the business of a livestock mart is deemed to be carried on.  As drafted, the definition provides that &ldquo;a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction&rdquo; is brought within the scope of the definition, and within the scope of the Bill.  It does not matter whether the adaptation is purely of a temporary character.  It does not matter whether or not a sale&mdash;either by auction or otherwise&mdash;has ever been carried on in that place.  If it has been adapted and if that place is provided, then, according to this definition, as I see it, that comes within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the intention of all of us is that the Bill should apply only to places which are proper livestock marts.  I do not think it is necessary to define a livestock mart.  They have become so common in the past ten years or so, I believe it is possible judicial notice would be taken of the term and that further definition is unnecessary. I see no reason why we should not in this Bill, in the definition section&mdash;the Bill is entitled the Livestock Marts Bill, 1967&mdash;use the term &ldquo;livestock mart&rdquo; and everyone would know what is meant instead of talking about a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.  But as long as we do use the expression &ldquo;a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction&rdquo; surely there is a duty on us to cut out what I described as accidental adaptations?  We can do that by acceptance of this amendment, by providing that the Bill will apply only in the event of the place which has been adapted also being used habitually for the sale of livestock by auction.  That <Col N="414" /> is all we seek in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is a further endeavour on our part to introduce some semblance of clarity into what is undoubtedly a most unsatisfactory definition in this Bill.  As Deputy O'Higgins has just said, we want to ensure it will be quite clear to whom and to what this Bill is applicable. We also want to know and to have it made quite clear who is excluded from the application of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a sensible one, a reasonable one and one which is readily defensible.  It does not go as far in clarifying the definition section as we would like but, at least, it goes some way towards introducing some semblance of clarity into the definition section.  Deputy O'Higgins said his amendment proposes, too, that the unsatisfactory clause in the definition section&mdash;and particularly the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;, with which all the previous amendments have been dealing&mdash;would be qualified by the insertion of a clause containing the words &ldquo;a place adapted and habitually used&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is vitally essential at this stage that the definition sections should be clarified.  Otherwise, the Bill can apply and will apply to all types of sales in all types of places.  The word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is a word which has unlimited application.  It is relatively easy to adapt a place for the purpose of the sale or sales but it does not necessarily follow that the place which is adapted for the purpose of the sale is, in fact, a place which is normally or habitually used as a livestock mart.  The whole point of this amendment is to impose some limit on the application of this word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister, in his annoyance with and his antagonism towards the Fine Gael Party, has blinded himself completely to the extent that he cannot see any reason in the amendment we have put forward in this case or in the previous amendments. It certainly reflects no credit on the Minister that he is not even prepared to give consideration to this amendment or that he did not give some consideration to the previous <Col N="415" /> amendments and shut his mind to all the reasonable arguments that have been put forward from this side of the House.  It appears that Deputies on the Government Benches have been precluded from contributing to this debate and have obviously been prevented from giving some consideration to the arguments put forward.  I doubt if there was ever a Bill introduced which had such an unsatisfactory definition section and if a Bill does not start off with clear-cut definitions, nobody will know where he stands and the widest and most diverse interpretation can be given.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister at this late stage to consider this amendment.  It does not qualify or clarify the application of the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; as well as we would like but it does, nevertheless, impose some type of rational limitation on the application of this part of the definition section.</P>
    <P>At this stage the meaning of the words &ldquo;livestock mart&rdquo; is quite clear. These livestock marts have been established over the past ten years and nobody is in any doubt as to what is meant by a &ldquo;livestock mart&rdquo;.  This Bill, which is termed the Livestock Marts Bill, 1967, was taken and understood by all and sundry to mean that it was a Bill applying to livestock marts in the normal meaning and application of the words.  Now, by reason of the definition section and by reason of the Minister's unreasonable insistence on pushing this definition section through and his refusal to listen to any argument put forward from this side of the House in support of clarifying the definition section, this Bill can apply to not merely livestock marts but to all types of sales of livestock by auction, whether these sales take place in a livestock mart, in what is sometimes called a cattle yard, in a farmer's yard or in a field.  It is easy to adapt a field or any enclosed space, whether it be a yard or otherwise, for the purpose of conducting a particular sale.  By putting forward this amendment and the other amendments, we are endeavouring to have clarified the places and the types of sale to which this Livestock Marts Bill, 1967, applies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> The Minister has refused even to listen to the arguments put forward and I have no doubt that if the Bill is allowed through unaltered&mdash;particularly this definition section&mdash;nobody will know where he stands.  There will be numerous arguments and numerous difficulties in the later interpretation of the Bill and there is a grave danger that the whole marketing arrangements for livestock which have been successfully built up through the co-operative movement and through private enterprise by way of the livestock mart may be thrown into jeopardy.  It is quite clear that the Minister has had second thoughts since the Second Reading of this Bill and that he now seeks to control, not merely the livestock marts already established and livestock marts which might be established in the future, but to control the complete domestic marketing arrangements for livestock in the country.  If he shows that he is prepared to listen to reason and if he accepts this amendment, he will be going some way towards clarifying the application of this most unsatisfactory definition section of this Livestock Marts Bill.</P>

We want the Government to accept this amendment so that the terms of the Bill may be easily understood by the average individual who will be directly affected if this legislation passes through the House. As Deputy Hogan mentioned this morning, it is difficult for one not to repeat oneself when one asks the Government to accept amendments such as those we have been discussing during the past number of days.

Deputy Allen said that a field is always attached to a cattle sales mart and when I explained to him that the nearest cattle mart to this building is the Dublin Cattle Market and I do not know of any field being attached to it, Deputy Foley interjected and said there is a holding yard.  Does Deputy Foley have to be lectured on the different purposes for which a field is used as against a holding yard?  However, these are the reasons why we put down this amendment.

I want to enlighten Deputy Dowling, Deputy Foley and Deputy Allen, and I want Deputy Carty's remarks on a previous amendment to be used to explain why it is necessary for us to ask the House to accept this amendment. As Deputy Carty says, a field cannot be constructed or reconstructed.</P>

      <P>If the Government accepted this amendment to include &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;, this would in some way eliminate any person who wished to have a dispersal sale or any other type of sale which would not be a continual arrangement, either monthly, quarterly or bi-annually. People have to dispose of their livestock for different reasons.  The small farmers of Connemara, about whom Deputy Geoghegan talks, who must emigrate because of Government legislation, may decide that they wish to sell their cattle in the way their forefathers sold them, and they should be allowed to do so without being interfered with by this legislation.</P>

If he does, he will be the first Fianna Fáil backbencher to have spoken today. If a small farmer in Connemara wishes to dispose of his stock, he should be free to do so by using his own farmyard or one of the fields in the small holding, without having to apply to the Minister, or the courts, or some other authority, for a licence, The whole notion seems to be that if such a person were to think along those lines and contact a local auctioneer and have the auction advertised, it is the auctioneer who would be prosecuted if such a sale took place. The Bill does not say that: the Bill says it would be the seller.  The auctioneer is not the seller.  He is merely the agent.  The seller is the vendor, in this case the owner of the cattle.  I submit that Deputy Geoghegan is now a party to a Bill by his own <Col N="422" /> Government, by his own Minister, by his own Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Geoghegan is quite content to come into this House when the division bells ring and trot&mdash; I think it was Deputy Hogan who described it this morning as hay-straw, hay-straw&mdash;through the lobby.  Deputy Millar, Deputy Crinion and a few other Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party understand agriculture.  I will include Deputy Foley and a few others. It is very hard to understand why Deputy Dowling has continued to interrupt speakers on this side.  He has continually interrupted and the fact is that he knows Sweet Fanny Adams about agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Title of the Bill is the Livestock Marts Bill and we believe that the Bill should be confined within its own Title and that those with whom Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party interested in agriculture would also be concerned should be excluded from the scope of the Bill.  The Minister proposes under this Bill to control livestock marts.  It is the function of an Opposition to pick out weaknesses in legislation and it is the function of a Government to give due consideration <Col N="424" /> to amendments proposed by the Opposition.  Not alone is the Minister ignoring the proposals made by the Fine Gael Party but he is also ignoring his own back benchers and some of his colleagues from his native county.  If the words &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo; are inserted the Bill will confine itself, we believe, to livestock marts and farmers who wish to sell cattle or other livestock can use any method by which they can command better prices for their livestock.  That has been a God-given right of the agricultural community and I see no good reason why a Minister in an Irish Government should interfere with that right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, I am aware that it was reported in the public press earlier this month that the circuit judge had said in court that he was seriously considering transferring the October sittings of the Circuit Court out of Letterkenny unless certain repairs and improvements to the courthouse were carried out in the meantime.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, imposes on local authorities the duty of providing and maintaining at their expense such courthouse accommodation as the Minister for Justice may direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unsatisfactory condition of the Letterkenny courthouse has been the subject of correspondence between my Department and Donegal County Council for a number of years.  On representations from the county council in 1964 my predecessor agreed, in the interest of economy, to modify his original requirements in regard to the Letterkenny courthouse and accepted the county council's proposal for a less expensive scheme of repairs and improvements involving a modest expenditure of £1,000.  It was understood that the scheme would be undertaken and completed without delay.  I am sorry to say, however, that the county council have, in the main, failed to implement their own proposals with regard to the repair of the courthouse. As a result, the present condition of the building is such that sittings of the courts in Letterkenny may have to be <Col N="445" /> discontinued unless the necessary work is carried out without further delay or suitable alternative accommodation is provided by the county council.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question there is no provision for the grant to local authorities of financial assistance from State funds towards the cost of providing and maintaining courthouse accommodation and unless and until the law is changed, local authorities in general, and Donegal County Council in particular, will have to face up to their statutory obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Treaty of Rome requiring the adoption of a common form of social welfare services for the EEC as a whole. There are, in fact, considerable differences between the systems in operation in the Member States.  While as recorded in Article 117 of the Treaty the Member States agree upon the need to promote better conditions of living and of work so as to lead to their progressive harmonisation and improvement, there have been no developments under this head which would call for immediate changes in our social welfare system on our entry to the Community.  In the circumstances I do not propose to have a White Paper prepared as the Deputy suggests, but if he so wishes I can arrange to place in the Library two recent publications giving information about the social security systems of the EEC countries. I would also refer him to Chapter 10 of the White Paper on the European Communities issued in April.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare what is the position regarding reciprocity of social welfare benefits with (i) EEC countries and (ii) Britain: what steps will be taken to extend reciprocity; whether there are any difficulties about extending it; and, if so, what are the difficulties.</P>

      <P>There are no reciprocal arrangements in relation to social security between this country and any member country of the European Economic Community. Movement of workers between Ireland and those countries is negligible and the need for reciprocal arrangements has not arisen.  Ireland and the member countries of the Community are, however, parties to two Council of Europe agreements under which the nationals of any one country, when in another, are guaranteed equality of treatment under the social security laws of that country.</P>
      <P>Reciprocal arrangements exist with Great Britain relating to disability, marriage, maternity and unemployment benefits, contributory widows', orphans' and old age pensions and workmen's compensation.  Negotiations are taking place with the British authorities for a reciprocal agreement in respect of occupational injuries.  No other extension or reciprocity is at present being sought.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the cost of providing family allowances in this State on scales similar to those operating in (i) EEC countries and (ii) Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no family allowance scheme common to the member states of the European Economic Community.  There are, in fact, considerable differences between the schemes of the various member states not only in rates of payment but also in coverage, qualifying conditions and methods of financing.  All of these schemes differ so radically from the Irish children's allowances scheme that any attempt to apply their scales to the Irish scheme would be unrealistic and misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British family allowance scheme is broadly similar to the Irish scheme, being general in its application, free of any means or insurance test and financed out of general taxation.  There are, of course, differences in coverage but applying the British rates of family allowance to the families being paid <Col N="450" /> children's allowances on 31st March last, the annual cost of the Irish scheme would be £15,124,000.</P>

However, I want to ask him is he satisfied that the old age pensioners and widows and people who are generally deemed to be entitled to free transport should be denied that, for instance, when going to Mass on Christmas Day, that they should be specifically excluded from availing of the bus if they are to go to Mass on Christmas Day?

      <P>I want to answer <Col N="453" /> Deputy Cunningham first and reply to his rather sensible question relating to County Donegal.  We are in communication with the Lough Swilly Bus Company at the moment to have the necessary arrangements made.  In regard to the few hours during which we do not permit pensioners to travel, I should like to point out that it is not a very desirable thing to bring old people out during the peak travel period, apart from other considerations. Nobody would want to see these people left standing at bus stops or waiting there in peak travel periods, apart from the fact that it is more suitable for the scheme to use the low peak travel hours.  This applies to cities only. Apart from the few exceptions we make&mdash;it may sound a lot in the regulations but it relates only to peak travel times&mdash;there is a very magnanimous view towards those old people about whom up to now nobody seemed to think.</P>

I would like to ask him if those were only formal or sham meetings?  Has he already made up his mind without any consideration for the parents?

Like the medical cards, I try to look at each case on its merits.  I try to get the parents to see the matter reasonably and I get the officers of my Department to consider the matter with the parents on all occasions where there are objections.  In this instance there are three schools in the parish, Knocktopher, Ballyhale and Castle-gannon. The Knocktopher school, the subject of the Deputy's question, is only one and a half miles from Ballyhale. All the schools are two-teacher schools and in accordance with the official policy for centralisation of all schools, my inspector reported that this was a desirable thing to do.  From the considered recommendations made by him and my officials, the correct thing to do was to close this school.  The combined enrolment of the three parish schools would only warrant a staff of five teachers, but my Department are prepared to retain the six teachers serving at present in the three schools. I think we are doing the right thing.</P>

How can the Minister and the advisers in his Department reach the conclusion that all the parents of all the children are wrong? Surely that is not a realistic approach assuming as I am prepared to assume, that the Minister is not approaching this problem on an across-the-board way of neglecting special cases?

The Minister is the determining authority in relation to the extent of the costs incurred, and I have a discretion as to the costs I will allow.  In exercising that discretion, I will have regard to many points such as: was the person in the inquiry a necessary party; was it reasonable that the person should have legal representation; were the costs necessarily incurred and are the amounts now claimed reasonable?  In my judgment, having regard to the report on the inquiry, I have to consider whether it is equitable that the person should be indemnified against the cost.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.  While I have not details of applications for admission to individual secondary schools in Limerick city an overall survey which my Department has made of the post-primary education position there discloses that the number of school places available is 5,155 and that the estimated pupil potential is 5,025.  Of the available places 4,335 are in secondary schools and 820 in vocational schools.  I should like to remind the Deputy in this connection that the scheme relates to free post-primary education and that it was not envisaged at any time that there <Col N="463" /> would necessarily be secondary school places for all pupils seeking post-primary education.  In most European countries the position is that places in academic secondary schools are provided for only about one out of every three pupils.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing places in secondary schools at present for three out of every four pupils, we have the position here that a pupil may enter a vocational school and proceed all the way to the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>With a view to replacing unsuitable accommodation and to providing for the full potential of Limerick city and the adjoining areas, three major schemes of extension and two new schools in replacement of existing secondary schools are planned for Limerick city.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say whether or not a situation has arisen in relation to one or two secondary schools in Limerick, where applicants for admission to the first year secondary course had to be turned away, in which there is a question of temporary prefabricated buildings being provided?  I have in mind Sexton St. Christian Brothers and the Presentation Convent.  Can I take it that temporary prefabricated buildings will be provided by September, to enable them to accept all who seek admission to these particular schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised by the Deputy, prefabricated classrooms are being provided in the following cases in Limerick; the Convent of Mercy in Bishop Street, two classrooms; the Presentation Convent, which he mentioned, four rooms, and three rooms for St. Munchin's.  Also, Deputy O'Donnell mentioned Sexton Street: there was some difficulty there about children getting in but with the cooperation <Col N="464" /> of all interested parties, the position has eased somewhat.  Anyway, arrangements are being made in Sexton Street Christian Brothers' School and the Brother Ignatius Rice School on the Ennis Road to cater for two additional classrooms in both places.  Finally, he asked me will these be up by September&mdash;they will, yes.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 2, line 15, after &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with amendment 2b in the name of Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and asking that the Government accept the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;.  This is for the purpose of ensuring that the Bill, as introduced, will cover exactly what it is meant to cover.  We hold that the Minister by the mere Title of the Bill, the Livestock Marts Bill, meant to control marts.  We also hold that the Bill as presented will, in effect, cover all types of cattle sales.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to follow the line of argument but if you will allow me to explain: We hold that if the Government accept this amendment to include &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo;, then the terms of this legislation would be confined to the operation of cattle marts and would not interfere with the rights of the small farmers who elect, for reasons best known to themselves, to sell their cattle by other methods. We find it difficult to persuade members of the Fianna Fáil Party to this particular line of thought.  As is now evident, we find it difficult even to persuade the members of the Government Party to provide a quorum in this Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The missionary efforts of the Deputy with the Fianna Fáil Party may be very excellent but I am asking him again to confine himself to section 1, amendment 2(b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In trying to persuade members present to this particular line of thought I, on my part, am endeavouring to enlighten Members so that they may, because of their membership of the Government Party, be in a better position to persuade the Minister to accept this, the ultimate fact being, of course, that if the Minister does not accept it, then the Government have the majority to steamroll this through Dáil Éireann.  It is for this reason that we in the Fine Gael Party are particularly anxious that members of the Fianna Fáil Party should be here to hear us and to listen to those points because as demonstrated by the interjections and interruptions of members of the Government Party during the <Col N="468" /> debate on this particular section when Deputy Hogan was speaking, it is quite evident that most of them are not familiar with these amendments.  They are quite prepared and content to present themselves in this Chamber when the division bells ring to perform the function which, in my opinion, they believe to be only a function they are obliged to perform by virtue of being members of the Government Party, that is, to act as yes men.  We in the Fine Gael Party have given detailed thought to these matters and they have been discussed at great length by us, and it is for reasons like these that these amendments appear on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason also that I personally, would be more than obliged if Deputy Corry would give us an indication of what he sees in this particular amendment.  I should like through you, a Cheann Comhairle, to ask: does it not appear to members of the Fianna Fáil Party that if this amendment is not accepted, then the Minister, through his officers, can enter any sales mart and any fair green, can go into any farm or holding if there is evidence of any type of cattle sale, whereas if the amendment is accepted, the Minister, through his officers, would be confined to the premises which are habitually used for this type of sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry is a Member of this House for many years.  He is a Member who has given loyal and noble service to the agricultural community.  No doubt he is a man of wide experience and great knowledge, and I cannot understand why he has not availed of this opportunity to enlighten me and to tell me that this is not good legislation. I would like to hear the honest-to-goodness views of Deputy Corry and I would like when this Bill is passed, as no doubt it will be, people interested in agriculture, and indeed future generations, to be able to avail of the wisdom which Deputy Corry could give us by reading the records of this House, but for some unexplained reasons Deputy Corry remains silent.  This is notable also of other members of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="469" /> Party.  I hope Deputy Corry will excuse me but I would like to put on record that the reason I am so particularly anxious that he should speak is that I regard him as being a member who has agricultural ability and indeed who has concerned himself with the agricultural industry generally.  The importance of this amendment is so great that we deem it necessary that Fianna Fáil Members should give reasoned and serious thought to accepting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the better interests of democracy that a Minister should refuse to accept an amendment which has been duly considered and put forward by a responsible Opposition Party.  The concept of democracy is a two or three Party system, one Government Party there to legislate and to propose, but also to listen to constructive proposals from the Opposition Party or Parties.  I am sorry Deputy Corry has now left the House. It leaves the Fianna Fáil Party with one member, a sad reflection on the industry which the Parliamentary Secretary has been appointed to control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy not take it as a sad reflection on his powers of oratory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe, but it is the function of a Government to provide a House.  At least we are entitled to that consideration.  I do not particularly wish to bring Deputy Corry back into the House but the generation to which I belong will be very interested to know what Deputy Corry feels about this amendment.  For that reason I am disappointed that Deputy Corry not only is not in the House but that he should fail to try to persuade some of the younger members of the Fianna Fáil Party, members of my generation, to take their seats so that they could hear him put on record the reservoir of knowledge he must have accumulated during the long number of years he has represented County Cork in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Before progress was reported prior to Questions, because I found myself addressing empty Government benches I brought to the notice of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that we needed a quorum.  Deputy Corry appeared in the House and demonstrated the arrogance of the Fianna Fáil Members by protesting about being disturbed during lunch and asking that the question be put.  That was typical of the dictatorial attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have not got the decency to take their seats and to discuss this matter in a reasoned, cool atmosphere.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Corry back.  We seek to protect individuals in the agricultural community who need protection.  That is why we have put forward serious, considered amendments to this legislation.  The amendment now is that we include &ldquo;habitually used&rdquo; after &ldquo;adapted&rdquo;. I now welcome Deputy Cunningham back.  If this continues, we shall soon have a quorum.</P>

      <P>It is a reflection on good democracy that the Fianna Fáil Party should treat this Assembly in the manner they have been treating it.  The only democratic right we have as an Opposition Party, bearing in mind that the majority will decide and that Fianna Fáil have a majority of Members in this House and that the result of all this talk will be that the Minister will indicate he will not accept this amendment and that Members of the Fianna Fáil Party will parade in here when the Division bell rings and will follow the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is a democratic right.  However, when a person takes on himself the onerous responsibility of exercising that democratic right by voting on any matter in this House, he should do so with an informed mind, and I submit that Deputy Cunningham is ill-informed because on an earlier amendment, he interrupted me to inform me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  This is one of the mechanics of democracy.  Our democratic right as an Opposition Party is to inform Deputy Booth what this amendment means in the hope that Deputy Booth will contact the Minister and say: &ldquo;Now, listen, Minister, this may be your opinion but I have listened to Fine Gael Deputies and I have listened particularly to Deputy Harte&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

We know that if we do not use every democratic means at our disposal no doubt Fianna Fáil Deputies will parade behind the Minister and the leaders of that Party when the division bells ring.  We believe it is the duty of Deputies to support legislation proposed in the better interests of our people.  Fianna Fáil Deputies have not discussed this Bill in great detail.  That is evident because of certain factors. Only a few Fianna Fáil Deputies have offered to explain why these things cannot be accepted, and that few <Col N="473" /> included Deputy Booth, present, Deputy Corry, present, and my reasoned colleague from Donegal, Deputy Cunningham.  When those three Deputies made some form of a contribution, they were so off the beam that it prompted members of this Party who had already spoken on the amendment to rise again to explain in detail what this is all about.  Deputy Andrews has just come in.  He does not concern himself with agriculture.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In line 16 to add &ldquo;but does not include the leasing or letting of any such place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With this amendment, the definition section would read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction <Col N="479" /> but does not include the leasing or letting of any such place.</P>
    <P>As I read the definition section, if a farmer provides in his own haggard, or in a corner of a field, or in any place you will, a place and in that place puts up a very temporary ring of any description&mdash;or, as they say in Donegal, a circle&mdash;and even if for one hour in any day, cattle or sheep or pigs are sold in that space, then the farmer is responsible for whatever takes place there.  He is held responsible even though he may be 50 or 100 miles away for any breach of the rules or regulations of the law applying to livestock marts generally.</P>
    <P>Surely this is crazy legislation? Surely it was never intended that a farmer who provided space should be held responsible for any breach of the law committed by any person using that space, whether that person is an employee or not, and is then liable to the penalties provided in this legislation? He might be liable to a fine of £1,000 or to six months in prison, or both.  There is provision for all these penalties.  Look at all that is required and all that may happen under section 6 where the Minister may require so many things&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister may, for the purpose of ensuring the proper conduct of places where the business of a livestock mart is carried on and the proper conduct of such businesses adequate and suitable hygienic and veterinary standards...</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not satisfied there are proper hygienic and veterinary standards carried out by the person who leases or rents the place or any employee of his, then the farmer who supplied the place is liable and guilty and may be imprisoned or fined heavily.</P>
    <P>That is the first.  Next we have &ldquo;The provision of adequate and suitable accommodation and facilities.&rdquo;  If the Minister says at any stage that the accommodation and facilities are not up to standard, the man who rents it may say: &ldquo;Talk to your man about that, if you can find him.  I did not adapt this place.  He adapted it and he thought it was good enough.  I <Col N="480" /> agreed to give him £200 a year for it. I will not go back and either pay him for doing it or be at the expense of doing it myself.&rdquo;  He is in trouble if either the Minister or any officer of his Department says: &ldquo;This will not do.  The accommodation is not good enough.  It is not up to our standards. You have to put it right.  If you do not, the farmer who leased it to you is in trouble and we will see to it he is in trouble.&rdquo;  We start off by having him covered in this definition section.</P>
    <P>That does not finish it.  The Minister may &ldquo;make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to such places and such businesses.&rdquo;  Who knows what regulations the Minister is likely to make?  I am not only talking about the present Minister, who is capable of making any regulations whatever, but we have to think about the people who will follow him.  You would not know when we would get an even more crazy Minister than the one we have at the moment; you would not know what sort of ideas he would get.  Anybody who lets or leases or provides a place could be in trouble for any and every reason.  We just do not know what the Minister has in mind.  We do not know what he is likely to do in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not only lay down regulations but also conditions.  If for some reason he thinks that this farmer who provided this place happens to be a member of the NFA, then that farmer has surely had it.  The Minister will see he goes to jail, if it is the last thing he does.  This is an obvious omission from the definition section. It is left out to catch that type of fellow.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, regulations under this section may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  prescribe the manner in which entries for auctions of livestock at such places shall be received.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the man who has leased or rented it says: &ldquo;This fellow is a chancer.  He is a puffer.  He has come in here to destroy my business.  I simply will not take his entry because he will ruin my business,&rdquo; that man is in serious trouble.  Naturally, the man <Col N="481" /> who leased or rented it will not know the fellows who come in to buy there. He may not have any connection with the farming business.  He may not know the first thing about what happened in the course of a livestock sale, not only in a mart but in an open fair or any place else.  He may not have sold a beast in his life, but he had the bit of land and he rented it.  But one refusal and the law has him, because he is included in this definition section. That is a serious situation.  It is a shocking situation in which to place any man, probably an innocent one. Unfortunately, as we all know, innocence or ignorance of the law does not safeguard anybody.  Most people leasing or renting a piece of land of that description would be ordinary, decent, unsuspecting people, who would not appreciate they were caught in this way.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (b) the Minister may:</P>
    <P>provide that entries for such auctions shall not be refused except in the circumstances prescribed in the regulations,</P>
    <P>He has even prescribed the circumstances in which they may be refused. The fellow who has the mart may not know what is in the written portion of this, not to talk of what the Minister may think up in the meantime&mdash;the new regulations he can come along with at any time that even we in the House find it difficult to keep track of.  Unless we watch the Order Paper day in and day out to ensure no Order we are not acquainted with is placed before the House, it could go through and we would not know anything about it.  Many of these people using such a place would not know anything about it, but the fellow who leases his place would be in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c) the Minister may:</P>
    <P>prescribe the manner in which such auctions shall be conducted,</P>
    <P>There are so many ways that auctions can be conducted and so many different auctioneers have so many different ways of conducting their business that the Minister could at any time say: <Col N="482" />&ldquo;No, you are breaking the law.  I do not like the way he auctions the stuff. I will have to tie him up.&rdquo;  Immediately he does not come into line, the owner of the place, the man who provided the place, is in serious trouble.  I do not think the law ever intended that.  I do not think it was ever intended in this Bill.  But, so long as the definition section remains as it it, undefined, and so long as this man who innocently provides the space is not excluded, then he is in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (d) the Minister may:</P>
    <P>prescribe requirements as to the size, design, maintenance, repair, cleansing, cleanliness, ventilation, heating and lighting of any buildings in which such auctions are held,</P>
    <P>The man simply adapted the place and handed it over.  The fellow who got it thought: &ldquo;I am right now.  I have a place in which I can carry on auctions.&rdquo;  He has it only a month or two when the Minister's inspector arrives and says it will not do at all.  The man has paid the rent in advance and tells the inspector so, who replies that that is a matter of indifference to him, that the place has to be put right, that he does not like the size of the building. The man replies that the premises are no bigger or no smaller than when he rented them.  Next the inspector says that the design of the place is wrong and does not conform to what was envisaged, that must be altered.  The lessee may say that he is not free to change it.  The contest continues and the man who has rented the premises is wide open to having proceedings taken against him.  If the design and the size are right, the inspector may say that there is not sufficient maintenance. He will not go to the lessee but will go to the farmer who gave the place.  When he gave it, everything may have been all right but paint work is not permanent.  The floors may not be kept right.  The employees of the man who has rented the premises may be responsible for that but it is the man who has rented the premises who must answer for it.  I do not believe that any piece of legislation was ever <Col N="483" /> intended to get at such a man in this way.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of cleansing and cleanliness.  I do not know how the distinction is made.  I suppose cleanliness depends on the amount of cleansing but the two words are included in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Cunningham) Acting Chairman (Mr. Cunningham)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show how it is related All these conditions and regulations are written into the Bill.  If I provide a place that is adapted in the most temporary way and for the shortest possible period I can be caught because the person who rented it did not conform to the requirements, or some employee of his did not do what he should have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am pointing out is that a discussion on the difference between cleansing and cleanliness, in which the Deputy was engaging, is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I did not know exactly what you were getting at. I introduced this because of the fact that in the conditions and regulations both terms are used.  I was saying that I did not see why both terms were included.  I suppose, if there were sufficient cleansing, there would be the standard of cleanliness required by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he gets over all the hurdles I have mentioned so far as to size, design, maintenance, repair, cleansing and cleanliness, he is not yet out of the wood because the next thing for which he is responsible is ventilation.  My experience of cattle marts, especially the type of temporary premises that I am talking about, is that there is such ventilation that one would get pneumonia even in summer.  There is sufficient building there to create a fantastic draught.  I often wonder where ventilation ended and draught began.  &ldquo;Ventilation&rdquo; is another of these vague terms.  There are very few people who know anything about it.  It is quite possible that the Minister would have an officer who would have <Col N="484" /> his own ideas about ventilation.  If the farmer were unfortunate enough to lease or rent his property to some fellow who did not appreciate what the Minister's officer had in mind in relation to ventilation, he would be liable to get into trouble.  I am sure that that is not intended in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of heating. Here there will be a serious problem because there might be no walls to this outfit which he has to heat.  The fellow who gets it has to heat it if the other fellow did not heat it.  The Minister's officer says that it has to be heated.  The man who rents it may ask what will that cost him, and says he has already parted with his money.  Heating is a serious problem.  There may be no roof on this place.  The argument goes on and on.  The man who provided the place had only, according to this definition, to provide &ldquo;a place adapted&rdquo; and &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is a word we could not define or decide exactly what it means. Because of that, we have all these difficulties. Then there is the question of lighting and there are standards and degrees of lighting and they represent many difficulties.  Endless problems could arise which could give rise to trouble and to legal proceedings against the man who innocently provided a place.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of section 6, subsection (2)  provides that the Minister may:</P>
    <P>prescribe requirements as to the accommodation (including washing facilities and sanitary conveniences) provided at such places,</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is discussing another section of the Bill. I would remind him that we are on amendment No. 3 to section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Acting Chairman will agree with me that all this is relevant to the amendment which will ensure that the man who leases or rents a place or provides a place will not be liable for all the things required in this section.  I know that we are all anxious to get on and to get finished with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is only interested in the discussion being relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="485" />
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate that, and I want to keep within the rules of the House and I bow to the ruling of the Chair, but I think it will be easy enough to convince the Chair that if all or any of these things can be responsible for a man getting into serious trouble, being fined, being imprisoned, because the definition section lacks the words which this amendment proposes to add, it is relevant to discuss in some detail what this definition section, without the words proposed to be inserted, would let such a man in for.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e), as I said, deals with the accommodation, including washing facilities and sanitary conveniences, and all that sort of thing, that are provided at marts, and indeed, are not provided in any sort of temporary mart or place adapted&mdash;it could be well adapted or not so well adapted.  If it is not so well adapted, these things will be absent, and the unfortunate man who provided this adapted place is liable to heavy fines and even imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (f) reads:</P>
      <P>prescribe requirements as to and provide for the veterinary examination of livestock at such auctions, the veterinary inspection of livestock marts and the veterinary supervision of such auctions.</P>
      <P>I do not know whose responsibility it is to see that the vet gets there and the vet does all these things as required by the Minister, but it can well be that he, too, might upset this unfortunate lessor and be the cause of getting him into trouble.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (g) reads:</P>
      <P>provide for the inspection of such places and the supervision of such auctions by health authorities and their officers,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What responsibility has the man who owns or leases this space in relation to the health authority officers.  It is difficult to be certain from this, but it indicates to me that he has some responsibility to recognise their existence, to see that when they come along there is no trouble about admitting them, that they are met civilly and that they get every facility for carrying out <Col N="486" /> their work.  This man might live 50 miles from the place.  He might be in a different business altogether.  How could he be expected to attend, simply because he has leased the place, and watch all these things, to ensure that none of these things goes wrong, that none of them happens.  He just could not be expected to do so, because it would mean that he would have to give up his occupation and perhaps lose his livelihood for the sake of a couple of hundred pounds that he is getting for this letting.</P>
    <P>This definition section is so hopeless that it should be scrapped altogether, but we are not saying that in this amendment.  We are only trying to ensure that the man who provides an adapted place is safe.  If we succeed in this amendment, we shall have succeeded in saving at least one decent man and perhaps a poor man from hardship.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (h) says:</P>
    <P>prescribe hygienic and veterinary requirements and standards for such places and such auctions.</P>
    <P>It might not be possible without very heavy expenditure to have the standards of hygiene and the veterinary requirements the Minister may prescribe for such a place.  It is rented at a price, but the accommodation is not there.  The man who rents it has not enough money to build the accommodation or is not interested enough to invest in that.  The other man is paying him for it and he is not going to spend any more money on it because he would be spending money on another man's property.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I will be amazed if the Minister does not agree that the words we propose to add in this amendment &ldquo;but does not include the leasing or letting of any such place&rdquo; are essential if the type of people to whom I have referred are to be safeguarded from the many hazards with which they are likely to be faced within the law as it will stand if this piece of legislation goes through the House unaltered.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>A person who contravenes a provision <Col N="487" /> of regulations under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Later on, of course, we get all the terrible things that will happen to any person who is guilty of an offence.  I could go on and on describing the hazards associated with leaving this definition section as open as it is, but I have probably said sufficient to awaken the people in this House and those responsible for this Bill to the dangers of leaving this definition section as it stands.  There is a great necessity for improving this definition to enable the man who is unfortunate enough, unsuspecting enough and perhaps in many cases decent enough to provide an adapted space to carry on even occasional auctions of the type I described here last night.</P>
    <P>This man might not even be paid rent for it.  He might have said: &ldquo;I know what you are trying to do for the neighbours here.  I am prepared to provide the space; I may have a cow to put into it myself, and at least I will be told by the auctioneer or whoever is interested in doing this job for the time being whether it is a good cow or a bad cow.  I do not want any rent for the place.&rdquo;  This is what he is letting himself in for and what the Minister is placing in store for this man.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister realised what he was doing or he would never have left this as open as it is.  I appeal to him now to do something with this definition section so that anybody and everybody in any way associated with the sale of livestock will not be caught and made liable to heavy fines or imprisonment.  We have made numerous efforts to improve the section but our amendments have not been accepted.  Since they have not been accepted, we now want to safeguard one category of people, the people who provide the adapted space.  As I say, it may be adapted only in a very temporary way and for a very short time.  I appeal to the House to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have been speaking for less than a minute and so I find it difficult to understand how I could be out of order for two minutes. I think there is a simple approach to this amendment which I hope will appeal to the Minister.  Deputy Clinton's amendment is for the purpose of adding certain words to the portion of the definition section which sets out to define the business of a livestock mart.  The Minister will recall that this definition has been under discussion from different aspects for some time and, remember, all it does is to define not what a livestock mart is but what the business of a livestock mart is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on in the next section to provide that a person shall not carry on the business of a livestock mart at any place without a licence.  As Deputy Clinton has pointed out, if a person does carry on this business which we are artificially defining in the definition <Col N="489" /> section, without a licence, various consequences ensue and an offence is committed. As a result of that offence, as the Bill stands, the person who carries on that business, which is a business artificially defined, could find himself jailed for six months and fined £1,000. Deputy Clinton has very reasonably made the case that this definition is not intended to include all people and all places, that there must be something to be excluded in the definition if the intention of the House is that the Bill will apply to livestock marts.  Remember that the Bill, both in its long Title and in its short Title, is a Bill referable to livestock marts and I want to put this to the Minister: either it is intended in that definition to include persons who lease or let land or premises which are subsequently used as livestock marts, or it is not.</P>
    <P>If it is intended to include such people, then I think many of the complaints which Deputy Clinton has made are valid.  If it is not intended to include them, those complaints are equally valid because it means that the definition section as it stands is too wide, too broad and too all-embracing. The first thing to establish on this amendment, if we can, is whether the Minister intends his definition to include people who lease or let a place adapted for sale of livestock by auction.</P>

      <P>If it is not intended that these people should be included, we should obviously exclude them now.  There is a certain amount of virtue when you say something in trying to say what you mean and if we <Col N="490" /> do not mean these people to be included, let us exclude them.  If we leave the definition as it stands and if we allow it to include the person who leases or lets a place which is adapted for the sale of livestock by auction, the possibilities are endless and I can assure the Minister and Deputies opposite that the possibilities for discussion of the amendment are accordingly also endless.</P>
      <P>For example, take the position of a person acting as a trustee for an infant whose duty it is to utilise the property of the trust in the best interests of that infant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the position of such a person, a trustee who is charged with the task of utilising the property of the <i>cestui que</i> trust in the best interests of the <i>cestui que</i> trust. What is that person's position if the particular person's property concerned happens to be suitable both as regards area and locale for use as a livestock mart if the soundings of which the Minister spoke in a discussion on an earlier amendment have been made to establish that the Minister is disposed to grant a licence in respect of such a place?  Now, so far as the trustee is concerned, he may decide that it is his duty to sound out the market, to see what bids there are, what rent can be obtained for the leasing of the ground in question.  He finds, having done that, that the people who wish to operate a livestock mart are the best bet, that they are prepared to pay the highest rent and the trustees accordingly arrange a lease of the property to those who wish to operate a livestock mart.</P>
      <P>The position under this definition section, if it remains unaltered, is that the trustees then, having provided the place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction or by definition, are deemed to be in the business of a livestock mart, although all the unfortunate people have done is to secure the best investment they can for the <i>cestui que</i> trust, for the beneficiary of the trust, if I may translate it for the sake of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>All they have done is to secure the best bargain they can for the beneficiary.  Nevertheless, by doing that, they find themselves in the position that they have provided a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction and thereby, if this Bill goes through unaltered, they are deemed to be in the business of a livestock mart. As Deputy Clinton has pointed out, they would then fall to be considered for the various penalties under this Bill, which can arise, for breach of any of the regulations made by the Minister under section 6.  That could be the position with regard to a trustee.</P>
      <P>Take the position of the President of the High Court or the general solicitor for wards of court, people of that sort who are entrusted with the care of the property of those who have been made wards of court, either because of their infancy and having no parents or guardians or persons <i>in loco parentis</i> who have been made wards of court or because they are people who have been adjudged to be of unsound mind and had somebody appointed to deal with their estates and their interests.  What is the position of the President of the High Court if he sanctions the lease of property which has been adapted for the sale of livestock by auction?  Is the President of the High Court then to be deemed to be in the business of a livestock mart and are the various penalties laid down in this Bill likely to apply to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the position of a person who has been appointed in care of a person found to be of unsound mind, who was answerable to the court, who has an obligation to apply the property of the person of unsound mind in the way in which the best advantage will be secured for it.  If again, having found out the market, that person finds that the best return on the property can be obtained by making a lease to a person who proposes to operate it as a livestock mart, is that person who has been appointed in the care of the person of unsound mind to be deemed to be in the business of a livestock mart or is <Col N="492" /> the position that the person of unsound mind, who is the owner of the property, and indeed the other example I gave, the beneficiary under the trust, who may be an infant, who may be a person of very tender years, is deemed to be engaged in the business of a livestock mart?</P>
    <P>It is essential to bear this in mind on the definition section and on the amendment we are discussing.  Remember what we set out to define here&mdash; this is a mistake but it is so&mdash;is not what is a livestock mart but what is the business of a livestock mart.  We provide in the next section that that business cannot be carried on at any place unless that place is licensed under the Bill.  It would be a different matter entirely if the Minister had introduced a Bill, the objective of the definition of which was to define what a livestock mart was and then in the Bill to provide that that place would have to be licensed and would have to comply with regulations laying down whether standards of hygiene or anything else that may be prescribed by the Minister were being complied with.</P>
    <P>We are not doing that.  We are defining the business of a livestock mart and we are providing that that business cannot be carried on in a place that is not either licensed or exempt under this Bill.  If it is carried on in an unlicensed place, an offence is committed.  Once we are defining the nature of the business artificially like this, any number of people who are not genuinely engaged in the business at all are brought within the net of that definition.  The examples I have given are pretty fair ones.  I think they are examples that could occur. There are many other examples which other Deputies might choose to give.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a widow whose husband was the breadwinner, who had a bit of property&mdash;whether it is a farm or not does not matter&mdash;and the widow on the breadwinner's death, finds she could not keep the business going and in order to keep a roof over her children's heads decides to turn the property to account, to find what are the best terms which she can get out of the property and at the same <Col N="493" /> time retain to herself and her family its ownership so that she keeps the capital value.  Obviously the thing for her to do is to see if she can get a person who will take a lease or a letting of that property.  If she is unfortunate enough, if this Bill is passed as it is, to get the best rent and the best terms from a person who wishes to use the property for the purposes of a livestock mart, then is that widow, merely because she has made the lease and thereby provided the place deemed to be engaged in the business of a livestock mart, guilty of an offence under this Act if that business is carried on without a licence having been obtained from the Minister or without an exemption order having being granted by the Minister?  There are a variety of ways in which it is open for a person to be captured by this definition quite accidentally.</P>
    <P>I come back to what I said at the beginning.  Either the Minister intends that all these transactions and similar transactions are to be brought within the scope of this Bill, or he does not. If he does not mean that they should be brought within the scope of the Bill, then the simple remedy is to accept the amendment and exclude them.  If he does mean that they should be brought within the scope of this Bill, then it would be necessary to explain that in detail to Members of the House so that we all have a full appreciation of the proposals which the Minister has brought before us and which are contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to let us know the answer to that.  Are they in, or are they out?  Is it the intention of the Minister to have them in or to have them out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this can be answered by &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;in&rdquo; or &ldquo;out&rdquo;, as the Deputy has so very aptly put the question.  Commonsense is a commodity which sometimes has a bearing on certain matters and on how these matters are dealt with.  I suggest that in this instance very little commonsense has been applied even to consideration being given to the amendment or having it withdrawn before it was discussed by Deputies, <Col N="494" /> particularly by a Deputy like Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, in regard to the treatment of matters such as the interpretation of law.</P>
      <P>I can only refer back to what I said, that is, the reverse of the use of commonsense in a situation such as this. The idea of putting this legislation through and thereafter using it contrary to the law of the land&mdash;that the person who originally made the lease will be charged&mdash;surely is not sensible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I rise to support this amendment in the name of Deputy Clinton and I do so because I can envisage a situation not as the Minister sees it.  I can see a situation arising at some time in the future where the co-operative mart, or private enterprise mart, might go out of business and the people responsible or who owned this mart might wish to lease it to a few individuals.  For example, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, just before Questions today, subsequent to an interjection by Deputy Meaney when he <Col N="495" /> asked were any Fine Gael Deputies members of mart societies, I reminded him that I was a member of Raphoe Mart and I paid a subscription to that committee.  I informed him that to the best of my knowledge no members of the Fianna Fáil Party in Donegal were members of co-operative marts.  The Minister informed me that this was not so, that he was a member of a co-operative mart in Donegal, to which I replied that to the best of my knowledge he had nothing at all to do with Raphoe Co-operative Mart.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In line 16 to add &ldquo;but does not include the leasing or letting of any such place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Clinton).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which we have been discussing for some time past is an amendment to the definition section of the Bill.  The <Col N="509" /> House will recall that the case has been made on a number of occasions that the definition section is the important section because on it depends the entire scope of the operation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to add to the definition of the &ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; the words &ldquo;but does not include the leasing or letting of any such place&rdquo;.  If amended the definition would read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction but does not include the leasing or letting of any such place.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister and the Government, or Deputies sitting behind the Minister, appreciate the importance of this amendment.  The Minister rose on two occasions to give his views but, for some reason or another, when a House was called and a quorum obtained, he decided to refrain from speaking, so we are in the position at the moment that we have not the benefit of the Government's view in relation to the amendment.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the Deputies who are supporting this amendment the import of this amendment is to bring some sense of reality into this definition section.  Speaking earlier, I made it clear that I regard this entire definition as requiring drastic alteration, as requiring such drastic alteration that the preferable way of dealing with it would be to scrap entirely the proposed definition of &ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Deputies opposite may feel like saying to me, and possibly regard themselves as justified in saying it: &ldquo;Well, if you hold those views, why did you not propose that this entire definition section should be taken out and replaced by something else?&rdquo; I should like to claim the indulgence of the Chair in order to explain to the House that I did, in fact, endeavour to make such a proposition.  Having listened to <Col N="510" /> the discussion on the various amendments tabled in order to try to remedy defects we suggested were to be found in this definition section, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to get completely away from the definition section and propose a completely new section.  I handed in an amendment, therefore, suggesting that we delete entirely lines 13 to 16 and substitute instead:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means the business of operating a livestock mart and includes the conducting of all sales of livestock at such mart.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle notified me that he could not accept the amendment because it affects <i>inter alia</i> amendment No. 1.  He pointed out that it should have been moved at the commencement of the Committee Stage. I see the validity of that argument because the House has already given a decision on the words involved in amendment No. 1, which was to delete the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; in the definition section.  I refer to the matter simply because Deputies might feel there was some lack of consistency in my remarks when I am critical of the entire definition section.  If the Government decide to refrain from the guillotine motion they have proposed in relation to this Bill, and if they allow the Bill to continue through the normal stages of Committee discussion to be followed by a Report Stage, it will be my intention on the Report Stage to submit an amendment on similar lines for acceptance by the House.  Whether or not I get that opportunity rests with the Government, who command a majority of votes in this House and who are, therefore, in a position to apply closure motions and guillotine motions and to rule out, by such motions, discussions on further stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are concerned to modify to some extent the provisions of the Bill in a manner which should, I think, command the support of Deputies.  It should at least command that support if I am right in the proposition I put to the House earlier, in relation to which I said a reply as to whether I was right or wrong in the <Col N="511" /> assumption that it was not the intention of the Government in drafting this amendment to deal with places or transactions that do not constitute any part of a livestock mart in the ordinary sense of those words, which are known and understood by everyone interested in the sale of livestock at marts, certainly for the last decade or so during which marts have become a reasonably common feature of rural life and reasonably well known to people who are concerned with rural or agricultural affairs, irrespective of whether or not they themselves engage in the agricultural industry, if this Bill is intended to be concerned only with livestock marts, then, as I said earlier, we should try to ensure, when we say something, that we say what we mean.</P>
    <P>We have here a Bill which, according to its Title, is supposed to deal with livestock marts.  The Long Title reads:</P>
    <P>An Act to provide for the control and regulation by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of livestock marts and the sale of livestock at such marts and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>That is to provide for other matters connected with the regulation and control of livestock marts and the sale of livestock at such marts.  As the discussion here has proceeded, it has become quite clear that the definition of the business of a livestock mart can in the circumstances which have been discussed be extended to cover places and transactions which have little or nothing to do with livestock marts, as we know them, and if the Bill is designed to deal with livestock marts, then we should confine its scope to dealing with livestock marts.</P>
    <P>The definition section of this Bill makes no attempt, good, bad or indifferent, to define what a livestock mart is, but it does set out to define the business of a livestock mart and it provides that no person shall be entitled to carry on the business of a livestock mart at any place unless a licence in respect of that place has <Col N="512" /> been obtained from the Minister for Agriculture.  Because of the way in which the definition section of the Bill proceeds to deal not with physical livestock marts but with an artificial definition of the business of a livestock mart we have run into considerable difficulty in finding out and understanding exactly what is intended to be covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Clinton's amendment under discussion now it is suggested that we should at least try to ensure, in considering this definition, that people who lease or let property, which property comes to be used as a livestock mart, should not thereby be deemed to be engaged in the business of a livestock mart merely because they are the lessors of the property concerned. If it is not the intention of the Government to deem such people as being engaged in the business of a livestock mart, there should be no objection on the part of the Government then to this amendment.  I do not believe it is the intention of the Government to extend the operations of this Bill, to cast their net so widely that lessors of the type of property to which I have referred would be captured and would be deemed, simply because they have made a lease or a letting of their property, to be carrying on the business of a livestock mart.  If I am wrong in that, and if it is the intention of the Government that these people should be included, then I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, who is occupying the Front Bench at the moment, to make that clear to the House.  So far it has not been made clear.</P>
    <P>I have given some examples of the type of odd situation which can arise if this definition section is left unaltered and if the words proposed by Deputy Clinton are not, in fact, added to the definition section.  We may, for instance, find a situation in which a trustee who is dealing with trust property wants to make a letting to the best advantage of the beneficiaries of the trust.</P>

I have no doubt that Deputy Booth will be fully with me in respect of the examples I shall mention.

If that trustee, having sounded out the market, decides that the way to turn the property in his hands to best account&mdash;I am using &ldquo;property&rdquo; not in the sense of securities but in the sense of land or premises&mdash;is to make a letting and if, having advertised the property for letting or leasing, he finds <Col N="514" /> that the best offer, the best rent and the best terms he can obtain come from a person who wishes to operate the place as a livestock mart and if he makes a lease of that property then it seems to me that, under this definition section as it stands, the trustee has then provided a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction.</P>

However, hold the solemn thought for a few moments because this is a serious matter.  Deputy Booth will understand its importance. The trustee, having endeavoured to discharge his obligations conscientiously under the trust, has provided a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction and, because he has provided that place, he is in danger of coming within the definition here of &ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo;.  I am saying&mdash;I assume this to be true&mdash;that it was not ever the intention of the Government to bring that kind of transaction within the ambit of this Bill.  If I am right in that, surely the right thing to do now is to exclude it and we can do so by adding the words proposed here by Deputy Clinton that this definition should not include the leasing or letting of any such place. That is one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another example would be the position of the committee appointed to deal with the estate of a person of unsound mind.  Possibly even the general solicitor for wards of court or the President of the High Court, in his capacity as a person responsible for <Col N="515" /> dealing with the estates of wards of court, could be captured under this definition if they agreed to the leasing of a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement here is the provision of such a place and if you provide the place then, as I see it, according to this definition, you are deemed by statute, once this Bill is enacted, to be engaged in the business of a livestock mart.  The whole thing seems quite farcical when viewed in that way.  I do not think Deputy Cunningham or Deputy Booth intended to stand over farcical legislation.  That is not what they are sent into this House to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The reason is that if a person by virtue of this Bill is deemed to engage in the business of a livestock mart, then all the subsequent provisions of the Bill apply to that person.  If the particular place concerned in the example I have given, the property leased or let, is not licensed under the Bill, and remember that under the Bill, if it becomes an Act, the Minister will be the only person having any say as to whether or not a licence is to be obtained&mdash;that is in the original draft of the Bill; do not make any point about the amendment to provide an appeal to the <Col N="516" /> nominee of the Minister, take the position as the Bill was proposed&mdash;the Minister would have the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The unfortunate trustee of whom I speak would then be a person deemed to be engaging in the business of a livestock mart at an unlicensed place and thereby he would be guilty of an offence under this Bill.  If he is guilty of an offence he is liable to severe penalties. He may be liable to a fine of £1,000, six months' imprisonment or both. That is the danger as I see it.  That is the difficulty of a trustee who makes a leasing or a letting in the circumstances of which I speak.  Was that intended?

      <P>The intention of the Minister, even what the Minister says in this House, or what Deputy Booth or Deputy Cunningham or anyone else says, is not going to matter a thraneen when this Bill comes to be interpreted in the courts but what does count is what is in the definition section. So long as we leave that definition section unaltered, then the examples I have given are examples that can be captured by that section.  Deputy Booth will understand the importance of trying to be precise in our definitions. Deputy Booth and Deputy Cunningham will now agree with me that this Bill is not a Bill which is conferring benefits, that it is a Bill which might have very serious consequences if a person is found to be in breach of the regulations made by the Minister thereunder, if he is found to be in a position of having committed an offence, an offence, mark you, which this Legislature would be creating when it passes this measure.</P>
      <P>It is important, as Deputy Booth points out, that we should remember that the intention does not matter later on when the Bill becomes an Act, but it does matter at this stage because if it is not the intention to include the kinds of places and kinds of persons I have been talking about, then now is our opportunity to make that clear. We can make that clear by amending this definition section.  The examples I have been talking about, of the trustee lessor dealing with the trust property, can be dealt with now and can be dealt with by accepting amendment No. 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the motion in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach does <Col N="518" /> not comply with Standing Order No. 27 which directs that:</P>
      <P>All motions to be put on the Order Paper for any day, shall be in writing, signed by a member, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day. Any amendments to such motions shall be in writing, signed by a member, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the second preceding day: Provided that, by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, motions and amendments may be made on shorter notice.</P>
      <P>I submit that this motion, which was put on the Order Paper on Tuesday night or Tuesday evening, does not comply with that Standing Order. Further, there is no suggestion either in the motion or in the terms of the legislation involved in the Livestock Marts Bill that the question may be regarded as an urgent one.  As far as I am aware, in any case in which this section of the Standing Orders has been abridged, the question of urgency was directly involved.  As I understand it, there were two previous occasions on which this section and a similar section, numerically, were involved. They expressly concerned a situation in which remedial action was involved, in the sense that time was of the essence.  In this particular case, there is no suggestion, either in the terms of this motion, Sir, or in the actual terms of the Bill which has been the subject of discussion by the House, that any situation might develop in which time was of the essence or in which remedial action could be involved by reason of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to you, Sir, that the terms of this motion and the actual terms involved in the legislation will in no way prejudice the situation by reason of delay.  As I understand it, on the two previous occasions, the question of imports was involved.  On both of these occasions, your predecessor, Sir, ruled that urgency was of the essence of the motion.  That is understandable, because imports at the ports or at a particular port were directly concerned. In this case there is no suggestion that <Col N="519" /> a lapse of time will in any sense involve a prejudicial situation or prejudicial circumstances in relation to the provisions involved either in the legislation itself or in the Long Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I therefore submit, Sir, there is no justification in this case for abridging the time laid down in No. 27 of the Standing Orders, which requires all motions to be submitted four clear days before the consideration of these motions by the Dáil.  It is not for me to suggest&mdash;and possibly not for the House to consider, because there may be different views on this&mdash;but there are many questions which might well be regarded by individual Deputies as of more urgent consequence to the business of the Dáil and to the nation that have been the subject of legislation. In some cases they have been the subject of Bills being introduced &mdash;in at least one case not being circulated and in the other only partially proceeded with&mdash;but they are of much greater urgency.  That may be a matter of opinion.  In this particular case, there is absolutely no justification because there has been no suggestion that any situation will arise between now and the resumption of the Dáil, either at the end of September or in the early days of October, which cannot be remedied by the enactment of legislation at that time and which would be in any way prejudiced by delay in proceeding with the present legislation.</P>
    <P>This motion indicates no question of urgency, no question which cannot be dealt with fully and completely by the enactment of legislation in the autumn, and which in any way would be prejudiced by failure to deal with it now.  I submit to you, Sir, that any decision to the contrary must be regarded in present circumstances as a partisan and inequitable decision, contrary to the interests of the community and contrary to accepted precedent and practice as operated by this House since the establishment of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the subject matter of the Livestock Marts Bill has been fully debated already. The Standing Order which has been invoked here, Standing Order No. 27, states that by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, motions or amendments may be made on shorter notice than the four days laid down previously in the Orders.</P>
      <P>The Second Stage of this Bill has occupied a full sitting of the House, six hours in all.  The Money Resolution in Committee took a total of nine and a half hours, spread over two days' sittings.  The Report Stage of the Money Resolution in Committee occupied nine hours, also ranging over two days' sittings.  This was unprecedented not only in the length of time that it took but also in that, as far as I can ascertain, a full day's debate actually took place at this Stage of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee Stage of the Bill has been going on now for four days, since shortly after 2 o'clock on Friday last until a short time ago.  So far, that Committee Stage has taken nearly 30 hours.  During this period only four amendments have been disposed of&mdash; in each case only after a division and in the case of three of the amendments, only after a motion on the amendment, as is provided for under Standing Order No. 53.  We still have to dispose of the first section of the Bill.  Ever since this motion was tabled, over 20 hours have been taken up and, as Deputy O'Higgins said a short time ago, little or no progress has been <Col N="521" /> made with its passage through the House.  Ten hours are still to run before the motion, if accepted by you, Sir, and passed by the House, is to take effect.  It is my contention that more than ample time has been made available for the passage of this Bill through the House in all its Stages. The main Opposition Party, Fine Gael, do not want to debate the Bill constructively. Their avowed intention, and this they have openly declared, is to obstruct the passage of this legislation by every legitimate Parliamentary device.  With one or two honourable exceptions, and I particularly mention Deputy O'Higgins, Fine Gael speakers have devoted themselves to making well-nigh interminable and irrelevant speeches at every given opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has put to me several points as to why I should or should not curtail the notice necessary to be given.  Standing Order 27 provides that, by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, motions may be moved on shorter notice than that stated in the Standing Orders.  I have considered all the aspects of the matter and I have decided to exercise the discretion vested in me by allowing the moving of this motion on shorter notice.</P>
      <P>The House will observe that the terms of the motion, namely, that the Bill should be disposed of on Friday, and the normal requirements of notice conflict with each other.  One or other of them, therefore, had to prevail and the other to suffer.  I feel that in such cases it is usually better, and in this case it is better&mdash;much better&mdash;that the House itself should decide on the motion.  The Chair, in the past, has ruled in circumstances such as the present one, that there is reason for allowing the motion to be moved on shorter notice.  I am not creating any new precedent.  There has been at least one precedent to which I may refer those seeking light and guidance, and that may be found in the proceedings on the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1935.</P>
      <P>I had also to consider the time already spent on the discussion of the Bill and the repeated and, I regret to say, unavailing attempts made by the Chair to check what appeared to be repetition.  I do not want to quote statistics&mdash;I do not intend to do that &mdash;but 18½ hours for a discussion of a Money Resolution is unprecedented. I cannot help feeling that, whatever amount of time was spent on the Bill, many Deputies, I do not say all, would still keep on submitting to me that enough time had not been spent on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Standing Orders provide that, by my permission, a motion may be made on shorter notice.  I examined this matter as closely as I could and, I hope, as fairly as I could, and I see no reason whatever to withhold permission in the present case.  I see every reason to allow it.  There is not, as far as I can discover, any definite statement as to urgency being necessary <Col N="523" /> as a reason for allowing the four days' notice to be curtailed.  Urgency, no doubt, would be a reason but there are other reasons as well.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is another matter. It probably is not very important here because one sometimes can scarcely say which is the minority and which is the majority.  I have to balance minority rights and the rights of the majority, though we are accustomed in this House to hear very much more of minority rights.  Sitting here, however, between the two sides of the House, I have to take into consideration the rights of the majority as well as the rights of the minority.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, I have had little difficulty in deciding that the best thing to do was to accept that the motion be taken today.  I had no basic reason, no reason of any substance, to refuse to curtail the amount of notice needed.  This is not to say that I had any desire to curtail any statements or any remarks.  I have arrived at this decision in accordance with the powers vested in me by the Standing Orders and I cannot hear further arguments on the matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset that, of course, we accept unreservedly your ruling on this motion. Whatever personal opinions I may have on it must remain unexpressed. So far as we are concerned, we regard this motion as unnecessary and unjustified by the facts.  The two previous occasions on which, so far as I am aware, your predecessor allowed the time prescribed by Standing Order 27 to be abridged applied in circumstances in which delay in taking action might have prejudicial effects or in which delay in taking action could have involved circumstances unexpected and unanticipated by the terms of the order under the specific legislation.  In this particular case no such circumstances exist.  There is in our present political or economic circumstances no justification for rushing this legislation.</P>
      <P>At present, the main question confronting this country is the situation which will arise when this country becomes a member of the EEC.  In anticipation of that situation two great problems are likely to arise.  In fact, one of them has already arisen in respect of the disemployment of workers and the effects of the dumping of goods on the Irish market at uneconomic prices.  In neither of these cases has any action been taken.  In one case a belated effort has been made to introduce legislation to deal with redundancy.  There has been no suggestion that the question is urgent, although many workers have already been declared redundant. In the other case, a gesture has been made by the appearance of a Bill on the Order Paper to deal with dumping. These are two vital questions affecting the interests of many workers and many industrial concerns, affecting the lives and the interests of a great variety of persons and their families in the community.  In both cases no action has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> So far as this measure is concerned, at least ten years ago there were cases in which individual livestock marts or undertakings found themselves in financial difficulty.  No step whatever was taken by the Government to deal with it.  No action was taken to deal with the individual problems created for farmers who offered their livestock for sale.  No suggestion was made that the problem was such as to cause concern either to the Government or to the Dáil.  But in recent months, when a dispute had arisen between a farmers' organisation and the Government, steps were taken to introduce what can only be described and regarded as vindictive legislation, legislation which has been criticised not merely by the Opposition&mdash;that might well be dismissed as political tactics&mdash;but by responsible leader writers in journals throughout the country, in daily newspapers, and finally in a public statement, after mature consideration, by a body like the Incorporated Law Society.  All these bodies and individuals condemned, regretted and expressed concern at the trend legislation had taken as evinced in the Livestock Marts Bill.</P>
    <P>Consider the problems that people have to face, the rising cost of living due to the failure of the Government to take action, the increase in transport charges, the rises in bus and train fares, the increases effected by the introduction of the turnover and wholesales taxes, the effect of these taxes on business, industry and trade facing the problems and competition of the Common Market.  Then consider the dilatoriness of the Government in dealing with the necessary legislation to cope with the problems of redundant workers and their families, workers who find themselves unemployed or disemployed or out on short time, and the problem of dumping.  Consider also the delay in the payment of grants in respect of houses, the delay and the shut down in connection with grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, the local authority grants for roads and amenity services, and the grants for the minor employment relief schemes.  In all these grants and schemes under legislation passed by <Col N="526" /> this House, there has been an absolute shut down, and there are at present much fewer people employed than were employed previously.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy or any person who stood in the local elections for the county councils can say that when they attempted to get a grant sanctioned or approval granted for minor employment schemes or for work under the rural improvements schemes, the answer was that the money was not available.  Today we find that grants are being refused in respect of school applications, despite the claims made that Fianna Fáil are responsible for educational improvements. It is easy to send a bus around the country with Fianna Fáil slogans on it, but when religious orders apply for grants or facilities, they are denied them.  When they apply for grants they are told they are in what is described as a low priority. What does &ldquo;low priority&rdquo; mean?  It means the never-never system.  These are the urgent questions that affect the people today and will affect them in the future.</P>
    <P>Can anyone suggest that whether a mart is licensed or whether it is approved or not, any citizen will be any worse off?  It is suggested that because we are going to enter the Common Market we must have regard to the standards which are applicable to the other member countries.  We accept that.  We agree that it is essential that we have regard to and accept the terms laid down by them, but there is ample power in the legislation in the form of the Diseases of Animals Act to fulfil the veterinary, public health or other requirements which are essential in order to comply with those terms.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion that farmers will get the £10 per head the then Minister for Agriculture promised would flow from the Trade Agreement of 1966.  The then Minister promised&mdash; we realise he may be a window box agriculturist&mdash;when he came back from London that farmers would get no less than £10 per head more for cattle.  The farmer has received £10 per head less for cattle since then.  Not merely is it <Col N="527" /> £10 per head less, but £15 and £20 per head less.  Today there are 150,000 fewer people employed than there were ten years ago, and yet it is suggested that this legislation is urgent.  I should be surprised that anyone in this House or outside it would have the illusion that this measure is vital or essential, or that anyone who is conversant with modern life or with facts economic, social or political, would suggest there is any urgency in this legislation.  There is no urgency or merit in it, nor any suggestion arising from EEC requirements or from any other quarter that there is urgency in it.  This legislation is vindictive, partisan and political, and it has been repudiated in the local elections.  On every occasion on which it will be offered to the people it will be repudiated, and we shall repeal it.</P>

      <P>You have asked for your medicine and you are going <Col N="528" /> to get it.  The position is that this motion is put before the House in an effort to push through the House a Bill which could not be put through in honest debate because there are no rules or regulations in this or in any other House of Parliament which would allow a Government to try to impose legislation on the people as this is being imposed on them, except for the fact that the man who is at present Minister for Agriculture has an undying hatred for one section of the farming community, those who are members of the NFA.  If he wants to do it, he should have spelled out what he wanted, that is, that he wants the right not alone to refuse to give a licence or permission to the NFA to run marts on their own, new marts, but also wants the right, if he so desires, to take from those who are at present making a success of running marts, the right to run such marts.</P>
      <P>I believe that this is an insult to the House for more reasons than one. There are four or five people present who were invited by the former Taoiseach to go to his office two years ago and discuss with him ways in which the business of the House which, for one reason or another, seemed to spill over into the month of July each year, could be shortened.  After a long discussion lasting many hours, the then Taoiseach made a suggestion, which was accepted by all the Parties on his word, that the financial business be reduced in such a way that only one debate would take place instead of two &mdash;as had been the procedure up to then, and that from the month of February in each year until the summer recess, no discussion would take place on anything except financial business, the Estimates, and that in no circumstances would any type of contentious legislation be introduced between then and the summer recess.</P>

      <P>The agreement was made that unless there was a very special reason, a reason of national importance, this rule was not to be broken and could be broken only after agreement had been reached with the <Col N="529" /> other two Parties together with the Government.  What has happened in this case?  The Bill was published on 31st May and was left lying on the Order Paper until almost all the financial business had been completed and when Deputies and, indeed, the Ministers with one exception were all of opinion that we were reaching the time when the summer recess could reasonably be expected to start towards the end of June, the Minister for Agriculture got out the big stick and said: &ldquo;I do not care what any of you want. I want the Marts Bill&rdquo;.  I am sorry to say that neither the Taoiseach nor the Ministers nor indeed the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil from rural Ireland who are as well aware as I am or anybody else in the House of what this Bill is intended for, were able to make that Minister change his mind.</P>
      <P>Having decided that the Bill was to be introduced and rushed through the House, certain proceedings were put in operation and the debate continued. There is no regulation of this House which says that Deputies, so long as the Chair allows them to do so, may not debate any item before the House. Despite that, I was amazed to hear this evening the Chair pointing out that there was repetition and refusal to obey his rulings.  Indeed I believe&mdash;and I am sorry to say it&mdash;that during the debate the House has been brought to the lowest level I ever saw since I came in here.</P>

Would it not be an excellent idea if he initiated a debate in this House about his talks with Mr. Peart and told us what happened during the two discussions he had here and in Britain, told us how he got on and if we will be in the position that there will be more than 150,000 head of cattle, as was stated by the Agricultural Institute, in the possession of farmers at the end of this year?  Would it not be a good thing and much more realistic if he told us he was securing a market for all our cattle in this country.  The Minister would not dream of doing that.  He would much rather engage in a petty scheme which he himself knows <Col N="534" /> is causing great evil in this country. Did anybody ever hear of such a situation in his life?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come to one other thing.  We heard a lot of talk about the British Free Trade Agreement.  We were told the great things it would do.  We on those benches can now say: &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;.  We remember the debate and all the rosy promises that were made.  We were told at that time the wonderful things it was to do.  We had the then Taoiseach coming in and some of the present Ministers praising this Trade Agreement and the wonderful things it was to do.  The net result of this has been that agriculture and industry have suffered.  I am very glad that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party is here now and that I can say that the Labour Party were right then and that he and his Party were wrong.</P>
      <P>Something is bound to go wrong with everything the Fianna Fáil Party put in hands.  So many things have gone wrong in this country since the Fianna Fáil Party came to office that we are not one bit surprised when we find something else going the same way.  As far as this closure motion is concerned, the simple truth is we could have left over the Bill until the autumn.  There was no reason whatever why an attempt should be made to rush it through in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very good reason why it should not have been tried.  The words of the former Taoiseach and the words of the people who are now carrying the offices of Ministers are at stake on this because a guarantee was given that the business of the House would be done in a satisfactory <Col N="535" /> way.  It was not done in that way and a deliberate attempt was made to fool the people who are public representatives in this House by introducing this Bill at the last moment, in the hope that the desire to get away on summer holidays would bring about a situation in which the Bill could go through in double-quick time.  I have never been a believer in a system whereby the business of the House is so delayed, as it has been delayed over the past few days, that it appeared as if the House would be brought into disrepute by the necessity to bring this about.  There is no doubt that if ever a Bill came before the House which required the Opposition and the obstruction of the Parties in opposition, this is it.</P>
    <P>We could accept it if there were any good reason which the Minister had for introducing this Bill.  So far, he has not expressed any good reason.  He has not explained to the House any single thing which would affect the interests of the country in relation to failure to have this Bill passed.  If this Bill were passed this evening, he would not be able to put it into operation before the beginning of next year.  The extraordinary thing about it is that no matter what happens, if he gets the Bill tomorrow afternoon gets it into the Seanad and through the Seanad in double-quick time, it will be 1968 before he is able to put it into operation. He believes that so long as he keeps this Bill on the Statute Book, so long as he keeps talking about it and warning about it, so long will he be able to frighten the farmers.</P>
    <P>Let me say this.  He tried it before. As a result mainly of his action, decent people spent weeks in jail.  I would like to point this out.  He will find out on this Marts Bill, as he found out because of his previous action, when it is all over and done with, that it will be the farmers who will refuse to take his dictation and who will refuse to be intimidated by him.  They were not intimidated then and this Bill, if it eventually sees the light of day, will not intimidate them either.</P>

Because this piece of legislation was introduced in this House, not as the considered Bill of a rational Minister but as the angered gesture of an individual pursuing a vendetta against a section of the farming community. I believe the ultimate intention of the Minister is to revive in our time the detestable memory of Mr. Browne and the Fianna Fáil Government of that day who had their agent for every tail on sale in Ireland, to buy the cattle that had been seized from the farmers of Ireland.</P>

    <P>I make no apology whatever as one of the most experienced Deputies of this House for announcing on the initial stages of this Bill that it bore on its face all the characteristics that justified us in using every procedural device available to us to arrest its progress in this House because it was a bad Bill.  I warned this House, Sir, on more than one occasion that when the Fianna Fáil Party get a clear majority in Dáil Éireann, the worst element in that Party go berserk.  That is what has happened on this occasion.  The Minister has succeeded in prevailing on the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party to support him in this vendetta, of which I believe the majority do not share his view.  Some day they will learn that Party loyalty is a good thing in public life but its essential concomitant is moral courage.  I know that this <Col N="537" /> Bill was denounced in the Fianna Fáil Party room and I know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A remarkable change has become manifest on the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil.  We have noticed heretofore a bland and silent cadre but there is now a somewhat disturbed surface on that scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing hurts like the truth.  They are going to hear the truth now and they cannot shout me down and they cannot silence me.  Here is their great illusion; they imagine that because they can dispose of a clear majority in Dáil Éireann, they can force their beastly motion through.  They forget that there is a higher court to which <Col N="538" /> decency in this country can appeal. They like the comfortable feeling that their Party work is done within four walls but they have forgotten that there is a fourth estate which is not only an asset to this society but a window for our people to look in on what Fianna Fáil think they are doing in secret.</P>
    <P>They can prostitute the processes of this House; they can assure themselves that they have used the instrument of democracy to destroy freedom by stealth but they cannot get away with it.

      <P>The wheels of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been admirable up to now: do not misbehave. But over and above, Sir, this disedifying spectacle of a Party gone berserk, there is the matter on which Deputy Tully spoke with authority. Our people know&mdash;and we know better even than the people&mdash;that Parliament functions not only on the basis of those Standing Orders&mdash;that is the minimum security which each individual Deputy in this House enjoys&mdash;but there is proceeding continually between us all the honourable arrangements that make Parliament work.  I have often explained to young students that they should not take scandal when hearing a member of the Government or a member of the Opposition exchange trenchant criticism of one another and share a cup of tea ten minutes later in the restaurant.  I have tried to explain to them that that is the way Parliament works.  We are not concerned to attack one another personally.  When we attack one another by name or designation, it is understood we are attacking the man for the policy he represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one facet of this scene but there is another.  I was Leader of the Opposition, as Deputy Cosgrave is <Col N="539" /> today, for five years in this House. Many people in the country will imagine that Deputy Seán Lemass and I did nothing but exchange harsh discourtesies of ordinary Parliamentary life across the floor of this House, and yet Parliament would not work if that were so.  Deputy Corish and I, and Deputy Seán Lemass met not infrequently but the only basis on which we met was a basis of utmost faith.  We spoke freely with one another because we were negotiating with one another to make Parliament work better than it was then working.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and I, Deputy James Tully and Deputy Sweetman met Deputy Seán Lemass when he was Taoiseach and the present Senator James Ryan.  The then Taoiseach and the then Minister for Finance, now Senator James Ryan, put the case that it was undesirable to have the finance business dragging along into the end of July and even into the beginning of August, that it was essential to get some machinery worked out whereby we would get the business disposed of. From their point of view, they were prepared to see that the autumn would be reserved for legislation about which it was reasonable to anticipate there might be deep division in the House.  It is well the House should know this. In the course of that negotiation, we agreed with the Government that in respect of Estimates, there would be an end to snap Divisions and so it became a Standing Order of this House that if a Division was challenged on an Estimate, that Division would be scheduled to take place at 10.15 p.m. on the day on which it was challenged or, in the event of its being challenged on a Thursday, the Division would be scheduled to take place at 10.15 p.m. the following Tuesday.  That was all part of the machinery to try to expedite the disposal of finance business.</P>
    <P>Have not those arrangements been honourably honoured by the Opposition Parties in this House since they were entered into with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass?  I know they have, but I mentioned it this morning so that the Parliamentary <Col N="540" /> Secretary might send a message to Deputy Seán Lemass that his conduct would be challenged and queried in this House.  And I would ask everyone present to check on what I am saying now.  I say there has been the grossest breach of faith.  I say that the undertakings personally given to me by the then Taoiseach, and to Deputy Corish, have been recklessly and shamelessly broken, because the consideration which the Taoiseach then offered was: &ldquo;We undertake on our part, on behalf of the Government, that no controversial legislation will be introduced after the finance business had been disposed of&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We were mutually agreed there would be two reservations&mdash;one, if the Government certified there was a matter of urgency for which they had to get certain legislative powers or if there was a casual Bill the passage of which our experience taught us would take virtually no Parliamentary time. I ask any fair-minded Deputy can this Bill&mdash;whatever he thinks of it; whether he is for it or against it&mdash;be described as an uncontroversial Bill?  And I challenge Deputy Lemass and his successor, Deputy Jack Lynch&mdash;I issued this challenge this morning before the Taoiseach had left for Luxembourg and while I knew Deputy Lemass to be in the House&mdash;to come into the House and answer for what I charged was a gross breach of faith&mdash;a breach of faith which is largely responsible for what has been happening in this House during the last three days.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this: Why has this Bill been met with the stubborn opposition that has been offered to it?  Why is every procedural device which we employ being used in order to arrest its progress to the Statute Book?  It is a question Deputies are entitled to ask and the people are entitled to ask.  I want to answer it. It is being opposed for two reasons&mdash; one, because we are convinced it will make bad legislation&mdash;that has been fairly well ventilated up to now, Sir&mdash; but there is another reason.  This Bill was recommended to us by the Minister as being, with the amendments he had proposed on the Order Paper, the result of substantial agreement between <Col N="541" /> himself on the one hand, the IAOS, the co-operative marts and the proprietary marts, on the other.  That undertaking having been publicly given in this House, on the following morning the people on whose behalf he professed to speak, publicly repudiated it and said that his version of what had passed between them bore little or no relationship to the truth, and that in respect of one of the amendments which stood in his name on the Order Paper, it operated, in their judgment, to make the Bill even more unacceptable than it was in its original condition.</P>
    <P>That was fraud and he was exposed in that fraud.  It is true&mdash;let us face it; and I personally will welcome the insertion at least of that one amendment in the Bill&mdash;that the Minister has put down an amendment to blot out of this Bill the proposition that an Irish Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his officials require police protection to meet the farmers of this country.  It is true, on reflection, that on urgent representation being made to him, I believe, from within his Party and outside, he is recoiling from that detestable asseveration.  But let us not forget he made it.  That is in his Bill as he brought it before this House. That is the spirit in which he approached this House.  That is the spirit in which he drafted this Bill and let us not forget it.  When that Bill was presented to the Fianna Fáil Party, there was only one voice raised to dissent, one voice and silence from the rest.  It was in that form that Bill was brought into this House and it was in that form that they voted for it on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I oppose this motion for the closure. I oppose it, confident that we are doing the right thing.  I oppose it because I recognise in it the same instrument as was used against our people elsewhere and the names of the people who used it have stank in the nostrils of our people ever since.</P>

I will admit that it sits ill on Deputy Davern to be cast in that role.

On Committee Stage, I intended to intervene on amendment No. 5 on the question of appeals to the district court, but it is clear now that what Fine Gael are concerned about is that in no circumstances must this House be allowed to debate the bones of the Bill.  They have obstructed the Bill's progress by harping on definition. I doubt if definitions have ever taken more than ten or 15 minutes of the time of the House on any Bill.  It is clear, therefore, that Fine Gael do not want a Committee Stage debate, that they do not want the Bill discussed. They say it should not have been introduced and they have been trying to prevent the House discussing it.</P>
      <P>We spent four hours debating &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; in one amendment.  Then we had amendment No. 2a and amendment No. 2b.  Deputy Dillon stood up and said we were prostituting democracy.

I am perfectly capable of indulging in a filibuster. I did so with Deputy Mullen on a certain piece of legislation dealing with the licensing of the Metropole Ballroom.  I stood in with him for the purpose of getting some concessions from the Minister for Justice.  We got a little&mdash;not all we were looking for, not all we should have liked.  That was not a filibuster comparable with this one: it was a question of three or four Deputies getting together to try to improve the Bill that was before the House, not to try to prevent the Bill being discussed.  That is what Fine Gael are doing now.  They do not want the details of the Bill to be discussed. Yesterday and the day before, as soon as a closure motion was tabled by the Taoiseach and we were called into the House, I, by interjection, pointed out it was not our time that was being wasted but the <Col N="547" /> time of Fine Gael.

They thought they would starve us but the very reverse was the case.  We have maintained our voting strength.

It is my constituents who are paying the bill, not the rural Deputies' constituents.  It is the Dublin city constituents and the Cork city constituents who have to pay the bill.

As the House knows, on the Second Reading of this Bill, the point of view of the Labour Party was put forward by Deputy Tully and Deputy Murphy.  I do not <Col N="551" /> think anyone in the House is under any misapprehension as to the views of the Labour Party on this Bill.  That viewpoint was put before the House on Second Reading.  So far as the Committee Stage is concerned, our attitude was that we should be concerned about and oppose the sections which we believed were the important sections. Quite frankly, we are not particularly concerned with most of the amendments put down by the Fine Gael Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was their strategy to put down these amendments and to take as long on them as they possibly could.  As the Leader of this Party, I would not have engaged in the same strategy, but I do not deny that it is their right, having regard to their attitude to the whole Bill, to engage in whatever tactics they wanted to.  On all these amendments the Labour Party had a free vote.  The Whip was not on for them.  I want to make that perfectly clear.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass said that the issue seemed to him to be quite clear.  I do not think it is.  The Dáil has got itself into a sorry mess and, if the tone of the Dáil and the atmosphere in the Dáil could be reported accurately in the newspapers, it would do nothing but tend to bring this Parliament into disrepute, and the two sides are to blame for this&mdash;the Minister because he insists on trying to push this Bill through in a particular time.  It must be agreed that what has influenced this situation is the fact that this is normally the holiday period.  I may be wrong, but I do not think there would be the same attitude on the part of the Government or the Opposition if this debate started in October.  I honestly believe that would have been the right time to start it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any urgency about the Marts Bill.  In my constituency&mdash;and Deputy Allen and Deputy Kennedy could corroborate this&mdash;no one is concerned with having this Bill passed quickly&mdash;no one I met, either farmer <Col N="552" /> or worker.  Why the Minister wants to have it passed without an adequate debate during this session, I cannot imagine.  I do not think it is any secret that an agreement was made with the former Taoiseach, and I do not know whether it passed on to the present Taoiseach.  It was solemnly agreed with Deputy S.F. Lemass present, Senator Ryan present, I being present for the Labour Party, Deputy Kyne, present, Deputy Sweetman, present and Deputy Tully, present, that no contentious Bill would be brought before the House when the financial business had been concluded.</P>
    <P>It was indicated about May of this year, or in the first week in June, that it was intended to introduce the Marts Bill.  Fine Gael did at that time give notice that they did not think this Bill should be debated in this session.  What has happened in between I do not know, but, as I say, the tragedy is that this closure motion before the House will be used because the Fianna Fáil Deputies are here in the maximum numbers.  It is also a tragedy that they are so complacent in all this.  With all due respect to Deputy Davern, who has been a good attender during this debate, it is, I think, treating the Dáil somewhat with contempt&mdash;I do not say this to his person&mdash;that a Parliamentary Secretary should be left here in charge of this debate and equally contemptuous that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach should come in here, mumble this motion to the House and then race out of the House.  Where is the Taoiseach?  I am sure he is busy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I was sure he was busy&mdash;whether travelling or talking, I do not know.  But where is the Tánaiste?  Where are the senior members to defend a motion the like of which we have not had in this House for a very long time?  There was one particular occasion when such a motion was introduced by the Taoiseach, now Deputy Seán Lemass, in an effort to stifle debate in relation to something to which we took particular exception, the Electricity Supply (Temporary Provisions) Act.  This is the Act which we <Col N="553" /> have been referred to and which was intended to prevent strikes but, of course, did not prevent strikes.  After argument here with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, he agreed that such a course was not right and the result was that over a period, an agreed period by the three Parties, we had the right to submit amendments and discuss them, on the understanding that the whole debate would be finished in a short time.</P>
      <P>Is it not pretty ludicrous that, despite all that has been said on this Marts Bill, irrespective of whether or not one considers it nonsense, and in view of the fact that we still have not finished the first section, because this House has to be closed or it is the desire to conclude business in a couple of weeks, the House will be denied a Committee Stage, a Report Stage and a Final Stage and the question as to whether or not the Minister or the court should give out these licences will never be debated here?  That was referred to on Second Reading.  Let us sit here until October, November or December.  Let us give up our holidays. I do not know if one could call it rational or not, but I and my Party are quite prepared to debate whether or not the Minister should have the right to give out these licences.  If, after a reasonable debate, Fianna Fáil, with their majority, carry the day, that is democracy and we will agree to that, but to curtail the debate in this fashion is something to which I and my Party could not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I repeat what I said with regard to the discussion over the past three or four days.  These gentlemen are entitled to do what they have done, but, in my view, we should have got down to debating at length the really important sections of the Bill.  I am against this Bill because I do not believe there is any need for urgency in relation to it.  It is not that I do not want to see proper regulations in these marts in which cattle are bought and sold.  What I do not want to see is this or any other Minister for Agriculture taking power to grant these licences.  I do not see why he should have that power, particularly when one remembers that dancehall proprietors, publicans, auctioneers and <Col N="554" /> others must go to the courts to obtain licences.  I think this is a dangerous power.  I do not go so far as to say the Minister will give these licences to his pals or that he seeks this power for this, that or the other motive. Irrespective of motives, it is absolutely wrong for any Minister for Agriculture, and not just the present one, to have this particular power.</P>
    <P>We have asked for discussion on other important matters.  I got my second post a minute ago.  I do not think the Government even appear to be concerned about the grave situation depicted in this document which tells us that, compared with this time last year, there are 9,500 more unemployed. What difference will the passing of the Marts Bill make to the unemployed? Will it make any substantial difference to the buying and selling of cattle or to the price of cattle? What the Government should be concerned about is telling us what their plans are for the creation of extra employment and their plans&mdash;they have been considering the matter long enough&mdash;with regard to redundant workers, who are out in their hundreds in my home town, walking the streets of Wexford.  These are more important things than the licensing of livestock marts, more important than the regulations the Minister says he will introduce to ensure these marts will be properly run.</P>

      <P>This is a very bad ending to the discussion we have had over the past two or three weeks.  I know there are strong feelings on both sides. I can well appreciate the attitude of the Fine Gael Party in their strong, and quite sincere, opposition to this Bill.  I cannot interpret the mind of the Minister for Agriculture because he has not yet to my knowledge given any adequate reason as to the urgency of this Bill.  We are, I believe, mature enough to recognise the importance of a reasonable Committee discussion and reasonable amendments.  We are mature enough and responsible enough to know that any piece of legislation about which people feel so strongly should not be carried in this fashion, carried by a guillotine motion introduced some 24 or 36 hours ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not deny that the Labour Party are opposed to the Bill but I would, even at this stage, ask if there is any possibility at all of agreement, if you like, to a reasonable discussion on this Bill to ensure that every Deputy in every Party who wants to talk will have an opportunity of debating sections and amendments and an opportunity, <Col N="556" /> after discussion, of deciding on them.  It is sordid to think that the recess should occur now in a situation like this, with discussion stifled and with no real decision on a Bill which both sides of the House regard as so important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in this, his tercentenary, Jonathan Swift were to return, he would find in the antics of the Fianna Fáil Party the most fruitful material for the genius he had for bitter satire.  We would have again a fresh edition of the Lilliputian mind, the small mind that is almost inevitably the concomitant of the bully.  This is the movement of the Bill, the effort to destroy free speech.  Such a process is not new to the Fianna Fáil Party, either inside or outside this House.  A motion such as this must have as its underlying reason the equity necessarily associated with urgency.  Where equity is sought there is a maxim which is inevitably and invariably applied, that is, that those who seek equity must come with clean hands.</P>
      <P>Let us, for a moment, examine the hands, metaphorically speaking, of this Government, whose Minister is seeking this Bill.  It was, as I said in an earlier speech, conceived in anger. Having listened to the spasmodic outbursts of people curiously inspired from the Government benches, I have now decided that this Bill was conceived not merely in anger but in hatred&mdash;the hatred, again, of the Lilliputian mind associated with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had his quarrel with the farmers.  Not satisfied with keeping them in the gutter of Merrion Street, not satisfied with short or long periods of quite unjustifiable incarceration, not satisfied with fooling them into the belief that better times were in store for them if they avoided clashes of certain kinds with authorities, not satisfied with his own mean and stealthy victory in that regard, he goes further and comes into this House and says, in effect: &ldquo;This is a measure conceived and designed by the Fianna Fáil Party forming this Government to be put into execution for the good of the farmers of this country.&rdquo;  That <Col N="557" /> was the reason given.  To support that reason, a solemn profession was made here, by way of jibe at these benches, that he had the support of the livestock marts, of the IAOS, of the Cork marts and of other interests in marts generally.  To that, the lie was given in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>Through every avenue of public opinion, the Minister was discredited, in journals and papers, by societies of repute, farming or otherwise.  The Minister apologised?  Has he said he is sorry?  No.  All he has said is that he mistook a situation.  If they had not spoken, he would have persevered in telling Parliament the untruth which he told merely to silence us on the Fine Gael benches.  But, of course, we knew otherwise and would not be silenced, nor will we be silenced now.  Even though we are silenced in this House by a chopper motion, we shall not be silenced outside it.</P>
    <P>Democracy means government by the people.  The price of freedom, operated in such a democracy, is that we be eternally watchful of the process of government.  It is the business of the Executive to plan and to advance legislation.  It is the business of the Legislature to examine it and ultimately to pass it.  It is the business, then, when called upon, of the judiciary to interpret it.  While we here engage in a very close sifting process of examination of a Bill of this kind, we are merely trying to see that the finished article leaving this Parliament will be as perfect as it is within our fallible conception of the perfect to ensure. We do not want, and I do not think any Parliament would want a Bill of this kind or, indeed, any Bill at all to be subjected to the test of constitutionality or, due to its equivocal nature and lack of clarity, to be the subject matter of prolonged and expensive litigation.</P>
    <P>We deplore this motion.  At a time when so many things require to be done, when so many things require our attention, in a period of urgency, in a period of rising unemployment figures, in a period of an ever-rising cost of living and depreciation in the value of money, in a period when we are engaging in the process of trying <Col N="558" /> to join the EEC, in such an overall period when we should be concentrating all our energies and directing our minds towards the situation that lies ahead of us, we are taken away from all of that necessary national work to engage here in disputation on a measure which has been conceived and brought forth by the bully.</P>
    <P>This is a bad Bill.  This is a Bill designed to keep people from exercising their rights in the courts of our country, if that be necessary.  This is a Bill where the <i>gauleiter</i> system of Fianna Fáil is again rearing its ugly head.  This is a Bill whereby people will be appointed outside the cattle marts and within the cattle marts to inspect the cattle marts and every one of them will have to go through the sieve of the Fianna Fáil cumann before he gets the job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know.  It is still hidden away in the archives of the speeches made by Deputy Seán <Col N="559" /> Lemass.  Deputy Tully and Deputy Dillon have already dealt with this closure motion as a breach of faith.  It is much worse than a breach of faith. It is an attempt, and it will be a successful attempt, of course, by reason of numbers, to stifle free speech.  It is the rampage of a Party drunk with power and, indeed, today aided in that state in certain other ways.  This is megalomania of the worst type.  This amounts to the rape of the democratic process and I can think of no more fitting description for the Minister for Agriculture and those supporting him than to say that not since the days of mythology when Jupiter, in the shape of a bull, raped the maiden Europa, was such an attack made on democracy or such an attack ever made by a Minister for Agriculture upon the farmers for whom he is supposed to speak and whose interests he is supposed to protect.</P>
      <P>This is vindictive, this is petty, this is bullying, and this Bill is only creating further the atmosphere in which the people are getting more cautious and afraid of the manner in which the democratic process is being abused. The time is not far distant when this Bill, if it becomes an Act, will be repealed, repealed by another Government when the people will have wiped away for ever from the benches of the Government in this House the megalomaniacs of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that must be said is that the Fine Gael Party have spoken on this Bill and said that when they got a majority in this Parliament as Government, one of the first things they will do is to repeal it.  Therefore, the people can decide on that particular point.  You, Sir, will be fully aware that if you have not been here for a long time and have not known the procedure and practice of what has happened and how arrangements are made, you very often do not understand or realise how business is being put through.  We are indebted today to the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, to Deputy Dillon, then Leader of the <Col N="560" /> Fine Gael Party, and to Deputy Tully, then Whip of the Labour Party, for the names of the persons who sat with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and arranged with him as an All-Party Committee that no contentious legislation would be introduced here when the financial business had been disposed of.  The purpose was to see that the business of the House could be judiciously disposed of and that it would be possible to have the recess earlier so that there could be an earlier resumption and an earlier resumption of business.</P>
      <P>We see now the breaking of faith. We see now the promises being broken and the absolute epitome of the end justifying the means.  If I were to mention something else to show the mind of the Minister for Agriculture and the way he works and the way he succeeds, it would be the incident of the suspension of Deputy Harte when the apology of the Minister for Agriculture came after the event had occurred, and when, in fact, the whole thing could have been eased and the Chair could have been put in a much easier position if that apology had been forthcoming before and not after. However, again the end justifies the means.  It was Deputy Harte who was suspended and the Minister for Agriculture, watching the cards fall on the table, with all his knowledge, all his experience and ability in regard to parliamentary work in this Chamber, saw to it that it was his Donegal colleague who fell by the wayside and he came out as the big magnanimous man in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have been here for a while can recognise the machinations of somebody who is prepared at all times to allow the end to justify the means.  Deputy Lemass has gone, and I have a feeling that if he were in the saddle tonight, this contentious legislation would not have been introduced and there would not have been the situation whereby the Minister for Agriculture had succeeded in bullying his own Taoiseach.  Let us remember the night when the farmers were sitting down.  We all remember very well when there were four Taoiseachs.  One <Col N="561" /> has since mentioned the scandal of low standards in high places.  The other three nominated themselves and the Minister for Agriculture nominated himself, as he told us afterwards, as a buffer.  Now we have a compromise Taoiseach who can be made to break the word of his predecessor and who can be in the position tonight of being on important international business in Rome, while at the same time, three reputable Members of Dáil Éireann can stand up and name the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who entered into this agreement that there would be no contentious legislation and were prepared to break it then because if they did not break it, they would have to break the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>If he wishes to be on a collision course, there is nothing you can do except sack him and apparently such is his power in the Party that that will not occur.  What will happen, I believe, is that as a result he will sack them and in the next general election, which might not be so far away &mdash; we can all detect the signs when we have been here a while &mdash; there will be the position whereby the Minister for Agriculture will find himself not on those benches but here.  In the 13 years during which I have been in this House and in the other House, there has been a phenomenon that rears its head at times.  It is the arrogance of a certain section of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is one of those times, but I want to repeat what I said during the Committee Stage of this Bill and also on Second Reading, and which I believe absolutely.  It is the statement which has so incensed the Minister that he has made me the target of his tongue. I believe that the Minister, being one of those men who watches votes and seats as certainly no one else in his own Party does, has decided that as a result of the row with the farmers, the Fianna Fáil Party are down about five or six seats, apart from any other losses they may suffer, and that the best thing for the Party to do is to destroy the NFA, even if that means losing another seat or two.</P>
    <P>If that election to which I have referred can be staved off for long <Col N="562" /> enough, the best thing for Fianna Fáil to do is break the NFA.  It is on that basis that the Minister for Agriculture has set out on his collision course.  He is the super-pragmatist and he believes, as no other man in the House believes, that the end justifies the means.  He will throw the chessmen on the table one by one so as to get the best advantage for Fianna Fáil.  I do not think any reasonable people sitting behind him or any reasonable people sitting over here will deny that, of all the politicians there are in the Fianna Fáil Party, he is the one who will make the decisions on the basis of pragmatism and on the basis of the end justifying the means.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the definition section of this Bill.  It has been said we did not get very far on the Committee Stage.  It has been said by the Parliamentary Secretary who moved this guillotine motion that we did not go through the Bill as we should have on Committee Stage and that there was deliberate obstruction.  But the definition section of this Bill is highly important and the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is highly important.  I quote section 1:</P>
    <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;business of a livestock mart&rdquo; means the business of selling livestock by auction or providing, for the holding of sales of livestock by auction or otherwise, a place adapted for the sale of livestock by auction;</P>
    <P>We have gone through the various arguments and, if I want to adapt a phrase from the Minister's speech to my own, I can do it without changing a line, without taking the cross off any &ldquo;t&rdquo; or the dot off any &ldquo;i&rdquo;.  In the same way I can adapt my farm, without changing one door, to the dispersal sale of cattle and so on to a livestock mart.  This means that the Minister wants to take entire control of the livestock industry.  He wants to control every sale.  Deputy Noel Lemass is not noted for a vast amount of grey matter, but he let the cat out of the bag.  He was present at one of the Fianna Fáil meetings.  He says if we are spending £60 million on agriculture and if he has to vote to spend £5 million there <Col N="563" /> times and £2 million in the last few years, they have to see to it that the Fianna Fáil Party have absolute control of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants absolute control of the sale of cattle.  He wants to be able to direct them where he wants to, towards the production of beef, towards the export of stores, towards selling wherever he says.  The definition section guarantees him that power.  If there is to be arbitration or an appeal as to whether or not he should give the sale of every bullock within a 20 miles area to a Fianna Fáil supporter, that appeal is going to be to a man nominated by himself.  Can there be anything more like playing uphill in a game of football with referee and the other 15 players against you?  That is what the Minister is seeking.  If we speak here for a few days, there is a guillotine motion.  It means democracy is gone.  It means, when you have a general election and get a majority, these people want to do anything they like, even to the extent of not having the next general election if they are afraid to meet the people.</P>
    <P>I want to mention something that has been mentioned before, the Redundancy Bill.  I had a visit from a gentleman, not from my own constituency, but from Dún Laoghaire, in fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe we are not speaking about the same gentleman.  I <Col N="564" /> am going to describe my conversation with this gentleman.  He said: &ldquo;The firm in which I have worked for almost 40 years is not closing down but changing its type of business I am becoming redundant.  What is my position in relation to the Redundancy Bill?  Will the provisions of the Redundancy Bill be retrospective? Will I be thrown on the road, just as I would have been if this happened five years ago?&rdquo; I wrote a personal letter to the Minister for Labour and got a courteous reply, as I always do, from that gentleman.  It said that the Redundancy Bill would not be retrospective, that it must wait until it passed through the House.</P>
      <P>We are now in the position whereby 120 people in Deputy Corish's constituency became redundant the week before last.  In cross-talk with Deputy Allen, this was not contradicted.  These people are not being looked after by legislation which has been on the Table of this House for the past nine months. Yet we are forcing through a Livestock Marts Bill that will give complete control to a man who had no interest in a bullock up to the challenge for power which occurred some months ago.  We are giving him control of the entire livestock industry of this country, with the right to say where they will be sold and who will be selling them.  If anybody seeks to appeal about it, the appeal will be to a Fianna Fáil henchman. That is being bulldozed through the House before we leave for the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the Greyhound Bill.  I want to say that Deputy Vivion de Valera, who is here now, had a discussion with me in the most friendly fashion in the Division Lobby yesterday. He told me: &ldquo;I cannot say anything about what Fine Gael are doing on the Livestock Marts Bill.  They seem to feel deeply about it and I did the same thing myself on the Greyhound Bill.&rdquo;  If he wants to deny that, he can.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Deputy Andrews has hardly concerned himself since he came here with the niceties of parliamentary <Col N="565" /> behaviour.  All he has been is a glorious failure.  I am sure he will improve with age, like Jameson's whiskey.  There is also the matter mentioned by Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave of between 150,000 and 170,000 fewer people at work than when this Government took office in 1957.  Is this a matter of moment?  Deputy Corish, for instance, opens his second post and gets a figure of 9,500 more unemployed than this day last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to discuss this intervention that has been made here several times over the past few days.  Of course, Deputy Pa O'Donnell is the President for the time being of the Incorporated Law Society. May I say that Deputy Pa O'Donnell feels his position in relation to that office so much that he said he would not speak for his Party on this Bill, except on amendments which had been put down as a result of discussions with the Incorporated Law Society. Although within the House during the entire passage of the Bill so far, simply <Col N="566" /> because he is President of that Society, he has been notably absent from the Chamber.</P>
      <P>I want to quote what the Society said about this Bill, and I use the words deliberately.  They said that possibly this Bill may be unconstitutional.  That means that if the man who sits opposite, who believes that the end always justifies the means, does bulldoze this Bill through here now, this week he may be faced with the situation wherein the Council of State or the President or who will, the meanest citizen of this country, may decide to contest this Bill on the basis that it is unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>I have made the point that this Bill is defined by the Incorporated Law Society as possibly unconstitutional.  I have made the point that they are not people to make unsubstantiated statements.  I have pointed out that the meanest citizen or the Council of State or the President or the IAOS, who have disowned the Minister, or the Associated Livestock Marts who have disowned the Minister, or the Co-operative Livestock Marts, who have disowned the Minister &mdash; any one of these, including the Junior Chamber of Commerce, may decide to contest that in court and they may <Col N="567" /> prove that the bullying and &ldquo;the end justifying the means,&rdquo; and the decision that the Government shall steamroll a measure through this House without due regard for parliamentary democracy and what has been the practice may end at naught, as I hope it will.  I want to warn the Fianna Fáil Party that they are gambling with themselves.  If that happens, that is the finish of them.</P>
      <P>What are the other matters that should have been discussed here during this session?  I have mentioned the unemployed and the fact that there are fewer employed.  What about the public scandal that there is about the fact &mdash; without mentioning any of their names &mdash; of a loss totalling £10 million of money invested in certain firms by decision of Government Ministers, which have failed and where there has not been an increase in employment but in many cases a decrease in employment and in more than one case a certain decrease in employment in other industries because one or two have staggered on by selling goods at less than cost?  Should that be discussed before we break up for the summer recess?  Are these things more important than the livestock marts?  What about the crisis in the cattle trade?  If the Minister likes to look up the answers to questions and supplementary questions given by his predecessor nine months ago, he will find that I told him then that there would be a glut in the cattle trade and over 200,000 cattle too many at this backend.  The Agricultural Institute has come out, I think perhaps in a sort of guided leak, to tell us that we are going to have 150,000 too many.  We are to have discussions with Mr. Peart and there is an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in which it is suggested that we may be paid to keep our cattle back.  Should this matter be discussed before or after the Livestock Marts Bill?  I would very much like to know which of these things the people think is the most important.  I have invited the Minister to look up the records and see whether or not I told you so nine months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to mention something <Col N="568" /> else.  There are Deputies interrupting here now who were not here in 1954-57.  I was here, in their position, at their age.  I will be 44 next October. Deputy Molloy and Deputy Andrews, who are a great deal more impertinent than I was when I came here, are in the same position now as I was in 1954-57.  No more irresponsible person in opposition, no more vindictive or vicious person in opposition could be imagined than the Deputy Blaney of that day.  I have heard him on these benches keep this House here for 2½ hours.  I have heard him on these benches vilifying men like Deputy John A. Costello.  That is something that is not forgotten.  It is forgiven but it is not forgotten.</P>

      <P>What this debate is really about scarcely anybody would know, except that it is a continuation and is typical of all that has gone before over these recent weeks.  I should like just to comment on a few of the further ridiculous claims that have been made by one of the speakers here tonight.  The first one I want to nail right back where it belongs is the refrain that we have been hearing over the past two or three weeks that this Bill is being rushed and that it is a vendetta against the NFA.  If any measure of its size could be said not to have been rushed, surely this is it. Surely the time that has been given to it so far is without precedent in this House in a matter of this nature? Surely we begin to realise the hypocrisy of Fine Gael when on Second Reading, the Stage on which each member who wishes to contribute, in order to criticise, to reconstruct, to improve or demolish, makes his overall contribution, we find that the total record of this important Stage of this relatively small measure occupies 99 columns. Ninety-nine columns of print has been sufficient entirely to encompass all that had to be said by everybody in this House in the debate of a general nature on this Bill.  If I remember correctly, there was no closure motion on that Second Reading debate. Nobody stopped anybody from talking on that Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Then we come to the Money Resolution which, in my experience over the years I have been in this House, although I am no expert in these matters, is merely regarded as a prelude to the discussion on the Committee Stage of a Bill, big or small.  We find on this occasion, after only 99 columns of debate on the Second Stage, there are 354 columns on the Money Resolution, that heretofore, in my limited experience in this House, has been regarded as a mere formality prior to dealing with the various sections, clauses and sub-clauses of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We come then to the Committee Stage.  Since we started and up to yesterday, I suppose we would have had at least 540 columns and 30 hours of debate. What did we spend this time on? For what did we bring all this print into being except to discuss these words in two amendments to one section? The words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;constructed or reconstructed&rdquo; in substitution for something else.  Those two small amendments cost this House and the country valuable time and money that could have been devoted to some of the important things that have been mentioned here tonight.  Fine Gael would only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy L'Estrange, as Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party, has made certain arrangements, that is no business of mine.  I cannot help it if Deputies from Fine Gael wish to behave unreasonably.  I cannot help it if they want to engage in a stupid, inane <Col N="572" /> discussion.  This has been going on day in and day out with scant regard for the normal procedure of this House. We continue with this, despite the fact that all Members of the House are aware since yesterday morning that the guillotine motion was being introduced, and would become effective at 5 o'clock tomorrow evening.  I warned Deputies yesterday to take note of the fact that such a motion was there, and that they should devote the valuable time of this House to dealing with this Bill in a constructive manner in the time available.  Instead of doing that, they dug their heels in and spent yesterday and today up to 7 p.m. discussing the insertion of the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; in section 1, and the insertion of the words &ldquo;and habitually used&rdquo; in the same definition section.  Here we are, most of us allegedly mature people, and we have spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That remark is well worth making.  Here we are with all of this time and all of these columns printed in the records of this House, and I do not think I am reflecting in the slightest degree on the Opposition when I say that all of these columns put together do not help in the slightest in regard to the meaning of this section.</P>
      <P>I am appealing again to Fine Gael, even at this late stage, to go through the Bill, to get on to the sections where they might be able to contribute something of value, to leave the definition section alone and stop trying to destroy the whole meaning of it.  Every single amendment that has been put forward and discussed here has been designed to destroy the essence of the Bill, and I challenge Fine Gael to show that this is not true.  I challenge the legal men in Fine Gael, who are well practised in law and its interpretation, to show that they have not designed these amendments solely and simply in the realisation that by getting even one of them through, they could destroy the effectiveness and the usefulness of the Bill as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it was a slip of the tongue or not, I do not know, but I rather <Col N="573" /> pricked up my ears when Deputy Donegan talked about the Incorporated Law Society, about which I have no intention of talking.  However, did I gather from him that there was something of a virtue to be detected in that the President of the Society, namely, our colleague, Deputy P. O'Donnell, had not spoken on this measure except on amendments that were prepared in the Incorporated Law Society.  Is this what I heard him say? Did they prepare these amendments?</P>

      <P>Not only did I not get any prepared by the Incorporated Law Society &mdash; this concerns the Deputy opposite not only as a Member of the House but also as a member of the profession &mdash; but I did not even experience the courtesy of getting a copy of the statement until it had first been published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been an oversight but on the other hand, an uncharitable view would be &mdash; and it might be taken out of it by uncharitable people of which there are a few still about &mdash; that it was not intended to be helpful at any stage and therefore why send it to the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for the Bill in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not really sore about it.  I am trying to be understanding about why the courtesy that one would expect from a body of the standing of the Society, presided over by a man from my own county and a colleague of my own, should not even do me the courtesy of providing me with the benefit of the wisdom of their deliberations <Col N="575" /> and the result of their consideration of this particular measure which they saw fit to get into print and have widely published and probably helped to prepare amendments for Fine Gael to come in here to try to wreck the Bill.  Possibly unwittingly they did all this: it is quite conceivable, but I must say I feel I would have been entitled, from a body of this standing, to at least a courtesy copy of this document of great weight that we are told about here.  I feel I should at least have got the benefit of its being sent to me rather than have to read it in the papers or possibly to read the abridged version published in certain papers.  I think that was the least one could expect from a body of this kind composed of eminent and respected people such as we associate with the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>However, to get back to the Committee Stage, I shall have to try to struggle along without the wisdom of the Incorporated Law Society which Fine Gael have to back their eminent legal people in their own Benches.  I shall try to struggle along without these people and the wise counsel and advice which they are capable of giving in a matter such as this and which the Society is noted for giving for nothing. I have had to do without this valuable contribution because of not having this sort of assistance and advice offered to me by this Society.  If I have not been as forthcoming in the sort of answers that Fine Gael would like me to give to their questions, it is probably because I have not been indoctrinated or educated in these last few weeks by the wisdom of the members of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>I am not against this very eminent society in the slightest degree.  Probably I really feel slightly peeved not to have had the benefit of their valuable consideration and the time they must have given to this particular measure free and for nothing I am peeved that I had not the benefit of help and assistance from them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but Fine Gael have put across this organisation &mdash; and they are right &mdash; as an organisation with no sort of Party allegiance, above and beyond politics.  It is really an objective organisation, and good luck to it and long may it continue.  I am just peeved that this organisation of such great weight should have put in such arduous work and expended so much sacrifice and sweat in their consideration of this measure and that I, of all people, should not have been offered the valuable information they have supplied to Fine Gael.  Why is this? It really saddens me to think that this is the way a Minister for Agriculture is treated on a matter as important, as vital as Fine Gael make this out to be. It saddens me that I am ignored by this very Society of which a man of my own country and an esteemed colleague has the honour to be President in this particular year.</P>
      <P>Having said this, I shall go back and try to struggle on in my own way without this valuable assistance in this debate.  I want to say that there have been 540 columns wasted, our time wasted, the time of the Opposition wasted, the time of the House wasted and the money of the people wasted, discussing, as I have said, cleverly prepared, one-word amendments to a definition section any one of which amendments or any combination of which, or the total of which, would have the effect of nullifying the intention of the entire Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael have worked long and strenuously to try to get just one of these amendments through.  There is a belief that you can wear things out so long and so thin that something will give and that by the drip &mdash; and it was drip and very boring drip &mdash; of this boring discussion and this repetition of one amendment after another, one amendment would be accepted, through boredom if nothing else.  This section is so vital to the Bill that, unfortunately, not even my boredom was sufficient to allow me to give way on any one of these, although it would have given me great satisfaction to do so because Fine Gael would probably fall through their seats if that happened <Col N="577" /> because they do not want to improve the Bill.  They want to wreck it.</P>
    <P>What I want to say to them is that for the few hours that still remain&mdash; and there are quite a few hours in tomorrow &mdash; we shall not participate in this debate to any extent because we want to hear what they have to say and we shall not overburden them with our contributions.  We shall tell them what is in this measure in plain, simple and straightforward language.  They can chew it over, digest it and spit it up again in whatever form they like. We will still recognise what it is, despite your best endeavours to make it otherwise.  You have got all day tomorrow to do this and I am inviting you now as the Party in Opposition you claim to be, which obviously you are not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My belief is that you will not take my advice and for this very good reason.  You have created or attempted to create so many myths, you have attempted to build this Marts Bill into such a measure of repression and vengeance that you are afraid to go on to the other sections of the Bill because a discussion of those other sections is so likely and so certain to explode those myths, those half-truths and confusion that you are creating on the definition section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having said that, I shall get back to this Bill which it is of such great importance to Fine Gael to obstruct and nullify, their tactics being by every possible move, as was their expressed intention, to block the Bill and have no part in it.  The cuter elements, knowing that this would not go down well outside, came in here and made various speeches and pleas, trying to hold the Bill as something capable of operating, but said they would do no more unless we adopted the stupid amendments they put down.</P>

    <P>I am challenging, defying and, indeed, finally asking Fine Gael to have a little sense, to have a little regard for this House, for the people of this <Col N="584" /> country, for the welfare of the community and the interests of the farmers, and to come in here tomorrow and devote the time left to discussing this Bill in a constructive manner &mdash; to discussing it and not obstructing it &mdash; and giving us the benefit of any wisdom they have &mdash; however little it is, it will be welcome &mdash; in whatever way they can, while they can.  Above all, let us not have a situation wherein, when this motion is eventually carried and all Stages of this Bill are put through the House by the majority of this House, Fine Gael will say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil would not let us discuss it&rdquo;, because they have got more time to discuss it than would have been necessary to discuss it properly ten times over.  Instead of using it, they frittered away the time, obstructing the business of the House as they have done.  They have attempted, by interruptions in various ways, to bring order in the House to a standstill. Despite all this, let them not expect the public to believe Fianna Fáil stopped them from discussing this Bill, because they will not.</P>
    <P>Again, my final plea is: come in and discuss it tomorrow &mdash; a challenge, a defiance and, finally, a request.  Do that, and you will have achieved something for this House and the regard in which it should be held.  You will achieve something which might even save your faces.  We do want you to save the face of Fine Gael because nobody is more conscious of the fact than we that we do require an Opposition for all the years we will be in Government, now, and right on into the future.  Remember all these things: come in tomorrow and give us some of your wisdom and less of your obstruction.</P>
