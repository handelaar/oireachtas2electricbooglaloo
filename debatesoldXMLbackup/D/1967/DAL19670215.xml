      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received a request from the licensed trade that he and the Minister for Justice receive a deputation to discuss urgent problems concerning the future of the trade; and if he will meet this deputation at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A request has been received from the Irish National Vintners Federation for the reception of a deputation in connection with certain matters affecting the licensed trade, the chief subject for discussion to be an outline scheme, prepared a considerable time ago by the Federation for a reduction in the number of licensed premises in the country.</P>
      <P>The Federation have been informed more than once by the Minister for Justice that he does not consider that the proposals put forward constitute the basis for a workable scheme. Furthermore, the Minister has stated that he cannot see how any scheme could be devised which would appreciably reduce the number of licensed premises in the foreseeable future, would satisfy the licensed trade and would not conflict with the public interest.</P>
      <P>The Federation have been told, however, that if they submit a detailed scheme it will be carefully considered. I do not see that any useful purpose would be served by the reception of a deputation, at least until a detailed scheme has been examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs the steps being taken to abolish all trade with Rhodesia; the value of total (a) exports to and (b) imports from South Africa; and if the Government will take steps to bring this bilateral trade into balance, if necessary by an enforced reduction of imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20th November, 1965, the Security Council of the United Nations adopted a resolution, which was not a mandatory one, calling upon all States to do their utmost to break all economic relations with Southern Rhodesia.  Arising out of this resolution the following economic prohibitions and restrictions were applied by the Government in relation to trade with Southern Rhodesia:</P>
      <P>(1)  the export of arms, ammunition and military material to Southern Rhodesia was prohibited;</P>
      <P>(2)  the export of petroleum and petroleum products to Southern Rhodesia was prohibited;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> (3)  exchange control regulations were put into operation and all financial transactions with Southern Rhodesia were subjected to control;</P>
    <P>(4)  all imports from Southern Rhodesia were subjected to control with a view to preventing the import of tobacco and asbestos which together accounted for 98 per cent of normal imports;</P>
    <P>(5)  Southern Rhodesia was excluded from the scheme of insurance for exporters against political risk.</P>
    <P>On 16th December, 1966, the Security Council adopted a mandatory resolution which makes it obligatory to prevent the importation from Southern Rhodesia of twelve commodities, namely: asbestos, iron ore, chrome, pig-iron, sugar, tobacco, copper, meat, meat products, hides, skins and leather.  The same resolution prohibits the exportation to Southern Rhodesia of:</P>
    <P>(a)  arms, ammunition, military aircraft and military vehicles;</P>
    <P>(b)  civil aircraft and motor vehicles, as well as equipment and materials for their manufacture, assembly or maintenance;</P>
    <P>(c)  petroleum and petroleum products.</P>
    <P>A further effect of this resolution is to prohibit carriage of the prohibited commodities in Irish-registered vessels and aircraft as well as participation by Irish land, sea or air transport facilities in the supply of oil or oil products to Southern Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>The Government have now authorised the further administrative steps necessary to give full effect to the restrictions on trade with Southern Rhodesia required by this latter resolution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the value of total exports, including re-exports, to the Republic of South Africa in 1965 &mdash;the last full year for which figures are available&mdash;was £178,065 and the value of imports in that year was £1,415,295.  We are constantly pressing the South African authorities to <Col N="1177" /> take steps to secure a better balance in our trade with that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The resurfacing of Runway 06/24 was completed last October.  Regarding the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by my Department and published in the public press on 24th January, 1967, which fully explains the position.  The final cost of the resurfacing has not yet been determined but it is of the order of £125,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the statement in the public press referred to by the Minister explain the mistake that occurred in the resurfacing, the fact that incorrect material was used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there was a mistake; I admit that there were representations made by the Air Pilots Association.  As a result of an examination, it was decided to do some extra work in the form of special surfacing but I have every reason to believe that the surface of the runway was quite safe.  It was a matter of disagreement between two groups of people but it has been satisfactorily solved by what might be described as optimum treatment of the runway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it a satisfactory state of affairs that the Air Pilots Association should have to keep a close eye on the state of the runway of Dublin Airport, among their other duties, and should have to bring the Minister's attention to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Airline pilots associations all over the world take the most intensive interest in everything relating to landing aids at airports.  They make representations, not only in regard to airports but also in regard to flying conditions and these representations <Col N="1178" /> are always considered by individual airport authorities as well as by the international organisations concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Tenders have been invited by the Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd. for the laying of a concrete road and culverts, sewers, water mains, pump-house and other incidental works.  It is not the practice to give any indication of the cost in advance of the placing of a contract.  These works will provide the necessary infrastructure for the development of a town centre for a town with a population of about 6,000 persons to which I referred in my speech to the House on the Estimate for my Department for 1966-67.  The present resident population at Shannon is about 1,700 persons occupying about 450 dwellings and it is the intention of the Company, when these site works have been completed, to encourage private investment in the provision of buildings and other amenities normally associated with a town of the size envisaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950, ownership of the Grand Canal system is vested in Córas Iompair Éireann. The canal is still being used for navigation and the Transport Act, 1958 provides that Córas Iompair Éireann may not close a canal to navigation until the expiration of three years from the date on which it was last used for navigation.  Any change from this position would involve amending legislation and no such legislation is under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>The sub-post office in question was closed, on the occurrence of a vacancy, because the amount of business transacted there was not sufficient to warrant its retention.

      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to.  The organisational status of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been under consideration in recent years.  Some administrative changes have been made and extensions of the Department's powers secured with the general object of enabling the Post Office to act more freely and to cultivate a more commercial approach in the conduct of its services; and it has been intended in the light of experience to re-examine the general position with a view to seeing whether any more radical changes in the Department's status or commercial practices are warranted. Any decision to be taken will, of course, be determined by reference to conditions in this country, but naturally the new arrangement being adopted in Britain&mdash;which to the best of my knowledge is unique&mdash;will be observed with special attention and interest.</P>

The British Minister and myself had a general discussion, which we were satisfied was very useful and constructive for both of us, on a number of agricultural matters of interest to our two countries.  During our discussion we reviewed the trade in agricultural products under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement with particular reference to meat and livestock. As regards the latter, we discussed the marketing of cattle and beef in Britain, including exports from this country as well as the factors beyond the control of either Government which were a main cause of the difficulties that affected the market in the the second half of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> We discussed the possibilities of improvements in the situation during 1967 and are to keep in close contact in this regard.  Mr. Peart and I also arranged to have a further discussion in a couple of months' time.</P>
    <P>As regards the discussions between Ireland, Britain and Denmark on cattle exports to the EEC, representatives of the three countries have had meetings in recent months about the very adverse effects on their markets of the virtual cessation of imports of cattle and beef into the EEC as a result of the high levies imposed.  This matter is being pursued in the context of the Kennedy Round negotiations in the GATT but it is not possible to say at this stage whether any improvement for Irish cattle exports to the EEC is likely to be obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Deputy Flanagan's question on 8th February when I said I believed that to be effective the Council should be both representative and compact.  I also said that four major farm organisations which broadly represent the economic interests of primary producers were being invited to nominate two representatives each to the Council and that six seats would be kept in reserve for particular agricultural interests which might not otherwise be adequately represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> There are over a hundred farming organisations in this country many of which, including Muintir na Tíre, could put forward a very good case for individual representation on the Council.  Moreover, there are certain important agricultural sectors whose interests are served not by one but by a number of separate associations.  If all these bodies were to be asked to select nominees we should have a Council so large and unwieldy that the prospect of its providing a useful forum for constructive discussions on agricultural policy matters between the farming community and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would be lost.  However, I should not like to think that membership of the Council was settled for all time on its inauguration and I believe some flexibility should be maintained so as to enable the Council to reflect changes which may take place from time to time in the organisational structure of farmers' representative bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just as simple as that.  As far as we know, there are 108 agricultural organisations reflecting the <Col N="1188" /> interests of various sections of farming and we could not possibly accommodate even a fraction of those on the Council.  In the main, we are having representatives of the primary producers, and the question is would a question which might be of interest to a member of a trade union from the agricultural side be of immediate concern to the primary producers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they have, but the point is that the NIEC will, I hope, shortly be rearranged so as to embrace agriculture which up to this it has not done and presumably with the representation which the unions quite rightly have, the overall aspects of agriculture as an industry and as it affects them will be taken care of.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if and when he proposes to rescind that part of the Exempted Development Regulations, SI No. 236 of 1964, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 which exempts demolition of houses from the ambit of town planning control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the reasons <Col N="1197" /> for the Exempted Development Regulations, 1964 which removed demolition from the scope of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963; what limitations are now exercised over demolition; and whether this part of the regulations weakens the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Exempted Development Regulations were made before the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, came into operation and are at present being reviewed.  The purpose of these Regulations was to avoid any unnecessary restrictions on property owners and developers and to reduce as far as possible the number of applications with which planning authorities would have to deal.  It was necessary to define development in the Act in a comprehensive way to ensure effective control and then to grant specific exemptions.</P>
      <P>Demolition of buildings was exempted in order to avoid double control. It was expected that property owners would normally obtain permission for redevelopment before destroying any building which still had a useful life.  I am not aware, in any case where it was claimed that preservation on artistic, architectural or historical grounds was desirable, that demolition was carried out until permission for redevelopment had first been obtained.</P>
      <P>A further reason for the exemption was that a considerable amount of demolition is constantly going on which is of no great planning significance. In so far as this work facilitates necessary urban renewal, the exemption is fully in accord with the objectives of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Act are primarily related to new building and changes of land use.  If demolition were subject to planning control the enforcement provisions could, of course, be applied but this would hardly satisfy those advocating preservationist policies.  If a property owner chooses to demolish a building, all that could be done to restore the position <Col N="1198" /> would be to require him to replace it with a similar but new building. This effect can be achieved at present inasmuch as new development is subject to control.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the exemption for demolition work is subject to limitations. The regulations provide that the exemption does not apply to any building which a planning authority decide to preserve.  They can make the demolition of such building subject to planning control by including in their development plan an objective for the preservation of the building.  During the period prior to the making of the plan, the same result can be achieved by a resolution declaring their intention to include such objective in their plan.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this provision in the Regulations reinforces rather than weakens the Act.  The objectives listed in the Third Schedule to the Act include preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historic interest but there is no mention of the prevention of demolitions generally or even of the demolition of habitable houses. Each planning authority will have to work out their own policy, identifying the buildings they wish to preserve and considering the condition of the buildings, the costs involved, integration with other planning objectives and the means to be employed, including planning control.</P>
    <P>A review of the Regulations is at an advanced stage and I am hopeful of some indication from Dublin Corporation as to what the extent of their policy in regard to preservation will be.  They have been studying the recent report by An Taisce and have also recently obtained preliminary advice from their consultant in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the regulation which excludes demolition from the control of the planning authority deals with trivia such as painting shutters and carrying out minor repairs, and that the position now is that in time of an acute housing shortage, a building speculator from Soho or elsewhere can acquire a perfectly good building, submit <Col N="1199" /> a scheme for its destruction and replacement by an office block, and while the planning authority is considering the expediency of allowing such demolition in view of the housing shortage, go in and smash up the building and present the planning authority with a dilemma: &ldquo;Either you let me build an office block on this site or you can go and cut the thistles on it because the house is down&rdquo;?  Surely the Minister will rescind this regulation so that the planning authority may have some authority to say: &ldquo;With the present acute housing shortage, we will not permit you to demolish that building.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I remind the Minister of the trouble Deputies went to in putting the Planning and Development Bill through the House? Under this regulation we are told: &ldquo;You can plan for paintwork but you cannot plan for demolition?&rdquo;  Is this not a strange state of affairs?  Will the Minister take some action immediately to cancel this regulation <Col N="1200" /> which makes nonsense of the Planning and Development Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

It is a matter for each authority to decide, in the light of this suggestion and their capital allocation, the extent to which they will make loans for these houses.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government when his attention and that of his Department was first drawn to the fact that house prices were unnecessarily inflated through individuals making exorbitant and totally unearned profits from the community's investment; on what subsequent dates such reports were made to him and to his Department; why no action has already been taken in respect of this very serious matter, having regard to the fact that almost all of the building land has been bought up by developers and builders; and what action he now proposes to take to prevent a continuance of excessive profiteering in housing development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible under the Prices Acts, 1958 and 1965, for price control, including control in relation to the prices of houses, and it is to his Department that formal complaints under the Acts of specific cases of excessive house prices are conveyed.  In so far as my Department is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that section 35 of the Housing Act, 1966, which was before the Dáil and Seanad for over a year, provides that I may refuse to allocate, withhold or reduce a housing grant where in my opinion, after considering any representations the grantee may wish to make, the price of the house does not represent reasonable value.</P>
      <P>To ensure the most economical development possible of available land, section 24 of the Act makes special grants available for residential flats provided by private developers and buildings of three or more storeys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to ensuring that any accretion in land value as a result of development by a council accrues to the benefit of the community, my Department advised local authorities by circular letters of 14th May and 12th October, 1960, 10th December, 1962, and 24th May, 1965, of the desirability of acquiring and developing building sites well ahead of programme requirements. Local authorities have been repeatedly urged in Ministerial <Col N="1207" /> speeches to adopt a vigorous and progressive policy in this respect.  Section 44 of the Housing Act, 1966, provides for the payment of a special subsidy for provision by local authorities of sites for private housing development and section 77 clarifies and extends the powers of compulsory acquisition for these purposes in advance of ascertained needs.  I brought these sections into force on 31st December, 1966, and I expect local authorities to use their powers under them to the greatest possible extent within the limit of available resources, particularly in areas where the cost of building sites may be disproportionately high.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities are required under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to make development plans for their areas by 1st October, 1967.  The plans must state objectives for the development of their areas, including the needs for serviced land.  Planning authorities are obliged to take action to ensure that these objectives are met.  I am aware that a scarcity of serviced land in the Dublin area has resulted in keen competition for available building land.  In this regard, I may say that it is my policy to give priority, in the allocation of capital for sanitary services, to schemes which are required for the servicing of lands earmarked for new housing or new industries.  Large-scale drainage projects which are in prospect will augment considerably the amount of serviced land available for housing in the Dublin area and the resultant adjustment in the imbalance between the supply of and demand for building land should tend in the long term to stabilise as far as practicable the level of land prices.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities have power when granting permissions for development to require contributions towards any expenditure by them on works which facilitate the proposed development. This power is in fact used by planning authorities.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the existing statutory powers in coping with the problem of the availability and cost of <Col N="1208" /> serviced land generally is at present under review.</P>

Surely the Minister did not discover this only when he became Minister for Local Government?

      <P>On the Report Stage of this Consolidation Bill, a peculiar situation arises.  We have discussed it in a special committee upstairs and we have done detailed work on the Bill. There are no amendments on Report Stage.  I want to draw the attention of the House, and indeed the country, to the fact that Dáil Éireann is now presented with a Bill consolidating the income tax law in this country consisting of 561 sections and a large number of Schedules.  While we are all agreed that it is a useful thing to bring within the compass of one Act of Parliament the entire corpus of law relating to income tax, I seriously want to put the point to the House that I do not believe that there is any living man in the Revenue Commissioners, in the public service, in any solicitor's office or in any accountant's office who really knows the contents of this Bill and Schedules.</P>

This is really a discussion on the merits or demerits of a consolidation Bill, not a discussion on the merits or otherwise of items in the Bill which is before the House.</P>

The Fourth Stage of a Bill, as laid down by the rules of order governing the procedure in this House, is that amendments moved and carried <Col N="1284" /> on the Committee Stage may be discussed and amendments moved on Report Stage.  What the Deputy is seeking to discuss now is whether there should be a consolidation Bill at this Stage before the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that I do not accept the proposition that it is not appropriate to the Fourth Stage of the Bill to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the ordinary procedure associated with the Report Stage is in fact nullified by the magnitude of this piece of legislation.  We ought now to be considering amendments submitted for the purpose of repairing any oversights of any decisions reached as a result of discussion on Committee Stage.  That is the purpose of this Stage.  I was explaining to students last night that the Dáil gives itself the Report Stage so that if the Opposition make an impression on the mind of the Minister on Committee Stage that an alteration should be made, the Minister may say: &ldquo;I will consider your amendment and before Report Stage, I will draft an amendment and we can then look at both. Perhaps I shall be able to come far enough to meet you to enable you to accept my amendment and withdraw your own&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in my going to University College, Dublin, on Tuesday night and explaining to students of politics that the Dáil has so arranged procedure if I come in on Wednesday and am told that I am not allowed to do that.  I want, with respect to the Ceann Comhairle, to assert my right to propose an amendment to the Report Stage of this consolidation Bill if, in my judgment, the amendments made in the Bill did not fully repair its deficiencies and I seek to avail of this occasion to do that which, as a <Col N="1286" /> deliberative assembly, we failed effectively to do in Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Deputy gave a very lucid lecture to the university students but he is not convincing me, and unfortunately he is not the person in authority at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to maintain and sustain that authority as does every Deputy but I am not clear what in fact the Ceann Comhairle is saying.  Is he saying that unless there are amendments on the Order Paper, one may not speak at all on this Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I entitled to say that the fact that there are no amendments on the Order Paper is in itself evidence of a defect in our procedure in dealing with this particular Bill?  I looked for amendments because from my long parliamentary experience, I assumed the Special Committee that laboured very long on this extremely complex piece of legislation discussed a number of the infirmities that appeared in the original draft.  I see that there are no amendments submitted on the Report Stage and the Ceann Comhairle may assume, or any other Deputy, that the reason for that is that the work done in Committee was so exhaustive and so perfect that no need for further consideration arose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well imagine that is true but I am putting forward to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and to the House, an alternative explanation and I am directing the attention of the House to the dangers into which we are running.  I am holding up a Bill with 561 sections and a very large number of Schedules and I am suggesting that in the desirable effort to consolidate income tax law, we are not producinig an instrument which is to the satisfaction of all: otherwise, I am confident <Col N="1287" /> that there would have been at least verbal amendments forthcoming on the Report Stage because 30 years of experience in this House teaches me that that is the invariable need and practice in dealing with a piece of legislation of this kind.  I submit to the House that the reason we have not got the amendments is that no living creature knows what is in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is because it is a consolidation Bill.  I suggest the reason that there are no amendments on Report is that it is a consolidation Bill and the law cannot be changed. We can only enact existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, a very useful thing even to have elicited this exchange of views.  That is a legitimate reply to the dilemma I advance.  I can move on then, on the Fifth Stage, to approach the matter from a different angle and if the Minister for Finance says to me: &ldquo;I agree with the Deputy. It is an astonishing thing to see a Bill of this magnitude come to Report Stage without a single amendment being moved, by Deputy Sweetman, who was largely the spokesman of the Fine Gael Party on this highly technical Committee, or by the Minister for Finance himself, or by any of the members of the Labour benches, but the reason for that is that I was in a position all the way through to certify to the satisfaction of the Committee that there was no change in the law.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only course I am trying to take is to reassure the public and ourselves that legislation of this kind is both seemly and becoming and both the Minister and members of the Committee now concede that in the original draft of this Instrument, various amendments were submitted and accepted.  However, we are faced here with the hard fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

I believe the reason for that is that no living creature knows what the Bill contains.  I do not blame anybody for that.

      <P>This is the consolidation of 50 years of law.  All I am trying to put to Dáil Éireann now is that we have allowed the income tax law to get into such a state of chaos that nobody knows the law.  That is not the case just here.  It is becoming a great scandal, I think, of legislation in the <Col N="1289" /> United States of America.  The same problem is probably beginning to arise in Great Britain.  What I am putting to the Minister for Finance is: is there any means of reducing this monstrous document to dimensions which would be comprehensible by the people whose daily lives are regulated by it?  There was a time when this law applied to a very small minority of the population. It now affects everyone who earns more than £6 a week.  I suggest to the Minister this is a matter worthy of his consideration and, in that context, I shall have a word to say on the Fifth Stage when others have spoken their minds.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to make some observations in relation to this.  It was mentioned at the Special Committee that this Bill was so complex that it might perhaps have been a better procedure if the Minister for Finance had introduced a Bill for the revision of the income tax law before introducing the Consolidation Bill.  I think it was one of the members of the Committee who suggested that, irrespective of whether the Bill for the revision of the income tax law or the Bill for the consolidation of the law came first, it was a matter of the hen and the egg.  It is not for me to make any comment on that at this stage, except to say that I agree entirely with Deputy Dillon that, so far as this consolidation measure is concerned, while there is undoubtedly an official&mdash;there may be two&mdash;who knows what is in the Bill from the point of view of his being able to refer us in the Committee with the greatest possible speed not merely to the sections in the Bill but to the sections from which they derived, there is, at the same time, no living person&mdash; it is only fair to say this in support of Deputy Dillon&mdash;who is able accurately to determine the interpretation of each particular section here.  Indeed if there were such a person, there would be no need for special commissioners, circuit courts, high courts or supreme courts at all.  The fact is that the law of income tax has, as Deputy Dillon said, got into such a jungle that nobody really understands it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> This Bill comes here as a consolidation measure and, as such, it comes with a clean sheet, so to speak, because of the manner in which it was browsed over and worked on as a purely consolidation measure for so many years by one particular person, who is now in a higher position in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, and because it was passed on by him to a man who made it his life's work for the past two years, and then dealt with by the parliamentary draftsman, and because, in the absence of some of us at the Committee, we were able to ensure that the amendments necessary to be incorporated in the measure to make it a proper consolidation measure, and no more, were included by the Special Committee.</P>
    <P>Nobody suggests that the Consolidation Committee in bringing this Bill to the House has brought a Bill that is more intelligible than the existing jungle.  We suggest, however, that we have put the law into one volume of 561 sections and 19 Schedules, the biggest Bill, I think, that has ever been brought before the Oireachtas.  The function of the Consolidation Committee is simply to bring to the Dáil and Seanad the statute law in force at the moment.  It was not our function, and we do not pretend it was, to bring to the House a Bill that, so to speak, cuts the Gordian knot from the point of view of disentangling the existing law.  There are two methods of dealing with the present position in relation to income tax law.  One would be to abolish income tax altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the present incumbent of the Office of Minister for Finance will promise that at some stage, but will not give the cost. The second way would be to bring in an income tax Statute Law Revision Act which would cut down many of the difficulties in this Bill and, in particular, cut out much of the nonsense incorporated in the Finance Act, 1965, which nonsense we had to incorporate here and ensure, in so doing, that the statute law in relation to income tax would be such that the ordinary person <Col N="1291" /> could understand it.  Deputy Dillon is 101 per cent right when he says there is nobody in the country who could understand and give with certainty an opinion on all the 561 sections and 19 Schedules of this Bill, but the Committee has to present to this House the re-enactment of what is the law and it remains for the Minister to bring in a Statute Law Income Tax Revision Bill simplifying the law and bringing it down to more intelligible proportions.</P>

      <P>All of us are, at some time or other, asked questions about income tax by our constituents. By virtue of our membership of this House, we are deemed to know something about it&mdash;very often wrongly deemed to know.  I must plead a massive ignorance as far as the laws concerning income tax are concerned, not having much acquaintance with that bracket myself.  It is extraordinary that we can be told here by Deputy Dillon, supported by Deputy Sweetman, that we have had a committee of this House producing a document which is completely incomprehensive. What sort of Committee is that for Parliamentary purposes?</P>

I do not understand it, and I doubt the ability of anybody else to understand it, but we are now being asked to accept it because it is a consolidation Bill.  Surely that puts Dáil Éireann in a ludicrous position?  It should not happen that a piece of legislation should be brought here of which it can be said that no one understands it.  Surely there is an obligation that it should not be left to Deputy Dillon to raise this matter here, to seek clarification of our legislation?  Surely it should <Col N="1292" /> not be left to the Report Stage of a Bill to ask for clarity?  It simply amazes me that we should have this Bill before us in the state in which it is, in which no person in Ireland can understand it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a good deal of misconception as to what this Bill is about.  Like Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Dunne, I would not like to set myself up as an authority on income tax law but the present situation may be traced to two causes.  One is the large number of existing enactments even since the 1918 Consolidation Act and the other is that the law gives a large discretion to the administration and that the real difficulties of the law are not contained in its framework.  This is a consolidation Bill.  Deputy Dunne would be perfectly right and Deputy Dillon would have my sympathy if this were a Bill to amend the law but the Bill is nothing more than a preliminary effort to bring order into the existing law and to consolidate it without changing it.</P>
      <P>The Bill as introduced to the House was to consolidate the law and it was referred to that Committee.  It would be completely beyond the powers of the Committee to alter the law at all.  The primary task of the Committee was the re-enactment of the enactments already on the Statute Book without changing them.  The purpose of the Committee was to do that and there was no change in content.  The Bill now comes before the House as a consolidation Bill and it is nothing more than the existing enactments brought up to date in language and put into one volume.  The members of the Committee might have wanted to alter the law and this question may have been raised once or twice in the Committee but that was beyond our competence.  This is merely a consolidation of the existing law.  It modernises, as far as possible, the language of existing enactments and brings within one cover, for the benefit of the community and the citizens, the statute law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even Deputy Dillon will admit that it is a great advance to have within the one document the statute law.  There is nothing in the Bill to give legal effect <Col N="1293" /> to anything that did not have legal effect before.  There was a suggestion that only the experts of the Department know what is in this Bill and I feel constrained, as a member of the Committee, to make the following remarks.  I have been a member of a number of Committees and, speaking for myself, I feel that this Bill left us to come before the House in circumstances in which we knew rather thoroughly what we had done.  Deputy Dunne feels upset that in such technical matters a Deputy is sometimes in a difficult position but I feel, and every other member who attended regularly at that Committee must feel, that we know and are confident that a good job was done here.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I do not wish to laud the members of the Committee but I must say that the staff work done in the Committee was without parallel, in my knowledge of this Parliament.  I never had the advantage of serving on a Committee of this House in which the staff work was so well done.  Our own Dáil staff, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners, the Attorney General's staff and the staff of the Department of Finance and the other Departments did their work excellently.  Deputy Sweetman deserves some credit in his own right but the service which the Committee had from the staffs of the Departments and the willing service of information we got enabled the Committee to do a record job in record time.  It is only right that that should be said here.  The views of Deputy Dillon might be interpreted as a reflection on the efficacy of the work done and I think great credit goes to the staffs for the service they gave.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I want to mention.  As I say, it would be more proper for Deputy Sweetman to say the things I have said, but I should like to say that Deputy Sweetman's competence and energy contributed greatly to the success of this Committee and he should be proud of the work.  I feel compelled to say this because of what Deputy Dillon said.</P>
    <P>To get back to my original point, this is merely a consolidation Bill and Deputy Sweetman has given the <Col N="1294" /> reasons why there are no Report Stage amendments.  The whole area of law reform, law improvement and law change, is in the hands of the Minister and we were not concerned here with that.  If it were otherwise, I am afraid that Deputy Dillon might have had an ally rather than somebody speaking against him, in regard to things being debated here in the House, a principle to which I fully subscribe.  I should like Deputies to understand that this was merely a consolidation Bill and comes before the House as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a word about the point raised by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Dunne.  I should not like the House, or indeed the general public, to get the impression that our income tax law is a completely incomprehensible jungle.  This is undoubtedly a very large and complicated measure but it is so mainly in the interests of the taxpayer.  Deputy Dillon pointed out that this Bill now affects everybody who earns more than £6 a week.  It is precisely because it does that it is such a large measure.  It would be a very simple matter for this House to pass a simple general type of provision which would say that everybody over 21 years of age will pay income tax and leave it to the Revenue Commissioners to work it out after that.  It is precisely because it affects the livelihood of every citizen that we have to be careful and spell out in the greatest possible detail who is liable, and precisely to what extent he is liable, for income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the first justification for the size of the Bill.  It is complex because we live in a complex society.  I do not think it is any worse than any other section of the law.  I remember when I was in the Department of Justice, we had a figure of a quarter of a million cases stated which governed the general law of the land.  If it is true to say that no one single individual understands all that is in this Bill, it is true to say that of many other branches of the law.  Does any lawyer even understand every aspect of our criminal law?  Does any lawyer understand every aspect of the law of negligence? I do not think so because the law of <Col N="1295" /> negligence consists of a number of statutes and an infinite number of cases stated, but this does not prevent the law from working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Here we are engaging in a process of consolidation and I think that is an important reform measure.  If the law is difficult and complex, then it is especially difficult and complex if it is contained in a whole variety of Acts to which reference must be made before you can understand any particular provision. Surely we are reducing the complexity and complications by putting all these various Acts together and by putting all the law together so that people will not have to refer to a whole series of income tax Acts to understand what the law is?  So far as there is complexity and difficulty in the laws governing income tax, the complexity and difficulty are being enormously reduced by the passing of this measure.</P>
    <P>I want to affirm that when this measure has been passed, it will be within the competence of most lawyers, most accountants and most judges to deal with any particular matter of interpretation of income tax coming before them.  I do not want anybody to get the impression that this it such an incomprehensible maze that nobody can understand it or find his way through it.  I do not think that is so. Most competent technicians will be fully able to deal with income tax matters fairly readily and fairly quickly, once this measure becomes law and once we get all the various enactments together in one piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>It was pleasant to hear Deputy de Valera's tribute to the staff work done for the Committee which considered this Bill at such considerable length.  As we are in a gracious mood, someone from the back benches, representative of the ordinary members of this House, should express a word of thanks to those of our members who sat on this Committee and who did such a thorough job on the Bill&mdash;tedious and even boring work as I have no doubt it was, the type of <Col N="1296" /> constructive work which is all too little appreciated outside this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>From reading the reports, I can see that Deputy de Valera and Deputy Sweetman were conspicuous participants in the constructive work done in the Committee, as indeed they were also on a similar Committee some years ago on which I served, the Company Law Reform Committee.  When we hear, as we so frequently do hear these days, Parliament denigrated, we can all take justifiable pride in the constructive Committee work done on these occasions. I agree with what the Minister has said, that this Bill represents a major convenience for tax practitioners, lawyers and accountants&mdash;tax mechanics, as I would call them.  I can well believe that the amount of draftsmanship that has gone into the Bill has been most exacting and has taken a tremendous amount of time.</P>
      <P>The Bill consists basically of the British Income Tax Act of 1918, as amended by our various Finance Bills since then.  Deputy Dillon mentioned Gladstone and his Bill of 1853, and someone intervened to point out that in fact the base line to which the Bill goes back is this British Act of 1918. It is appropriate that we should remind ourselves that this Bill consists, as to 75 per cent or 80 per cent, of British law, that its root and core is that British Act of 1918, which, in fact, went back to the measure to which Deputy Dillon referred, the British Income Tax Act of 1853 and, indeed, the basic principles on which that was based go back 50 years earlier to the time of William Pitt.  We are here re-enacting this British law, much of which is quite unsuited to our requirements and much of which is quite archaic in the modern times in which we are living.  The Bill, in short, is really nothing very much to boast about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going now to engage in the solemn farce of translating this British law into Irish, a process which will take, I am sure, years before it is fully perfect as the law of this land.  If this <Col N="1297" /> law is turned into Irish, is that going to make it any more suited to our requirements? Of course, it is not.  It is, as I said, a solemn farce.</P>
    <P>It is time we took a firm grip on ourselves and faced up to the dire necessity to reform our tax law.  Whatever about the Members of this House understanding all that is in this Bill or not understanding it, there was one body which sat in this country some years ago which clearly understood all of it and that was the Commission on Income Taxation which was established by Deputy Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance and which reported to Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Finance, some years later. That Commission consisted of many able tax experts, representing a broad spectrum of Irish society.  It consisted of experts and lay people.  The Commission made many recommendations for the reform of our tax law many of which have not yet been implemented. The Minister, Dr. Ryan, who received the Report of the Commission was an arch-conservative.  His successor, the Minister's predecessor, the present Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, achieved nothing in the way of tax reform.  Indeed quite the contrary, in the Finance Act of 1965, most noticeably in Part VII of that Act, he introduced provisions relating to a capital gains tax on property and land which are virtually incomprehensible, which have caused a tremendous furore amongst persons called upon to advise property owners and developers, which in its present form is creative of great hardship on simple people.</P>

Unless the Minister can give us an indication that he will bring to bear a more constructive approach to tax reform than either of his two predecessors did, we will be left saddled with <Col N="1298" /> this archaic and outmoded British law, unsuited to our conditions, for a further indefinite period.  I appeal to the Minister&mdash;he has an opportunity of speaking again on the Fifth Stage&mdash;to give us some indication of what he will do to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation, for a start&mdash;those as yet unimplemented&mdash;and, <i>in toto</i>, to make of our tax law something more suited to Irish conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I do indeed, but the point which the Deputy made conveyed a very clear distinction to my mind, and I think the report will bear me out that he said this Bill was a farce and nothing to be terribly proud of.</P>
      <P>I regard this Bill purely as a steppingstone and I think that is all it can be.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that much of it is still incomprehensible. This was a matter which, on the Committee, caused us considerable heartburning because it was very difficult indeed not to be tempted to try to introduce discussion in an effort to amend the law in order to make it clearer and more comprehensible.  Our difficulty&mdash;and it was made clear to us throughout&mdash;was that we were restricted in our deliberations to ensuring that the document which we would hand back to the House at this Stage would be one which enshrined the statute law as it stands at this moment, all in one document instead of being in a number of documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The state of income tax law is necessarily confused by reason of the fact that it has developed through piecemeal amendment and each amendment as it was put through in successive Finance Bills reacted on sections which were specifically mentioned <Col N="1299" /> and on other sections which were not specifically mentioned and further amendments started off a form of chain reaction.  We have not got over this rather confusing situation by producing this Bill, but, at least, we have now made it possible for a reform of income tax law to take place.  Up to now any drastic reform would have been impossible.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with Deputy Byrne because I think he was not listening to to the Minister as closely as he might have because I think the Minister made it perfectly clear&mdash;he did to me at any rate&mdash;that he regarded this as a steppingstone towards some general reform, I certainly am all in favour of that because the system as it stands is quite unsuitable and far too cumbersome, far too time-consuming and almost uneconomic.  There is far too much time spent, both on the Revenue side and on the side of the taxpayer in trying to establish liability. This Bill, in itself, will not clarify matters to any extent, but it will give the Minister and the House in due course an opportunity for a complete and drastic reconsideration of the whole system.</P>
    <P>The production of this Bill was quite an astonishing performance.  It represents an enormous amount of very careful and detailed research by numerous State officials.  We have been able to bring the Bill slightly more up to date on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, and we have had to resist the temptation to go any further than he has suggested, but I do agree with Deputy de Valera that the amount of work which was carried out in order to produce this Bill at all was quite fantastic, and the way in which it was presented to us was absolutely beyond all praise.  Even though it was good in its initial presentation, after a preliminary discussion, we asked for further analyses of the various provisions to assist us in our consideration of the Bill itself.  This work was carried out with quite extraordinary speed and the additional information which was passed on to us as members of the Committee made it very much more <Col N="1300" /> easy for us to see which particular sections really needed detailed consideration and which we might safely pass, on the assurance that they were a verbatim repetition of existing legislation. All those officials did a tremendous amount of work and I should like to pay my tribute to them.</P>
    <P>I feel, too, that we were particularly fortunate in having Deputy Sweetman as chairman because, while I think we all did work, he put in very much more homework than anyone else and as a result, our deliberations were reduced in length very considerably.  He was most co-operative and helpful and also gave us the benefit of his expert knowledge. It is only right that I should add my tribute to him personally.  It was a Committee which carried out much of its work in private.  We all did our homework individually over the Christmas holidays.  The actual working in Committee was very short when one considers the size of the Bill.  We have taken a great step forward.  My one reservation is that I hope it will only be the first step in a very drastic reform of the whole system of income taxation.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think our intervention on the Report Stage has not been fruitless. First we have paid tribute for public service rendered by Deputy Sweetman as chairman of the Committee. Secondly, there were emphasised the industry and zeal of individual Deputies who sat under his chairmanship in performing the very formidable task entrusted to them by the Dáil. Thirdly, we paid well deserved tribute to the secretariat of the Committee, the Revenue Commissioners and the various Departments of State who placed their expert resources at the disposal of the Committee.  I think it is a good thing that that should be put upon the public record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose, sitting in the back benches one has an opportunity of saying things one has not when sitting on the Front Bench.  As the Third Estate, we are frequently reproached by the <Col N="1301" /> Fourth Estate for a lack of diligence, and in attending on public business. Our numbers are not infrequently counted.  I intend to reciprocate the compliment.  In discussing this matter which affects every single citizen of the State earning more than £6, there is one member of the Fourth Estate in the Press Gallery which I believe consists of approximately 30.  However, I understand, of course, perfectly well that for the purposes of our deliberations, the presence of that one distinguished member of the Press is adequate for such a subject as this.  I shall expect in the future similar understanding by the Fourth Estate that a moderate assembly of expert Deputies dealing with technical matters adequately represents Dáil Éireann as a whole which prudently delegates to its expert members that to which they individually feel they cannot make a substantial contribution by way of intervention.</P>
    <P>May I tell the House that the first Consolidation Bill to appear in Dáil Éireann had its deliberations conducted by my humble self?  The first Consolidation Bill ever passed by Dáil Éireann, a very technical Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now I want to turn for a moment to a matter which we began to ventilate.  I think Deputy Dunne makes a mistake when he says, as emerged from our discussion here today, that the law has been allowed to get into a state in which no one can interpret the provisions of this Act. I do not think that is true.  I do not think there is any provision in this Act which reproduces the law as it stands to-day which is not susceptible to interpretation by a machinery which provides an effective tribunal for interpretation as between the State, on the one hand, and the individual taxpayer on the other.  The procedure is cumbersome, as all litigation is cumbersome.  My complaint is that in common with many other countries, we have allowed income tax law over the years to get into such a state of complexity that there is no living person who knows all of the law relating to this matter which is allegedly down now in one Statute which should be comprehensible at least to some expert advisers.  This is something to which we as parliamentarians should have regard.</P>
      <P>Laws, if they are good, should be certain and just.  Is there any Deputy who can maintain that the income tax law as contained in this Bill is certain or just?  I do not think that under either criterion the law as it stands today is good law.  The law to be certain ought to be comprehensible, once the attention of the person on whom it impinges is directed to the relevant provisions.  It is unreasonable to demand that every citizen of the State should know where to look for the law but it should be possible for somebody expert on the matter to take a consolidation Act and say: &ldquo;There is the law as it applies to your problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to quote section 362 of the Income Tax Bill as it stands to-day, which relates to Part XXIII which deals with the sale of securities:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  If the first buyer is entitled under any enactment to an exemption from income tax which, apart from this subsection, would extend <Col N="1303" /> to the interest, then, subject to the provisions of this section, the exemption shall not extend to an amount equal to the appropriate amount in respect of the interest, as determined in accordance with Schedule 10:</P>
    <P>Provided that if the first buyer is entitled as aforesaid and any annual payment is payable by him out of the interest, the annual payment shall be deemed as to the whole thereof to be paid out of profits or gains not brought into charge to tax, and section 426 shall apply accordingly.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>This section shall not apply where the exemption arises from the residence of the first buyer in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I accept of course that these matters derive much of their complexity, as has already been said, from the annual activity of the Revenue Commissioners in their advice to successive Ministers for Finance devised to prevent the avoidance of the intention of the Legislature as expressed in previous Finance Acts.  Let us clarify our minds as to the distinctions that are to be made between lawful avoidance and illegal evasion.  Illegal evasion could be dealt with by the appropriate legislation, but there is such a thing as lawful avoidance.  The Revenue Commissioners rightly conceive it to be their duty to direct the attention of the Minister for Finance for the time being if a method of lawful avoidance has been discovered to frustrate the intention of the Legislature.  The usual procedure is to advise the Minister for Finance to present to Dáil Éireann in the ensuing Finance Bill an appropriate section to render that method of lawful avoidance no longer lawful.  As the years pass, these cases arise; sections are introduced in successive Finance Acts; the law becomes more and more complex until, eventually, it is all brought together within the covers of one document, which then assumes the grotesque appearance of the Bill we are at present considering.</P>
    <P>This evil has gone much further in the United States of America.  I <Col N="1304" /> think we have a lesson to learn from the experience of the people of the United States.  I refer to the legislation governing Federal income tax.  It has now become such a jungle of exceptions, qualifications and obscurities that the courts themselves are slowly drifting into the position to which Deputy Dunne refers, that is, that they cannot interpret what the Federal Legislature intends to be the law.  I do not think we have got that far in this country, but, if we allow the situation represented by this Bill to drift along without a deliberate attempt to simplify the law, we are on the highroad to the situation in which the Judiciary itself will be in the dilemma of being unable to interpret what the Legislature really intended to do.  Thus there will be introduced into our legislation the ultimate effect that nobody knows or is in a position to discover what the law is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has referred to the confusion that exists as a result of certain provisions of the 1965 Finance Acts relative to income tax on property developments.  Doubtless the Minister has heard of this himself, but to my certain knowledge, one individual of my acquaintance placed a problem of this character in the hands of a reputable firm of solicitors whose considered advice was&mdash;and I believe they spoke responsibly and accurately: &ldquo;If I submit a case to counsel for advice, on this explicit problem there has been no decision and I can divide the Bar approximately fifty-fifty, and I can get fifty per cent of the library to give you an opinion in one sense and fifty per cent to give you an opinion in the diametrically opposite sense.  My advice to you is that, if you attempt to have this matter resolved, you must end in the Supreme Court, because the Revenue Commissioners have their view and it does not correspond with yours.&rdquo; No competent tax lawyer in the country can be found to agree with another on this particular problem.  Its determination is a matter for the ultimate judicial authority in the country. To create a situation of that kind and to stand over it is, in my submission, highly undesirable from every <Col N="1305" /> point of view, because it removes from the law that essential of virtual certainty.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to consider for a moment what is further involved. Suppose some courageous litigant goes to court and is brought all the way to the Supreme Court, with all the expense that involves, and ultimately gets a decision there in his favour.  He does so at immense cost.  But there is no reason at all to assume that the decision secures even for posterity some valuable prerogative, because it will be the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to advise the Minister for Finance that the decision of the Supreme Court is at variance with the intention of the Oireachtas when the original Finance Act was passed and to propose an amendment for incorporation in the current Finance Bill to set right the incorrect interpretation of the section of the Finance Act on which the judicial decision was based.</P>
    <P>When we are handing out tributes, we should remember that this consolidation Bill was undertaken by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.  I do not know who inaugurated the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Dr. Ryan and the present Taoiseach played their part, as well as the present Minister for Finance, in the deliberations leading up to the Bill.  If the present Minister says, when replying, that this consolidation measure is no more than the inclusion of the existing law between the covers of one Act of Parliament for the purpose of clearing the ground, to clear away so far as is humanly possible all the ambiguities, obscurities and complexities of the existing code, then I think we shall all have a very much easier time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not underestimate the formidable nature of that task.  I am not really qualified to say in how far the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation set up by Deputy Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance did help in simplifying the law as it stands at present but I am certain that this Income Tax Act, as it will be known <Col N="1306" /> when it has passed through the Oireachtas, is fast becoming an instrument of injustice rather than justice.</P>
    <P>I want to say something which I think will not please Deputy Sweetman and, I am sure, will enrage my colleague, Deputy Byrne.  It is that the average businessman, the average wage-earner or salary earner, the average man going about his lawful occasions and trying to earn his living, is slowly and irrevocably being delivered into the hands of the experts like Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Byrne, Deputy Sweetman being a solicitor highly versed in the law and Deputy Byrne being an accountant by profession, and both dealing with matters of this kind, to the point that, going about your lawful occasions and your lawful work, you are no longer able to comply with the law except by keeping in constant consulation with experts of this kind.</P>
    <P>I was recently sitting in the company of quite a distinguished chartered accountant and he used a phrase consisting, I think, of 15 words.  I said to him: &ldquo;Stop, stop; I understand the English language as well as the next one but what does that phrase mean?&rdquo; He smiled blandly at me and said: &ldquo;Turnover: it is the new lingo for &lsquo;turnover&rsquo;.&rdquo;  You do not feel you are giving value for money now if you are an accountant and do not refer to turnover as the &ldquo;arbitrament of the impact of influx and efflux, etc.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>All that tripe is now becoming the jargon of the Income Tax Acts.  If you go back to Baggot, the 19th century economist, you will find that he was the first who said to bankers: &ldquo;Never allow the atmosphere of mystery that surrounds you to be dissipated; otherwise they will all know that you are just moneylenders with a grand name.&rdquo;  They have been wise enough to maintain the mystique and it has almost become a sacrilege to query the omniscient wisdom of the moneylenders in the places in which they live, fattening <Col N="1307" /> on the people whose interest supplies them with their handsome living.  It is in the power of some of us to separate some of that mystique and expose them for what they are, pursuing the honourable but humble avocation of money lending.  It is very difficult for anyone, however eloquent or public-spirited, to expose the mystique built into the 561 sections and the number of Schedules annexed to this Bill.  I want to be assured that we are not content in Oireachtas Éireann with consolidating the law and that we have a firm intention to reform it.  Can one picture the procedure that will go on in the remote cockloft of Leinster House when the translators begin translating this into Irish?</P>

This Bill is no better and no worse than what we ourselves would produce because much of what is there comes from what is now relatively ancient British statute law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say just a <Col N="1308" /> few words.  I had intended on the Fifth Stage to be more explicit in relation to the work of the Committee and of those who made the work of the Committee so easy.  I agree entirely with Deputy de Valera that the staff work was such as I have never seen in any Committee here before.  Like Deputy de Valera, I had some experience of the first Consolidation Bill that was sent by Deputy Dillon to this House, the Fisheries Bill.  At least in this Income Tax Bill, we did not have to consider the definition of traps and nets and so on, although this Bill is full of traps and nets for the unwary, but it was in reasonably modern language.  That does not in any way affect the fact, and it is a fact, that the service we got was something of which those who provided it can very well be proud.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the gracious tributes paid to me by Deputy de Valera and Deputy Booth but in fact it was the other members of the Committee who made the work so easy.  There is only one point I want to make at this stage.  When the Companies Act, 1963, was published, there was a special issue made available at once on long white foolscap without translation in hard-back covers.  It was indeed a vital necessity for practitioners.  The same applies to this Bill.  If it is not issued quickly in some suitable form like that, it will disintegrate in one's hands very soon.  Secondly, I hope it will be possible at a very early date to provide something in the nature of an official index.  I understand that some work has already been done towards that end but this is a Bill, which without an official index, will be extremely difficult for a long time for people trying to find their way through the sections. Even though when they get the section they want, they may not be able fully to comprehend the effect of what is there, at least we should like to be able to find our way to the section with reasonable speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is my third point.  I do not know whether it will be possible to ensure in relation to this that there will be something in the nature of a copy of the procedure adopted for the stamp duty legislation, some type of loose-leaf <Col N="1309" /> binding and printing by which it will be possible each year at the time of the Finance Act to take out the existing pages and put in new ones.  I sincerely hope that having regard to the size of this, the major task on these occasions will be to take out pages and that the number of pages we will have to insert will be less.  Certainly something in the nature of this loose-leaf system which is adopted in relation to the taxation law in Sweden, so far as I recollect, would be highly desirable. I hope it will be possible to have an undertaking from the Minister that such will be produced at an early date.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill passes, I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the manner in which the Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas dealt with this measure.  As has already been pointed out by a number of Deputies, this Bill, the largest which has ever come before the Oireachtas, is an extremely complicated piece of legislation, and it is perfectly valid to say that the Committee gave it both detailed and expeditious consideration. When it is enacted, we will have in this country for the first time all the statutory provisions relating to income tax in one Act.</P>
      <P>This, of course, will be of considerable assistance to everyone concerned, whether they are concerned as taxpayers, or advisers, or administrators, or in the courts.  This is an achievement of which the Joint Committee can very well be proud.  I think all concerned should be congratulated.  I want to endorse the tributes paid to the Chairman of the Committee especially, and also to the individual members, to the Revenue Commissioners and their staff, the Attorney General and his staff, including the Consolidated Law Reform Office, the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and, indeed, everyone concerned in this monumental undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important and significant step forward, and I should like to assure Deputy Sweetman that the suggestions which he has made are being favourably considered.  It would be a pity if, having got this far with the <Col N="1310" /> consolidation of the income tax law, we were to allow the situation to deteriorate again at any future stage. We should now continue with the good work and keep the law, complicated though it may be, at least in a readily accessible form.  In so far as we can achieve that, I will give the House an undertaking that we will certainly do it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should again like to thank the Joint Committee and all concerned for the excellent work which they have put into this very significant measure of consolidation.</P>

      <P>Bille gearr é seo agus tá súil agam go nglacfaidh na Teachtaí go léir leis. Tá dhá rud á dhéanamh san mBille. Níl aon foráil dleaghthach ann faoi láthair &ldquo;Aldermen&rdquo; a thoghadh do Bhárdas Átha Cliath ó thárla gur cuireadh alt 36 den Acht Rialtais Áitiúil (Baile Átha Cliath), 1930, ar ceal.  Tá cead é sin a dhéanamh á thabhairt anois.  De réir fó-alt (5) d'alt 3 den Acht Rialtais Áitiúil (Baile Átha Cliath), 1945, caithfidh an t-Aire luacháil agus daonradh a chur san áireamh agus socruighthe á dhéanamh aige faoi uimhir na gcomhaltaí a thoghfar i gceantar ar bith.  Táim ag iarraidh ar an Dáil é seo a chur ar ceal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes two amendments to the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1945.  The first amendment, effected by paragraph (a) of section 1, will enable an Order under the 1945 Act dividing the city into electoral areas to specify the number of aldermen to be elected for each area.  Consequent on the repeal of section 36 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, <Col N="1311" /> there is now no provision for the election of aldermen at the 1967 local elections.  It seems appropriate that the position in Dublin should be the same as in other county boroughs, and that the necessary provision should be made in time for this year's local elections.  What is now proposed is similar to the provision made in section 87 of the Electoral Act, 1963, in relation to the other county boroughs.</P>
    <P>The second amendment to the 1945 Act is that provided for in paragraph (b) of section 1, that is, the deletion of subsection (5) of section 3 of the 1945 Act.  That subsection reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) In assigning by an order under this section the numbers of members to be elected for the electoral areas specified in the order, the Minister shall have regard to the populations and rateable valuations of such areas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill gives an example of the kind of distortion caused by making valuation a factor in arranging electoral areas.  I should say that I am aware of the case that can be made for giving some weighting to valuation and I am prepared to concede that it can seem plausible enough.  However, I am firmly of the opinion that the principle of &ldquo;one man-one vote&rdquo; should override all other considerations and that any provision which infringes on this principle, even indirectly, should go.</P>
    <P>The repeal of subsection (5) of section 3 of the 1945 Act will bring the position in Dublin into line with that obtaining in the other county boroughs, in that no express legal requirements will be laid down as to the factors to be taken into account in the division of the county borough into electoral areas.  It will, therefore, devolve on the Minister to devise the fairest possible division in the circumstances.  In the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil on what is now section 87 of the Electoral Act, 1963, some Deputies made the point that the making of a dividing order was a very extensive power but <Col N="1312" /> the House eventually accepted the section on the understanding that the Minister would introduce an amendment at Report Stage providing for the laying of dividing orders before each House.  So far as Dublin is concerned, such a provision already exists; subsection (8) of section 3 of the 1945 Act provides for the laying of an order before each House of the Oireachtas and for possible annulment by either House.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the electoral law are under consideration at present, and I hope to be able to introduce a Bill on electoral petitions and certain other matters in the next few months.  Meanwhile I would stress the need for urgent consideration of this present Bill if any dividing order in accordance with its terms is to be effective at the next local elections.  The urgency arises from the fact that the Register of Electors now being prepared, and which comes into force next April, must take account of the new electoral areas.  This leaves very little time for the making of the order and for the taking of certain preliminary steps by the corporation.  I would therefore urge a speedy passage of the Bill, if, as I confidently expect, its provisions commend themselves to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to make one or two comments.  This Bill has been brought in now&mdash;I shall not deal with the individual sections in it &mdash;in the month of February.  The local elections have been announced for June.  It is of vital importance that the order dividing the areas in Dublin should be published at the earliest possible opportunity so that it will be clearly understood that this is not going to be done until after the election.  I want the Minister, therefore, to tell the House clearly what will be the very last day by which he will table or publish the order making the new distribution. It would be grossly unfair if that were left until the very last minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic provisions of the Bill, designed to correct the inequities which exist so fas as representation is concerned, must be accepted by those of us on these <Col N="1313" /> benches.  As instanced in the explanatory memorandum, there are gross inequalities in the matter of representation. As the Minister has said, these spring from overdue emphasis being placed upon the need to consider rateable valuation when determining the basis of representation in the City Council.  It is to be hoped that in his next revision, which will flow from the passage of this Bill, the Minister will endeavour, so far as it is practicable, to ensure that there will be equality of representation throughout the entire city.  The principle he cited of &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo; is one which it should be hardly necessary for us in this enlightened age to advert to at all, but, by reason of what has happened here in the determination of the method in use up to now, particularly so far as representation on Dublin Corporation is concerned, that principle has been to a great extent negatived.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the provision in relation to the title of &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo;. There was a time, I suppose, when this title had some relevance.  It sounds as if it comes from the very early days of this city when it was thought desirable to distinguish, perhaps to honour, the more senior members of the council and the title &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo; was decided on.  It is not a good thing that we in what is said to be a democratic age should stick so closely to these titles which now have no meaning and which, indeed, engender a certain distaste amongst many of us.  In England and in Belfast, the title of &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo; has some meaning inasmuch as the lords mayor are chosen, and can only be chosen, from the aldermen.  That is not the position in Dublin.  It would not be right if it were.  Across the water and across the Border, the title is bestowed on members of the corporation only after they have been members for a number of years; it is related to seniority of membership, and the very name suggests it is conferred upon the elders in the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In years gone by there may have been something to be said for it, but I cannot rid my mind of the conviction that it was also related to property rights.  Property rights in the context <Col N="1314" /> of local representation and in the context of the manner in which they were dealt with in former times are not appropriate to be considered in matters relating to Dublin Corporation now.  Without any intention of delaying the passage of this Bill, I urge on the Minister that he should avail of this opportunity to abolish this title of &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo;.  It has no meaning.  It is a pretension.  If one considers it in the context of a title appropriate to someone who had served a number of years on the corporation, then it no longer applies in Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  I stood for Dublin Corporation and I became an Alderman, even though I had never been a member of it before.  I had no wish to be called &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo;.  I felt neither better nor worse for it.  It has always struck me as an anachronism. I am sure there were other members of the Council who had spent many more years in the service of the city who were more entitled to the honour, if honour it can be called.  Under the last Act passed, provision was made for this useless, meaningless, outdated and worthless title.  If it is thought desirable to get rid of it in Dublin, it may be argued that it would be better to wait and do it on a national scale all over the country.  If we wait for that, we shall be waiting a long time.</P>
    <P>I am not in love with the title of &ldquo;councillor&rdquo; either.  In fact, to be frank, I am not in love with any kind of title at all.  I am enraged by the sight of members of Dublin Corporation in their robes and I am sure the aesthetic sense of our people is often affronted by the vulgarity of this parade.  We all know how it originated. Why should we be inflicted with it for the rest of all time?  I would draw the attention of the members of the Corporation who are present here to a very sinister aspect of these robes. Aldermen are to be identified by a yellow streak on their robes, which suggests to me that the original promoter of the idea had a certain sense. of humour.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  I should think he was really laughing up his sleeve because I remember the same gentleman suggesting that we here in Dáil Éireann should wear Roman togas.  As if we are not bad enough? However, to return to my point, I would ask the Minister to think speedily of getting rid of this title because, as I have said, it has no meaning.  You could have somebody coming along at an election who never had any experience of corporation work, who never had any membership and never gave an hour's service to the city and he may become an alderman on the tide of popular acclaim. We have all seen the dangers of that. Not alone is the fall bad from the public point of view but it is also bad for the individual to whom it happens. The fall is all the worse when it occurs.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he could give us some idea as to when he could let us know about the redistribution, as to when he will make available to the House maps of the proposed new areas and if he could tell us what basis he proposes to use in the redistribution.  Does he intend to stick steadily to the allocation of a fixed number of votes to a fixed number of seats?  Does he intend to apply that principle to the whole city area?  It is essential that he do that and that it be done with the utmost alacrity. Already the political organisations have made selections for the forthcoming elections and a great deal of ground work has been done with a view to securing support in June.  A great deal of work may be wasted because these people concerned may be toiling in the wrong vineyards.  In fairness even to his own people he should let us know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather doubt it. Perhaps the Minister will tell us when he proposes to make the maps available? Does he intend to enlarge the corporation?  Does he think the idea of the enlargement of the corporation from the present 45 members has any merit?  It is a debatable point.  We are aware that there are cities of this size with much larger city councils and <Col N="1316" /> there may be something in it.  Is it reasonable to think that five elected representatives can successfully discharge the vast burdens placed on their shoulders in this demanding age? It may be said that if we all did our work there would be no problems but that is something on which everybody has his own particular point of view.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that other aspects of electoral law are under consideration and that he hopes to be able to introduce a Bill dealing with electoral petitions.  He should give some thought to the problem of the register as well. We have all had the experience of people coming to us in large numbers on election day and telling us that they should have a vote and that they have found, on going to the polling booth, they have not got one.  This is due to the inadequate system of compiling the register.  The Minister might consider the setting up of a Committee of the whole House to examine that aspect of the electoral law.</P>

If we take the basis of the No. 9 area, which has five members, and apply that principle to No. 1 area, we would need 25 councillors for No. 1 area.  This proposal is long overdue and one that should be dealt with quickly, and I hope it will not be held up by wondering whether we should call the members aldermen or councillors. If this is the intention, the Minister cannot give any date, and the only reason for holding the Bill would be to prevent him implementing the principle of one man&mdash;one vote.</P>

      <P>Cé go bhfuil Fine Gael i bhfábhar an Bhille seo, tá cúpla ceist agam le cur ar an Aire, mar tá faitíos orainn i dtaobh athrú nó dhó a chuir sé ós ár gcomhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> I would like to know by what prior enactment the Oireachtas repealed the Local Government (Dublin) Act of 1930.  The Minister did not mention by what enactment he did that, and as a matter of interest, I would like to know.  There are nine people now pretending to be Aldermen, and we would like to be sure that they are entitled to the yellow streak to which Deputy Dunne refers.  We in Fine Gael have on numerous occasions drawn attention to the uneven distribution in the present arrangement of electoral areas in Dublin, and I am glad that, even at this belated hour, the Minister is taking steps to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>There is no logic in maintaining a valuation qualification when we have done away with the property vote.  To maintain a property valuation is therefore to some extent a retention of the 40/- freehold.  Even if there was any justification for retention of the valuation qualification, it is a fact that the high valuations in the centre city area are not related to personnel and are not related to the electorate.  Most of the high valuations are related to premises in respect of which no vote is cast because the valuation is paid by non-voting legal entities such as limited companies and statutory bodies, so that the qualification in relation to valuation has no justification today.  It is difficult to see why it was even considered in 1945.  It is a pity it has taken so long to recognise this peculiar situation and to do something to rectify it.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Select Committee consisting of 17 members of whom five shall be a quorum, be appointed, with power to send for persons, papers and records: (a) to examine the capital expenditure of State Boards and Companies, and to consider the future capital programme and plans of such Boards and Companies; (b) to consider whether any <Col N="1318" /> changes are needed in the organisation of such bodies; (c) to consider whether there is proper and adequate liaison between such bodies and Government Departments, and private interests affected by their activity, and between the bodies themselves in matters of common interest; (d) whether the private citizen or other body obtains reasonable service from such semi-State bodies and in case of dissatisfaction has a reasonable means of securing redress from any such body; and (e) to make such report or reports embodying the recommendations of the members of such Select Committee as it thinks proper.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to State-sponsored bodies is one that has been causing some anxiety not merely to members of this House but to people outside the House, in the past few years. It is perhaps fair to say that the position of the State-sponsored bodies here, and their operation, is one that has grown up quite haphazardly over the years.  The first State-sponsored bodies were set up in 1927 when the Dairy Disposal Company was formed for the purpose of disposing of creameries in certain parts of the country.  It is still happily flourishing with those creameries not disposed of at all.  The Electricity Supply Board was formed in or about the same time and was restricted then to public utilities, in the strict sense of the word.  As the years wore on, the use of State-sponsored bodies &mdash; and I use the term &ldquo;body&rdquo; to cover both boards set up specifically under statutes and companies set up under the Companies Acts, or under statutes &mdash; became a matter for <i>ad hoc</i> considerations whenever a problem arose which it was desired to remove from Civil Service control.  In passing, I may say that when removing it from Civil Service control in one sense, it had at the same time, the effect of removing it from the control of this House and from effective public control of any sort.</P>
    <P>Some of these <i>ad hoc</i> bodies were set up in the early 1930s and then during the years of the Emergency, there was a variety of bodies set up purely to deal with emergency considerations <Col N="1319" /> of that time.  Many of those emergency bodies, have, of course, since ceased to operate and are not now in existence and therefore are not a matter for consideration at present. Following the ending of the Emergency and the ultimate wiping out of some of the bodies set up for emergency purposes, other bodies were set up again on an entirely <i>ad hoc</i> basis rather than according to any plan.  They were set up partly because there did not seem to be any particular reason why it could be hoped that private enterprise would fill a void in the economy and partly because the type of undertaking was such that it was felt at the time that some form of public enterprise was more appropriate.</P>
    <P>Down through the years there has been a suggestion that if something was done incompetently, the mere fact of transferring it to a new State-sponsored body meant that the work was going to be done in a competent fashion.  That was proved to be far from the case.  It does seem extraordinary that in this day and age there should exist a large sector of production in respect of which the public, through the taxpayer, is called upon to pay the piper and in that sector there is no effective control at all by those who should be exercising the attributes, if one likes to use that word, of a watchdog over it.</P>
    <P>The first analysis of State-sponsored bodies which I have been able to find was one made by Dr. John O'Donovan in the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland on 12th May, 1950.  He divided State-sponsored bodies into seven different sectors, agricultural companies, financial institutions, industrial undertakings, public utilities, transport organisations, emergency companies and other bodies.  As I said already, the emergency bodies have gone and therefore it is fair enough to take the State-sponsored bodies of the present under the six categories he has mentioned, with the addition, perhaps, of what one might call social welfare organisations, whether Arramara Teoranta &mdash; which although <Col N="1320" /> nominally a manufacturing company, is in fact a social welfare organisation for providing employment in Connemara&mdash;or companies for health purposes or the welfare of one sector or another of the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>After that analysis made by Dr. O'Donovan, a very striking statement was made by Mr. Mortished, speaking to that paper, in which he was most emphatic in his condemnation of the fact that there was not adequate control of these public bodies, and particularly that there was not adequate publicity given to the method in which the control which there might be would be operative.  Of course, I should add that Mr. Mortished had, perhaps, a jaundiced view, of this House in that he was not very partial to politicians for reasons which it is not very difficult to see.  In his statement on that occasion, he was rather hard on the politicians.  However, he did make it clear that in his view at the time, there was a very strong case for a permanent general supervisory body in relation to these State-sponsored bodies acting in much the same way and in the same spirit as the Committee of Public Accounts Acts.</P>
    <P>One comes to another paper also read at the Statistical and Social Society on 29th May, 1965, when Mr. Bristow made a most factual analysis, not merely of the terms of employment of State enterprises but also of the proportion of production in the State for which they were responsible. I noticed particularly that he came to the same conclusion as Senator Garret FitzGerald came to in his paper on State enterprise, that their payroll accounts for about ten per cent of total wages and salaries.  We are, therefore, to-night dealing with no small or insignificant sector of the economy when we are dealing with a sector which accounts for about ten per cent of total wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, State-sponsored bodies are of their very nature particularly capital intensive and, therefore, the amount of the gross fixed capital formation in any year by the State-sponsored bodies is very much <Col N="1321" /> greater than the ten per cent of their payroll and I think the general estimate is that it would account for about one-quarter of our fixed capital formation.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true to say that these State-sponsored bodies do have some supervision on them by Ministers and by the Departments under the various Ministers responsible for them, but they all work, regardless of what they are, in a jealously protected atmosphere of secrecy which does no one any good and certainly does not do any good to the people who work in them, much less to their public image.  The atmosphere of secrecy to which I refer is emphasised even in many of the replies which I have got today where the Ministers concerned have refused to answer questions in relation to the salary of the five chief executive officers in each institution.  Some of the Ministers concerned, in fact, have so little contact with these State-sponsored bodies for which they are responsible that they were not able to answer the questions, although, I am glad to say, the Minister for Finance, who would be responsible for more bodies than any other Minister was able to provide the information at once, in so far as he wished to provide it.  He, however, also took refuge again in the secrecy about payments that are made to executive officers.</P>
    <P>It is entirely wrong that in the case of boards such as Córas Tráchtála or Bord Fáilte, the status, if you like to use the word, and the remuneration of the employees in those boards should be published here in this House and that the Minister responsible would refuse to publish in the same way the same factual information about companies and other boards that have been formed.  It is that atmosphere of secrecy that has done a great deal to spoil the image of work that has been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts also from time to time has adverted to this matter and, as far as I can find, the last reference to it is that in the report that was made on 17th November last when the Committee stated, in paragraph 3:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> The Committee notes that its suggestion that an amendment of Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann should be made to enable it to review the accounts of State-sponsored bodies which receive subventions from voted moneys is being received in the light of the comments of the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I differ slightly from the Committee of Public Accounts in that respect in that I do not think it is necessarily the Committee of Public Accounts that is the best means of exercising the control in question, although I do without question subscribe to the view that a committee of some sort is required.  However, it is because we are open to conviction as to the best method of control that our motion was phrased in the way it is.  The motion is, as I say, for the purpose of ensuring that there would be a Committee of this House set up to ensure that a suitable form of control by the Oireachtas of these various State-sponsored bodies and boards would be considered.</P>
    <P>In fact, the proportion of the active population employed in this sector of the economy is not merely substantial of itself but substantial by comparison with other countries.  We provide more employment for our people through State-sponsored bodies than do Belgium and Denmark and very little under the figure for France, Sweden or Austria.  Admittedly, we have a smaller number employed here, in proportion, than they have in Britain, but even in Britain they have had two Select Committees to discuss this very problem and to make recommendations in relation to the problem of control, whereas we have not had one at all.</P>
    <P>In 1957, which is the last date I can get, the State-sponsored bodies absorbed, in Finland, Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, approximately between 22 and 25 per cent of gross fixed investment. The only countries in the EEC report where the amount was larger than here were Austria, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.  The best <Col N="1323" /> estimate that one can come to is that there are about 50,000 persons employed in Ireland in this sector of the community.  The amount that they have to take out of the national pool in relation to fixed capital formation is, as I say, somewhere in the region of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that I accept that in many of these State-sponsored bodies there are many dedicated public servants but these bodies have tended in recent years to provide a class of people who resent any type of constructive criticism of their endeavours.  Another way of putting it would be that some of them have got very much too big for their boots. A concrete example of that was the disgraceful performance by the Manager of Córas Iompair Éireann in relation to this House just before Christmas.  There is, unfortunately, a certain feeling growing up amongst them of &ldquo;scratch me and I will scratch you&rdquo;, and the personnel engaged in some of the companies are not in the same forthright class as those on the boards to which I have referred earlier and whose work is discussed and bound to be discussed more fully in this House.</P>
    <P>The type of audit carried out by the auditors of a commercial concern is entirely different from the type of audit carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to voted moneys.  The commercial audit is devoted entirely to ensuring that there is not fraud, that a proper financial picture is shown, and so does not in any way consider the legality, if I may use the word, or the appropriateness, of the expenditures that are concerned.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, on the other hand, does not concern himself with the commercial side of an audit, but he does concern himself very much and very properly with the underlying authority for the expenditure and with the appropriateness of that expenditure.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in relation to these State-sponsored bodies, one wants to get something that is halfway <Col N="1324" /> between the two.  The directors of the State-sponsored bodies are appointed by the Minister or the Government of the day.  The commercial auditors are appointed in exactly the same way and it would not be reasonable or proper to expect that the auditors in those circumstances would be reporting in a critical way of the directors who have appointed them, because though, in theory, the auditors of a company are appointed by the shareholders in fact, as the Minister only too well knows, it is the directors who make the appointment.  We have again and again, not merely in relation to auditors but today in relation to executive staff, had it clearly laid down that it is not the Minister's concern; it is the directors who make the appointment at issue.</P>
    <P>There has been evidence before the British House of Commons in their Select Committees that it was not reasonable to expect commercial auditors who are working with the directorate of the nationalised industries there to produce the same kind of reporting on appropriateness as would be done by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  However, when one turns to the problem that is here&mdash;and everybody must accept that there is a problem&mdash;and turns to what is being done in other countries, it is a most significant fact that we are very much behind in the steps we have taken, or rather, the steps we have failed to take.</P>
    <P>I suppose the oldest State enterprises in the world are those in France where the Manufacture Royale of Louis were responsible for the expansion of the Sévers porcelain factory and the Gobelin Tapestry, but in France they have faced up to this situation with the Court de Compte and they have therefore a position in which while there may be commercial auditors for the State industries, as there are here, there is also in relation to those a court of accounts in which it is the responsibility of that court to ensure that the State-sponsored bodies do not go beyond the powers that have been given to them.</P>
    <P>It always struck me as one of the most extraordinary things that I came <Col N="1325" /> across when I was Minister for Finance, that during the time of my predecessor, a company that had been set up by this House had, apparently with Ministerial approval, set up a subsidiary company of its own without coming back to the Dáil for the authority to do so.  It seemed to me grossly wrong that, when a Minister in any Government had come to the House and asked the House for authority to set up a particular company, be it CIE, be it the Irish Life Assurance Company or any other company, that company would then on its own and without coming back to the Dáil or to the Oireachtas, proceed to hive off certain of the responsibilities that had been put on it without proper Oireachtas authority.</P>
    <P>I agree that probably at the time when Irish Estates were set up by the Irish Life Assurance Company or when the hotel companies were set up by CIE, the Minister of the day was asked for and gave his approval.  However, whether he gave his approval or not, it seems to me a gross derogation of the powers of this House that the duties that have been given to a board in that manner should be delegated and hived off to a subsidiary company in the manner in which that was done in those two cases.</P>
    <P>These State-sponsored bodies, while they may be able to judge within the narrow concepts of their own business what is best in that business, cannot possibly have the same wide conception of the public interest as would be necessary for, shall we say, a Government Department.  Yet it takes the very rough handling of threatening to dismiss the directorate of one of those bodies before they can be brought back from a line that was entirely wrong, entirely outside their normal scope, to a line the Government of the day thought desirable.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that if the Minister for Finance were faced with the same problem as I was faced with of ensuring that the Horse Show, the Spring Show, would have adequate room to expand, he would have taken the same view as I took, that it did not matter what property development <Col N="1326" /> was going to take place in that area, the first essential from the point of view of our tourist trade ought to provide that the Horse Show, the Spring Show, would be able to expand and would be able to go on being the immense attractions they have proved to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I only mention it to show that it was entirely wrong for the body in question to hive off its responsibilities to a subsidiary company which was not in the same contact with my predecessor as the main company would be, and therefore that the situation had arisen out of something not visualised by this House when the parent company was set up.  I have no doubt whatever if the method of audit there had been not the commercial audit in the ordinary way, but the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General, or somebody of a similar nature, that difficulty would never have arisen.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has examined the only book published on this matter: &ldquo;The Accountability and Audit of Governments&rdquo; by E. L. Normanton, published by the Manchester University Press.  I understand I have an advantage over the Minister in this respect because I understand this is the only copy anywhere in any library in the country.  The Minister has it in his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will expect him to corroborate that there is in every country other than in Ireland some means of ensuring that State-sponsored bodies of this sort are made amenable to public control.  In France, where they have the oldest public industries of this sort in the world, they have got the Court of Accounts. In America they have a very clear method of providing control over Government corporations.  These corporations are audited by a body which is bound to produce its report, not merely to the Executive in the person <Col N="1327" /> of the President, but also to the Bureau of Budget, the General Accounting Office, to the appropriate Committee of Congress and to Congress itself.  Its working in relation to Government corporations in America over the years has clearly been proved to be an outstanding success.  In recent times America has not had the proliferation of new Government corporations springing up as it did in the 30s before the last World War.  Nevertheless, the number that are there, and the enormous extent of the subvention given by the Treasury to them, has made it absolutely essential to have this power of control given to the General Accounting Office, as it is called, and reports back by that body to Congress and to the relevant Committee of Congress.</P>
      <P>The position in Germany is that they have a similar audit by a public auditor, who is something halfway between our Comptroller and Auditor General and a commercial auditor.  He reports back to a court of audit rather like the French court in that respect. Every country has done something in relation to this problem except us. The British had two Select Committees on it.  While they considered a wealth of evidence, I do not think they came to conclusions that are entirely valid for us here.  But the very fact that even today answers are given to purely factual, statistical questions that they are matters for the corporations themselves and not matters for the Minister concerned is evidence that these bodies have gone out of control and that the sooner control is exercised, not merely by the Executive represented by the Minister but by this House, which has to provide the money and the wherewithal for them, the greater will be their efficiency and standing in the public eye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I think the House will agree from Deputy Sweetman's statement that this is a very difficult and complex subject and one that we cannot hope to cover completely in Dáil Éireann.  This difficulty and complexity is, in itself, a sign that Dáil <Col N="1328" /> Éireann is not the body to deal adequately with these State-sponsored concerns.  That is what really lies behind this motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman rightly paid tribute to the very many dedicated people in State-sponsored bodies who carry out to the best of their abilities, which in many cases are very great, the functions for which these bodies were set up.  These bodies range from the Milk Board to a transport company, taking in en route social welfare schemes and services.  There are a host of other types of bodies which I have not time to enumerate here.</P>
      <P>We in Dáil Éireann are trying to exercise some control over all these bodies.  I will take back that sentence and say we are pretending to exercise some control, but we are not exercising any effective control over them at all. The Minister refuses to answer questions which come within the ambit of day-to-day administration.  We might put it another way by saying he is not allowed by the rules of the House.  I am not blaming the Minister for that. Any Minister of any Party in power would find he would have to do that.</P>
      <P>I would like to take just one small and what may appear to be a trivial example of this&mdash;the CIE bus queues which we all know.  I have seen them stretched for a couple of hundred yards, people standing in the rain.  It is not a trivial matter for them.  We cannot raise that in the House.  After all, the whole purpose of a transport company, its reason for existence, the reason why this House takes an interest in it and pours money into it, is so that people will be transported from their homes or their businesses to wherever they may want to go, so that what appears to be a trivial day-to-day question is really an extremely fundamental one, not only politically, but from the point of view of the real reason for the existence of the particular body and also because we are not able to exercise that degree of control which all of us would like to see exercised without swamping this House with day-to-day matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we achieve our purpose? We can do it by setting up a Committee <Col N="1329" /> which will deal with that and go into the capital expenditure side of it. I hope the Minister will not say that the Public Accounts Committee is one that is set up by this House and can deal with this matter because, in my opinion and I think also in the opinion of Deputy Sweetman, the PAC is not a Committee which can deal with that. From my memory of that very excellent body and its work, its primary function is to see that Government Departments spend the money as Dáil Éireann told them to spend it and they must not spend more and should not spend less in many cases.  I do not think that the PAC can help Dáil Éireann in this matter.</P>
    <P>Other countries have apparently found that they have to set up new bodies to deal with what is a function of the 20th century in parliamentary life.  If we try to do it here, we shall swamp the House with a mass of complex matters with which we are not able to deal and it is quite inadvisable that we should try.</P>
    <P>There are so many facets of this question of State-sponsored bodies that I should like to take them one by one.  I cannot hope to get through them all.  I have mentioned the question of Dáil Éireann and its function in connection with them.  We may be told if the Minister is against this: &ldquo;You may bring it up in the Vote.&rdquo;  The Vote does not come often enough to deal with matters that need to be dealt with, day-to-day matters which in many cases are the reason for the existtence of the body.  We can only deal with them in a loose fashion.</P>
    <P>We then have the question of the bodies themselves.  They have an innate tendency, like all bodies set up by a parliament and allowed more or less to function on their own under a sort of loose control, to become <i>imperium in imperio</i>, a state within a state.  They think they are not answerable to anybody. That is an inevitable development, not necessarily of all these bodies, but they all certainly have a tendency to work in that direction. They would not become more liberal, more closely in touch with the people or even necessarily with democratic procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> One could say that is an inevitable development, almost a new Parkinson's law.  A further matter concerning these bodies is the inevitable power they develop because we cannot cope, and have not the time to cope, with all the matters with which they are concerned. We, in fact, are relinquishing our own powers and if we relinquish them in matters like that, these powers will be taken from us.  If we do not exercise them, we lose them either by precedent or by deliberate intent on the part of these bodies.</P>
    <P>In the 18th and 19th centuries, the legislative bodies of the world had a very great struggle in various countries with the royal prerogative and the parliamentary history of those periods is very largely an effort by parliaments to exercise control and establish power over the power of the monarchs and later, in the 19th century, to develop the skills that were necessary to see that the vast civil service which parliament had to create carried out the ever-increasing work of parliament and to ensure that those powers were not lost.  The history of those centuries is a splendid one from the point of view of the establishment of parliamentary power.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, we in the 20th century do not have any questions like that but we have the difficulty of dealing with bodies which we ourselves set up and we shall be failing to exercise the vigilance which a parliamentary body should exercise if we do not take steps to see that these bodies are watched over, helped on occasions and on other occasions reminded of their real function. That is why we in this Party have felt this is a question which should be aired widely and thought about.</P>
    <P>We believe a Select Committee of 17 members should be appointed to go into this question and report back to the House on how best to exercise the control which we know is not being exercised over these bodies.  That does not always mean &mdash; or mean at all&mdash;that those bodies are not carrying out their functions in a proper manner, but it sometimes does happen that they are not carrying them out in the way in which this House wished <Col N="1331" /> them to and still wishes them to carry them out.  For those and other reasons, I have great pleasure in seconding this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years, we in the Labour benches have been asking for some type of Committee to be set up for the purpose of having some control&mdash;not overall control&mdash; over the activities of semi-State bodies. We believe that many of them, indeed most of them, are doing an excellent job and, as previous speakers mentioned, that many of the key men in these bodies are dedicated men who are doing a good job and believe that they are doing it in the right way. We feel it is bound to happen that scattered throughout the very many people employed in the semi-State bodies will be the odd one who believes that given unbridled control, he can do anything he likes, whether or not it is in the public interest.</P>
      <P>Possibly the State feels that because the Government Minister in charge of the Department which is responsible for the particular semi-State body has the right to examine the audited accounts, that is sufficient control over the body.  We do not agree with that at all.  We believe that since these bodies can rightly be described as creatures of Parliament, set up by Parliament, financed in most cases by Parliament, it is ridiculous that they should have now reached the stage where they do not feel answerable to anyone.  As Deputy Sweetman said, it has become nearly a matter of form that a routine audit takes place, looking for fraud and things like that in the accounts, and if they are not present, there is no further interest in the affairs of the company.  The Minister naturally, being a very busy man, and his officials perhaps having more than enough to do, usually they just take a cursory glance and see that everything is above board in the board's report, not the accounts of the semi-State body, and the result is that everything in the garden is rosy so far as they are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again and again in this House, questions have been addressed to Ministers who are responsible for the Departments <Col N="1332" /> under whose aegis there are semi-State bodies.  When they are questioned, if the question is of such a nature that an easy reply can be given without embarrassing anyone, that reply is given.  If it is an embarrassing question to the Minister, to the Government, or indeed to a semi-State body, the Minister will say he has no function in the matter.  The Minister for Transport and Power is a typical example.  We have had this from him so often that it has nearly become his signature tune: &ldquo;The Minister has no function in the matter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Minister and Parliament should have a function in the matter.  We believe we not only have a right to investigate the question of profit and loss and not merely the question of the ordinary activities, but also that the questionable decisions taken by those boards from time to time should be subject to investigation by representatives of this House.  As Deputy Sweetman said in his opening statement, every civilised country in the world where semi-State bodies exist has some system of responsibility by the Parliament.  We seem to be out on our own in this matter.  We have our own peculiar system.  Why, I do not know.  Maybe it is because it is the easy way out.  We have decided just to carry on, get the audited report, let the Minister have a look at it, and everything is grand.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask what I mean by &ldquo;questionable decisions&rdquo;, in view of the fact that I said earlier that most of these bodies are run by dedicated men.  I would refer particularly to the decision taken by the ESB, of their own accord, to completely close down electric power in this country. The ESB may have considered that they had good reasons for doing this, but when we asked to have the matter fully investigated, we were told this would not be done.  That is a typical example of where administration by a semi-State body should be examined and the rights or wrongs of it finally proved.  As it is, there are two sides, and both are sticking to their own story.  It appears as if the general public will never know who was right <Col N="1333" /> or who was wrong on that black Monday.</P>
    <P>We have quite a number of other instances.  For instance, there is the closing of the railways by CIE.  Surely there should have been some way in which this House could have investigated decisions to close railways: whether or not the decision taken was the right one; whether or not the system which was offered as an alternative after the closing of the railways was the right decision?  Syrely all those things should be subject to some scrutiny by a committee of this House.  There is also the amount of money that is being expended. There was a story that CIE were going to save so many millions of pounds by doing certain things. Many people feel that these millions were not saved and that in fact it is costing much more to do the job than it did originally.  Surely it should have been possible to put the evidence before some committee which would be able to investigate it and pass judgment on it?</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, most of these bodies are doing a pretty good job. How are the top executives paid? What are their conditions of employment? Since the Taoiseach, Ministers, Members of this House and the other House, and the Civil Service must have their salary-souls bared in front of the general public, why should it not be possible to have the same information supplied about those who are attached to the semi-State bodies. Maybe they are not being paid nearly as much as they are entitled to.  Maybe the evidence would prove that they are paid a lot more than many of us would think they should be paid. Those are matters which should be subject to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>We have the situation where certain conditions of employment are being negotiated.  We have had over the years a number of transport strikes.  We have been told that the reason these transport strikes took place was that, according to the Minister, the unions representing the workers were unreasonable.  On the other hand, the workers are prepared to say that it was because <Col N="1334" /> of the unreasonable approach by CIE: on one occasion, on two occasions, on three occasions, a very junior member of the staff was sent to negotiate on wages and conditions of employment, instead of a top man who could take a decision, and it was this that caused the dispute.  Now we can never have these things investigated because, according to the Minister, he has no function and there is, therefore, no one in this House who can have a complaint of that kind investigated.  It is because of that this motion has been tabled by the Fine Gael Party: they want the right to set up a committee to investigate.  They have done a public service in putting down this motion.  I hoped that, when the proposer and seconder had finished speaking, the Minister would get up and put his point of view.  Apparently, he has decided he will wait a little longer.</P>

      <P>I hope it will not be that the Minister has no function in the matter.  Perhaps I have got the wrong Minister.  It appears a simple thing for this House to set up a Committee to investigate the matters to which I have referred, a Committee to find out if the very substantial sums being expended on some semi-State bodies are being spent in the right way, a Committee to find out if there are in fact&mdash;this is something which is not directly referred to in the motion&mdash;many other semi-State bodies which could be set up and could do a darn good job, after full investigation and examination by a Committee of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that the setting up of a company within a company, which was done on a couple of occasions here without the authority of this Dáil, was illegal.  However, the companies concerned got the Minister's sanction, and got away with it.  One of them seems to have done quite well. <Col N="1335" /> With regard to the other, both the Minister and the Government would, I suppose, be much happier if everybody would forget all about it, but it is not likely to be forgotten too quickly.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of thing which should be the subject of consideration by a Committee such as that suggested in the motion.  There is no use in the Minister getting up, as I presume he will and saying that what we suggest is that the day-to-day operations of these companies should be interfered with by this House, that we should not attempt such interference, and that such interference would, in fact, only cause a great deal more confusion than has already been caused.  As far as we are concerned in the Labour Party&mdash; Fine Gael have made themselves pretty clear&mdash;our point of view is simply that this Committee should be set up to do exactly what I have said it should do. If the Minister has given this matter the consideration he should have given it&mdash; it has been long enough on the Order Paper&mdash;I feel he will have very little hesitation in agreeing that this Committee should be set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Transport and Power is not <Col N="1336" /> here because he is the person who most irritates members of this House by his insistence that he will not provide information about State-sponsored companies, information which both sides properly feel should be available to them.  His answer is invariably &ldquo;No&rdquo;; he refuses to give the information, and that is that.  Because of that attitude has come the need for the Committee now proposed.  Any company operating in the commercial sphere needs direction and this direction must have a certain discipline imposed upon it, either the discipline of looking after its own money, if it is money invested by the directors, or being responsible for the money invested by the shareholders who have appointed certain persons to act as directors.  That is the whip across the back of the director of the ordinary company and in 99 cases out of 100, he freely accepts his responsibility.</P>
      <P>In the case of a State-sponsored company, there is a different situation, due in particular to the attitude of certain Ministers, such as the Minister for Transport and Power.  A situation has developed in which the Government want every State-sponsored company to succeed, while, at the same time, giving the public no information of any kind as to the intricate operations of the company.  Naturally enough, that breeds suspicion and, equally naturally, breeds the demand by the Opposition for more information. There is, too, the other point that, when the executives of any company realise that the directors, irrespective of profit or loss, are determined that the company shall succeed, then their attitude as executives is conditioned by that situation.  They have a different attitude altogether from the executive in the ordinary company who is responsible to the directors and who must always bear in mind that his actions and decisions decide either profit or loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give an instance of what I mean.  If you are a clerk in an office in CIE and if you reach a certain point at which you have seven other clerks under your control, then your salary, your pension rights, your whole mode of living, are spectacularly changed. <Col N="1337" /> Whether or not the operation was a profit-making one would not enter into your thoughts.  Let me give another example.  Socially I met an official of the ESB and I put a hypothetical question to him: &ldquo;Is it right or is it wrong that the ESB should sell appliances against the ordinary trader down the street, who is paying rent, rates and taxes, while you are not bound to make a profit; you are merely bound by the instructions of the Minister?&rdquo;  Very honestly that man answered: &ldquo;The position is that there are now 800 people involved directly or indirectly in the sale of appliances and every one of those wants to have his future looked after, wants to see expansion, wants to have his ambition realised.  You cannot sack him and, secondly, you cannot depress that ambition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that in that way one builds for oneself a colossus&mdash;I am not saying whether it is right or wrong&mdash; which wants to expand, irrespective of the result, irrespective of whether the result spells more loss or more profit. In the particular instance I am giving, it would probably be more profit because the ESB can switch off the current if the instalments are not paid. Because of their wonderful collection system, the operation is a complete insurance against loss, but the operation is not a profit operation.  I give it as an example to show that executives in a company are not necessarily bound in the proper way by the directors; directors normally have their responsibility either to themselves from the point of view of profit or to their shareholders since they are put there by the majority of the shareholders to look after their interests.</P>
    <P>What is the corollary here?  I want to suggest that if we here, by the collection of national loans, or the guarantee of loans to the ESB, or the passing of money to CIE, invest the people's money and underwrite the payment of that money through the collection of taxation, then the responsibility rests on the Members of this House and on them alone to see that these companies are properly carried on.  There is another responsibility as well.  If we make capital investments in State-sponsored <Col N="1338" /> bodies, then we must see that the people who subsidise them through us are not being adversely dealt with by the State-sponsored bodies and that they do not interfere in the people's private affairs.</P>
    <P>Once this thing starts, you have started the growth of a colossus which you cannot stop because you have involved all the people in that State-sponsored body in activities which may or may not be right.  The Members of this House have the responsibility to the ordinary voter and taxpayer who elected them to see that the people's money is properly dealt with and they have the responsibility to the ordinary citizen to see that he is not interfered with by the actions of a State-sponsored body.  There have been instances where Members of this House have objected to practices of State-sponsored companies. For instance, there is the practice of not charging up interest on capital and also the practice of producing an operating surplus.  This means that the taxpayers are paying for a movement of capital into that State-sponsored body and that there is no repayment from the State company itself.</P>
    <P>That might be justifiable if the company concerned were providing a social service.  If it could be proved, for instance, that CIE provides a social service in seeing that part of the country is not cut off from the rest of the country in regard to transport, that would be an instance where the proposed Committee could decide that CIE was providing a proper social service. There are other instances in which this provision of social services is questionable.</P>
    <P>I have here some figures from the accounts of a State-sponsored company and again there is an omission of the amount of interest.  Because the terms of the loan and the terms of repayment have not been decided, they blandly put into the accounts that no figure has been provided for interest payments. The difference in the accounts of this company if the calculation of interest on capital were made at seven per cent, which is a reasonable figure, would be £420,000.  I would prefer not to go into <Col N="1339" /> the absolute details because this is a young company, and we all wish it success, but it is an instance where a State-sponsored company has decided not to include a figure for interest in its accounts and this fact completely distorts the information given to the public.  It is only when one sits down and spends a lot of time in doing homework that one sees these difficulties and anomalies.  I am sure that if a Select Committee sat down and discussed this matter, they would make a recommendation to include a figure for interest which is what every commercial company faced with such a situation would do.</P>
    <P>If any such manna from heaven happened in the case of an ordinary commercial company, the accountants of that company would insist on including a figure for interest or on putting a footnote to the accounts giving the position as it was and indicating a probable interest rate.  These are matters in connection with State-sponsored bodies to which there has been objection since I have been in this House, that is, since 1954.  These objections have never been answered.  Minister after Minister has said that this is a function of the State-sponsored company and no more about it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the money involved in our State-sponsored bodies was much less, there might have been some justification for not going too deeply into the matter.  Now all these companies, the ESB, Aer Lingus and the Sugar Company should grow.  Bord na Móna should grow if they build the briquette factories that we suggest.  It is in that situation that we suggest that an examination into the operation of these bodies on behalf of the people should be made by the parliamentarians of this House.</P>
    <P>I agree that when that is done the Cabinet table is the place where decisions must be made in relation to capital investment and to the provision of further capital, if necessary. The situation is that while that power must rest with the Cabinet, there is need for the minute and detailed examination suggested by this motion.  Deputy Sweetman ended his <Col N="1340" /> speech by saying that the standing of these companies would be considerably improved, if it were possibled to have this examination.  I could not agree more with Deputy Sweetman. The attitude of many people is that these are State-sponsored bodies and that they can do what they like.  This attitude may or may not be correct but it would be far better if a Committee of the House could examine the situation and see how private interests are affected by the activities of these companies, to examine, if the practice has been to produce an operating surplus, in order to find the real position and see what is the interest due to the plain people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Such a Committee might say, if any of these companies was producing a real surplus, that some of the money should be repaid to the people and the Government could decide, if there was a request for further money for expansion, whether that money would be properly employed to provide employment for our people and to produce goods for export.  I want to advert to the fact that in many instances proper figures for depreciation are not being charged.  This is a well-known fact.  It means that these people, apparently, when sending a set of accounts to the Government are not bound by the stricture by which the ordinary chartered accountant is bound.  He knows that when his name goes at the bottom of the accounts and the accounts go to the Revenue Commissioners for examination, he must stand over the figure he certifies.</P>
    <P>The practice has largely been not to charge proper depreciation.  There has been a loose view about this, to the effect that it is all in the one cake, that if they declare a higher profit and have to pay income tax, it goes back into the kitty and it could not matter less.  This means that the executives of this State-sponsored company can retain profits for future use within the company, a decision which should be a decision of the Cabinet, of this House and of the people&mdash;whether or not the money <Col N="1341" /> they invested and which has now earned a profit should come back to them in the shape of repayment, or as an interest factor, or should in fact be left with the company.</P>
    <P>I support this motion in every way I can and I believe, as Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dockrell have said, that if this is done, we will have a much better situation in relation to State-sponsored companies and far more respect for them.  Within that framework, it will be far easier for them to expand with the goodwill of this House which, at the moment I am sorry to say, some of them have not.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Tully mentioned earlier, we are supporting the general terms of the motion, but at the same time it would be wrong to create the impression that we support some of the views expressed by Deputy Donegan, particularly in relation to the question of the private sector.  First of all, we have to examine either in this House, or possibly in Committee, if the motion is passed, why State-sponsored bodies were established and why they continue.  Do we not know that a number of them, including CIE, were established because private enterprise failed miserably to do the job for the community, and even with all the encouragement given to private enterprise for years, it still fails to do the job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from Deputy Donegan that we might approach this question from the point of view that in relation to essential services&mdash;and a number of these State enterprises do represent essential services, whether we like it or not&mdash;if private enterprise does not make possible the growth of the community, then and then only should the State step in to take over an enterprise that is unprofitable.  If this is the view of State enterprise, there is no problem whatever.  Let private enterprise then continue as it has been for many years, getting whatever fat is going and leaving the essential services for the community, including services like the ESB, CIE, and the air services.  If they cannot make a profit, leave the State to carry the purse and leave the taxpayer <Col N="1342" /> to bear the cost.  While we are supporting the motion, it may be that we are diametrically opposed to part of the contribution made by Deputy Donegan.  However, we have long held the view that there should be a greater degree of accountability to this House, and through this House to the community, by State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Year after year Deputies from the Labour benches and from the Fine Gael benches and, on occasion, from the Fianna Fáil benches, have complained not just about details of administration but about major decisions of State-sponsored bodies which it was not possible for the House to examine or discuss on the basis of their representative capacity.  Much has been said about the attitude of the ESB in the past year.  We have not yet got any satisfactory information in this House about the attitude of the Board on that occasion.  The same applies to the attitude of the Board of CIE not in relation to dealing with individual workers but in relation to their approach to major industrial relations.  When challenged about such things, the Minister concerned has been able to say that he has no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the attitude of a Board, established by the Minister, in relation to every major application for wage or salary increases which goes through an automatic process of failure to negotiate, followed by conciliation and arbitration, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; at the end. The same applies to the position of thousands of citizens who are affected by decisions to withdraw services.  We have, too, the position of RTE where some months ago the position was reversed.  A body which was supposed to control its own policy and make its own decisions was interfered with. This is a difficulty which can only be overcome by an investigation and a decision that there must be some form of accountability to the community's elected representatives.  Nobody in this House who has any sense of responsibility wants to impede State-sponsored bodies if they are doing a good job of work for the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before the debate was adjourned, we in Fine Gael are in favour of having a rearrangement of the electoral areas for the Dublin Corporation in Dublin if the purpose of the rearrangement is to bring about a situation in which there is equality in the number of electors in the various electoral areas.  We do, however, have a certain amount of fear regarding the blank powers which the Minister is seeking.  We do not think it is any defence to say that the Minister already has immense, uncurtailed powers in relation to fixing electoral areas in other parts of the country, particularly in the boroughs of Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  We think the kind of legislation which the bureaucrat is anxious to get from this House is something that this House should be reluctant to give, that is, legislation which gives Ministers complete power to arrange things to their own satisfaction, because a situation invariably arises then that this House is, in fact, not making the law; all this House is doing is permitting other people to make the law.</P>
      <P>We do not think it is any adequate safeguard to provide, as the Minister is providing, that any Orders which he makes under this Bill must be laid on the Table of the House so that they may be rescinded, if this House so decides, within seven Dáil days of the Orders being put on the Table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making any specific allegation as to what the present Minister or the present Government may do when I say that it is wrong to give a power of that kind to a Minister because the Minister of the day could well gerrymander the electoral areas to his own Party advantage and there would be no prospect of upsetting the gerrymandering arrangement as long as the Minister had a majority in the House and, clearly, he would not be Minister unless he had a majority in the House.  Therefore, there is absolutely <Col N="1344" /> no protection whatever against gerrymandering in the powers the Minister already has in relation to some boroughs and is now seeking in relation to Dublin.  We think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Constitution has a safeguard in relation to this because in the Constitution it is specifically set out that there must be an equality in the ratio between population and Deputies and that this must as far as practicable&mdash; and that is the phrase used in the Constitution&mdash;apply. Some years ago we were told in this House that it was not practicable to have an equality in the ratio between Deputies and electors and as a result, it required only two-thirds the number of votes in the west of Ireland to elect a Deputy as it took along the eastern seaboard.  The people who decided that here in the first instance were the Dáil and because the Government of the day had a majority, they were able to force through the Electoral Act of 1959 which had a gross inequality of electors or of population to Deputies.  It required to be challenged in the courts and it was challenged in the courts, and the courts held that this Oireachtas had not arranged the constituencies in such a way as to secure as far as practicable an equality between the population and the Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that that protection should be there because not only must we have a scheme which respects the principle of one man, one vote but we must also have a system which ensures that it is one man, one vote and to every man an equal vote and that when the people of Dublin are going to elect their councillors to represent them on Dublin Corporation, every person ought to go in the knowledge that his vote has exactly the same influence, has the same power and the same effect as the vote of anybody else. That cannot be done unless we respect the equality which ought to exist between the number of electors in the various electoral areas.</P>
    <P>On figures which I got in reply to Dáil Question No. 24 today, we discover that the number of electors for the Dublin Corporation on the current <Col N="1345" /> 1966-67 register is 321, 363.  This, divided between the nine electoral areas which we have at the present time, would give an average of 35,707 per area.  We find that under the present system which the Minister is quite rightly seeking to amend because we have inequality, we have three constituencies where the number of electors far exceeds that figure and we have six constituencies in which the number of electors is under that figure.  One of them, I suppose, can be regarded as being fair and as near as practicable to what should be the average, that is, the No. 3 area, which has 35,117, only 500 under the average of 35,707.  The No. 1 area, to which the Minister makes reference in his explanatory memorandum, has 21,200 over the average of 35,707 which ought to apply.  In the No. 5 area, which covers Ballyfermot and Drimnagh, there are 4,300 over the average and in the No. 7 area, which covers Crumlin, Kimmage, Rathfarnham and churchtown, there are 9,500 over the average.</P>
    <P>The effect of that is that these people are to some extent disfranchised. They have less political power. They have less say in determining the complexion of Dublin Corporation than have people in any electoral area where the number of electors is less than what ought to be the average.</P>
    <P>Again taking the constituencies which have fewer than what ought to be the average, you have at the top, again the area to which the Minister makes reference in his explanatory memorandum, the No. 9 area, which is primarily the South City area and also taking in part of the centre of the city just north of the Liffey.  We find that they have 20,306 under the average of 35,000 and other areas, the No. 2 area, 5,200 under the average; No. 4 area, 3,300; No. 6 area, 2,900; No. 8 area, 3,700 under the average of what ought to apply.</P>
    <P>This has clearly created a situation in which there is no equality of electoral power in Dublin and, therefore, we welcome a change of heart on the <Col N="1346" /> part of the Minister but we do say that this is the wrong time to bring in this reform.  Again and again, the Minister&mdash;not this Minister but his predecessors, his colleagues in the present Government&mdash;were asked by ourselves on the Fine Gael side of the House to take the steps necessary to bring about an equality of electoral strength.  We regret that this was not done long ago. However, it is now about to be done but we have not yet got from the Minister, and we think it is the least we should have got in his opening statement, any indication as to when he proposes to make the amending orders. We are now, according to the information we got from the Minister last week, scarcely four months away from the next local elections which will be held in June and even with the best of goodwill and speed in this House and in the Seanad, this Bill will not become an Act for some time and after that the Minister will have to make the necessary orders.  It is treating the electorate with very scant consideration and treating would-be councillors with no consideration to be bringing in a measure of this kind right on the eve of an election.  The time to bring in amending legislation of this kind was after the 1960 local elections and certainly long before the period at which the outgoing council ought to have terminated, and that was away back in 1960.</P>

      <P>No. I would prefer to see the amendment brought into operation as soon as possible, but it is only proper that we should protest that it was not done sooner and that we should protest that it should be done right on the eve of the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think it is rather ironic, too, that the existing City Council were not consulted about the matter. Indeed I made inquiries in the City Hall this week and it seems that there has been no notification whatever from the Department of Local Government to those responsible for the compilation of the register about the new electoral boundaries.  That is a <Col N="1347" /> very casual way to treat the people responsible for the compilation and the making up of the register.</P>
    <P>It is rather ironic that the City Council are consulted sometimes at great length in relation to matters over which they have no control and they are not consulted in a matter of this kind over which, admittedly, they have no control but of which they have considerable knowledge. Take, for instance, the long debate in relation to the Minister's demand that rents be increased.  The City Council have no power whatever in relation to that matter and one wonders why they were consulted at all.  The explanation is probably that by having these consultations and by having discussion on it amongst the councillors, an effort was made to create a facade of democracy; the impression was created, and deliberately created, that the council had some say in the determination of rents.</P>
    <P>As I say, there was no legal necessity for consulting them.  There was no practical benefit which could flow from consulting them, because the Minister and the Manager are a law unto themselves in this regard.  The exercise was indulged in to create a facade of democracy and to try to put the blame on people who are completely innocent.  However, here where one could reasonably have expected the Department of Local Government to consult the council, no effort whatever was made to consult them.  Even members of the Minister's party were quite surprised to receive information recently that this change was to be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>I share with others who have spoken here today regarding the office of alderman the feeling that it is an anachronism.  As far as I know&mdash;if I am wrong, I should like the Minister to correct me&mdash;an alderman has no power that a councillor has not got. They have exactly equal powers.  In Belfast, the title of alderman is conferred on the senior member in an electoral area, that is to say, the member who has been longest serving on the council, but that does not apply <Col N="1348" /> here.  Here an alderman is a person who has been at the top of the poll, the first elected.  Why we should bother to continue this anachronism into the second half of the twentieth century, I do not know.  It reminds me of the two systems of legal punishment which still exist, although in practice there is absolutely no difference between them. One is a system of ordinary imprisonment and the other, a system of penal servitude.  People have the idea that penal servitude is a system of punishment which imposes much greater pain and suffering than what can be imposed through ordinary imprisonment. In practice, there is no difference between them.  Likewise in relation to office, powers and privileges, there is no distinction between an alderman and a councillor except that one gets the title of alderman and is entitled to wear a piece of gold braid at the end of the municipal garment.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to explain another piece of anachronistic legal verbiage.  When deeds are sealed, they are reported to be sealed in the name of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the City of Dublin. The poor councillor as such gets no mention at all.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it does appear in the title.  However, I am sure all our Lord Mayors have been &ldquo;right honourable&rdquo; and Ministers would not query their right to be so described. I should like the Minister to explain more about the power he is seeking in the Bill to determine the number of aldermen.  At the moment we have nine because we have nine electoral <Col N="1349" /> areas, but as I understand the law&mdash; I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;there is no restriction on the number of electoral areas which may appear, short of the necessity to have not fewer than five.  Once he has five areas, he can have any number of other areas.  I am not sure whether he is under an obligation to apply proportional representation which would require a minimum of three seats, but he probably is.  Am I right in thinking the Minister would be free, if he wished, to have 15 areas with three councillors apiece or he could break it up any way he wished, so long as the total amounted to 45?</P>
      <P>I would hope the Minister would agree to an amendment which would indicate that Oireachtas Éireann wanted the equality of voters to be preserved and wanted him to have regard in the preparation of electoral areas to the principle that there should be not only one man, one vote but equality of voting power as well.  I expect that is the Minister's intention, but that is not good enough.  If the Minister wants to do otherwise, if he wants to gerrymander, he can do it under the Bill which he is asking this House to approve.</P>
      <P>I would earnestly ask the Members of the Dáil and particularly those on the City Council, not to give any Minister this power, which is undesirable. This House should ensure that the rights of individuals are protected and the only way in which we can do that is to ensure that no legislation goes out from this House which gives the Minister freedom to do as he wishes.  It is much better to say: &ldquo;You may do as you wish as long as you respect the rights of individuals who should have an equal say in local government&rdquo;.  What we are doing here is saying: &ldquo;You can arrange it anyway you like and as long as you have a majority in the Dáil, then the Government can put it through&rdquo;.  That is not democracy. If the people of Limerick, Cork and Waterford have done it, there is no reason why the Dublin jackeens should do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to insist that the people <Col N="1350" /> of Dublin should have their rights preserved. It is only by doing that we will prevent the situation which has arisen whereby it takes four times as many people to elect a councillor out in Raheny and Killester as it does to elect a person to represent the people here in this area where the Dáil is situated.  It is only by writing in an obligation to have regard to equality of votes that we will ensure that that situation does not arise again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Fine Gael Party welcome the re-arrangement of seats in the city area.  I do not know what the Minister will do eventually but I should like to see 45 single seat areas.  This can be done even without touching the present system of voting.  At the moment there are nine areas and apart from No. 9 area, which has a very small electorate, all the areas have huge electorates and it is almost impossible for any alderman or councillor to represent the area as efficiently as he would like.  I have every confidence that the Minister will do a good job of re-arranging, but, whatever he does, he will be criticised for it by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan referred to possible gerrymandering.  But, if you examine local elections, you will find that very often political schools of thought are ignored by the voters, who are inclined to vote on the basis of personality rather than political affiliations.  Your next-door neighbour, even though opposed to you politically, may vote for you in a municipal election, while he may not do so in a general election. I think Deputy Ryan's fears on this point are groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne gave an exhibition of Jansenism and Calvinism.  Indeed, I can picture him when he becomes a city councillor, as he is likely to do, coming in like Cromwell, crying &ldquo;Away with this bauble&rdquo;, doing away with the Lord Mayor's chains, the councillors' hats and all the rest.  But will the council be any better for all his suggestions?  He has the socialist tendency of seeking equality in everything.  He suggests we should not have aldermen.  He would have our city councillors distinguished by numbers, while Big Brother looks <Col N="1351" /> down from the gallery.  Why does he not propose the abolition of the City Council itself?  It was founded by the Normans; there was an admixture of Saxons and at one time, believe it or not, an Irishman could not be a member of it.  But things have changed since then and today any resident of this city, irrespective of property rights and of whether he is wealthy or poor, is entitled to membership of the City Council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne disputes the right of the public to elect their aldermen.  If they pick somebody to be an alderman, why should we deprive them of that right?  I have heard members of the City Council say that the Lord Major should be elected by the public.  It is rather contradictory when you hear people say they will not trust the public to elect an alderman.  Perhaps it does not matter a lot whether those on the council are aldermen or councillors, but I believe we should maintain the alderman rank until such time as some intelligent argument for its abolition is put forward.  Those in public life do not always command the respect they deserve.  Those who give their time, day and night, in local authorities to serve their fellow-men without remuneration are certainly deserving of respect, and anything we can do to give them a bit of prestige we should do.  We should in this national Assembly record our thanks to the hundreds of men and women who have served on local councils for the past seven years and to those who are prepared to carry on.  Despite the fact that one Party has guillotined those over 50, I think we will get sufficient people, even over 50, to serve on the council.  In my Party it was always ability that counted, and not age.  I would ask the Minister to consider the suggestions I have made, because I think they would make for better government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke in this House some time ago about the need for change in the municipal electoral areas and I also spoke on that subject in the corporation.  I am glad the Minister <Col N="1352" /> has been convinced of that need, even if his predecessor was not.  The situation that has developed in Dublin since 1960 is completely ludicrous so far as the number of voters required to elect a councillor for an area is concerned. The Minister mentioned that in one area five councillors were elected by 15,000 electors while in another area&mdash;admittedly, an extreme case&mdash; five councillors had to go before a miniature Dáil electorate of 56,000 voters.</P>
      <P>In addition, I pointed out that the majority of the councillors on Dublin Corporation are not Members of this House.  Deputies may have problems, but at least they are paid allowances. By virtue of their activities as councillors, they may or may not enhance their prospects of being re-elected. But those who are not Members of this House and are in an area with 56,000 voters, a wide, spread-out area with ten or 15 parishes, residents' associations, tenants' associations and ratepayers' groups, find the problem a very difficult one indeed.  Most of them endeavour to meet their responsibilities to the best of their ability; but they must face not only the difficulty of getting around but very heavy out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has seen the need to make some changes.  I also pointed out that since 1960 the growth of housing, both public and private, on the perimeter of Dublin was making the problem even more difficult.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it will have the effect of re-arranging the boundaries.  The Minister has not made it clear at this point whether it is his intention to make this change by varying the boundaries of the existing nine municipal areas.  The Bill refers to the requirement to have not fewer than five municipal areas.  The Minister did not indicate whether he was thinking in terms of varying the actual number of areas at the same time as re-arranging the boundaries. This is a matter the Minister should give the House an opportunity of discussing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear I must disagree with Deputy Ryan, not on the principle that the <Col N="1353" /> House should be entitled to deal fully with the arrangement of the representation of these areas, but, because of the time factor involved, I should be inclined to take the risk that the Minister would not be too unfair in arranging the boundaries of the municipal areas.  If he does not act fairly and equitably, we shall have an opportunity of commenting&mdash;but only commenting &mdash; if the matter is brought before us.  At the same time, having regard to the present position of the House, I think the Minister could get away with his intention, even if some other machinery were to be devised for a prolonged examination and discussion of the proposal.  Having regard to the fact that the boundary divisions are well overdue and that he has announced that local elections will take place this year, and almost the exact date of them, it is, and I agree with the Minister, imperative that this matter should not be unduly delayed.</P>
    <P>I see no reason, however, to write into the Bill a provision for the position of alderman.  If that section is dropped by the Minister, he can still, if he only changes the existing boundaries, elect five councillors for each area.  The only difference would be that one of them would not be called an alderman.  With all due respect to my colleagues in the House, I say that as far as the corporation is concerned alderman means only somebody who is first elected.  Does a Deputy who is first elected get any particular title? He is just a Deputy the same as other Deputies in the area.  An alderman may be&mdash;I do not say any of them are&mdash;a person elected who does not bother to turn up to council meetings, who does not even know there is a committee meeting which he should attend, and yet he is distinguished in somebody's eyes as being in some way privileged as against the other four councillors in the area who try to work very hard for their constituents. attending regularly at committee and council meetings.  In the eves of people who do not know the situation, the alderman is distinct from a councillor.</P>
    <P>I suspect the main reason, as the Minister has said, is that this is in <Col N="1354" /> line with procedure in other parts of the country.  That is not necessarily a valid reason.  It might well mean there would be some added expenditure by the corporation in respect of stationery and perhaps legal documents that they have already ordered if the title of alderman were dropped. I think it is a pragmatic decision. They might have to rearrange some legal stationery and contracts if the term were dropped.  Apart from that, I see no merit in retaining a title that does not mean anything.  &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo; means something in Belfast, in London and other British cities because both the election and responsibilities of aldermen are different from those of the councillors.  &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo; did mean something in Dublin prior to the abolition of Dublin Corporation but when the corporation was restored, the term &ldquo;alderman&rdquo; failed to have any meaning.  Therefore, the Minister might be well advised to consider deleting this section.</P>
    <P>During the discussion, my colleague, Deputy Dunne, made some remarks regarding the robes of the corporation. I was a member of the corporation when these robes were introduced. I wore them as did many other people, distinguished members of the corporation. The main argument in favour of the robes was that on various formal occasions&mdash;there are not many to which the corporation are invited, mainly Easter Sunday, Christmas Masses and occasions possibly such as the death of a colleague&mdash;if the members of the Council turned out in robes, it would preserve an appearance of unity and also it did not matter how councillors were robed underneath. They might have a very fine lounge suit or morning dress, or just a jacket and trousers.</P>
    <P>On certain occasions it is a fact that we turned out in robes in greater numbers.  I have nothing against wearing uniforms, unlike, possibly, some Members of the House.  Lots of people wear uniforms: children going to school, boy scouts, university students and, indeed, I know only very few people who as a principle never wore uniform.  I have the honour to bear <Col N="1355" /> the name of two who did not wear uniform going to dances but they just did not believe in going to dances. Many people may make humorous remarks here about members of the City Council turning out in robes but the same people will trot out tonight or tomorrow night to the Gresham or some other place with stiff collars and black suits and they are just as much in uniform.  They are complying with a different convention.  People who do not want to wear robes in the corporation are not compelled to do so.  While my colleague, Deputy Dunne, is entitled to make the remarks he made, on behalf of the other members of the corporation who see no harm in wearing these robes, I want to make my position clear.  It does not matter if they wear dungarees. If you are an Irish dancer, you can wear the appropriate uniform without doing anyone a disservice, or lowering your own personal integrity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it necessary to make the comment.  You were not here, Sir, for the earlier discussion and I wanted to be clear on it.  The important thing about this Bill is the fact that it is now introduced.  The Minister did not indicate his general intentions in respect to varying the boundaries.  If the Bill goes through, he will have the power not only to amend the boundaries but to vary the number of areas.  I want to ask him what his general views are in relation to the question of changing the number of municipal areas.  There are nine at the moment, and under the Bill, he would have power to reduce this to five.  I would suggest that in relation to any such operation regard should be had to the position of members of future city councils who will not be members of this House, and who, as the law stands at present, do not receive one penny remuneration for their services, or one halfpenny remuneration to cover the expenses borne by them in carrying out their duties as members of the City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> This may be a difficult problem for the Minister.  As the law stands, we have municipal elections every five years, although we have now gone over that five years by two years.  I do not know whether the Minister will have regard to the growth in the various areas when he is dealing with this matter.  If we could be assured that the next municipal elections will be held five years after this one, the problem might not be too difficult, provided the areas are arranged on a reasonable and equitable basis.  In the past few years, parts of the city have grown very rapidly, and in other parts, the population has remained static or been reduced.  There has been a change in the situation as outlined by the Minister the other day.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it gives the Minister an opportunity of redressing the balance.  I want to ask him if he will indicate whether it is his intention to retain the nine municipal areas in making the boundary revisions provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill, but as one of the senior members of Dublin Corporation in this House I feel that perhaps I should add my voice to the voices of Deputies, councillors and others who are not councillors, who have already spoken.  We do not oppose this Bill. I suppose we welcome it.  It is probably necessary to alter the constituencies from time to time in pursuance of democratic and other usages.  When the Minister is considering any changes like this, I should like him to consider seriously giving representation to the business community.  That was always done in the past.  Some time in the 1930s, the commercial register as such ceased.  Because of the importance of business effort in Dublin, and in the whole country, I think it would be a good thing if a proportion of the membership of Dublin Corporation were specifically reserved for business representation.  As I say, that used to be done.  This would be an act of justice because a tremendous amount of money is levied on business people who have not any direct voice in the deliberations of the council as such.  It <Col N="1357" /> would also be of benefit to the corporation.</P>
      <P>Some references were made to aldermen.  I cannot find anything in the explanatory memorandum which gives any hint that the Minister is contemplating any change in connection with the appointment of aldermen. Personally, I do not think it matters very much.  As has been pointed out, aldermen fulfil no function as such. They do not take precedence in any particular way.  The only thing I can think of is that when the roll is called in Dublin Corporation, the name of the alderman in each area is called out first.  That delightful honour is about the only thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that most of them are not there. I do not think that is fair because they are no more likely to be there or not there than any other councillor.  They are neither better nor worse attenders than councillors, nor are they better or worse than councillors.  They are the same as councillors.  There is no specific difference.  I suppose it follows an old custom, and perhaps there is something to be said for keeping them on.  The day may come when it might be in the interests of the council to have a body of men who would speak for them.  I do not know that there is any particular purpose served.  I certainly do not want them done away with.  I am quite neutral in the matter.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the robes. One Deputy, who is not a member of Dublin Corporation at the moment, but who, I trust, will be at some future date, said an alderman had a yellow streak in him.  He was referring to the yellow flash on the present aldermanic robes.  The councillor's robes lack that band of gold.  That is the only difference between the two.  Some years ago the red robes, with the fur round the bottom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ermine is fur; I rather imagine it was rabbit.  Anyway, I think those robes were much more <Col N="1358" /> colourful, but they were done away with and our present robes were substituted. Deputy Larkin argued that the robes covered a multitude of sartorial sins.  In that respect, they are, I suppose, quite useful.  I know I found them very useful during what was euphemistically referred to as &ldquo;the emergency period&rdquo; when we were all short of fuel.  Attending church services in robes, in a cold cathedral, I was one up on the rest of the congregation because I had a coat and robes. They were very useful.</P>
      <P>To come back to the change in the robes some years ago, these are beautiful robes made out of Irish poplin. However, to my mind, they are academic robes and not municipal robes.  The change was made roughly 15 years ago and I think the idea was then that the old robes seemed too like the old judges' robes.  That is not so.  Perhaps there was a suspicion, too, that they were connected with a former Government in this country.</P>
      <P>I should like to put it on record that the red robes worn by members of Dublin Corporation&mdash;other municipal bodies in Ireland still continue to wear them&mdash;are the universal badge of aldermen or councillors all over Europe.  I believe the red robes derived from the red of imperial Rome, which was really called purple, but is considered to be red.  It was the symbol of authority and members of councils throughout the whole of Europe wore these robes to denote they were in a position of authority. That was the reason for the red robes. I have a sneaking regard for them because they go back to the beginnings of history in Europe.  They are the symbol of authority.  The next time a change is being made, consideration might be given to the red robes of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the changes proposed in this Bill, I hope there will be an equitable redistribution.  I should like to make one point in relation to the area I represent, Area No. 9.  This is almost entirely situated on the south side of the Liffey.  In one of the recent Acts, the area was given a certain little bite across the Liffey, bounded <Col N="1359" /> by Capel Street, the Quays, O'Connell Street and Henry Street.  I can assure the Minister that though that area comes into Area No. 9, it has absolutely nothing to do with it.  Most of the people living in the area are hardly aware of the fact that they are part of Area No. 9 and a great number of them, I think, do not turn out to vote because they do not know the councillors.  The councillors representing Area No. 9 are all South City councillors.  These people were accustomed to North City councillors.  In any re-alignment of that particular municipal area, the Minister should take note of the fact that the Liffey is a natural dividing line and mixing up the two representations is something the public do not understand.  The councillors themselves are really not in a position to represent adequately the area in question because over 90 per cent of their problems have relation to the south side.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will take note of what I have said with regard to Area No. 9 and also with regard to a commercial register for business people.</P>

      <P>A great deal of this discussion has centred round aldermen and criticism of the title &ldquo;alderman&rdquo;. It has been generally agreed the title is empty and meaningless.  As a Dublinman, though not a member of the Corporation, I feel that too many of the traditions of this city are being whittled away from the point of view of our titles or, from the point of view of our buildings, knocked down.  I agree with the previous speaker that there is no reason why, since this title is an empty one, we should not keep it. I went to our excellent Library here and consulted both the Oxford Dictionary and Webster Dictionary, in relation to the definition of &ldquo;alderman&rdquo;. &ldquo;Alderman&rdquo;, in the Oxford Dictionary, is defined as a man who occupies the position held in an earlier stage of society by the <i>ealdor</i>, patriaarch or chief of the clan.  It can be extended to mean the head of a guild. Then, of course, we have the aldress, the wife of the alderman, or the alderwoman. <Col N="1360" /> It is a pity, I think, that corporators called aldermen have to go back to their wives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the question of gerrymandering, the Minister has clearly enunciated the principle of one man, one vote, and I do not see how he can be accused on those grounds of attempting to gerrymander any of the electoral wards which he is setting up under the Bill.  I am sure that Deputy Ryan is full of political prejudice and I can understand his equation of the principle of one man, one vote with gerrymandering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay a special tribute to the members of Dublin Corporation and of Dublin County Council generally. They are voluntary workers and give their time free.  They are civicminded and public-minded men, and I agree with Deputy Larkin when he <Col N="1361" /> suggests that the Minister should look into the question of giving them an allowance for their out-of-pocket expenses. From my own experience, I am aware of one of my colleagues haveing to make eight telephone calls in the one day and at 4d. per call, that is 2/8d.  which he could ill afford.  There is also the question of correspondence with the Minister, with the Town Hall and with constituents.  These, and other out-of-pocket expenses, make up a considerable sum which the unpaid and civic-minded man has to pay up himself. I would ask the Minister to look into the general question of expenses for councillors.  I would also reiterate my disagreement with the philistinic attitude of those who would cast away the last vestiges of our Dublin traditions. Let us keep our aldermen.</P>

      <P>Certainly I share to a certain extent the high opinion that Deputy Ryan appears to have of the efficiency of the Fianna Fáil organisation but, efficient as it is, I am quite convinced from my own experience that it would not be able to supply me with the information on which to base an attempt to gerrymander the city of Dublin.  I do not think it possible for any organisation to say with certainty what way any section of the city will vote, whether it will be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  I would not be able to attempt any redistribution of electoral areas with the object of benefiting my own Party more than others, despite my knowledge of the effectiveness of our organisation.  It is only natural that Opposition Deputies would have an even higher opinion of the efficiency of our organisation than we have as they have been so accustomed to experiencing the effectiveness of that organisation at successive elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> Deputy Sweetman asked me when the order specifying the new electoral areas would be made.  I do not think it should take long to do that.  The division of Dublin into electoral areas on the principle of one man, one vote, taking into account the fact that the wards are already defined, must be a very simple operation which could not be done in many different ways and it should not take long to make the order.  I should hope, with the co-operation of the House and the Seanad, to be able to make the order and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of the present month.  In making that forecast, I am assuming that this Bill will be passed by the Dáil today and by the Seanad next Wednesday, 22nd February.  It could be signed by the President on 27th of the month and I would hope to be able to lay the order before the Houses of the Oireachtas immediately after that.  In giving the House that timetable, I am assuming that the Bill will be given a speedy passage.  If it were delayed here or in the Seanad, that timetable would also be delayed.</P>
    <P>A lot of the discussion dealt with the subject of aldermen.  As I explained in my opening speech, the position is that there is provision for the election of aldermen in all the boroughs except Dublin.  Because the Electoral Act of 1963 repealed a particular section of the Local Government Act of 1930, the provision for the election of aldermen in Dublin city no longer exists.  When the Bill came up, I was faced with the position of either providing for the election of aldermen in Dublin city or of ruling them out in Dublin, and Dublin only.</P>
    <P>I share the opinions of most of the Deputies with regard to this title of alderman.  It is only a title: it makes no sense and means nothing and it seems to me to be nonsense to have it.  However, if I were to decide formally to abolish the position in Dublin, it would have delayed the Bill by a month because the title appears in our legal documents and it appears in other statutes, and provision would have to be made for the removal of the title of alderman in all these other things.  Therefore I did not think it <Col N="1363" /> was worthwhile delaying the Bill for that.  Certainly I see no point in it myself, and as I mentioned in my opening speech, there is a more general amending Bill being drafted, and if it is decided that it is important enough to bother getting rid of it, we might as well do it in a more comprehensive way and get rid of it altogether.  Certainly I have no interest in the empty title of alderman.  That is why I would not be prepared to accept a proposal to drop this provision from this Bill because it would mean delaying the Bill and possibly make it impracticable to revise the electoral areas in time for the local elections.</P>
    <P>We had two views expressed about the wearing of robes, by Deputy Dunne, Deputy Larkin and Deputy Dockrell.  Personally, I incline to the views of Deputy Dunne but there again it does not arise on this Bill, and I suppose it is not a matter of any great importance, either.  Deputy Dunne asked if there was any intention of providing for a corporation with greater numbers.  There is no provision in this Bill for it and it would require legislation, but I do not see a great deal of point in the case Deputy Dunne made.  He maintained that a greater number of councillors would make for greater efficiency in representation, that each councillor would have a correspondingly smaller amount of work to do.  I cannot understand how that would come about as a result of doing this.  For instance, on the present basis of nine electoral areas, if they are revised so as to bring the representation into line, that would mean that each councillor would represent roughly one-ninth of the city's population, and even if you increased the number of councillors on that basis, the numbers of people each councillor would be representing would still be the same.  Increasing the number of councillors, therefore, would not have the effect which Deputy Dunne suggested it would have.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to the suggestion that there might be some gerrymandering in this, I stated quite clearly that the whole purpose of this Bill is to make it <Col N="1364" /> possible for me to equate as far as possible the number of electors per councillor.  I do not think that Deputies need have any fears in this regard. Recently there have been orders made in regard to a number of towns and cities.  For example, Cork has been divided into six areas and the average of population per member in those six areas is: 3,524, 3,560, 3,560, 3,668, 3,672, and 3,600.  In that case it is obvious that the representation has been arranged as equitably as it would be conceivably possible to do.  Similarly, Dún Laoghaire has recently been divided into three areas where the number of electors per member is 2,115, 2,203, 2,094.  I do not think that anybody could expect any greater degree of equality in representation than that. Therefore this power has not been abused in the past and I have already stated that the main purpose of the Bill is to enable the same thing to be done in Dublin.  The scope for different revisions of the city is small since the wards are already defined and therefore Deputies need have no fear in this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the fact that there has been no notification about the new boundaries to the corporation, who are at present engaged in the compilation of the register.  The position is that there could not possibly have been any such notification because under the law as it stands, any such revision would have to take into account both valuation and population and I do not intend to do that.  In this Bill, I am asking the House to give me authority not to have to take valuation into account. Therefore, they could not possibly have been notified and, in fact, cannot be notified until after the Bill has been passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also made a case that this revision should have taken place a considerable time ago, as near as possible to the last corporation election of 1960.  However, since 1960, the number of electors in No. 1 electoral area has increased by 50 per cent, so that if the revision had been made in 1960, it would already be out of date and developing areas would still be out of line with other areas.  The fact that this <Col N="1365" /> situation has developed so much since 1960, that the disparity in representation as between No. 1 and No. 9&mdash; which I think is the smallest&mdash;has developed so much since 1960, means that there is a stronger case for the Bill and it will be apparent to the House that this should be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin wanted to know if there was any intention of reducing the number of areas to five.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>From nine as they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have no such intention.  The idea of doing that did not occur to me and I would not see any point whatever in reducing the number of areas.  If I were to do anything like that, I would be more inclined to go in the other direction, which Deputy Larkin must have in mind when he suggested that I should take into account the difficulty experienced by councillors in covering the areas as they stand at present.  In this regard Deputy Dockrell referred to the fact that in the last revision of these electoral areas, No. 9 area was adjusted so as to take in portion of the city to the north of the Liffey.  Certainly the idea of recognising the Liffey as a boundary commends itself to me, but if we were to do that&mdash;and obviously if it were to have been done the last time&mdash;it would not be possible to continue with nine five-seat areas. That was probably the difficulty the last time.  I think my approach would be to try to adhere to ward boundaries and, in particular, to the boundary of the Liffey, but if I do that, obviously, there cannot be the same number of seats on the North and the South as 45 is the total.  So it will be necessary, if we do that, to depart from the present layout of nine five-seat constituencies, to some extent at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be completely opposed to a revival of the position that obtained formerly in Dublin of giving special representation to the business community or to any other section of the community by some adjustment of the register of electors as was the position here before.  The Joint Committee on <Col N="1366" /> Electoral Law considered this matter and, very rightly, rejected it.  The position previously in Dublin was that of the 35 council members, five were commercial members.  The registered commercial electors were individuals, partnerships, unincorporated associations or corporate bodies, resident in Saorstát Éireann.  In the case of companies, their business had to be wholly or substantially managed or conducted in Saorstát Éireann, occupying premises of valuation £20 or over for professional, commercial, or industrial purposes.  An elector had one vote for a valuation of up to £50, increasing by one vote, up to a maximum of six votes, for each £50 or fraction of £50 above this figure.  The 1930 register was prepared from claims by eligible electors and contained 1,048 names out of a possible 2,500 approximately, and they had the power to elect five of the 35 council members.</P>
    <P>It is with getting away from that type of representation that this Bill is primarily concerned and I certainly would be completely opposed to the suggestion of reviving it.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points that were raised and I would ask the House to pass the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would not be his intention to reduce the number of areas.  Might I comment? Any question of wards would be completely impossible because wards vary from wards with a population of 900 to wards with a population of 12,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, may I say in relation to what the Minister said on Second Stage, that the Minister has indicated the manner in which he has created electoral areas in Cork and Dún Laoghaire.  If he achieves a similar equality so far as Dublin is concerned, he will not find us opposed to any arrangement he may make.  I would have preferred to have the Committee Stage on another day in order to put down an amendment which would have imposed on the Minister the statutory obligation of preserving equality, but, in view of the Minister's undertaking, to bring about equality, so far as practicable, we are prepared to accept that he will do so and we can only await the result of his efforts.  I do believe he will have great difficulty if he tries to preserve the wards as we know them now because, as Deputy Larkin mentioned, there are wards with 12,000 and wards with 800. I imagine his problem in both Cork and Dún Laoghaire was eased by not having to keep to wards.  Ward boundaries in Dublin have little relationship to the existing distribution of population.  If it is necessary to get away from wards in order to have equality, it would be better to do so rather than tie oneself to boundaries which may have some interesting historical significance but are not helpful in distributing the number of voters equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of aldermen, I did notice that we had in the 1963 Act a provision which abolished the aldermen in Dublin as we knew them, but it occurs to me that if we did not postpone the local elections in 1965 and 1966, there would be no aldermen in Dublin unless an order like this had <Col N="1368" /> been brought in.  It does not seem to have occurred to anyone, certainly not to the holders, that their offices were in peril.  Perhaps they might consider that the postponement of the local elections was to their advantage.  Perhaps on the new council we will have two ranks&mdash;the aldermen and the younger men from Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given us an assurance that his intention is to retain the nine areas.  I mentioned the question of wards.  It should be possible for the Minister to make a reasonably equitable re-arrangement of the areas.  He has given us an assurance that that is his intention.  Possibly the whole question of wards will have to be looked into at some stage because they are no longer realistic.  If the Minister were to undertake to do it at this stage, the possibility is that due to the fact that wards are dealt with in all the documentation, inevitably the elections would be postponed and I would not press that matter except to say that with the nine areas it should be possible for the Minister at this stage to have at least fairly reasonable redistribution of the boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed with interest what the Minister said about the representation in the areas.  He agreed with me that it was desirable not to have the areas of the north of the city pushed into the south.  I have not had an opportunity to discuss it with my colleagues but I do not think there is anything sacrosanct in the nine electoral divisions.  I do not think it matters that much.  Once we are adopting as our criterion the population, we should follow that, irrespective of the present areas.  If we are going to look for so many thousand electors to elect so many persons, then, obviously, we will have to change boundaries very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings us to the position that certain areas might have to have more than five, some areas might have to have less than five.  We would be getting away from the principles which we follow in elections if we cut that down <Col N="1369" /> too much, but I would say to the Minister that there is not anything particularly sacrosanct in the nine electoral areas, each having an equality of numbers elected.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not see eye to eye with me on the commercial register.  I was not at all thinking in terms of going back to exactly the same system as was adopted in the past.  But I would commend this viewpoint to the Minister, namely, that the city of Dublin, any city, is composed both of citizens and of businesses. There is such a concentration of individuals in a city for purposes of business that it has been held in the past&mdash;sometimes perhaps too much&mdash;that the businesses were of such importance that they should at least be given a voice in the running of the area in which the businesses were placed, in the area to which they contributed such an enormous amount of the revenues that came in, and that under our present system we are enforcing on the business community a degree of taxation without representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to what Deputy Ryan says, I feel confident that when the new representation of the electoral areas is put on the Table of the House, Deputies will agree that every possible effort has been made to arrive at equality of representation in the different areas.  I agree that the idea of having nine electoral areas is not sacrosanct, and if we take the suggestion of Deputy Dockrell to take the Liffey as a boundary, that is, not to cross the Liffey with any electoral area, then obviously you cannot continue to have nine five-seat areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of votes on the two sides of the city north and south, is not exactly the same, which is just as well; since we have an odd number of councillors in Dublin Corporation.  I think it would be possible to adhere to the boundary of the Liffey and at the same time to achieve reasonably equal representation.  However, this will involve some departure <Col N="1370" /> from the present system of nine five-seat areas, but I have no intention of going to either extreme, of going for 15 three-seats or of going for five nine-seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there was less case for this Bill some years ago than there is now.  I have here the electorate figure for 1964, and that figure is not all that different from now.  The No. 1 area at that time was 56,000; I think it is now 59,000.  The number in the No. 9 area was 16,000 against 15,000.  There was a very good case to be made some years ago for bringing in this amending legislation. I hope it is better late than never, so we shall not resist it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps that is so, but the Minister knows that an effort is now being made to concentrate population in the centre of the city in new flats, so maybe it will be out of date soon enough.  One would hope that under this Bill when the Minister is taking unto himself liberal powers to determine the electoral areas, use will be made of the opportunity so that we shall not again have the situation to which I have referred. Therefore a year before the next following local elections a look should be had at the electoral areas to ensure that equality is maintained between the number of electors and the councillors.</P>

      <P>The Minister has met my point of view very fairly but not fully.  I had considered putting down an amendment to the Seanad amendment, with a view to eliminating the tying up between the definition <Col N="1373" /> of &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and the new category of persons now being allowed in under this definition of &ldquo;tenement&rdquo;. As I say, the Minister has met me fairly in the matter and possibly it is better to leave it in accordance with the Seanad amendment, which, as the Minister has explained, not merely takes in yearly tenants but balances matters by allowing lessees into the same position. It did seem to be rather unbalanced before, where a person who had what might be regarded as a minimal interest in the land as a tenant from year to year was placed in a more advantageous position than a person who held under a lease.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 5:</P>

    <P>In subsection (3) (i), page 5, line 5, &ldquo;(not being provisions enabling such rent to be altered once only and within five years from such commencement or upon the erection after such commencement of any buildings upon the land or upon the <Col N="1374" /> breach of a covenant, condition or agreement in the lease)&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;lease&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is mainly a drafting amendment but it was also designed to clarify that lessees will not be denied the right of purchase although the type of lease which the builder of the houses may have taken contains a rent review clause.  As the House knows, any lease with a variation clause in it from after X number of years is excluded from the terms of the Bill.  There are cases where a lease is entered into and the rent is not finally fixed until the house is built or until some specified time after the lease has been granted.  We want to make sure that that type of lease is not excluded from the right to purchase.  It is in ease of the tenant. There was a danger that that category might be excluded.</P>

      <P>Before section 4 the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who proposes to acquire the fee simple in land by virtue of this Act shall serve a notice in the prescribed form upon each of the following persons who can be found and ascertained, that is to say, the person who is for the time being entitled to the next superior interest in the land, every (if any) person who is, in relation to the land, the superior lessor of the person so proposing and every (if any) person who is the owner of an incumbrance thereon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This redraft of section 4 is designed to clarify doubts which had arisen as to the drafting of the original section. The only difference between the old section and the new section is that the new one envisages the possibility that some of the persons on whom notice must be served by a tenant who proposes to purchase his fee simple cannot be found.  Taken with the other consequential amendments, it enables the procedure to be completed in these circumstances.  The case was made that, if some of the people to be served could not be found, under the section as originally drafted the whole purchase process could be held up.  We are now making it quite clear that the procedure can be completed in that event.</P>

      <P>I have said this so often that I nearly bore myself saying it, but the difficulty is that when these things go into court for interpretation, the courts can only have regard to what is in the section we pass.  They cannot have regard to an expression of opinion, whether of the Minister, myself or any Deputy. For that reason, where an obligation is being imposed on anyone, whether an official or not or whether it is being made a duty of an applicant or a committee, for example in the case of a person of unsound mind, unless we write into the Act what should be done, there is the danger that the court afterwards interpreting the Act, comes to the conclusion that what it says is not, in fact, what was intended here.  I do not want to hold up matters; I do not want the Bill delayed. This is the kind of thing that perhaps the Minister's Department might look at in case it runs into any snags or difficulties which would require a speedy amending Bill.</P>

Particular objection was taken to the global nature of the phrase &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; and I have decided by this amendment to delete the words &ldquo;before an officer of the court or any other person&rdquo;.

      <P>The effect of amendment No. 22 is that the county registrar can refer an arbitration to another county registrar where he may have a personal interest.  It can happen that the county registrar could have a personal interest, and in that case he can depute the whole job to another county registrar.  In amendment No. 21 we are preventing any county registrar from deputing the job of examining a witness to another officer of the court or to any other person.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (4) a new subsection inserted as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" />&ldquo;( ) Whenever it appears to a county registrar for any county that he cannot properly deal with a matter falling to be determined by his arbitration under this Act by reason of the fact that he has a personal interest therein or such personal knowledge of the facts or of the parties as might prejudice his determination of the matter, he shall nominate the county registrar for an adjoining county to hear and determine the matter and, upon such nomination, the matter may be heard and determined accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a), page 11, lines 19 to 21, subparagraph (iv) deleted and the following subparagraphs substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) if the land is used for the purposes of business or exceeds one acre in area and is not used for the purposes of business, the area and nature of the land, its location and user and the state of repair of any buildings or structures thereon,</P>
      <P>( ) the price paid for the fee simple or any other interest in the land on a sale taking place on or after the 22nd day of May, 1964,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to insert two new matters into the list of things which must be taken into consideration by a county registrar in deciding the purchase price.  The first is a paragraph in substitution for one already in the section, and its effect would be to require the county registrar to take into consideration the nature of the land, its location and user, only where the land was used for the purposes of business, or where it exceeded an acre, in either of these cases, to consider also the area of the land.  The second paragraph requires the county registrar to have regard to the price which the landlord paid for the fee simple if he purchased it since the Ground Rents Commission reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> The first new matter arose as a result of a deputation to me from the Combined Residents Association in Dublin.  They wanted to exclude from this the ordinary type of residence so that if the county registrar proposed, as was envisaged, to inflate the compensation to be paid, which he might do if he took into consideration the nature of the land, its location and user, that should only apply to business premises or land in excess of one acre.  I think that is fair enough because it is only in the case of business premises that problems would arise in relation to the location and user of the land.  Where a person is merely buying his own home we should narrow the area of compensation for this purpose.  The Residents Association put this to me and I acceded to their view.  I think this is reasonable enough.  If any sale took place since the report of the Commission, the price paid for the fee simple or any other interest in the land on a sale taking place on or after 22nd May, 1964, that should be taken into account by the county registrar.</P>

The view was held that if a county registrar for one reason or another had regard to these other matters in determining the purchase price, it was only right and proper that he should have the responsibility of specifying the matters to which he had regard when making an assessment of the purchase price.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment with the two following amendments is to ensure that the section&mdash;which is designed to prevent landlords having conditions in leases requiring the lessees to insure the property either through them or with a specified company&mdash;will not be avoided by the device of the lessor putting the restriction due to an ancillary or collateral agreement.  Specific cases have come to my notice where landlords anticipating this amendment <Col N="1387" /> were getting over the intention in the section by making a direction to insure set out in a collateral arrangement.  We are making it quite plain in the amendment by prohibiting it in the case of ancillary or collateral agreements.  We think this should finally close this very undesirable procedure.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>Before section 33 the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subject to subsection (2) of this section, so much of any contract made after the commencement of this Act as provides that any provision of this Act shall not apply in relation to a person or that the application of any such provision shall be varied, modified or restricted in any way in relation to a person shall be void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in this Act shall prevent a person from giving or accepting, for the purpose of the acquisition of the fee simple or other interest in land under this Act, or <Col N="1393" /> the apportionment of a rent under this Act, a shorter title to a fee simple or any other interest in land than the title which a purchaser is, in the absence of special contract, entitled to require.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a fairly substantial amendment which was suggested in the Seanad and with which I agree.  Deputies will be aware that in Deasy's Act there are forfeiture provisions, which have existed since 1860, in regard to any tenant who, in breach of a covenant in his lease, carried out an assignment or sub-letting without the written consent of the landlord.  The amendment proposes to repeal there provisions and to extend to breaches of the covenants concerned the same relief against forfeiture as the Conveyancing Act, 1881, extends to breaches of any other covenants&mdash;that is simple damages.  Objections to these provisions in Deasy's Act have been of long standing.  They provide too drastic a penalty for a breach which could arise due to negligence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The professional bodies impressed on me that forfeiture was too onerous at this stage and has been the cause of trouble.  It was put to me in the Seanad that we should repeal sections 10 and 18 of Deasy's Act.  The forfeiture provisions contained in those sections now go by the board and any such assignment or sub-letting without consent now makes the tenant liable to damages for breach of covenant rather than forfeiture.  It is an entirely new section which was put strongly in the Seanad and by the professions.  It is not strictly relevant to the main ground rent provisions.</P>

      <P>When we reported progress, I was about to make some further observations on this section and to say I thought the section as it stood was reasonably good&mdash;that it more or less followed the same lines as local authorities take and that I should not like to see any amendment to the section that would lessen in any way the rights of the tenant.  There is nothing more disturbing for a tenant than to have his son, daughter, niece or nephew, move out and afterwards be unable to continue in occupation of the house that had become their home. I agree that the provision in this section should be fairly strict&mdash;that it should be positive the person has been genuinely living in the house.  Such persons should be able to fall into the tenancy.  Any small degree of uncertainty would give rise to a good deal of worry to members of a family who for many years, through grandfather to father to son, have resided in the house and formed a sentimental attachment to the house.  These provisions should be continued in this Bill so that relatives will not be exploited on the <Col N="1396" /> death of tenants or through any other happenings.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pattison's views are appreciated on this question.  When I spoke of the problem involved here, I was not referring to the successor who has genuinely and <i>bona fide</i> resided there. I do not know if the Minister can do anything about this matter in this Bill. It occurred to me that the kind of problem we are anxious to solve might be stopped if there were some time test, some period of residence.  I can visualise a situation where there is an elderly relative in occupation and likely to die.  Somebody might move in and cash in on the tenancy in that way. I fully appreciate the situation where there is a <i>bona fide</i> residence and where the tenancy is of importance to the family.</P>

    <P>This amendment is consequential on the enactment of the Housing Act, 1966.  Section 114 of that Act provides that in any contract entered into after the commencement of that section for the letting for habitation of a house at a rent not exceeding £130 per annum there shall, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, be implied a condition that the house is at the commencement of the tenancy in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation and an undertaking that the house will be so kept by the landlord during the tenancy.

      <P>Because in practice the repair of electricity, wiring of houses and things like that traditionally have been the obligations of the tenant.  The section seeks to set out what in practice happens.  In fact landlords have not got the obligation in regard to the maintenance of electricity in a house once the house has been linked up by the ESB.  It has always been the practice for the tenant to extend and maintain the wiring and fusing, to put in extra points and deal directly with the ESB. The landlord does not enter into it.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, people have been very reluctant to interfere with gas pipes.  In any case where trouble has started with gas, the usual thing has been for the tenant to leave it to the landlord or the gas company whereas in regard to electricity the norm has been that most tenants regard themselves as competent to put in fuses, extend the wiring or do whatever little job requires to be done to put the electrical apparatus right.  It has been represented to me that in practice in 99 per cent of cases the tenant has made himself responsible for dealing with electricity but has always been loth to deal with gas.</P>

The repair of electrical installations is in (c).  What I am doing by the amendment is excluding electricity from those implied covenants on the basis that in fact electrical repairs have been traditionally done over the years by the tenant.

      <P>Before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.  (1) Where an order under section 21 of the Principal Act stood in force immediately before the passing of this Act, it shall have effect as from such passing subject to the following modifications:</P>
      <P>(a)  for the amount specified therein as the basic rent of the dwelling in question there shall be substituted an amount equal to the lawful rent so specified less any amount so specified in respect of rates, and</P>
      <P>(b)  for the amount so specified in respect of lawful additions there shall be substituted an amount equal to any amount so specified in respect of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> (2)  Where an application is made by a landlord under section 8 (1A) of the Principal Act in relation to a dwelling in the case of which an application previously made under section 20 of the Principal Act remains not determined, the latter application shall be regarded as terminated.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where, during the month referred to in section 23 (1) of the Principal Act, an application is made by the landlord under section 8 (1A) of that Act in relation to the dwelling&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the order made on the application shall operate to revoke the order under section 21 of the Principal Act, and</P>
    <P>(b)  thereupon the provision as to the rent to be paid contained in section 22 (2) of the Principal Act shall not apply to the dwelling.</P>
    <P>(4)  The applications under section (8) (1A) of the Principal Act mentioned in subsections (2) and (3) of this section may be made notwithstanding subsection (3) of section 22 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The provisions of the new section which this amendment proposes to insert before section 12 are of a traditional or consequential character and do not involve any changes of substance.  Subsection (1) provides that an order provisionally determining the rent of &ldquo;small premises&rdquo; under the 1960 Act which is in force when this Bill becomes law is to have effect as if it showed on its face that the calculation of basic rent and lawful additions had been made in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of the 1960 Act as amended by this Bill.  In other words, the provisional order will be deemed to reflect the new basic rent being introduced by this Bill&mdash;the actual rent being paid on the 8th June last&mdash;instead of the basic rent determined under the 1960 Act&mdash;normally the rent being paid on 31st December, 1960.  The provisional orders which will be in force when this Bill becomes law will show the 1960 Act basic rent and various lawful additions for repairs <i>et cetera</i> as well as for rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> To bring the orders into conformity with the new situation, they are being deemed to read as if they were merely a single lawful addition for rates, the balance being the 1966 Act basic rent. Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of the proposed new section are consequential on the introduction of the provisions enabling &ldquo;small&rdquo; landlords to have a fair rent fixed in certain circumstances and are necessary to avoid overlapping between the procedure for the determination of the rent in accordance with the procedure laid down in Part III of the 1960 Act and the new procedure for determining fair rents.</P>
    <P>However, as small landlords will be entitled to have fair rents fixed only in respect of houses and self-contained flats and as almost all the dwellings normally dealt with under the special provisions for the relief of poor tenants in Part III of the 1960 Act relate to rooms, it is unlikely that these provisions will be necessary, except in relatively few cases.</P>
    <P>There are really two parts, the first part dealing with provisional orders that have already been issued under the provisions for small tenants in the 1960 Act.  The amendment is to ensure that when we talk of the basic rent of a tenement in this Act the basic rent set out in these orders will be in line.</P>
    <P>The second part is designed to ensure that there is no overlapping between the new procedure we are now bringing in here for the determination of a fair rent in the case of a small landlord and that laid down in Part III of the 1960 Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to insert the following after line 2:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The words &lsquo;any tenant of which has availed himself of this Act or of any of the former enactments relating to the restriction of rent to obtain a reduction of the rent of the dwelling&rsquo; in subparagraph (ii) of section 13 (4) (a).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the repeal of these words from section 13 of the 1960 Act is to provide that in every case an increase in rent to which the landlord is entitled by reason of an increase in the rates for which he is responsible, may be recovered by the landlord on giving seven days' notice.  Under the present law, this is the period necessary in the case of statutory tenancies, or if the rent claimed under the notice of increase of rent does not exceed the rent provided for in the tenancy agreement; or if the rent is based solely on an increase of the rates payable on a dwelling, any tenant of which has availed himself of the 1960 Act, or of any of the other Acts relating to rent restrictions.  However, there are a number of other circumstances where the length of notice to be given is such as would be <Col N="1406" /> necessary for a notice to quit.  This means that in the case of monthly, quarterly or yearly tenancies, the landlord is never quite able to recover the amount of the increases in rates because of the necessary time lag.  We are now proposing that in these circumstances also the seven days' provision will apply.</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable to introduce the seven day rule for all rates increases and it follows that if the rates should ever be reduced, the tenant&mdash;in that unlikely event&mdash;will have the right to have the rent reduced at the end of the seven day period.  In practice, it makes universal the seven day rule which already operates in the cases which I have outlined.  It is in ease of the landlord, to the extent that he is able to recover the full amount due to him which, at the moment in certain cases of monthly, quarterly and yearly tenancies&mdash;because of the delay involved&mdash;he cannot recoup to the full extent.  Under the seven day rule he will be able to act expeditiously and be assured of being able to recoup himself of expenditure to which he is entitled by law.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mullen has given notice that he wishes to raise the subject matter of Question No. 37 on today's Order Paper on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon I posed the following question to the Minister:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government when his attention and that of his Department was first drawn to the fact that house prices were unnecessarily inflated through individuals making exorbitant and totally unearned profits from the community's investment; on what subsequent dates such reports were made to him and to his Department; why no action has already been taken in respect of this very serious matter, having regard to the fact that almost all of the building land has been bought up by the developers and builders, and what action he now proposes to take to prevent a continuance of excessive profiteering in housing development.</P>
      <P>I would not have had to raise this matter on the Adjournment, were it not for the fact that when the Minister answered my query, he did not give the information I sought.  He did not, for example, indicate when he found out that those exorbitant profits were being taken.  He did not indicate what action he had taken about the matter.  Neither did he indicate what action he proposed to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the Minister's speech in Cavan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  I raised this question, having regard to <Col N="1409" /> the Minister's failure to use his powers and take effective action to control the price of houses.  I came to raise this question, having read the newspapers. I noticed on the Sunday morning of February 5th, the Minister was reported as having made the speech he had. He was also reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on Monday, 6th February.  It was headlined in this way:</P>
      <P>Homes as Important as Factories &mdash;Boland Denounces profiteering on sites.</P>
      <P>The Government looks on the job of building new homes as being just as important as factory building and deplores speculation that sends up housing site prices.</P>
      <P>Mr. Boland, Minister for Local Government, at Cavan yesterday, said that land buying and high profits had put burdens on the homeseeker. The private sector must not &ldquo;unduly exploit&rdquo; the social needs, he said.</P>
      <P>I submit that there is no use denying the fact that there has been an inflated increase in the price of houses.  This increase has been brought on by speculators and by the house builders.  I am more than anxious to ascertain why no action has been taken before now and if it is intended to take any action in connection with this matter.  The Minister is in the position to glean a great deal of information about a matter of this kind.  I am satisfied that, having regard to his Department, he must be in a position to know what is happening in connection with the price of houses.  I, in my small way, in an attempt to elicit information, have got this type of information from Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They tell me, having regard to the increase in the price of houses, the gross average price of houses in the last few years shows a substantial increase. In 1961-62, the position was found to be that the price put on a house was £2,124; in 1962-63, it was £2,356; in 1963-64, it was £2,550; in 1964-65, it was £2,768; in 1965-66, it was £3,297; and for April to December, 1966, the average was £3,428.  This is the distinct evidence of what the Minister <Col N="1410" /> referred to in his speech in Cavan. I, in turn, submit it is not sufficient for the Minister to go to Cavan, or any other place, and make a complaint about this matter and at the same time do nothing about it.  Had there been something done about it, the situation, as I described it, having regard to the corporation figures, would not be in evidence.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this is a matter of great public concern.  I am sure everybody will join with the Minister when he expresses the point of view that houses are as important as factories and also when he expresses the point of view that it is wrong for people to charge exorbitant prices for them.  I now wonder if this is a matter of closing the stable door when the horse has gone.  I am absolutely certain the Minister has full information about this inflation in the price of houses, having regard to what some of his colleagues, who are developers and speculators, indulge in.</P>
    <P>When I asked my question today the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible under the Prices Act, 1958 and 1965, for price control, including control in relation to the price of houses.</P>
    <P>This is a well-known fact and need hardly be mentioned.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is to his Department that formal complaints under the Acts of specific cases of excessive house prices are conveyed.</P>
    <P>It is only a natural query that I have to raise in that connection.  Taking into consideration what the Minister said at Cavan, has he now approached the Minister for Industry and Commerce and has he given him the benefit of what he said or information in support of what he said?  This is the obvious thing to expect the Minister to do in connection with a matter of this kind.  In this very long drawn out reply which the Minister gave and which I contend did not answer my query, the Minister attempted to spell out that he did not have to give positive <Col N="1411" /> replies to queries.  If you like, his reply is bordering on evasion.</P>
    <P>This is one of the main reasons why I found it necessary to raise this matter on the adjournment.  In the third paragraph of the Minister's reply, which is a very lengthy one, he said:</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring that any accretion in land value as a result of development by a council accrues to the benefit of the community, my Department advised local authorities by circular letters of 14th May and 12th October, 1960, 10th December, 1962, and 24th May, 1965, of the desirability of acquiring and developing building sites well ahead of programme requirements.</P>
    <P>It is all very well saying this.  The Minister, at the same time, neglected to state that simultaneously with the circulars, the situation which prevailed was that there was no money provided by the same Department.  I hold that in a matter of this kind, in the matter of the inflation in the price of houses, when the Minister himself sees fit to talk about it, it is also imperative that the Minister take action about it.</P>
    <P>Further, in his reply, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>... I expect local authorities to use their powers under them to the greatest possible extent within the limit of available resources, particularly in areas where the cost of building sites may be disproportionately high.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a semblance of evasion of the issue.  The Minister is Minister for Local Government; he is responsible for the administration of all local authorities.  Surely, he should be able to say what he did to ensure that local authorities were carrying out his wishes in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the final paragraph of this long and evasive reply, the Minister states:</P>
    <P>The ineffectiveness of the existing statutory powers in coping with the problem of the availability and cost <Col N="1412" /> of serviced land generally is at present under review.</P>
    <P>This is a clear indication of the advice: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo; Certainly it will not satisfy the unfortunate people who have been caught in the net to which the Minister adverted. It is no use telling them repeatedly the matter is under review.  The figures of Dublin Corporation are those for ordinary houses being purchased by those described as the working classes who must have an income under a certain figure before they qualify for a loan or a grant.  Advantage has been taken of these very people.  They have been charged up to the hilt.  The Minister says the charges have been exorbitant. Yet nothing has been done about them.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper that the Minister should indicate, and I expect him to do so, when he got this information. I have not access to the information the Minister has, but the figures I have indicate that this has been going on for years.  If that is so, then the Minister should say why it has been so and why, if it has been going on for some years, no action was taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister, too, should really be a little more positive and tell us what action he proposes to take now.  I defy contradiction of the fact that people setting out to buy SDA houses in 1963 found the price had increased 40 per cent.  A few years back in this House the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was directed to this matter.  The Minister disputed the fact that prices had increased.  Very few builders or developers have been investigated. There was a public outcry two years ago approximately in the City of Dublin in relation to the price of houses and the unfortunate people who banded together found themselves confronted with a demand that they should provide all the information to substantiate their allegations.  Eventually one builder was investigated.  He was sorted out from the rest, and there was no more about it.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened recently in connection with &ldquo;Home Truths&rdquo; on Telefís Éireann.  We are aware of the <Col N="1413" /> fact that in the city of Dublin exorbitant prices are being charged for new houses.  These cannot be attributed to labour costs.  We are aware of the fact that developers came in and bought up land all over the place.  I am sure the Minister is not without knowledge why a co-operative organisation has found it necessary to state that almost all the land for house-building has been taken up in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and the Minister in his reply now should indicate clearly when he or his Department &mdash;I do not hold the Minister personally to blame; I am conscious of the fact that he is new in this particular Department &mdash; first had this information.  I think I am entitled to know, and so is everybody interested, when this information became available.  When it did become available what action was taken?  What action does the Minister intend to take now with a view to ensuring there will not be a continuance of this situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, I think, entitled to express some surprise that my statement that unjustifiable prices were being charged for land for housing should have aroused such annoyance in the Labour Party in particular.  They seem to resent bitterly my having adverted to this and my having indicated that this was something not acceptable.  My reply earlier today was anything but evasive.  It answered the queries raised by Deputy Mullen, giving him the information he presumably wanted.  The fact that he was given that information only seemed to increase his annoyance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated quite clearly what steps had been taken already to deal with this problem.  I indicated that I was now examining the effectiveness of the existing powers.  As I say, this seemed to increase the annoyance of Deputy Mullen and his colleagues in the Labour Party.  Apparently they did not want this question to be dealt with at all.  It suits them better presumably to have these complaints and to be able to say nothing is being done about them.  The fact that powers have been taken to deal with this problem and <Col N="1414" /> that I am examining the possibility of ensuring more effective action only seems to upset Deputy Mullen and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I stated in my reply today:</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring that any accretion in land value as a result of development by a council accrues to the benefit of the community, my Department advised local authorities by circular letter of 14th May and 12th October, 1960, 10th December, 1962, and 24th May, 1965, of the desirability of acquiring and developing building sites well ahead of programme requirements.</P>
    <P>I said:</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been repeatedly urged in Ministerial speeches to adopt a vigorous and progressive policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>I went on to point out&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 44 of the Housing Act, 1966, provides for the payment of a specific subsidy for the provision by local authorities of sites for private housing development and section 77 clarifies and extends the powers of compulsory acquisition for these purposes in advance of ascertained needs.</P>
    <P>That clearly indicates that the Minister for Local Government was still endeavouring to get these sections implemented by local authorities, to get them to acquire to the utmost extent possible sites for housing, particularly in areas in which the cost of building sites might be disproportionately high, having regard to the fact that the value of the land had been increased by the investment they had made on behalf of the community.</P>
    <P>These sections of the Housing Act, as I told Deputy Mullen&mdash;he seemed to resent the information &mdash; were brought into force on 31st December, 1966.  Deputy Mullen may or may not remember&mdash;I do not know whether he took an interest in it&mdash;that the Housing Act, 1966, had a long and tortuous passage through this House.  For all I know, he may have taken part in the obstruction of the Bill.  The fact is that, because of the delayed passage of the <Col N="1415" /> Bill through the House, it was only on 31st December, 1966, that I was able to bring these sections into operation, sections designed to facilitate local authorities in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>I said that I expected local authorities to use their powers under this section of the Housing Act of 1966 to the greatest possible extent within the limits of available resources, particularly where the cost of building sites was disproportionately high.  I went on to say that I was aware of the great necessity of servicing land in the Dublin area and that it was my policy to give priority to the servicing of land earmarked for new houses and new industries.  Surely that is an indication of my intention to do all possible to alleviate the situation and to ensure that any land that is rendered more valuable by the investment of the community will not result in having these completely unjustified profits taken by people who had nothing whatever to do with increasing the value of the land.</P>
    <P>The primary thing in the Dublin area is to increase the supply of serviced land available for housing and to ensure that the local authority will acquire as much as possible of that land for its own housing requirements and for the provision of private houses.  Deputy Mullen emphasised this question of the Minister for Industry and Commerce being responsible for price control.  To talk of tackling the problem of imposing control on the price of land is nonsense.  That is not the way to tackle it.  People have been known to get around these things.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce imposed a maximum price on land for housing, it would be no wonder if that were reflected in the usual manner, that the maximum price would become the minimum price.</P>
    <P>Surely the proper way to tackle the problem is for the authority which made the land valuable to acquire it compulsorily as they have been empowered to do in the recent legislation introduced by the Government and with which they got very little help from other parts of the House? <Col N="1416" /> Deputy Mullen quoted figures for the price of houses and I have indicated that I think the contribution made to the increase in the cost of houses by the increase in the cost of acquiring sites has been excessively large in later years but I do not agree with Deputy Mullen that this is the sole contributing factor in the increase in the price of houses.  Housing prices consist of the cost of acquiring and developing the land, the cost of wages, the cost of materials, the productivity of labour and the builders' profits.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that house prices have increased between 1960-61 and 1964-65, that is, the erection of the superstructure, by one-third.  Within that period, industrial wages have increased by 54 per cent.  I would say that it can hardly be argued that the wages of those engaged in the building industry have lagged behind industrial wages generally so that it is safe to assume that the increase in wages in the building industry has been of the order of 54 per cent.  That has obviously also been another factor in the increased cost of houses.  The fact that the total increase in super-structural cost has been one-third and the increase in wages 54 per cent would suggest that that element in the costs had quite a considerable effect.</P>
    <P>I do not say that there was not scope for a fairer distribution of the profits arising from house-building but the figures show that that process has been taking place and has contributed to the increase in house prices.  What was quoted in the papers from my speech in Cavan was mainly this question of the contribution to the increased cost of housing made by the inflated values obtained for land for building.  I mentioned that that element of the increased cost of houses was very largely unjustified.  I have intimated already that certain action has been taken to make it possible to reduce that contribution to the increase in the cost of houses.</P>
    <P>Local authorities can now acquire land compulsorily for purposes other than their own direct housing needs. They have been exhorted on many occasions <Col N="1417" /> since 1960 to go ahead and do that.  There has been some response but there has not been sufficient activity on the part of local authorities in acquiring land and making it available for private housing at a reasonable cost.  The sections of the Act which I have brought into operation provide extra incentives to local authorities to do that.  An additional grant of £150 per site is now available for this purpose so that a person building a house on one of these sites will be helped to the extent of this £150, plus the State grant of £275, plus the local authority grant of £275, making a total contribution to his house of £700.  I do not think that is an insignificant figure.</P>
    <P>These facts were given to Deputy Mullen in my reply to his question and he is resentful of the fact that he was given them.  Having given him this information, it is quite obvious from what I said last week that I am not satisfied that the matter is being satisfactorily dealt with as yet.  There has not yet been time for the provisions made under sections 44 and 67 to be properly effective.  I indicated that this was a problem which was receiving my attention and I told Deputy Mullen that the effectiveness of the existing statutory powers in coping with the <Col N="1418" /> problem is at present under review. That should be enough to alleviate Deputy Mullen's fears, if indeed they are genuine fears.</P>
