      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order, Nos 1, 8 and 9.  As I arrived in the House, I was informed that the Whips had a discussion and that they agree, subject to the agreement of the House and subject to complying with Standing Orders, that if the business ordered concludes before the time stated for Questions, that Questions might proceed immediately on the conclusion of the business.  I suggest, Sir, that course might be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill comes to the Dáil from the Seanad and an explanatory memorandum, revised to take account of the changes made in it in the Seanad, has been circulated.  The memorandum begins by explaining that, for convenience, it refers only to auctioneers but that the references to auctioneers are to be taken as applying to house agents as well.  In what I have to say now, I propose to adopt the same device, so Deputies will understand that, even if I do not mention house agents expressly, I mean to include them in my references to auctioneers.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two main objects.  The first is, to increase from £2,000 to £5,000 the deposit which a licensed auctioneer is required to keep in the High Court.  The second is to require auctioneers to keep clients' moneys in a special bank account and to keep proper records of them.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposed increase in the deposit, the position, as Deputies are aware, is that the present deposit of £2,000 was fixed by the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1947, so there is a strong presumption, right from the outset, that it is inadequate today, because of changes in money values over the last 20 years.  However, as I explained in the Seanad, the proposal to increase the deposit to £5,000 is not put forward just as a mechanical or routine adjustment of the existing figure to take account of changes in the value of money.  It takes account of what has actually happened, in the matter of claims against the deposit, in so far as official records can supply that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official figures show that, over a period of years, there are, on average, five claims per year against deposits.  The figures show, further, that four out of the five &mdash; again this is on average &mdash; are fully covered by the existing deposit of £2,000.  This means that we have an average of one case a year in which the deposit is insufficient to meet claims.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1045" /> in those cases where the deposit does fall short, there is no source of information from which we could establish by how much it falls short.</P>
    <P>Ideally, of course, the deposit should be such as would cover any loss, however great.  However, under a system which operates, in practice, on the basis of fidelity guarantee bonds, unlimited cover is not practicable.  Even if an insurance company would provide cover for an unlimited amount, which is highly unlikely, the premium would certainly be such as to be a considerable burden on quite a few auctioneers and an impossible burden on some.  So it is necessary to look for a reasonable compromise.</P>
    <P>The figure that I propose in the Bill, namely, £5,000, would, I think, be rather low if it stood by itself.  However, it should not be assessed in the context of the existing arrangements but in the context of the other proposals in the Bill which would require auctioneers to keep clients' moneys in a special bank account and to keep adequate records.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, almost a cliché to say that, if an auctioneer is determined to make away with clients' moneys, no restrictions of this kind will succeed in stopping him.  In many cases, however, a man who makes away with other people's money does not begin with a fraudulent intention and, in the case of a business like an auctioneer's business, a man may easily find himself in difficulties, not because of any intention or plan to defraud, but because of carelessness in the keeping of records and in mixing clients' moneys with his own. The hope I have for these provisions about special accounts and so on is that they will prevent people from starting on the slippery slope that ends in the Bankruptcy Court or perhaps, even, in a prosecution for fraud.</P>
    <P>I am putting some emphasis on the fact that in many of these cases where things go wrong, it is not a question of fraud, at least at the outset. I am doing this first of all because it is a fact which gives grounds for hoping that the requirements now <Col N="1046" /> proposed will have a significant effect.  As I have said, these requirements might do little good in the case of a man determined from the outset to act fraudulently but this is, I think, most exceptional.  The second reason I stress that losses are often caused by negligence is that, as prosecutions for fraud on the part of auctioneers are rare, some people may be tempted to think that there is no need at all for these provisions.  It is necessary, therefore, to keep firmly in mind that, as far as the individual client is concerned, it does not matter greatly to him whether his money is lost through negligence or through fraud and the fact that fraud is, fortunately, rare does not excuse us from going as far as we reasonably can to protect the client against loss that may not arise through fraud.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the two main provisions of the Bill and they received general support in the other House. There are other provisions in the Bill, mostly of a procedural and technical nature, which were altered fairly extensively while the Bill was going through the other House.  The changes made in the procedural provisions were largely, I may say, a result of comments made by the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.  These two organisations, with their detailed knowledge of practical problems that arise in the offices of auctioneers and estate agents, were in a position to offer very helpful suggestions and I am glad to acknowledge their assistance in this regard.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there is an explanatory memorandum and I think it has sufficient detail to provide those Deputies who are particularly interested with an adequate account of each section.  I need hardly say that if further explanation is required of any particular provision, I shall be glad to provide all the assistance I can on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I do not think it is necessary for me to delay the House any further at this point so I conclude by commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="1047" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I view this Bill with mixed feelings.  I understand&mdash; and it is implicit in the Minister's statement &mdash; that to a large extent it may be regarded as the Bill of the auctioneers' profession in that it is based largely on their suggestions and their desire to see this kind of regulation brought into the control of the affairs of auctioneers.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the Bill makes two principal changes: one in raising the deposit required from auctioneers from £2,000 to £5,000, and secondly, in providing a statutory requirement regarding the keeping of auctioneers' accounts.  The reason I say I view the Bill with mixed feelings is that while I appreciate the arguments in favour of raising the deposit required, I am conscious at the same time that there are many small auctioneers throughout the country who might not find it so very easy to comply either with that requirement or with the accounts requirement in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister quite rightly has made it clear that by and large the number of times that there is actual fraud concerned when things go wrong is probably very small indeed, and more often than not if things go wrong, it is a question of this happening through carelessness, or negligence, or mistakes. The spirit in which this Bill is moved by the Minister is that he is not suggesting that there is any widespread problem so far as fraud is concerned, but that he wants to have machinery which will reduce the danger of problems arising because of carelessness, negligence or mistakes.  I appreciate that argument, but it would seem to me that it would be preferable if that could be left to the auctioneers' association to put into effect and operate by means of regulations made by themselves, rather than that it should be put into operation as a statutory matter in an Act of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very close analogy between the proposals in the Bill and the position obtaining in the solicitors' profession.  The Minister will be aware that this matter was dealt with by the solicitors' profession, and dealt with <Col N="1048" /> by themselves.  The Solicitors Act enabled the profession to make regulations governing matters of practice and matters of accounts.  On reading this Bill, it seems to me that the authors have endeavoured to follow fairly closely the pattern established by the Incorporated Law Society when they settled their accounts regulations.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that I think it more satisfactory that the regulations should be made by the profession itself rather than that it should be imposed on the profession by an Act of Parliament.  I do not think there is any sense of grievance amongst solicitors in connection with the accounts regulations which, in some ways, go further than what is proposed here.  I do not think that any sense of grievance or imposition exists in the solicitors' profession because those regulations are their own regulations, made by the profession pursuant to the authority given to them to make regulations in the Act dealing with the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>Here we are taking a different direction. Instead of saying to the auctioneers' association: &ldquo;We will pass an Act of Parliament which will give you all the authority you require to regulate your own affairs as regards accounts, and the keeping of bank accounts, and so on,&rdquo; we are making it a statutory requirement by legislation. Ultimately the effect may be the same, but I think there is a difference of approach, and the approach made by the Legislature in respect of the auctioneers' profession seems to me to be less desirable than that which was made in relation to the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it quite clear that I am expressing to a great extent personal views on this because, while I am speaking for my Party, we do not regard this in any sense as a Party measure or a political measure.  Other Deputies may have a different approach to the Bill.  At this stage I think it right that I should repair an omission of the Minister's and extend my congratulations and possibly those of the House to my colleague, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, on his election as President <Col N="1049" /> of the Auctioneers and House Agents Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan will no doubt address himself to this Bill and I think it would be reasonable, and to be expected, that his approach to the Bill would be that of the association of which he is president.  As I say, my approach is one of accepting the Bill because it is the Bill which I believe the auctioneers' profession has desired but nevertheless I do feel critical about some aspects of it.  I do feel some concern for the situation of the small auctioneer who possibly is not a member of the association.  Also, I feel fully conscious &mdash; as, indeed, the Minister has made it clear that he is conscious &mdash; that, if things go wrong, by and large it is more likely to be a question of carelessness than a question of fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter which I should like to suggest to the auctioneers' association possibly more than to the Minister.  It is on parallel lines to what has been done in the solicitors' profession.  It is that the auctioneers' association might consider the establishment of a compensation fund which ultimately might be able to replace the requirement for a bond or a deposit.  The Minister is aware that the solicitors' profession regulate their own affairs in that regard and that they have established a compensation fund to which all the members subscribe and which contains a more than adequate guarantee to the public in the event of matters going wrong.  I think that that is the right type of approach in a profession.  It might, in some way, be an imposition on individual members of a profession but, when it is done by the profession itself, it is a matter that is accepted without any sense of grievance or any sense of resentment.  Might I say in that respect that, comparatively recently, the solicitors' profession elected to amend their accounts regulations and to have a requirement of an accountant's <Col N="1050" /> certificate in connection with the obtaining of their own practising certificate? This matter was dealt with by the profession by a majority vote at a general meeting.  I know it is not entirely relevant to this Bill but, in dealing with vocations or professions of that type, it seems desirable that as much discretion as possible should be vested in the profession themselves, once they are acting on the right lines.</P>
    <P>There are just a couple of small matters of detail which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister so that he can consider them between now and Committee Stage. The first thing that occurs to me in relation to this Bill is that it deals with clients' accounts to a large extent, that is, clients of auctioneers.  So far as I can see, nowhere in the Bill is there a definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  If the Minister consults the solicitors' accounts regulations, he will see that, in those regulations, &ldquo;client&rdquo; is defined. Everyone knows where he stands.  In this Bill, as far as I can see, no definition is given of &ldquo;client&rdquo; although &ldquo;client account&rdquo; is defined as meaning a current or deposit account in the name of an auctioneer or house agent in the title in which the word &ldquo;client&rdquo; appears and which is kept in a bank at a branch in the State.</P>
    <P>The second matter I should like to query for further consideration by the Minister before Committee Stage is the requirement in section 5 (1) (b) that an auctioneer or house agent who keeps more than one client account shall keep all such accounts at the same bank unless the District Court, for special reasons, otherwise permits.  I do not understand the necessity for that.  I can appreciate the argument that if you ensure that an auctioneer will keep all his accounts in the one bank it makes control and supervision easier and that if he has accounts in different banks it just might not be so easy to check on him, if a check is required.  We must balance that argument against the one which was rightly used by the Minister that if a man deliberately sets out to defraud. <Col N="1051" /> no amount of regulations adopted either by the profession itself or carried into an Act of Parliament will prevent it.</P>
    <P>I think our dealing with the profession should be on the basis of trust and confidence, on the assumption that they are not individually going to set out to defraud their clients.  It might be of considerable importance from time to time that auctioneers should be permitted to keep their client accounts in different banks.  The Minister has as much experience of rural Ireland as I have and possibly more.  He knows as well as I do that very often it can be a matter of considerable importance to an auctioneer to feel that he can keep in with the various banks in the area in which he practices and it might suit him very well and might suit his clients very well that he should be permitted to keep his accounts in different banks.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider again that requirement which seems to me to be unduly restrictive.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to ask the Minister about is in connection, again, with section 5 which deals with what an auctioneer may do in relation to client money.  Putting the matter very generally, it provides that he must put the money in a client account without unnecessary delay and it sets out when he may deal with it otherwise.  If the Minister compares these requirements with the requirements set out in the solicitors' account regulations, he will find that, very reasonably and properly, the solicitors' account regulations provide that a solicitor need not lodge the money in a client account where he has been directed by the client to deal with the money otherwise.  It seems to me that it might very well be of importance to auctioneers that a similar provision should be written in here.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the kind of case which occurs frequently enough where a person is selling one bit of property and buying another.  It may be that the deposit is with an auctioneer and that the deposit, in the particular circumstances of the case, is, so to speak, freed either by arrangement between the vendor and purchaser or because <Col N="1052" /> the deal has been closed.  It may suit the client to be able to say to the auctioneer: &ldquo;Instead of paying that out to me or instead of putting that into a client account in the bank or instead of vesting that in the trustee security, I want you to use that to put down as a deposit on another bit of property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, occasions may arise where a client wants to give directions to the auctioneer as to how the deposit will be utilised.  I have no doubt that if this were being done on the basis of a regulation being made by the association, this kind of point would arise and could be dealt with by the regulation or by an amendment to the regulation.  But, here, when we are laying it down in an Act of Parliament, we have to try to be far more farsighted in the matter because we have to try to visualise the kinds of situations which may arise in future. That is another reason why I prefer to see this kind of thing carried out by regulation of the association than in an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me that, at any rate, that particular type of discretion, which is not the discretion of the auctioneer but the discretion of the client, should be incorporated into these requirements.  I would be glad if the Minister would examine that point also between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister in his opening speech gave any estimate of the number of auctioneers affected by this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill is a very good example of how the time of Dáil Éireann can be wasted.  This is a Bill which has a limited, albeit an essential, function to perform.  I hope that in any <Col N="1053" /> changes which may flow in future in the organisation of our legislative processes Bills of this nature which, after all, are very simple and do not call for prolonged examination in Parliament, should be referred to a specialist committee of the House to be dealt with in Committee and later reported back to the House.  I merely make that observation at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it is taking up the time of Dáil Éireann which, I suggest, might be devoted to other more general &mdash; I do not say more important &mdash; matters.  This is an important matter but I am speaking in terms of the specialist nature of the Bill and the manner in which it could be far more expeditiously dealt with. I hope steps will be taken in the future to deal with this type of legislation in the way I suggest.  In fact, I feel it is an inevitable development.  In these days, Dáil Éireann does not sit long or often enough for us to be spending our time indulging in prolonged parsing of legislation in this fashion, sentence by sentence.  It is a matter for specialists and I daresay it should be left to them and the best of luck to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we have the Bill before us. Again, like Deputy O'Higgins, I am expressing a personal opinion which may not find favour even with other members of my own Party, let alone other Members of the House.  As we have the Bill before us, there is not really very much to be said about it. No matter how it may be dragged out, there are only two proposals in it.  One is the raising of the deposit from £2,000 to £5,000.  That may very well represent a hardship to some of the small rural town type of auctioneers.  I do not know if the Minister could give any indication of how these auctioneers are divided.  I would imagine that the small auctioneers in the small towns in rural areas would predominate in that figure of 1,000.  The deposit means nothing to the big type operators in the cities and large towns.  I am quite certain that it will come within their ability to meet it.  Does it represent too <Col N="1054" /> much for the man who is perhaps in a small way of business and who is an auctioneer on the side in an effort to supplement his income?  That is a question which occurs to me but I would accept that the Minister's Department have far more detailed knowledge of this group than I would have and I would be content to accept their judgment in the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not hold with Deputy O'Higgins's view that special groups of society &mdash; not all groups &mdash; should be left to determine their own rules of procedure.  That is wrong.  If it is to be applied to auctioneers as it has been applied, indeed, to the solicitors' profession, why should it not be applied to every other section of the community to make their own rules within given generalisations?  Why should any group have a privileged position in a matter of this kind?  I do not think they should.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I feel the onus is on the Minister and on the Government to make such regulations as they think fit to ensure that the public good, which must be the main consideration of the Dáil, is protected to the full. Laws are made to that end.  Laws are not made and are certainly not deemed to be made to facilitate the interests of any particular section as against the rest of the people.</P>
    <P>The solicitors' profession is a very honourable profession and I say nothing in denigration of the profession and the many worthy people who populate it but it has often struck me that it is because of the special relationship which that profession bears to the administration of justice that it has managed to get itself into the position that it is in of making its own rules of behaviour.  I am sure nobody will argue that these rules were not overdue.  Indeed, if I do not make a mistake, the rules in relation to the solicitors' profession, in their present condition, were brought about by the action of Dáil Éireann.  I can be corrected in that if I am wrong. They were brought about because of the need for action by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a special group.  The Bill is a very simple one <Col N="1055" /> and I personally do not want to take up a great deal of the time of the House talking about it because I am quite certain that a great deal of the time of the House is about to be taken up.  I do not want to stand in the way of those more expert in these matters.</P>
    <P>The only point that occurs to me is whether £5,000 would represent a hardship to the kind of man I have described &mdash; the person in a small town who might be dependent to some extent upon the business of auctioneering for a living and whose annual business might not be very great.  Otherwise, the Bill is excellent.  It brings in regulation where regulation is required.  In saying that, I do not want to suggest the auctioneers of Ireland are in any way remiss in their duties and obligations to their clients.  I do not think we need define what is a client.  Everybody knows what an auctioneer's client is. Only the pedant seeks to quarrel with these things, and perhaps the lawyer. It occurs to me that seldom over the years has one heard of or read about any instances of fraud as far as this group are concerned.  As a general rule, they are highly regarded in all parts of the country.  I hope the Minister will have this legislation put through this morning with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Bill has been approached by Deputy O'Higgins and also by Deputy Dunne, speaking on behalf of his Party.  In my opinion, this is a most desirable and necessary piece of legislation.  I cannot subscribe to the observations of Deputy Dunne that the time of the Dáil should not be devoted to the consideration of an important Bill of this kind.  It may be desirable to have a Committee of the House deal with legislation of a complex and difficult character, but a Bill of this kind can be more appropriately dealt with in the House where every Deputy has an opportunity of expressing his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation concerns a small section of the community, but one <Col N="1056" /> that renders to the general public an important and necessary service.  The auctioneer and estate agent performs a very necessary function in this country.  Indeed, those associated with real estate business throughout the world perform a very necessary service.  At present efforts are being made in practically every country to raise the standard of efficiency, to give the general public a better service and more enlightened assistance and guidance in regard to the property market and, what is of particular importance in this country at present, in regard to valuations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction.  We can safely assume it is the first instalment of what we hope will be more comprehensive legislation. The Bill has two very important provisions.  First, it proposes to increase from £2,000 to £5,000 the deposit which a licensed auctioneer is required to lodge with the High Court and, secondly, it requires an auctioneer to keep clients' money in a special banking account and to keep records of such moneys and his dealings in them.  These provisions are not alone necessary but most desirable. Under the existing law, an auctioneer is required to enter into a bond of £2,000 in order to obtain his licence from the Department of Justice.  This sum of £2,000 was fixed in 1947.  It is now 1967 and there is a considerable difference between the value of the £ today and the value of the £ in 1947.  The fact that the deposit has been increased from £2,000 to £5,000 will be no more of a hardship today than the £2,000 bond was in 1947.  I feel that the Minister and his Department were most considerate of the smaller auctioneers in rural Ireland and elsewhere for whom it might have been a hardship to increase the bond to £5,000.  I do not think this is going to create any difficulty whatever for anybody in the auctioneering business in this country, but it is going to help their clients considerably.</P>
    <P>Further, this will be a means of helping to bring into the auctioneering business a type of person more fitted for it.  I want to refer briefly to <Col N="1057" /> the importance of having in the auctioneering profession the best and most highly qualified people to deal with this specialised work.  At present anyone can go into the District Court and obtain an auctioneer's licence.  If he enters into the bond for £2,000 and makes his application, he will be granted his licence, no matter what other profession or business he may have in addition.  Those of us in the real estate business and public representatives generally have had our attention drawn to the fact that auctioneers' licences can be obtained too freely.</P>
    <P>There are cases in which people apply to the District Court and are granted licences for the purpose of selling a single property.  An auctioneer's licence was granted to an applicant who then proceeded to sell his own farm by public auction, collected his commission, and that was the end of his business; he did not proceed any further as an auctioneer.  Auctioneers' licences have been granted to people who are not fully qualified or capable of giving to the general public the specialised service expected of an auctioneer and valuer.</P>
    <P>This has been the cause of a considerable amount of anxiety to the Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association. They have devoted all their energies since 1923, with the very able assistance, guidance and wise counsel of the secretary of that Association, Mr. Michael H. Gray, to genuine efforts to raise the standard of the auctioneers' profession in Ireland. The association which represents auctioneers on both sides of the Border has been giving serious consideration to these matters.  They approached the Minister for Justice many times with a view to the passing of legislation to tighten up the granting of auctioneers' licences so that they would not be available to every Tom, Dick and Harry.</P>
    <P>A person may not practise the engineering profession unless he has his degrees and qualifications.  To practise as a solicitor, one must have the appropriate qualifications.  The auctioneers' profession is rendering to the people of this country a service equal to, if not <Col N="1058" /> more important in many respects, to that of the legal, engineering or any other profession.</P>
    <P>The raising of the bond from £2,000 to £5,000 will be a help to the profession. To become a good auctioneer and valuer takes many years of study and experience.  On one occasion when I asked a colleague of very long standing in the auctioneers' profession what I would say in a certain valuation report I was drawing up, the advice he gave me was that it takes many long years of hard work and careful study and examination of property and prices in order to express an opinion as a valuer.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate for one moment that the auctioneering profession should be a closed shop, nor is that the aim of the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association.  Far from it.  The Minister knows that is not the case.  We are anxious to raise the standard of the profession to the highest possible degree.  Specialist services are being called for now from those engaged in the real estate business.  We of the auctioneering profession can see that very clearly from our association with the Federation of International Real Estate Agents when we visit Paris, Copenhagen, Tokyo, England and elsewhere. This has brought home to us that it is of the utmost importance that we should have the best and most highly qualified people in this profession.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that in order to obtain a licence to practise as an auctioneer, all one has to do at the moment is to present oneself in court, get an insurance company to cover one's bond to the extent of £2,000, which can be readily available, without any regard by the court to fitness, suitability or qualifications.  In most countries there is some regard to suitability, fitness, qualifications and financial standing.  In New Zealand, the Real Estate Agents Bill, 1963, has a very important section, section 10.  I understand that the secretary of the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association has already sent the Minister a copy of the New Zealand Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the <Col N="1059" /> House to section 10 of that Bill which deals with the granting of licences to persons to act as auctioneers and estate agents.  It requires:</P>
    <P>The magistrate to require evidence as to character, fitness and financial position.</P>
    <P>It is most desirable, before granting a licence to any citizen &mdash; may I say that, even though they may have been very few, licences have been granted to some undesirable citizens but the Minister will agree with me that, on the whole, the number has been small; Deputy Dunne referred to that fact &mdash; there should be evidence as to character, fitness and financial standing.  With a few exceptions, the auctioneering profession here is of a very high standard of integrity and honesty.  We are all pleased at that.  If there have been cases of dishonest transactions or fraud, those dishonest transactions or fraud have not been based on intent to defraud. They have occurred because licences have been given to people who should never have got them.  Fraud has occurred mainly because of a muddling-up of auctioneers' accounts. The provision in this Bill in that regard will help considerably.  In future accounts must be kept separate.  I was speaking on one occasion to the secretary of the auctioneers' association. I asked him: &ldquo;Mr. Gray, is it possible that there are auctioneers who do not keep separate accounts and who are sufficiently foolish to put their clients' money with their own money?&rdquo; The reply I got was that it was amazing the number of auctioneers who, because of lack of thought and lack of a proper sense of responsibility to themselves, their families and the public generally, put their clients' money with their own personal banking accounts.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how any businessman handling clients' money could deposit that money with his own because, the moment he does so, he is facing disaster.  Auctioneers and valuers hold their clients' money in trust.  They have no claim upon it, no authority to use it, no authority to trade with it. They have no authority beyond holding it in trust.  I am sure this extraordinary <Col N="1060" /> practice does not occur in the case of firms and I cannot understand how any man could dream of putting his clients' money with his own personal account.  The provision in this Bill requires an auctioneer in future to keep clients' money in a special banking account and to keep records of that money.  That is very desirable for the auctioneer himself and most desirable from the point of view of the general public.  These two main provisions in the Bill meet with the full approval and with the entire agreement of all responsible people engaged in auctioneering and real estate business in this country.</P>
    <P>I referred to evidence of character, fitness and financial position of an applicant anxious to start business as an auctioneer.  Anyone entering the auctioneering business has to handle tens of thousands of pounds of other people's money and surely it is vitally important that such a person should be in a fit financial position to be the custodian, if only in trust, of other people's money.  Licences, however, have been granted to people who were not in a financial position to conduct a satisfactory auctioneering business and the moment large sums fell into their hands by way of deposit they were tempted.  We have known of cases in which deposits were made in trust with an auctioneer and the auctioneer traded with one deposit in the hope that another deposit would come in later. That way of conducting business spells disaster.</P>
    <P>These provisions will have the effect of raising the standard of the auctioneering profession.  The Bill is a step in the right direction and it is one which is welcomed by the profession.  In the long run, it is the general public who will benefit from this to the greatest extent.  I have already pointed out how easy it is to obtain a licence.  One can never have a really good professional body unless those engaged in the profession are dedicated to their business. There are many good auctioneers, dependable and reliable, who have other callings.  There are publicans who engage in auctioneering.  There are grocers and undertakers who do likewise. People in many walks of life <Col N="1061" /> carry on auctioneering as well.  But the profession is really constituted of dedicated men who are engaged fulltime in their profession and who carry on no other business or commercial operations. That is the only way in which the best possible service will be given to the general public.</P>
    <P>Valuation is an important facet in the auctioneering profession and it is vitally important that no unqualified person should express an opinion on valuation because an ill-considered or ill-founded opinion may involve a client in considerable financial loss. The same is true of the buying and selling market.  One does not go to a blacksmith to have a tooth pulled; one does not go to a painter to have shoes and boots repaired; one does not go to an engineer for medical advice: one goes to a doctor.  It is the same in the auctioneering business and the buying and selling trade.  One goes to the man who is trained, whose business it is to know the extent of the buying and selling market, who has studied the value and sale of land, and who has studied the value and sale of property, private property and business and other premises.</P>
    <P>Firms engaged fulltime in the auctioneering business have specialists in their employment, specialists in auctioneering and in the buying and selling of land, house property, rents, and so on.  There should be a greater degree of control over the issue of licences to people to act in such a capacity.  The Minister will readily agree with me that it is quite wrong to grant a licence to anyone to enter into any profession unless he is qualified for that profession as it may mean substantial financial losses for clients who engage the services of such unqualified persons.</P>
    <P>I want to direct attention to how loose our laws are and how firm and rigid the laws are in other countries with regard to entry into the real estate business.  I quote section 10 of the New Zealand Real Estate Agents Act, 1963:</P>
    <P>Magistrates to require evidence as to character, fitness and financial position&mdash;(1) Before granting an <Col N="1062" /> application for a licence to carry on business as a real estate agent, the Magistrate shall require the production of sufficient evidence to satisfy him that the character, fitness, and financial position of the applicant are such that he is, in the opinion of the Magistrate, having regard to the interests of the public, a proper person to carry on business as a real estate agent.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where application for a licence is made by a person carrying on or proposing to carry on business as a real estate agent in partnership with any other person, the Magistrate shall require the production of evidence as to the character, fitness, and financial position of each of the partners.</P>
    <P>When in New Zealand a limited company desires to enter into the real estate business, the courts, through the magistrate, will require each director of that company, individually &mdash; not one in charge but each of them &mdash; to come forward and satisfy the court that he is of excellent character, that he qualifies as to fitness and that his financial position is sound and secure. In the case of directors, all the directors must appear and satisfy the court. In the case of partnership, both or all partners must, in order to comply with the law in New Zealand, satisfy the court as to character, fitness and financial position.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister who has been extremely reasonable in his attitude to all the approaches that have been made &mdash; and may I express the grateful thanks of the auctioneering profession for his lively interest and the manner in which he has received the various deputations and representations put forward by the association &mdash; to consider seriously the question of character, fitness and financial position in regard to the granting of auctioneers' licences?  I would strongly recommend section 10 of the New Zealand Real Estate Act, 1963 to him. I am sure he already has it because the secretary of the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association sent him a copy.  If our District Courts were to have a qualification, before the <Col N="1063" /> granting of a licence, on character, fitness and financial position it would, I think, on this question of the issue of licences to everyone who wants them, most certainly ease the whole situation.</P>
    <P>To give the Minister and the House an idea of the serious efforts and attempts that have been made to raise the standard of the auctioneering profession, I want it to go on record that at the present time and for some years past serious efforts have been made to raise the professional status of our auctioneers.  I should like to pay very special tribute to the work, the endless energy and tireless long hours of work which a number of past presidents of the association have put into this important work.  I refer to Mr. Frank W, Meldon, Mr. Raymond D. Corish of Wexford and Mr. Liam Maher of Roscrea. Nobody will be more pleased, I am sure, than the Minister to hear that, in so far as the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association are concerned, after 1970 no person will be admitted to the association unless he satisfies the association that he complies fully with all the requirements laid down as proper standards for an auctioneer and estate agent.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the College of Commerce in Rathmines and the auctioneers' association are at present conducting courses for young men and, I am happy and glad to say, for ladies who wish to participate. Those courses are very essential for the profession.  The association has already issued the examination curriculum and I am sure the Minister has already seen a copy of it.  By 1970, those who are seeking admission to the association will require to have a knowledge of book-keeping, estate accounting, law of property, law of contract and tort and local government. They will also require to have a knowledge of the elements of building construction, elementary surveying, the elements of economics and the law of landlord and tenant.  In addition, they must have a knowledge of the law of planning and compensation, the principles of valuation, construction <Col N="1064" /> and maintenance of buildings, chattel auctions, inventories and furnished lettings.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of the association that everyone who is engaged in the auctioneering profession will be qualified in these subjects.  To help those who cannot attend the courses at the College of Commerce, correspondence courses are being made available and those who avail of them will certainly, by hard work and careful study, give a very good account of themselves.</P>
    <P>In addition to the correspondence courses, a number of seminars are to be organised a few times a year at which very practical, useful and valuable work will be undertaken, with, of course, the full support and co-operation of everybody who is anxious to raise the standard of the profession. The Minister agrees most readily that if there is any profession in Ireland today hard at work putting their own house in order it is the auctioneering profession; if there is any profession which has given an excellent account of its hard endeavours in that direction, it is the auctioneering profession.  I have met some students who have participated in these courses and I am glad to say they will be a credit to their profession, to their association and will render an excellent service to the general public of this country.  That is what we want.</P>
    <P>The Minister will again agree we are living in competitive times, in a new and modern world in which competition is keener than ever before, in which we can even now see that the day of the ordinary unskilled worker is finished in this country.  We are living in an age when he requires education, training and qualifications to fit him for his own job of work.  So it is that in relation to the real estate and auctioneering business the time has now come &mdash; again because of world changes and the keenness of competition, for which education is essential &mdash; when these courses are necessary to ensure that we have the best and most highly qualified people in the profession.  To those large firms in auctioneering &mdash; there are quite a number of them, very <Col N="1065" /> progressive &mdash; I should like to avail of this opportunity of expressing my thanks for facilitating the younger members of their staffs to participate in these courses.  If there are any auctioneering firms who, as yet, do not realise the value of these courses, I hope that in the interests of the younger members of their staffs and of those who are in the auctioneering profession, the members of whose families will follow them in the profession, apart from the home training, although I most readily agree there is nothing better, they too will avail of them.  I am sure that by the early 1970s those entering the profession will have a very high degree of qualification.</P>
    <P>May I repeat there is no intent whatever to make the profession a closed shop?  I want to assure the Minister that what we seek is to attract into the profession the best and most highly qualified personnel.  The qualification for these courses &mdash; as has been laid down &mdash; is that candidates must not be less than 18 years of age on the date of the examination, except in exceptional circumstances.  Candidates must satisfy the secretary of the association that their education is leaving certificate standard, with a pass in at least five subjects, including mathematics and English, or an equivalent examination; and, in exceptional circumstances, candidates over the age of 25 years, with a minimum of four years' experience and whose educational qualifications are not at this level, will be given special consideration.  Serious efforts of this kind to ensure the high standard of the profession are very necessary and I am sure the Minister and his Department appreciate that, whilst they are doing their part in introducing this desirable and helpful Bill, the auctioneers themselves are doing their part in educating, to the highest possible standards, those entering the profession.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one which has been more or less asked for by the association of auctioneers.  It is true to say we have not got everything we asked for but the Minister has met us very reasonably and favourably.  I hope this is not the end of legislation for auctioneers <Col N="1066" /> because I am sure, by the early 1970s, the Minister may see fit &mdash; when there is clear evidence of the results of these educational courses &mdash; to grant, by legislation, registration to Irish auctioneers.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for having acted on the representations made to him in respect of the matters involved in section 13 of the Bill.  I refer to page 3 of the explanatory memorandum on the Bill which states:</P>
    <P>This proposes that the provisions relating to the keeping of clients' moneys in a special client account, and the other provisions connected with those provisions, will not apply to the auctioning in a public market of fruit, vegetables or other primary products (apart from livestock) of agriculture or horticulture.</P>
    <P>When representations were made to the Minister on the difficulties of complying with these provisions, particularly where they concerned auctioneers engaged in the fruit and vegetable marketing business, the Minister acted on them and as I have shown, the provisions do not apply to such auctioneers. The Minister therefore met the profession's request reasonably and on behalf of all those engaged in the fruit and vegetable marketing business, I wish to express thanks.</P>
    <P>Again, I express wholeheartedly to the Minister the best thanks of the auctioneers' profession for the manner in which he has received us on many occasions.  He has spent many long hours with us, and with great patience examined the proposals laid before him.  I should like to think that this Bill is the result of these prolonged discussions.</P>
    <P>When I speak of co-operation between the auctioneers' profession, other professions and the Department of Justice, I feel I should pay a tribute to the secretary of the auctioneers association of long standing, Mr. Gray, for the manner in which he encouraged such widespread co-operation.  He has always been an example of devotion to duty and the results of the co-operation he has encouraged between the auctioneers' profession, other professions <Col N="1067" /> in the country and the Department of Justice are to be seen.  Particularly, very happy relations exist between the Department of Justice and the auctioneers' profession from which many desirable results have flowed.</P>
    <P>I wish again to assure the Minister that we are satisfied with the Bill.  We hope it will be the means of raising the standards and improving the services rendered so efficiently heretofore by the auctioneers of this country.  We can give a valuable service and we have been giving such a service.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Dunne pay a tribute to the standard of integrity of Irish auctioneers.  They have been giving a reliable, dependable, honest service.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm for me to comment that now that we have town planning legislation in operation, on many occasions local authorities and Government Departments will be seeking the advice of experts in valuation matters. I draw the Minister's attention to the highly qualified service available through the many trained valuers we have in the country and I suggest that the advice of these valuers should be called on by the Government and by local authorities on all occasions.  I appreciate that the appointment of valuers is not a function of the Minister for Justice but the Minister may use his good offices with the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers who may be concerned, to have the skill of our valuers availed of on all occasions when such expert advice is needed.  I may deal with that more fully in another way on another occasion but I should like to point out now that we have a highly specialised corps of valuers in the country whose training has included many years of experience.  I suggest that when public bodies need advice in this specialised field, it is to these valuers they will go and not to some other profession.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Minister for introducing this measure which I commend to the House.  I wish to assure him again that the auctioneers will do their part in no small way to maintain <Col N="1068" /> and to improve the efficiency of the service they give to the country and on which so many people depend.  We realise it is only the best who should be engaged in this profession and the Bill, together with the steps being taken by the auctioneers themselves, will help to achieve this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the House has approached this matter in a constructive way and I should like especially to thank Deputy Flanagan for the remarks he has made about me personally and about the Department.  The auctioneers' association at all stages were very helpful and constructive in their suggestions on the principles of the Bill and on some of the complex matters of detail which arose in regard to its drafting.  I found the association at all times helpful on the principles of the Bill and on the details, which, as I have said, became complex at one stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan laid considerable stress on the importance of getting into the profession people of character, fitness and financial stability.  This is very necessary because of the important trust capacity in which auctioneers find themselves from time to time.  To a greater degree than nearly every other profession or group in the community, they find themselves on many occasions trustees of substantial sums of money, and the lacuna in our legislation heretofore has been that there has not been any criterion or test for those in the profession other than the obtaining of a bond of £2,000, a relatively simple matter these days for most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I lay considerable stress on what to me is a key section in the Bill, section 12, which sets out that any person applying for a certificate of qualification, which has to be applied for to the District Court annually, from now on must furnish an accountant's certificate setting out that detailed records have been kept of the various transactions in which he or his firm has been engaged during the 12 months prior to the date of the application; and also setting out that the clients' moneys arising from these transactions have been kept separate from the <Col N="1069" /> auctioneer's personal account and, generally, certifying the accounts position of the auctioneer or firm in regard to client transactions.</P>
    <P>This precondition which is now inserted here, goes a very long way, I feel, to meeting what Deputy Flanagan referred to as being incorporated in section 10 of the New Zealand Act which requires the person to have a certificate of character and a certificate of his financial position.  I feel that much the same thing is done in practice in this particular section of our Bill, because the most practical concern in regard to an auctioneer is the position of his accounts and his financial stability.  I do not think a court need concern itself overmuch about character in the sense of going into what might be described as a moral field of investigation.  The important thing as far as the District Court is concerned is the financial stability of the man; how has he been behaving in regard to keeping his accounts separately and what is his financial situation in regard to his position as an auctioneer.  This, I feel, is the real test and the introduction of this test is an important matter in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Like any measure of this sort, the most important aspect is the aspect of prevention rather than the curative aspect.  The fact that each year prior to receiving his licence to operate as an auctioneer this provision is there whereby his financial position and the transactions which he has been negotiating and the records in regard to them can be fully reviewed by a district justice prior to granting the licence, I think is the surest guarantee that people in the profession will be, as Deputy Flanagan rightly said, people of financial stability who can be properly entrusted with clients' moneys.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred also to the question of ultimate registration of the profession.  This is a matter on which we can hold fire for the time being.  I welcome the fact that the auctioneers' profession is, as the Deputy put it, putting its house in order to a substantial extent and is, in fact, setting a headline to other groups in the community in this respect by providing educational <Col N="1070" /> and training facilities for its members to ensure that they are fully qualified and equipped to deal with complex problems that arise in regard to auctioneering.  I welcome this and look forward to further progress in this direction. Perhaps in some years' time we can look at the situation again and see what progress has been made by the profession in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to some matters of detail which are possibly more appropriate to Committee Stage. I shall have them examined between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I referred in my opening remarks to the increase in the bond from £2,000 to £5,000.  This, I do not think, will represent any undue burden on the profession.  As Deputy Flanagan pointed out, when £2,000 had to be obtained in 1947, it is not unreasonable to require that £5,000 be the bond in 1967 and I hope it will only mean an increase of some few pounds a year in the annual premium.  However, I do not lay such great stress on that aspect. The important matter is the furnishing of the accountant's certificate prior to the renewal of licence each year in the District Court.  This is the prevention aspect, the aspect intended to prevent people from going in careless directions. As I said, we have had very little evidence of fraud on the part of the auctioneering profession in regard to people who have got into trouble, but there is evidence of carelessness and negligence and people get into trouble in that way.  The furnishing of the certificate to the court each year will be a check for the auctioneer himself. It will be a check to prevent him getting into wrong ways and will enable the court to deal with him in a salutary fashion if he is going in a wrong direction by refusing to renew his licence.  This may prevent him getting into trouble and, as well as being a source of benefit to the community, will be to the benefit of the auctioneer himself by preserving a very desirable discipline in regard to his handling of moneys.</P>
    <P>This brings the auctioneers' profession into line with what has already been done in regard to the solicitors' <Col N="1071" /> profession.  As has been said, we have dealt with it here by way of statute and in the solicitors' profession, by way of internal regulation among themselves.  However, that is because they have had an association of very long standing and the auctioneers' association have only in recent years begun to move, as they themselves say, to put their house in order in this respect. However, the two measures run side by side and the two measures, the Solicitors Act and the regulations made thereunder and this Bill run side by side in ensuring the protection of the community and the protection of the practitioners concerned.  They are, I think, the two professions most concerned with the public in regard to trusteeship of moneys.</P>

      <P>It is not fully accurate: I meant in the principle of controlling the professions in regard to this question of handling clients' moneys.  I think they are comparable in that respect and certainly the fact that the auctioneers' profession in open court, must, as it were, reveal from now on its full financial situation in regard to clients' transactions is a more rigorous requirement than that pertaining in regard to the solicitors' profession.  It is a more rigorous form of check.</P>

I am raising it now for the purpose of hearing from the Minister whether he considered the matter further.  Perhaps it would be better to raise the matter when we come to the European section, or to the OECD, but as this section deals with diplomatic immunities, I thought I could raise it now.  It is in regard to the position of Irish people who may be assigned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present when the Bill was debated here but it is reported in the press that the Minister was invited to express an opinion as to what would happen if a citizen of this State is involved in a traffic accident with a diplomat and it transpires that the diplomat is not adequately insured.  The Minister pointed out that it was not possible under the normal diplomatic code for him to impose conditions on diplomats, which I fully understand.  Of course in our experience, in 999 cases out of 1,000, no problem arises because the diplomat can waive diplomatic immunity and accept the law, but we are well aware that the multiplicity of diplomatic representations all over the world is growing and it would not be impossible for a situation to arise in which a citizen of the State might find himself seriously injured and in the awkward situation that diplomatic immunity was claimed and no remedy was available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if there is any way in which, where a diplomatic mission did not indicate to the Minister its readiness to accept the normal jurisdiction of our courts in civilian actions arising from any such incident, the Minister would simply say to such diplomat: &ldquo;If you will not do it, we must do it,&rdquo; and have an understanding that where a diplomatic mission would not indicate to the Minister its intention of submitting to the civilian jurisdiction of the courts in matters of this kind, and without causing any international incident, the Minister could say: &ldquo;I must do it on your behalf and I will arrange with the appropriate insurance company to carry the risk which ordinarily in courtesy we would have expected your mission to carry&rdquo;, and thus ensure, without diplomatic upheaval, <Col N="1074" /> that the right of the aggrieved citizen of this State would in all circumstances be covered by the appropriate insurance if any accident should take place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has drawn attention to an aspect of diplomatic immunity which causes concern to a number of people.  However, we have found up to date that even where diplomats were not covered, in all cases the diplomats met their liability.  No State adhering to the Vienna Convention has the right to pursue an accredited diplomat to the courts, but we have the duty to pursue any diplomat who neglected to insure or who refused to pay adequate compensation arising out of injury or damage caused by a motor accident and we can in the ultimate analysis declare a diplomat who refused to pay up to be <i>persona non grata.</i></P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and others may say that that still leaves the injured party without his compensation.  I would say that in the last analysis if, having used all the pressure we could and gone to the extent of declaring the diplomat <i>persona non grata</i>, there was no other remedy left, the Dáil would have to consider the matter.  After all, it is the State which is granting these diplomats their immunity and we are doing it in the best interests of the State.  We are committed to give it under the Convention &mdash; we have no way out of that commitment, and therefore the Irish citizen, or the person who is injured on Irish roads, could in the last analysis appeal to the State, to the Government, to see that his compensation is forthcoming.  I do not think that in such circumstances, if they ever arose&mdash; I doubt if they would &mdash; a Minister would have any difficulty in getting the Dáil to pay the small sum involved, small from the point of view of the State but perhaps large and very significant for the person who has been injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a mountain out of a molehill.  I agree <Col N="1075" /> entirely with the Minister that the likelihood of such an incident arising is extremely remote.  I sympathise with the Minister's suggestion in regard to invoking the <i>persona non grata</i> ultimate sanction in order to remedy a situation of this kind.  However, it did occur to me that without creating any diplomatic uncomfortableness, it would be possible to say to a diplomatic mission: &ldquo;The Convention is there.  It was ratified. That gives rise to the possibility of civil action.  We fully recognise that the mission has no obligation to submit to our law but we would be glad to know if it is the intention to do so, so that we can take other appropriate measures to guard against the possibility of such accidents if the mission determines, in the exercise of its rights under the Convention, not to accept liability for such accidents.&rdquo;  That problem arises.</P>
      <P>Supposing the present situation remains and there is no party to sue. That is the present situation.  If the diplomatic mission refuses to submit to jurisdiction, there is no party to sue.  There is no court to determine the measure of the damage so when it comes to determining what compensation is suitable, the Minister must go to the Department of Finance and ask leave to bring in an <i>ad hoc</i> Supplementary Estimate as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the person injured, whereas if the Minister could think of some device whereunder he would stand in in any case where a diplomatic mission had declined to meet its liability, and would suffer himself to be sued for the tort of the diplomatic mission, then the amount of the damage could be fixed by the judiciary, whereafter the Minister could either rest on the insurance arrangements he had made or come to Dáil Éireann with a Supplementary Estimate for the amount of the damages fixed by the court in which he was the nominal defender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do think that the Minister is entirely right in saying that the problem here is miniscule, and rarely if ever arises, I can recall in my experience one or two occasions on which a diplomatic mission did claim diplomatic immunity, not in a matter of <Col N="1076" /> damages but in a matter of criminal law, and I think it would be a desirable thing, with all the talk there is about diplomacy and diplomats, to be able to say clearly to everyone that diplomatic immunity is a mutual convenience every nation affords every other nation, but that it is not done at the cost of any individual citizen of the State, and that where any tort is perpetrated by any member of a diplomatic mission there is a remedy.  We cannot say this under the present terms of the Convention.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it might be desirable to consider the possibility of creating a situation in which in the unlikely event of a diplomatic mission refusing to suffer itself to be sued in our courts, he would have power to suffer himself to be sued and seek from Dáil Éireann authority to pay whatever damages an independent judiciary might assess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would require an Act or a section of a Bill to cover the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon, for the Minister to stand in if an aggrieved party could not take a diplomatic representative to the courts to get compensation.  As I said in my first reply to Deputy Dillon, in the last analysis, if there is no remedy other than the State paying an Irish citizen who has been injured or whose property has been damaged in a motor car accident, the remedy would be to ask the Dáil to meet whatever reasonable compensation was necessary in that case.  There would be no difficulty in getting a decision as to what was a reasonable amount.</P>
      <P>However, there are many actions that could be taken before we come to that situation.  The ideal remedy is that the diplomats should always be insured.  We have in recent years taken steps to ensure that that will be so.  We have circularised them and we keep reminding them about it.  There is a question of seeing their insurances from time to time.  That is a matter which is under consideration.  That may be the way to meet it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole atmosphere surrounding immunity is affected by a Resolution passed at a United Nations conference on diplomatic intercourse and immunities.  In the Resolution we are speaking about, there were several sections.  The last two sections read:</P>
      <P>Mindful of the deep concern expressed during the deliberations of the Conference that claims of diplomatic immunity might, in certain cases, deprive persons in the receiving State of remedies to which they are entitled by law,</P>
      <P>Recommends that the sending State should waive the immunity of members of its diplomatic mission in respect of civil claims of persons in the receiving State when this can be done without impeding the performance of the functions of the mission, and that, when immunity is not waived, the sending State should use its best endeavours to bring about a just settlement of the claims.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the decision to waive or not to waive does not reside in the diplomat: it resides in his Government.  I do not think any Government could claim that if a diplomat has a car accident in a car that was necessary for the performance of his function and his mission, he should not pay compensation, if he had overlooked insurance.  I do not think-it necessary to go any further than we are going in this Bill &mdash; any further than the Convention and this Resolution go&mdash;but if, in the last analysis, by some combination of accidents, we find ourselves in a situation where an Irish citizen has been run down or his car has been hit by a car belonging to a diplomatic representative and there is no insurance and we cannot get compensation from the representative concerned then, finally, there is a remedy which could be taken here in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was made in the Seanad that where an international organisation appoints an Irish citizen as its representative or assigns certain functions or duties, or requests an Irish citizen to undertake, say, an investigation or to carry out any particular type of work on behalf of the organisation, that person should be free to accept such an assignment, such an appointment for the work designated, without securing the consent of the Government.  When the matter was before the Seanad, the Minister undertook to consider it further.  It does seem that this particular type of work is different from the work which one normally associates with diplomats or persons enjoying <Col N="1079" /> diplomatic status.  I suppose that, up to relatively recent years, when people carried out any form of representation or work, it was on behalf of a Government and, to that extent, they were accredited by one state or represented one state in the dealings with another and therefore were sent or assigned or undertook on behalf of the sending state a particular form of representation in the accepting state.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, with the very substantial growth in international organisations and the multiplicity of these bodies, as well as the wide ramifications which the work of international bodies and agencies have assumed, the older type of representation has been widened to a much greater extent.  We are all familiar with technical personnel of one type or another undertaking specified limited work on behalf of international organisations.  As this section is phrased, if, say, OECD or any of these international organisations decide to appoint an Irish person to undertake a particular assignment, or to perform what they consider specialised work, he or she may accept that assignment only with the consent of the Government.</P>
      <P>There are three likely results.  The body concerned, or a number of these international organisations, if they are put to that trouble, may say: &ldquo;Well, it is easier to get somebody else to do it&rdquo;, and therefore an Irish citizen who would benefit by this may not be selected.  Again, the organisation concerned and the Government may merely accede to these requests as a matter of form.  However, it does seem that the other likely result is that the organisation concerned will appoint people who are not Irish citizens and, to that extent, our citizens will lose by the non-selection of Irish people and the selection of outsiders to do the work.  As drafted, the section seems to be too wide.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether he has had an opportunity since the discussion in the Seanad of considering a possible amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose it will arise that frequently <Col N="1080" /> but, on the other hand, with the multiplicity of activities of various international organisations and the range of work which so many of these do from time to time, a great deal of this work is of a highly specialised nature, has no political significance in the internationally accepted interpretation of these matters and could be of no consequence in many cases except to the organisation concerned and, of course, to the affected interests here. Therefore, there was a strong view expressed in the Seanad of the provision taken here which states that where Irish citizens are appointed they may not be appointed except with the consent of the Government.  So far as I am aware, this proviso exceeds anything contained in similar legislation in most countries.  I think there is a difference between the wording here and that contained in other legislation. When the matter was before the Seanad some weeks ago, the Minister undertook to consider it further and perhaps he will indicate what conclusions he has reached?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition is right in saying that there were strong views expressed in the Seanad but there were two sets of views and they were both stated very strongly.  The first set of views was that in the Bill as it stood before the insertion of section 49, we were giving the right to somebody abroad to nominate an Irishman here to do some job of work for an international organisation, looking for statistics, writing appreciation of certain problems, and so on, and so forth, and that that would give this Irishman a licence to rampage around the country with complete immunity and that nobody could do anything to hold him responsible for his crimes against the community.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald stressed very heavily this aspect that we were giving this gentleman a licence.  He said:</P>
      <P>There is an absolute immunity there.  It is not qualified by any requirement that such person be named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He suggested there that before an <Col N="1081" /> Irishman had the right to claim these immunities by virtue of the assignment of some work to him by the Secretary-General of an outside organisation, at least, he should be named to the Government.  He said that, not only once, but several times.  That was in column 1391 of the Seanad Debates of 1st March, 1967, volume 62, In the same volume, at column 1394, the Senator said:</P>
    <P>Those people are being put in a privileged position.  First of all, there is the particular effect that arrest while such people are performing duties here is not covered.</P>
    <P>Again, he said:</P>
    <P>There is also the other provision which is very strange, whereby there is no requirement that they shall be named.</P>
    <P>Further, in the same column, he said:</P>
    <P>The mere fact that the Organisation employs them automatically gives this privilege.</P>
    <P>In column 1395, he said:</P>
    <P>I believe that they should at least be named by the Secretary-General of the OECD as being people who should properly enjoy this safety.</P>
    <P>Further down in the same column, he said:</P>
    <P>This automatic immunity should only be given to people to whom the Secretary-General wants to give it.</P>
    <P>I am giving only short extracts.  That is one set of opinions that were expressed very strongly by Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>I found it very difficult to credit that a Secretary-General would nominate somebody to work here without advising the Government, thereby giving them a chance to object, which I do not believe that either this Government or any other Government would do but, at least, it would be the courteous and the right thing for the Secretary-General to do.  International relations would be improved by the extension of such a courtesy.  On this matter of how representatives of organisations &mdash; and foreign States are included in that &mdash; are appointed, I would add&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction. I thought this only applied to organisations as distinct from States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  I want to point out that a number of these Conventions or agreements in the OECD, the Council of Europe and many others, were drafted and agreed to before the definitive international Convention on this, which was the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  When it came to setting down in writing what was usually and generally agreed, the privileges and immunities that should be granted to diplomatic and consular representatives, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations states in Article 8, which is given on page 15 of the Bill:</P>
      <P>1.  Members of the diplomatic staff of the mission should in principle be of the nationality of the sending State.</P>
      <P>2.  Members of the diplomatic staff of the mission may not be appointed from among persons having the nationality of the receiving State, except with the consent of that State which may be withdrawn at any time.</P>
      <P>3.  The receiving State may reserve the same right with regard to nationals of a third State who are not also nationals of the sending State.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that if this Vienna Convention had been agreed to away back in 1945, all the agreements on the immunities and privileges of the representatives of these international organisations would have been based on that Convention. However, we have to take the matter as it stands.  We agreed to the OECD Convention and the protocol setting out the immunities. We cannot give a direction to the Secretary-General that he should carry out the normal procedure of advising the Government when he is going to appoint an official who will be operating in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not regard some expert who got a fee for writing a paper on any particular subject for the Secretaryin <Col N="1083" /> General of the United Nations or the Secretary-General of OECD as being in full employment.  He gets a fee for producing a paper.  However, Senator FitzGerald certainly left a number of Senators under the impression that, if something were not done, the Irish people were going to face great danger from the gallivantings of people appointed by one or other of these international organisations even to write a paper.  I thought the right thing to do was to introduce section 49, which I think is very reasonable and is in conformity with Article 8 of the Vienna Convention.</P>
    <P>Section 49 says:</P>
    <P>Officials of an international organisation, community or body referred to in this Act or an organisation to which this Part applies serving in the State or persons performing duties in the State assigned to them by any such organisation, community or body shall not be appointed from among persons who are Irish citizens except with the consent of the Government, and the consent may be withdrawn at any time.</P>
    <P>I think the Leader of the Opposition will agree with me that no Government, this Government or any future Government, would dream of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;, if the Secretary-General of OECD or the Council of Europe inform them they propose to appoint a certain Irishman to do some work here, writing or studying some problem that was affected by our local conditions. But it gives an assurance to people who might become excited by what Senator FitzGerald said that it is not going to happen.  It would be only a reasonable thing for the Secretary-General to let us know if he was going to station somebody here for a time, whether a foreigner or an Irishman, somebody who would be employed by him and working in Ireland.  I have no doubt that anybody so selected by the Secretary-General to do some work for him would be acceptable to the Irish Government.</P>
    <Col N="1084" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one point.  I think there is a distinction between these organisations and the normal diplomatic representation covered by Article 8 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  I agree that normally there is not much likelihood of somebody writing or reporting on a matter in a fashion that would in some way or other show a particular aspect of the country in an unfavourable light.  On the other hand, there is an advantage in many cases in having people familiar with the country, though in certain circumstances it might be argued that an outsider might be in a position to undertake a more objective examination or investigation.</P>
      <P>Looking at the particular report which, I suppose, we are all most familiar with on which this has arisen &mdash; the OECD Report &mdash; this is based on data supplied by the different affected Government Departments here.  The statistical information and other facts included in that report are based entirely on information supplied by the appropriate Government Departments, but the final conclusions are deduced by the OECD authorities and are expressed as their views or opinions.  It seems to me, therefore, there is a distinction between a diplomat representing a Government or a person representing a State &mdash; whatever his status, whether an ambassador or a person of subordinate rank &mdash; and the person assigned a particular function for the purpose of a specific investigation or inquiry by a specialised agency or organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that if this section were amended in some way by saying &ldquo;With the consent of the Government, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.&rdquo;  It might cover the objections made and, at the same time, grant the powers which I think in all the circumstances are reasonable enough, provided there was no suggestion that these consents would be unreasonably withheld.  It might be that a particular person was selected by an international organisation because of his known views, even his political views or any other views, on <Col N="1085" /> a particular matter, and the Government of the time might object to him. If that particular organisation felt he was the best person qualified to undertake it, then the fact that a person might hold views that were in some way or other different from those of the Government might mean that the consent which would normally be given would not be given.  It is hardly likely to arise in many cases.  If this section were amended by the inclusion of the words &ldquo;such consent not to be unreasonably withheld&rdquo;, the safeguard that some people think necessary is provided, while at the same time reserving the right of the Government, acting, I suppose, on the advice of the Minister, to have the necessary powers, which would be in line with the phraseology of Article 8 of the Vienna Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition can be assured that the consent of the Government would not be unreasonably withheld if the Secretary-General of an organisation wishes to have a representative who is an Irishman resident here in the State. Deputy Cosgrave has not fixed in his mind that this refers to somebody who is doing a little research, producing a paper, in fact producing a paper for himself so that he can send it to the secretary of one of these organisations and get a fee for it or perhaps not get a fee for it.  It is not necessary for the performance of that sort of work that the person concerned should have the privileges and immunities of an ambassador.  That would be putting an Irishman into a position in which he could escape if he committed some offence against one of his fellow citizens, and it is not necessary in relation to that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it comes to the point where one of these organisations sets up office here &mdash; and the United Nations has several offices all over the world &mdash; I think it is right that, whether it is the United Nations, the Council of Europe or the OECD, the secretary-general, if he wishes to have a standing office of that kind, should propose to the Government concerned the setting up of this office and that he proposes to appoint <Col N="1086" /> an official to run it, whether he is an Irishman or a non-national.  Particularly is it right and proper that he should do so if the person to whom he proposes to give the position is an Irish citizen resident here.  Apart from that, the phrase which Deputy Cosgrave has suggested, that such consent should not be unreasonably withheld, goes without saying.</P>
    <P>If section 49 is studied very closely, it will be seen that it does not prevent a secretary general appointing somebody, if he wants to do it, but it does prevent that person going into court and claiming that, because he has got an appointment from the secretary-General of one of these organisations, even though the Government here knew nothing about it, he is above the law, that he is in a privileged position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his fellow citizens.  As I pointed out, it did not occur to us to include this section when the Bill was being drafted, but when Senator FitzGerald raised this point, I could see he was going to create a scare.  I took what steps I could to prevent any scare, and I think this is a reasonable section.</P>

      <P>May I raise a point with the Minister of the recruitment and status of Irish nationals serving in these organisations, OECD, FAO, the Council of Europe, the United Nations, and so on?  I take it that in the majority of instances, they are Civil Service personnel; in fact, they would have to be to join an organisation like that to be effective and efficient.  What is the procedure that is usually adopted when an application is made by an Irish civil servant for a transfer to one of these international organisations?  I take it that he is seconded from the Irish Civil Service and that he becomes <i>ipso facto</i> an international civil servant.  When he is transferred to this international civil service, does he carry his full pension rights and other rights with him to these international organisations, or is he only transferred for a longer or shorter period and does he ultimately come back to the Irish Civil Service and have full pension rights and time allowed to him for such period as he served abroad?  This has nothing to do <Col N="1087" /> with the discussion that has taken place in relation to a particular service a person may carry out in another country, for instance, writing a paper, as the Minister said, but, generally speaking it seems to me that if a civil servant is transferred to one of these international organisations, he would automatically become an international civil servant and therefore would come under the direct control and discipline of the head of such an organisation who is usually designated as the secretary general.  I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify this point.</P>

      <P>These international organisations are not bound to appoint only civil servants.  The United Nations Organisation employs more Irish people than any of these other organisations, and in the case of an Irish civil servant being offered employment by the United Nations, he asks leave of his Minister to take it up.  He may be offered temporary employment or he may be offered a lifetime employment. In the case of temporary positions, we have a number of civil servants who are experts in either an administrative or a technical capacity and, if they leave for a few years, they can come back again into the Civil Service. They do not sever their relations with the Irish Civil Service.  There are, then, the other cases in which people are offered lifetime employment in pensionable posts in the United Nations; in that case they sever their connection with the Irish Civil Service.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>It has already been announced publicly that the factory of Donnelly (Dublin) Ltd., has been acquired by Clover Meats Ltd., and is to continue in production.  As regards the other factory mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell, I understand that the new proprietors have not as yet decided on their future policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of pigs killed at bacon factories in 1964, 1965 and 1966 were as follows: 1964, 1,567,000; 1965, 1,797,000; 1966, 1,643,000.  The number <Col N="1096" /> killed in January and February, 1967 was 233,000 compared with 285,000 in the corresponding month of 1966.  It is expected that the present reduced level of pig production will persist for some time yet but an upturn in production is envisaged later in the year.  With a view to assisting the bacon curing industry to meet the situation created by the lower level of pig supplies I have reduced from 18/- to 12/- per pig, with effect from 1st April, the levy which curers pay as a contribution towards the cost of supporting pig meat exports.</P>
    <P>The means by which it is hoped to achieve the 1970 pig production target include a system of guaranteed minimum prices for good quality pigs, grants for the erection and improvement of piggeries and various breed improvement schemes.  Due to these measures the level of pig production in 1965 was, in fact, a post-war record while the 1966 level was the second highest since the war.  When it became clear last year that a decline in production was likely the Government announced a new scheme of grants for farrowed sows and the grants for pig rearing and fattening houses were increased.</P>
    <P>Since last summer the prices paid by the bacon factories have been substantially higher than the guaranteed minimum prices and this should provide a further stimulus to increased pig production.  I am, however, keeping the pig supply situation under continuous review with a view to taking such further measures as may be appropriate to achieve an increased level of production.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Second Programme for Economic Expansion envisaged something over two million pigs and that our bacon factories are geared to deal with that number of pigs?  At present there are only 24,000 pigs per week going to the factories.  Does the Minister not agree that a crisis faces the bacon industry and that something will have to be done to remedy the situation? Does he not consider that the greatest help he could give the small farmers at the present time is to subsidise the price of meal.</P>

If the situation in the west of Ireland should deteriorate, would he consider, by way of transport subsidy, equalisation of bacon prices &mdash; produced in western factories &mdash; with that of bacon produced in factories more accessible to export points?  Secondly, does he appreciate, when he gives us the figures of 1.567 million, 1.797 million and 1.643 million of pigs passing through bacon factories, that those figures are arrived at after having virtually eliminated pork exports which did <Col N="1098" /> constitute in the past a very valuable export over and above the volume of pork delivered to the bacon factories?</P>

      <P>The first matter raised by the Deputy has been looked at and will continue to be looked at if circumstances should arise which would dictate that something of this nature was required.  In so far as pork killings are concerned, it is true that to some degree, the export of pork to a reasonably profitable market has been curtailed in order that we should go as near as possible to filling our quality bacon export quota.  That is the actual situation at the moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices for store cattle have been moving upwards for several months past and at present are not appreciably below the level of prices at this time last year.  The average price per live cwt. for store bullocks at Dublin Market on 29th March was 169/- as compared with 173/- at the corresponding market in 1966.  Exports of store cattle to Britain so far this year have been showing an improvement on exports in the early part of 1966 and the recent increase of 5/- per live cwt. in the guaranteed price for cattle under the British Fatstock Guarantee Scheme should tend to strengthen the trade.</P>
      <P>Since last autumn we have developed an export trade in young feeder cattle to Italy and so far about 4,000 head have been shipped.  Every effort is being made to develop this useful trade.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to remind cattle producers and exporters of the desirability of spreading exports of cattle over as long a period of the year as is possible.  Prices of both store cattle and fat cattle are normally at the seasonally lowest points in the late autumn when the supplies coming on the market are heavy.  It is to everybody's disadvantage and is liable to cause market upsets if too great a proportion of our exports take place at that time of the year.  I fully realise the practical considerations involved but I would urge producers and exporters to do everything they can to distribute their exports more evenly over the year and, in particular, to avoid overloading the market in September, October and November.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister knows that the price of young cattle, especially suck calves, makes them unsaleable at the present time and that the small farmer is dependent on these?  He has spoken about the glut in our exports in the autumn. <Col N="1100" /> Surely he should realise that the best way to get over that is the setting up of a marketing board?

      <P>But the Minister stated that one of the reasons for the drop in price is the glut of our exports in the autumn and he wants to see a more even distribution of our exports during the year.  I am putting it to him that the ideal way to do that is to set up a proper marketing board to deal with this, have stability and continuity of exports throughout the year and not have these hills and hollows, or ups and downs of exports.</P>

He is also aware that I said &mdash; as he quoted me as saying &mdash; that there was a drop in cattle, or that this was the cause of the drop.  I merely took the opportunity of reminding producers and exporters of the desirability of trying to spread their selling a little more widely rather than have a glut in the latter part of the year, if that is possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The tariffs and other restrictions on the import of cattle into the Member States of the EEC have not been removed.</P>
      <P>Under the EEC Beef Regulation, which has been in operation since November, 1964, changes in market prices inside and outside the Community affect from week to week the amount of the variable levy payable on imports of cattle in addition to the import duty which does not vary. Movements in market prices have resulted in there being no levy on imports of cattle into Belgium since 20th February, and on imports into the Netherlands since 27th March but levy is still payable on imports into France, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg.  These levy changes result from market price conditions and not from any alteration of the import regulations.</P>
      <P>However, as a result of a recent decision by the EEC Council of Ministers governing the level of the national guide prices determined by the Member States for the year beginning this week these guide prices are being increased generally and the higher level of protection which this involves seems likely to make trade with the EEC difficult for us and other supplying countries during the coming 12 months.</P>

      <P>The final interpretation of the results of tests carried out under the BTE Scheme is a matter for my Department.  This is done on the basis of the test reports furnished by the veterinary surgeons and other relevant information.</P>
      <P>In the Glencar area, all the animals which were classed as reactors by my Department's veterinary officers have been purchased.  A number of other animals which had been tagged by the private veterinary surgeon were adjudged to be inconclusive, and these will be tested again.  If they are then deemed to be positive reactors, my Department will be prepared to purchase them.  The new tests will be carried out as soon as the regulations permit.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what travel grants are available from his Department for groups travelling abroad for study of sales promotion; how such grants are paid; what are the conditions as to availability; and where forms of application may be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operate a Technical Assistance Scheme under which, subject to the availability of funds from the amount provided <Col N="1106" /> for the purpose by Dáil Éireann in any financial year, applications are considered from eligible concerns for technical assistance grants of up to one half of the cost of study visits abroad for certain purposes.  The scheme is open to:</P>
      <P>(a)  industries or firms engaged in the processing of agricultural commodities or fish or in activities closely related to the production, processing or distribution of agricultural commodities or fish and</P>
      <P>(b)  trade organisations of such industries.</P>
      <P>Grants are made in respect of visits abroad by representatives of the management&mdash;or of management and labour jointly&mdash;of eligible firms and industries to study aspects of industrial organisation where the cost to the sponsor of the visit is not less than £20 per representative.  The scheme does not provide for grants for sales promotion.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Scheme of Technical Assistance Grants for agricultural industries, my Department are also prepared to consider the provision of grants for visits abroad for purposes of study or technical training by representatives of organisations closely associated with agriculture or fisheries, applications being considered on the particular merits of each case.</P>
      <P>A grant under the Department's Technical Assistance Scheme is not normally paid until the visit abroad has been completed and necessary vouchers furnished to my Department together with a short report on the visit.</P>
      <P>Application for grants must be made to my Department and approval obtained before the visit abroad takes place.  Each application must include particulars of the duration, estimated cost and benefit expected to accrue from the proposed visit.  There is no specific application form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his Department have investigated the desirability of manufacturing fish flour or fish protein concentrate for export to countries where people now lack protein in their diets; and if in view of the fact that the Food and Drug Administration in the USA have found this fish product to be safe for human consumption he will make a general statement as to whether such a manufacturing process would increase the outlets for locally caught fish and would enable this country to make high protein content food available cheaply to underdeveloped countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have been following with interest developments abroad towards the production for human consumption of a wholesome and acceptable fish protein concentrate &mdash; also known as fish flour &mdash; but as far as I am aware, production on a commercial scale for human consumption has not so far been undertaken in America or in Europe.  The Food and Drug Administration in the USA have subject to certain stringent requirements, recently approved of the use in human diets of fish protein concentrate made from whole fish, but <Col N="1108" /> while the costs of producing, distribution and selling the product have been projected they have not yet been commercially proved.  Production in Ireland would essentially be a matter for private enterprise but both my Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be only too pleased to give anybody interested in setting up a factory here all the information at our disposal as to the present stage of development of the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether a factory producing fish meal could use certain types of fish or certain portions of fish at one and the same time to produce the type of human protein mentioned in this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this very high protein concentrate can and is physically capable of being produced. Apparently it has, in fact, been produced in some other countries and the claim is that it can be made from whole fish, not just any selected fish or any selected parts of selected fish.  The whole question at the moment would appear to be whether it is commercially a useful undertaking.  My personal information on this is that it has not been commercially proved.  We had a discussion on it with a gentleman from the US who has been interested in this for some time.  He believes it can be commercially done and he is doing the animal concentrate at the moment.  He feels that this is quite a big thing in the future, particularly for those hungry countries, the countries in which there is a shortage of food.  The information I have from this particular individual would indicate that it can be done &mdash; he was quite enthusiastic about its potentialities &mdash; but our official information is that so far it is not commercially proved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>No.  It probably could, although that is rather technical.  Food <Col N="1109" /> regulations are involved.  When I speak of the commercial possibilities, I mean the commercial aspect of it, not whether there is a market for it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is satisfied in respect of the Dublin city and county, including Dún Laoghaire, that the firefighting facilities and equipment as well as the water pressure are adequate to deal with the present population of the areas concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The obligation to make provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires is imposed on sanitary authorities by the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  Due to the fact that expenditure on the fire service is completely rate-borne, the acquisition of equipment is a matter for the sanitary authority.  My Department has, however, encouraged these authorities by means of circular letters and inspections to provide themselves with the most modern firefighting equipment available.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the firefighting facilities, equipment and water pressures in respect of Dublin city and county including Dún Laoghaire, are generally adequate to meet the requirements of the areas.  The general question of the firefighting arrangements is kept under constant review in my Department and in any case where equipment or water pressure appears to be inadequate, my Department urges the sanitary authority to remedy the deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone recognises the skill and efficiency with which the firefighting personnel perform their functions but is the Minister satisfied that with the growth of the population in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire the firefighting facilities are adequate?  The growth of population means more premises and is the Minister satisfied that firefighting facilities are now adequate to deal with the situation? The Minister is aware that recently there were a number of serious fires. There was the serious fire in the church in Dún Laoghaire; there was the fire in the city; and recently there was a fire on the outskirts of the town of Bray where certainly the water pressure was inadequate.  Is the Minister satisfied that adequate investigation is made to keep the facilities, the water pressure and other equipment, up to the demands of the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I am satisfied.  In Dún Laoghaire some improvements are being made at present.  In regard to the fire in Dublin city, it is not correct to say that there was any deficiency of water pressure on the occasion in question. Having regard to the fire in Bray, the deficiency in water pressure arose because of the private supply to the hotel in question.  The pressure was adequate in the Dublin Corporation main.</P>

    <P>I am advised by the county council to the following effect: &mdash; The reconstruction of the Dublin/Naas Road had to be rephased in recent months due to the institution of an action for an injunction to restrain the county council from proceeding with the construction of a dual-carriageway highway at a premises near Blackchurch. This necessitated a revision of the work programme, and during the period in question emphasis has been placed on earth works and drainage rather than actual road-laying which might account for the impression that the scheme was being delayed.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1956-57 subsidy was paid by my Department on loan charges incurred by Cork Corporation and other urban authorities in providing <Col N="1128" /> dwellings, at the rate of 66.2/3 per cent of these charges where the dwellings were provided for persons displaced from unfit or over-crowded houses, left homeless through the collapse or destruction of their dwellings, or in need of rehousing on medical, compassionate or other similar grounds where their circumstances would not permit them to be rehoused otherwise.  In a limited number of cases where houses were provided by the authority for other persons, the lower subsidy rate of 33.1/3 per cent applied.  For the greater part of 1966-67, prior to the operation of the Housing Act, 1966, the conditions applying to subsidy for local authority houses in urban areas were broadly the same as in 1956-57.</P>
      <P>In 1956-57 these subsidies were paid only on loan charges on the part of the cost up to £2,000 for a flat and £1,500 for a serviced house, irrespective of size.  In 1966-67 the corresponding limits were £2,200 and £1,650 respectively.</P>
      <P>The average subsidy paid to the Cork Corporation for a serviced house built in 1956-57 and at the then current interest rate was about £55 a year and the total subsidy payment to the Corporation came to £96,588.  The average subsidy for a house built by the Corporation in 1966-67 is estimated at about £80 a year per house and the subsidy payment totalled £225,846, excluding any adjustment which may fall to be made as the result of the recent extension of the city boundary.</P>
      <P>The approximate average cost of a local authority house in Cork city in 1956-57 and in 1966-67 was of the order of £1,660 and £2,620 respectively.

      <P>The house in question was inspected on 13th January, 1967 and was passed for payment on 26th January, 1967. Where there is evidence of an illegal no-rates campaign the inquiries which are now being made as to whether particular applicants for grants have paid their rates inevitably result in delays in the payment of grants in those cases, including the present case, where rates have not yet been paid. Further inquiries are being made in this and other cases as to whether there are special features involved.</P>

Is <Col N="1131" /> the Minister not aware that this lady is a widow whose house, for all practical purposes, fell a couple of years ago and that for the past couple of years she has been doing everything possible to get a house built?  With the assistance of the Land Commission, who agreed to give her a loan of £500, she built this house but the Land Commission loan is being held up because the Minister will not pay the grant.

They cannot be maintained without the finances to operate them.  Therefore, I consider I have a responsibility to make myself aware of whether or not the illegal campaign to deprive the community of these services is effective.  Certain inquiries have to be made which inevitably result in delays, since this is additional to the normal work of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to similar questions put down by him on 7th July, 1965, in which I supplied the available relevant particulars for the five year <Col N="1145" /> period ended 30th June, 1965.  From that date to 31st March, 1967, a total of 460 properties purchased for land bonds amounting in nominal value to some £2.08 million vested in the Land Commission while, in the same period, purchase moneys aggregating about £2.3 million in respect of 533 properties were allocated.</P>
      <P>An investigation just made in the case of lands purchased or acquired for land bonds shows that in recent times the average time-leg between the date of vesting of a property in the Land Commission and the date of allocation of the purchase money is 9½ months approximately.  This contrasts sharply with the period of 27 months to which I referred in my reply to the Deputy's previous questions of 7th July, 1965 and constitutes ample evidence that the various measures taken in recent times to streamline the procedures for examination of title and allocation of purchase moneys have led to a marked improvement in this sector.</P>
      <P>I might add that the number of titles at present pending for investigation by Examiners is only 8 and the documents relating to all these have been lodged within the past month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that one possibility is that the delay might be due to the fact that there is inadequate legal staff and would he care to look at the matter from that angle and see if the period could be shortened?  Personally, I feel that 9½ months is rather a long time to wait to be paid when you have sold something to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the factor, amongst other factors, of insufficiency of staff at one period when the Deputy previously questioned me on this matter.  The Deputy will appreciate that the period is now down to 9½ months.  I am not personally satisfied with 9½ months but there are some factors, as the Deputy will appreciate, that are not attributable to delay on the Land Commission side.  Sometimes possession is not given and this figure represents the overall position.  However, <Col N="1146" /> I am keeping the matter under review to see if we could get a further reduction in the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to mislead the Deputy.  I can say the units on offer are much smaller as time goes on.  Where formerly an offer might comprise 1,000 or 2,000 acres, the average is down now to figures considerably below that in aggregate. I would prefer if the Deputy put down a separate question as to the comparability of these figures with the former intake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate there has been a reduction in planting from 25,000 acres annually to 20,000 acres?  Is it <Col N="1147" /> not a fact that that reduction was possibly due to the situation obtaining in which there is not sufficient land on offer or is it due to the fact that there is more delay in assessing, valuing and buying the land than heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction to 20,000 acres was made, as I explained to the Dáil, because of the financial circumstances at that time.  We will be back now to 25,000 acres.  I have made it clear to the Dáil from time to time that I am not happy with the reserve of land to try to maintain that programme and it is creating a problem for us.  We would need much more land in reserve than we have in order to maintain a steady planting programme of 25,000 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, a long term forecast of thinning production from State forests was completed in 1963.  Details of the forecast have been made available to manufacturers and other interested persons and groups.  In the years that have elapsed since completion of the forecast actual thinning production figures have proved to be reasonably close to the forecast figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>While that may be so, <Col N="1148" /> I can say that the forecasts the factories got were fulfilled as far as the Forestry Division were concerned. Some of these factories have very substantially increased their productivity. When they came for forecasts to my Department at the beginning, their requirements then were far less than they are now, due to increased business. We cannot cut down an issue of forest just to keep them going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not factually true.  In 1962-63, the forecast was 3.3 million cubic feet hoppus, and the thinnings produced 3.1 million cubic feet hoppus; in 1963-64, the forecast was 3.6 million cubic feet hoppus and 3.1 million was produced; in 1964-65, the forecast was 3.9 million and 3.5 million was produced; in 1965-66, the forecast was 4.3 million cubic feet hoppus, and 4.5 million cubic feet hoppus was produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>These people are continuously in touch with my Department through the trade.  What I have stated is correct.  With an expanding industry, the plans of many of these people have been changed.  They need much more raw material now, due to increased throughput and expanding markets, than they did when they started.  We will give them as much thinnings as we possibly can.

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands the estimated reduction in employment by his Department owing to the reduction in the rate of planting in State forests from 25,000 acres to 20,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Many factors influence the level of employment on State afforestation and it is not possible to define precisely the effect which the alteration of the planting programme had on employment in a single year.  It is estimated however that a reduction of about 110 men or about 2½ per cent of the potential labour force was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in my constituency of Wexford there has been a reduction in the employment of personnel in all State forests?  My information is that that reduction is due to the reduction in the planting acreage from 25,000 to 20,000 and that that, apparently, is the only factor.  If there are any other factors, would the Minister care to indicate what they are and if there is likely to be an improvement in the near future?  People who have been employed for up to 15 years have been let go in these different forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking&mdash; to mention a couple of the factors&mdash; they are increased techniques in the Forestry Division through work study and the increased use of machinery. An overriding factor may be the shortage of land in any particular area. The Deputy will appreciate that, where there is a forestry centre and the seasonal work there finishes and there is not additional land for planting, some of these men must go.  These are some of the factors.  The Deputy asked me about the country as a whole.  I could not break this down in respect of County Wexford.  However, in so <Col N="1151" /> far as one can judge and taking into account all these different factors, the reduction in the potential labour force last year was 2½ per cent.</P>

The staff of the Establishment Section, which deals with the administration of the Department generally, was&mdash;again excluding messengers, cleaners, etc.&mdash;65.  It may be taken that the great majority of the remaining 231 were, broadly speaking, dealing with the Defence Forces but it would not be practicable to segregate <Col N="1154" /> those dealing with the FCA and other classes of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The number of personnel of all ranks in the Permanent Defence Force on 28th February, 1967, was 8,415. The effective strength of the FCA was 18,016.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot see my way to introduce the legislation suggested by the Deputy, as the charge for duty on real estate, including freehold registered land is a most valuable safeguard so far as the collection of estate duty and succession duty is concerned. In referring to the avoidance of unnecessary expense the Deputy presumably has in mind the expense involved in obtaining a certificate of discharge from death duties.  Since this certificate is obtainable free of charge from the Revenue Commissioners, the only expense involved is the solicitor's charge for obtaining it; and normally this constitutes only a small element in the vendor's total costs.</P>

    <P>1.  Net produce of Income Tax is the estimated ultimate yield from the tax assessed in a given year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> 2.  The figures in column (2) include, so far as Sur-tax is concerned, the <i>net receipt</i> of Sur-tax for each of the years specified in column (1).</P>
    <P>3.  Figures of the net produce of Income Tax under Schedule E are not available for any year subsequent to 1962-63 in consequence of the introduction of the system of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; in 1963-64 following on recommendations in the Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  However, it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the <i>net receipt</i> of Schedule E tax since it consists almost wholly of tax collected under P.A.Y.E. and under Rule 11 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E. In the circumstances the figures for Income Tax included in columns (2) and (3) for 1965-66 are net receipt figures and not figures of net produce.  The percentage figure for 1965-66 in column (4) should be read accordingly.</P>
    <P>4.  The figure of total net produce of Income Tax for 1960-61 included in column (2) and the net produce of Income Tax under Schedule E shown for that year in column (3) are not comparable with the corresponding figures for earlier years because, in arriving at the net produce figures for 1960-61, deductions estimated at £4,150,000 were allowed in respect of the abatement (i.e., one-half of the net tax for the year 1960-61) provided for by Section 14 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959, in the case of emoluments coming within the scope of Pay As You Earn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the likely advent of free trade and the urgent necessity to assist and encourage the business community to prepare itself for the increased competition by reinvestment of its profits in modern plant and equipment and to establish adequate financial resources, he will consider introducing a lower rate of taxation on undistributed profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a lower rate of tax on undistributed profits, apart from its budgetary implications, would not of itself ensure that retained profits are in fact ploughed back or reinvested.  In any event, profits ploughed back into a business by the purchase of machinery or plant and the construction of industrial buildings are, through the operation of initial and annual allowances, freed completely from charge.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, having regard to the adverse effect on the building industry and on shopfitting specialists, in particular, caused by the increase of valuations in respect of improvement and modernisation of shops and shopfronts, he will introduce legislation to prevent valuation increases at least for a period in respect of shop improvement and modernisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>The administration of the valuation code is assigned under statute to the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> The matter of valuation increases arising out of shopfitting alternations was recently discussed between the Commissioner and representatives of the interests concerned.  It will be appreciated that the revision of valuations by reference to the improvement or disimprovement of premises is inherent in the system of valuation laid down by the statutes.</P>
    <P>Under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Acts, 1954 to 1966, relief has already been provided in respect of valuation increases resulting from improvements and modernisation of shops and shopfronts. A two-thirds reduction of the valuation increase is allowed for the period of seven years following completion of works of this kind.  This is a substantial concession, and, having regard to the need for limiting exemptions in order to avoid an inequitable distribution of the rates burden, I would not be prepared to introduce legislation to give any greater measure of exemption.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is proposed to introduce legislation which will provide for a more equitable levying of rates in Dublin city and so bring relief to the overburdened occupiers of private dwellings who are in receipt of small pensions, low fixed incomes, low wages or small salaries.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to the statement made by the Minister for Local Government in reply to a question asked on 2nd March, 1966, about the financing of local rates.  The Government are still open to consider informed criticism of the Interdepartmental Committee's Report on Valuation <Col N="1169" /> for Rating Purposes, which was published as a White Paper in October, 1965.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the type of people referred to, would the Minister not do something to speed up this matter?  There is an obvious need for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most complicated matter in the country.  As the Deputy knows, this interdepartmental committee has been sitting for some time.  It issued a report which the Government published in October, 1965.  Comment from the general public and interested parties on that report has been very meagre and very disappointing, but the committee is still sitting and still carrying out its examination and it would be premature, I think, to take any action at this stage without having a complete review of the whole situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Commissioner of Valuation does not initiate revision of valuations.  The initiative lies with the local authorities.  The Commissioner of Valuation must comply with the prescribed statutory procedure in any case referred to him by the local authorities.  I cannot interfere with the statutory procedure relating to the revision of valuations.</P>
      <P>Any person aggrieved by reason of an increase in valuation has the right of appeal, subject to compliance with the procedures and dates laid down in the Valuation Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the situation is archaic in the extreme?  I understand the law has been there for over 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to that.  One is that the law in itself is in need of clarification and consolidation.  I would hope to initiate some action on that in the near future. The other is whether or not this House would be ready to face up to a complete revaluation of the whole country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the rateable valuation of many houses in the Rathmines and Rathgar areas of Dublin city have recently been substantially increased; if he is aware that very serious hardship is being caused to many people by such increases; the reason why the Commissioner of Valuation has revalued so many properties in the areas; his authority for so doing; and if he will introduce legislation to relieve ratepayers in necessitous circumstances who have had increases imposed on them.</P>

    <Col N="1171" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any increase in the valuation of houses in the districts referred to from 1st March, 1967 was effected in each case under the statutory procedure which obliges the Commissioner of Valuation to undertake the revision of valuation of any premises if requested by the local authority to do so.  An increase in valuation would be called for in any case where the existing valuation of the premises is found to be substantially below the level which would reflect the present net annual letting value.  A frequent reason for increases is that houses formerly valued as family dwellings were found to have been subdivided into flats, apartments, or bedsittingrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the reference to hardship in the Deputy's question, I am not aware that the position is as represented. Moreover, in any case to which <Col N="1172" /> a reconstruction grant relates the revision of valuation consequent on such reconstruction would not come into force for seven years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, I would refer him to the reply given by me to Questions Nos. 113 and 114.</P>

      <P>I would, however, draw the Deputy's attention to the increased provisions in the 1967-68 Estimates Volume for special employment schemes now administered by the Department of Local Government and to the substantial provisions in the Capital Budget 1967 for such items as building and construction, tourism, agriculture, forestry and fisheries.  The increased expenditure under all these heads will be of direct and indirect benefit, to the smallholders mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no objection to the publication of particulars of ground rents and, <Col N="1176" /> with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement showing the amounts of ground rents payable in respect of such of the premises listed in reply to Question No. 36 on the 14th March, 1967, as are subject to those rents.  I do not see that any useful purpose would be served by a calculation of the rate per square foot of office space in these cases.</P>
    <P>No decision has yet been taken in regard to the purchase of the ground rents concerned, pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1967.  It is not to be expected that there will be a short term purchase plan.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Finance what progress has been made regarding the drainage of the Woodford canal, Ballyconnell, County Cavan, since his predecessor met a deputation of public representatives and others on the subject on the 12th June 1963; and if he will make a statement on the matter <Col N="1181" /> having regard to the importance of the drainage of this canal to the local farmers and to the tourist industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Woodford Canal is in the Erne Catchment.  The Erne is a large and complex catchment presenting many problems.  It was explained to the deputation in 1963 that, when the Erne came to be considered under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, it was decided to survey in the first instance the main portion of the catchment entirely in our own territory and outfalling through Belturbet in order to avoid the delay and difficulties posed by border rivers such as the Woodford. The deputation was told also that the survey of the border rivers including the Woodford would be taken up when actual work had been started on the scheme for the area upstream of Belturbet.</P>
      <P>The normal engineering survey for that project had at that time been carried out but, following discussions with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in order to minimise interference with the fishing in the area, it was found necessary to make a special sounding survey of the lakes. That took almost a year and has now been completed and the results are being plotted and studied.  The preparation of the scheme is proceeding and as promised the examination of the Woodford river will be taken up when works are in hands.</P>

      <P>When prisoners are being taken by car to prison, it is common practice for the Garda to handcuff them while in the car, in order to ensure their safe custody.

I pointed out, in reference to that particular photograph, that it related to two prisoners who were not members of the NFA but who were there for detention under conviction by the courts in respect of ordinary criminal offences and that the people so photographed had no relationship whatever with the NFA.  I was at pains to point that out in my reply on that occasion.  This is a separate matter.

      <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Ryan on 7th March, I indicated that the current estimated weekly cost of keeping a person in custody was £15.  This was calculated on the basis of a daily average population of 570 persons in custody.</P>
      <P>For the preceding four financial years the weekly cost of prisoner maintenance was: 1962-63, £10 15s.; 1963-64, £10 10s.; 1964-65, £14 9s.; and 1965-66, £14 3s.</P>
      <P>The daily average population of persons in custody for each of these years was 491, 570, 566 and 561 respectively.</P>
      <P>The increase in cost as between 1963-64 and the subsequent financial years was in the main due to pay increases and to additional staff requirements consequent on a reduction in staff working hours.</P>

As indicated in the press reports, the company has decided to make its facilities at Baldonnel available for subcontracting work for the manufacture of aircraft components.

      <P>Under the technical assistance scheme administered by my Department grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost are available to manufacturing firms who send managerial and supervisory personnel abroad to attend training course or to study aspects of industrial organisation. Grants on a similar basis are also available in respect of the study of productivity techniques and procedures abroad by trade union representatives. Grants are also available for visits abroad by representatives of distributive trade associations to study aspects of distribution.</P>
      <P>The principal condition is that prior approval of the grant must be obtained before the activity in respect of which the grant is sought commences.  Each application is considered on its merits. Before any grant is paid evidence of the expenses incurred must be submitted. No special form of application is prescribed.  My Department does not make any grants available in respect of travel abroad for the promotion of sales.  Grants for this purpose are provided by Córas Tráchtála, who also lay down the conditions for availability and decide how they are paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only source from which the information sought by the Deputies could be obtained would be the confidential documents filled up for the Revenue Commissioners by importers. These documents are used by the Central Statistics Office in preparing official statistics but it is not the practice of either the Revenue Commissioners or the Central Statistics Office to release information as to the names of individual importers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We might have available information as to the numbers but not the names.  The names are regarded as confidential and are not disclosed to my Department or anybody else by the Central Statistics Office or the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The thinking behind it is that, if this information were disclosed, in certain cases people might not be prepared to fill in the forms for the Revenue Commissioners because they would regard disclosure of the information as damaging to them and we would, therefore, fail to get accurate statistics.  While I can see the force of this argument, there are many reasons why information of this nature should be available to my Department.  It is a difficulty about which I have been concerned <Col N="1201" /> and I am trying to devise some method of getting information without breaching the principle I have enunciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the absence of such information precludes the giving of real effect to one of the functions of his Department, that is, to ensure that products are not imported in an unfair manner and the only way to do this is to know the names of the establishments which import the articles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the difficulty operates in quite the way the Deputy thinks but there is a difficulty in regard to the importation of goods here which could perhaps be supplied from home sources, which I suppose is what the Deputy is getting at.</P>

      <P>Since I tabled this question, a number of shops in Dublin have this kit on sale.  Would the Minister agree that this toy, for want of a better word, should not be placed in the hands of children?  Furthermore, would he agree that this is another commercial gimmick to cash in on the death of the United States President?

      <P>To deal with the last portion of the supplementary question first, I did not say that there is no legislation to deal with it.  There may be, but I am not aware of it.  What I <Col N="1202" /> said was that there is no machinery at my disposal to deal with matters of this kind, nor is it really appropriate to the Department of Industry and Commerce. I understand that these items are at present on sale in Dublin and that the folder is marked &ldquo;Recommended for adults or older children&rdquo;.

The implementation of some provisions of the Convention will require the enactment of new legislation before the Government are in a position to ratify it.  It is proposed to introduce such legislation in due course and, consequently, when Recommendation No. 483 is next considered by the Committee of Ministers' Deputies, the Permanent Representative will be instructed to vote in favour of the proposals contained therein.</P>
