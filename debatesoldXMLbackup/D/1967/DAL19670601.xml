      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>It is a very simple Bill.  Its purpose is to preserve what has been the normal practice relating to the composition of county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the committee of agriculture in each county are appointed by the county council in every local election year.  Since the enactment of the Agriculture Act, 1931, the rule which applied to all such appointments was that every committee of agriculture must be composed, at the discretion of the council, either wholly of persons who are members of the council or partly of persons who are, and partly of persons who are not, members of the council.  In 1964, when the Agriculture (Amendment) Act was passed, dealing with a number of matters affecting committees of agriculture, it was thought well to provide that it should be mandatory on the county councils to go outside their own ranks for at least 50 per cent of the membership of committees of agriculture. There have, of course, been no local elections since the 1964 Act was <Col N="1874" /> passed, so that this particular provision has not actually come into operation.</P>
    <P>On further consideration of the whole matter, it has been represented that the provision is too rigid and restrictive.  This is the view of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, which represents all the committees of agriculture.  The County Councils' General Council, and individual committees of agriculture and county councils have also expressed similar views.  It is pointed out that the large majority of county councillors are of farming stock, are well conversant with the problems of the farming community, and are vitally interested in promoting its welfare.  County councillors, too, being the elected local representatives of the people have usually a keen sense of their duties and responsibilities in the service of the people&mdash;mostly the farming community in the rural areas.  I believe that there is force in these representations. While a number of county councils do, in fact, appoint a good few non-councillors on committees of agriculture, I am satisfied that it would not be desirable to oblige all the councils to fit into a rigid pattern&mdash; at the risk of depriving able men and women willing and anxious to serve on both bodies the opportunity of acting on the committees of agriculture. Taking everything into consideration, my view is that the long established and democratic system, which leaves the discretion in this matter to each county council in its own area, is the one calculated to be of best advantage all round.  I believe that the county committees of agriculture as at present constituted are doing good and constructive work which benefits the whole farming community and that tinkering with their membership will not increase their effectiveness and might well lessen it.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, by means of the Bill that the amending provision in the 1964 Act&mdash;which as I have said has not in the meantime actually become operative&mdash;requiring 50 per cent of the members of committees of agriculture to be non-councillors be rescinded; and that the position which allows the county councils to decide <Col N="1875" /> for themselves in this matter of the appointment of outsiders on committees of agriculture be retained.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill.  I do so for a number of reasons which I believe to be sound and which I now propose to put forward.  As the Minister says, prior to the passing of the 1964 Act, the position was that the county councils elected all the members of county committees of agriculture. They were free, under that legislation, to elect as many people as they liked outside the county council, people who were not members.  Now, I think it is right to say that the 1931 legislation was not precise in so far as it did not state the number of members who were to be council members and the number who were to be non-council members. In practice, I think this varied very widely all over the country.  There were quite a number of councils that appointed no outside members and retained the entire membership for members of the county council.  In other cases, some members were appointed.  I have had the experience myself of failing to get elected to the county committee of agriculture&mdash;the then chairman of the largest organised group of farmers in the county.  On another occasion.  I failed to get the President of the Hereford Breeders Association elected on the committee of agriculture.  It might be no harm to mention that it was well known that this man was not a Fine Gael supporter. However, I am indicating this to show exactly what has been happening over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1964, Deputy Smith, the then Minister for Agriculture, who had long experience both as Minister for Agriculture and as Minister for Local Government, decided to have regard to the change that was taking place generally in agriculture and to give this change some chance of showing itself by ensuring that people who had a real contribution to make to agriculture would get an opportunity of bringing the benefit of their experience and their knowledge of agriculture generally to county committees of <Col N="1876" /> agriculture.  A large proportion of county councils are, in fact, farmers, and quite experienced farmers who have a lot to contribute, but I think we must recognise that there are many people who make a considerable contribution to the advancement of Irish agriculture who would not stand for election to the county council and who, at the same time, would be in a position to make a valuable contribution to the work of county committees of agriculture and agriculture generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith decided to bring in this legislation, having consulted the various parties concerned and having, at that time, consulted the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. He told this House he had got general support for his decision in making it mandatory on the county councils to provide 50 per cent of the places for people who were non-members.  That Bill, at that time, received the unanimous support of every Party in this House.  It was introduced in 1964 and it was intended that it should come into force in the 1965 elections which, as we all know, were postponed for reasons that have been discussed here and elsewhere.  They were postponed again in 1966.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, Deputy Smith resigned his position as Minister for Agriculture.  His place was taken by Deputy Haughey who also gave this measure his support and was prepared to give it a trial.  We now have the extraordinary position that a third Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture is coming in to throw this out before it gets a trial.  It is worth recalling to the House what Deputy Smith had to say about this legislation at the time and, as well, what Deputy James Tully of the Labour Party had to say about it.  It is unnecessary for me to quote Deputy Donegan, who supported it as well.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 887 of the Official Report of 9th June, 1964, volume 210, Deputy Smith said in support, in connection with this particular section of the Bill:</P>
    <P>There have been considerable changes in recent times, notably in the emergence of new voluntary rural organisations, the extension <Col N="1877" /> of the co-operative movement, the growth of the educational and advisory services and the development of new techniques and ideas generally. There can hardly be any doubt that committees of agriculture would benefit from some members drawn from the voluntary rural organisations and the co-operative movement or from among prominent local individuals who for one reason or another do not wish to stand for election to the county council.</P>
    <P>I believe that the time has come to re-shape our legislation so that persons, who are not members of county councils but who are playing a leading part in the improvement of our agriculture, and in raising our rural living standards, will have a greater opportunity to participate in the membership of committees of agriculture.  I feel sure that the change now proposed will bring to committees a new source of inspiration and strength and that it will lead to a more general acceptance of the educational and advisory services by the rural community.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to continue reading what Deputy Smith had to say in support of this change.  I have said sufficient, I think, to indicate his reasons for bringing in this legislation and for giving it his full support.</P>
    <P>I think I have said that the various people in the House and the various Parties in the House gave it their full support.  The only regret that was expressed at that time was that it was not sufficiently specific to ensure that these non-members, when being appointed, would definitely be people who had a close association with agriculture and who had a contribution to make and would not, in fact, still be selected on a Party political basis.  That was the only regret expressed and that was a general regret.  Even the Minister for Agriculture at the time expressed the same regret but he did not see how it was possible to tighten it up any more without perhaps depriving some people, who would have a contribution to make and who would have a considerable knowledge of farming and farming practice, of the opportunity of appointment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> As reported at column 891 of the Official Report of the same day&mdash;9th June, 1964&mdash;Deputy James Tully spoke about the first part of the Bill and then, when he came to this part of it, had this to say:</P>
    <P>The second matter is somewhat more complicated.  In most sensible county councils, and I include the one in my own county in the number, politics crop up only once in the year.  That is on the day the chairman, vice-chairman and the committees are elected.  After an election, when certain committees are being appointed, the vocational committee, the agricultural committee, and so on, we have politics right along the way.  When I heard this Bill was being introduced, I thought the Minister would have gone a long way further on this line.  I have not discussed the matter with Deputy Donegan but I think there is a great deal of sense in what he has said.</P>
    <P>It is really too bad that people who do not know anything about agriculture should find their way on to these committees, simply because they are members of a political Party and must be given some kind of position, either because they have been defeated for election to the county council or they have topped the church gate collection.  They must get recognition and the recognition is membership of a committee. Now, that is wrong and I shall be very glad to support the Minister if he devises some other system of appointment.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from what happened in 1964 that this measure was welcomed by all the Parties and they gave good and sound reasons for supporting it.  The Minister has come in this morning and given no reason whatever why he has changed his mind in the meantime.  What has happened to bring about this change?  We have had further development in agricultural organisation and, in fact, generally outside politics, and it would be a great mistake on the part of the Minister to insist now that this piece of legislation, which I believe was well-intentioned and would have its effect, be thrown out before it gets a trial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> In considering this whole matter, we should ask ourselves what is the work of committees of agriculture and who are the people most generally useful on such committees.  We all know that the main function of committees of agriculture is in regard to the agricultural advisory services.  More and more in the future the most important work of the advisory services will be drawing up planned programmes of production on individual farms.  That will require a great deal of co-operation from the farming organisations and it would be of great assistance to us if we were assured that a large proportion of the members would not only be progressive farmers but, better still, if they were members of farming organisations.  This would naturally give them a wider appreciation of the needs of agriculture in any particular area.</P>
    <P>I know that County Dublin is an exception in so far as there are only a few people on the county council who have any association with farming.  We have the job of providing the committee with a county committee of agriculture. There is an immense amount of important work to be done in the county and in fact a great deal of important work has been done.  We have the situation that out of the total membership there are only a few people having any connection with agriculture.  We have politics entering into it to the extent I have already described.  It is not just possible, as long as it is not mandatory on the county council, to eliminate politics. We have a few members outside, but only a few.  We should all be anxious not only to include among the members prominent farmers who belong to farming organisations or men, or women for that matter, who have shown that in their own right they have a real contribution to make.  It is too bad if we do not ensure that such people are appointed.  There is also a definite place on these agricultural committees for farm labourers.  This is something that has been left out of the picture and it should not be left out because the livelihood of many farm workers <Col N="1880" /> is involved and their future depends on the prosperity of agriculture.</P>
    <P>This is a retrograde step and I would appeal to the Minister not to go ahead with it.  Certainly, if he does, we on these benches will oppose it.  He has failed absolutely to make a case for the change he proposes.  An excellent case was made for it in 1964 when it was introduced and no change has taken place except a change that might indeed warrant its retention, and indeed its strengthening, to ensure that there will be no mistake about the type of persons who would be appointed afterwards, that they would not be appointed on a Party political basis. I do not mind people being political as long as they have the knowledge required to promote and encourage the work of county committees of agriculture.  As Deputy Tully said on that occasion, politics enter into it perhaps once in the lifetime of the committee and then very rarely afterwards.  That has been my experience.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is usually tough enough to take resolutions of that kind in his stride.  On such occasions you do have a line-up, but this sort of thing has no effect on the work of committees. However, the knowledge and experience which members have, the contribution they can make to the organisation, control and advancement of the work of the advisory services, is of great importance.  If the members are not knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the work of the advisory officers, it is difficult to expect results from the advisory officers.  Frequently we have noticed the feeling that is abroad that these committees of agriculture are purely political.  I do not agree that that view is correct, but it is there and what we should be doing is endeavouring to eliminate that sort of view and <Col N="1881" /> produce evidence to show that we are there to ensure that the people who act on these committees know what they are doing, that they are progressive farmers and have a contribution to make.  As I said, I consider that farm labourers should also be included in the membership of these committees and in addition many schoolteachers have an important contribution to make.  They have also an important function to play in bringing to the knowledge of their pupils the work the advisory officers are doing.  There are many other people who could well act on these committees, such as the local bank manager.</P>
      <P>This definition is perhaps a little too conservative in so far as it excludes people of that sort who have a considerable contribution to bring to the work of these committees and who should be included.  While the qualifications of people eligible for these committees are quite precise, no case has ever come up of a person being disqualified.  In the 1931 Act, it is stated, and this still obtains, that no person shall be appointed to be a member of any agricultural committee unless he has a practical commercial or technical knowledge of land, or has an estate or interest in some agricultural land in the county or has special local knowledge of agricultural matters.  The last one is the hard one to define, special local knowledge of agricultural matters.  He does not need to be a farmer, as we know, to have such knowledge.  Perhaps that allows people in and I think it should be retained but we should make it mandatory.  We should give this legislation that was brought in and considered to be good legislation not only by the then Minister for Agriculture and his successor but by all the Members of the House in 1964 a chance to operate.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this Bill at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has quoted Deputy Tully very extensively and while I respect the views of Deputy Tully and also those of Deputy Clinton, I think none of us can afford to be positive in regard to this proposal. If we are to arrive at the type <Col N="1882" /> of representation on committees of agriculture that Deputy Clinton advocates, we would have to recast the whole system of local government. Members of my Party, as individuals, may have their own views because, again, I do not think this need be a political issue in the House but I favour the proposal made now by the Minister.  As long as our local government system remains as it is and as long as the councillors are elected in the present manner, I believe they themselves should have power to decide what will be the composition of the various subsidiary committees.  I do not say this of Deputy Clinton exclusively but I believe that there is an impression or a view held in the country that local public representatives such as those now putting themselves forward have something wrong with them, that they are somewhat subnormal and that even in respect of the committee of agriculture, we should supplement the committee with people who have expert knowledge of this, that and the other thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original proposal in 1964 was that 50 per cent should be co-opted from outside and that only 50 per cent of the representatives could be members of the county council.  There is room for experts in agriculture as there is in vocational education or in library committees but nobody has made a move to ensure we shall have experts on the vocational education committees or the library committees, the harbour boards or any other subsidiary bodies, health committees, mental hospital committees and so on.  The Minister has rightly said that quite a number of people representative of the agricultural industry present themselves for election.  I do not think there should be special places set aside, so to speak, for those whom people say have special knowledge of agriculture.  I am not talking about any of the voluntary associations.  There is no easy way, and there should not be, to public representation and the few thousand people offering themselves now for election on 28th June in my view, so far as local government is concerned, should decide matters such as are being discussed here today.  If these people are experts <Col N="1883" /> in agriculture, in vocational education, in health or something else why do they not be good citizens and present themselves for election?</P>
    <P>The proposal is 50 per cent but what is sacred about 50 per cent?  Why not 40 per cent, 25 per cent or 60 per cent?  I do not think the Minister should decide on the percentage of outsiders. At present in County Wexford, County Kilkenny, County Leitrim and County Roscommon they decide themselves what extra help is needed from those who are not councillors and who might be regarded as experts.  As far as I can gather, these experts or specialists in agriculture who are co-opted to county committees of agriculture in many cases are inclined to look down on the &ldquo;yahoos of public representatives&rdquo;, particularly those from town areas.  I do not agree that county councillors who are elected from town areas should be debarred, as was suggested on one occasion, from county committees of agriculture.  These are councillors who were elected to represent the people and who are concerned about the rates, about expenditure, about income and all the various facets of their county council in their own functional area.  They are also concerned with how money is spent on agriculture, whether the advisory services are good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily follow that because they are from an urban area they would not be able to take an intelligent interest in agricultural advisory services.  If that were the case we should have violently objected&mdash; I do not say I am an expert in criticism in this respect&mdash;to Deputy Haughey becoming Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He is reputed to know a lot about horses and I am sure he does, and about hens, but he has never been regarded as a farmer in an extensive way.  I do not know much about the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I know only that he comes from what would be regarded as an agricultural county and, as far as I know, he is not an extensive farmer. I do not know if he has ever been on the land himself to the extent of taking a reins in his hands to plough.  I did <Col N="1884" /> that myself but I do not consider myself a farmer: I did it for a pastime. I do not think a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should be condemned because he is not an active farmer.  Neither can we say the representatives on the committees of agriculture should be condemned because they come from urban areas.  So long as they have the courage and good citizenship to present themselves for election they are entitled to be represented on any subsidiary bodies of the county council.</P>
    <P>I know only my own county and I know there is adequate room for those who are not county councillors.  These selections are being made, as they would be under either of these two proposals, on a political basis.  The proposal of the former Minister, Deputy Smith, would not ensure that the representation which Deputy Clinton says might be on these committees of agriculture would, in fact, be there because, with 50 per cent, you would have Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party trying to get their own men on.  We should be completely honest about this and admit that as far as all these appointments are concerned, chairman, vice-chairman, rate collectors and so on, the county councillors behave in a political manner and if 50 per cent were to be selected they would still behave like that.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Apropos</i> of what Deputy Clinton said, there was a member of my Party who was a member of Dublin County Council and who is now its chairman, Paddy Murphy.  He has taken a tremendous interest in agriculture and did a tremendous amount of work on the county committee of agriculture in County Dublin.  He was somewhat ignored and perhaps put off the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>More than his share. In any case, I do not see any particular case for reserving on the county committees of agriculture seats for those whom people say have expert knowledge of agriculture because, as I said at the outset, if this were to be brought to its logical conclusion, we should do the same thing in regard to vocational education committees, library committees, health and mental hospital committees and so on, that is, try to ensure that experts in these fields would be members of these committees.  I support the Bill which in effect retains the <i>status quo.</i> As I said at the beginning, those who present themselves for election, who have the guts and the courage to do so, should not be deprived of membership of the subsidiary bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a county committee of agriculture since they were started, I support this Bill. I do so because our county committee of agriculture in Sligo, which is dominated by Fine Gael, opposed this decision and passed a resolution to that effect.  Therefore, I am amazed at some of the things said here today. I am in complete agreement with Deputy Corish who said that anyone who has not the courage to go forward for election is not entitled to be a member of any committee.  That may be a wild statement but I believe in it.</P>
      <P>Let us examine what happens at the appointment of these committees.  Some years ago Sligo committee appointed some men, men who had been turned down by the people.  The same thing would happen again if this 50 per cent became effective.  The men going up for election as representing whatever Party was in power would be offered the 50 per cent and there would be no word about whether they knew anything about farming or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long experience and this has been my experience.  I am old enough to remember as a small boy the jubilation in this country when the people got the system of local government into their own hands and when the jury system was done away with.  We have all read of the Grand Jury system.  They were the landed gentry <Col N="1886" /> who ran the affairs of this country in their day and the ordinary people had very little say.  In my opinion, this was an attempt to go back to that system and to deny the rights of the people who were elected by the people to manage the affairs of the county committees of agriculture.  Again, I am completely in agreement with Deputy Corish when he says that anyone who has not the guts to go forward for election is not entitled to representation on those committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there is any misunderstanding, I said he is not automatically entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>He should not be automatically entitled.  I would suggest to the Minister, or anyone else, that if he wants these county committees to be controlled completely by agriculture this can be done but I do not agree with it.  I agree with Deputy Corish that the men in towns who take a keen interest in agriculture and who get votes from farmers are as much entitled to sit on committes of agriculture as anyone else because they are voted there by the people of the town and of the county.  The farmers who go up for election get votes in the town as well.  Anyone who has not the courage to go forward and face the people on 28th June should not be on those committees. Let them go forward for election on that date and if the people elect them, well and good.</P>
      <P>I do not believe those people have any God-given right, any more than anybody else, to be elected to these committees.  The public representatives are elected by the people but there are often slurs thrown on them.  They always work for the people but slurs are thrown at them.</P>

Quite recently we had the National Agricultural Council formed and outside rep-representation on vocational committees, on library committees and on old age pensions committees.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the situation. If the local elections had taken place when they should have in 1965, this Bill would not have been in existence and was outside representation not given?  If the elections had taken place last year, this Bill would not have been in existence.  There was only the Act and there was then no word of <Col N="1889" /> amending it.  There was no word of amending it until the recent activity of the NFA.  The Minister said&mdash;I quote from yesterday's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
      <P>It would be a great relief to all, even at this stage, if the NFA &ldquo;abandoned their current tactics and decided to work constructively with other organisations and with the Government.&rdquo; There was no need to tell the NFA how they might do that, and if they did they would be welcome to their two seats on the NAC.</P>
      <P>Surely if the Minister, or the Fianna Fáil Party, are sincere about getting co-operation, even without outside representation, this is not the ideal time to amend the Act?  It is being done for the sole purpose of carrying this fight a bit further.  It has been carried far enough and Deputies on all sides of the House are fed up with it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should compromise and give at least 25 per cent representation to outside sections of the community.  We have other organisations who are anxious to get representation, and who have no hope of getting it, such as the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Muintir na Tíre and others.</P>

      <P>It is very convenient for the Fine Gael Party to make the occasion of this Bill a Fine Gael platform, seeing that they have so many policies&mdash;one for by-elections, one for general elections and one for Presidential elections.  Now they have no ready-made policy so they found the NFA a convenient platform which would help them to give the Government <Col N="1890" /> a wallop.  All their other policies failed signally when they were tried out in different parts of the country.  I was greatly surprised to hear Deputy Reynolds denigrating county councillors in Leitrim and in Roscommon because of the fact, he says, they denied representation to outside bodies on their county committees of agriculture. It has often been cast up to Galway County Council that we deprived the Opposition members of representation, which was untrue, and that we certainly gave no outside representation to organisations other than the elected members, which also is untrue.  We have representation of farming organisations that I know of and, indeed, the agricultural colleges are represented on those committees.</P>

      <P>These county council candidates offered themselves for election; they faced the public in a free vote; the public picked them and in many cases, if they are not directly members of the farming community, they represent the farming community, having been elected by them.  In fact, in rural Ireland in any of the counties west of the Shannon, and I presume the same goes for most county councils, most of the councillors have a knowledge of agriculture, theoretically, anyway, if not factually.  They are entitled to serve on the county committees of agriculture.  Why should they not, if they are elected by the people?  Having regard to the manner by which they are chosen these are no back-door elections, which cannot be said for other organisations of whose methods we know quite a lot and whose methods of election we do not approve; in any case they are not the essence of democracy.</P>

While I am not a farmer, I meet enough of the farming community to know about their problems and the things they are looking for and the objective they have in mind, which is an improved standard of living.  All of us, whether farmers or teachers, or whatever the profession a councillor may have, do our best for the farming community and we are no fools, as some of the speakers on the opposite benches would like us to believe.  Any man who offers himself for election and succeeds in getting chosen is no fool, despite the fact that a reverend gentleman on the Late, Late Show the other night would have us all believe that we have no democracy in this country.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Bill is introduced to amend the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1964. Between 1931 and 1964, it was open to county councillors to elect to committees of agriculture either members or non-members of the county council. That was the position from 1931 until 1964.  After the experience of 33 years, it was apparently thought advisable to change that procedure and to make it obligatory on county councils in a democratic way to elect at least 50 per cent of the members of a committee of agriculture who were not county councillors.  The law was changed in 1964 by what was virtually an agreed measure.  The Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1964, introduced here by Deputy Smith, went through the Oireachtas as a virtually agreed measure.  There may have been discussion on whether the percentage should have been 25 per cent or 50 per cent and there were discussions as to whether rural organisations, or agricultural organisations, should have the right to nominate directly on to committees of agriculture, but, by and large, it was an agreed measure.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it surprises me very much to hear Deputy Gilbride and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach speaking so strongly in favour of this Bill, and denouncing so strongly the Act of 1964 which their Party sponsored and their Minister piloted through this House.  What has happened in the meantime, because the method which they advocated so strongly in 1964 has never been given a chance?  It has had no chance of working.  I can only think there has been some sinister intervention between 1964 and 1967 to prompt the present Minister for Local Government to repeal the measure which he and his Party favoured so much in 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is nothing undemocratic about conferring on county <Col N="1893" /> councils the right to appoint non-county councillors to committees of agriculture.  There is nothing undemocratic about that at all because, if there is, there is certainly something very undemocratic by conferring on the Taoiseach the right, by a stroke of his pen, to put 11 Members into Seanad Eireann.  Surely if it is wrong to elect non-county councillors to these committees, other than by what is strictly a democratic process, it is equally wrong to confer on the Taoiseach the right to elect 11 Members of what is the Upper House.</P>
    <P>It can be said in favour of Deputy Smith, when he introduced the Bill in 1964, that at least he made a case for it.  The Minister said here this morning:</P>
    <P>I believe that the county committees of agriculture as at present constituted are doing good and constructive work which benefits the whole farming community and that tinkering with their membership will not increase their effectiveness and might well lessen it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith in 1964 said in the Seanad, on this measure, in volume 57, No. 16, column 1368 of the Seanad Debates:</P>
    <P>I think I can say to the Seanad that I did not look at this matter with any hostility towards elected representatives of members of Parties in local bodies.  I did have in mind one thing, and I believe many people had it in mind in common with me. County committees of agriculture, in the main, did not seem to be serving the purpose they were intended to serve as well as one would like them to.  They did not appear to have the confidence of the people, the degree of confidence they would require to be successful in their work.  I am not saying all this lack of confidence was justified but it is true to say that it existed.</P>
    <P>That was what Deputy Smith had to say when recommending a change in the law to the Seanad in 1964.</P>
    <P>There were differences, and there was a division as to the percentage of non-councillors and as to the method of recruiting them, but there was general <Col N="1894" /> agreement that there was a necessity for the Bill.  Yet the Minister has said this morning that the county committees of agriculture were against the change in the law effected in 1964 That is not quite correct.  According to Deputy Smith, the then Minister for Agriculture, the county committees of agriculture were prepared to go some way with a change in the law, as brought about by the Act of 1964, because, in the same volume, at column 1371, Deputy Smith had this to say:</P>
    <P>I must admit that they&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>They being the General Council of Committees of Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;were reasonable up to the point that they would go as far as 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>They were prepared to agree with the Minister that 25 per cent of the members of committees of agriculture should be non-councillors.</P>
    <P>Again, when Deputy Smith was introducing the measure in 1964, the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill of that year, he was very anxious that rural organisations, voluntary organisations, should have representation on committees of agriculture and the only thing that prevented him from giving direct representation was the difficulty in appointing them because speaking at columns 1381 and 1382 of the same volume, he said:</P>
    <P>I know in certain counties, when fairly outstanding leaders of the NFA, or some other rural organisation, were mentioned, they have been co-opted to county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The better the organisations are organised in the districts, the more likely they are to make themselves felt with the county councils in securing representation.  If they have not the standard of organisation, it is their fault.  They have often claimed to me to have, and I am now going to put them to the test and say: &ldquo;You can get 50 per cent one way or another.  It is for you to go after public men and to ensure that you will&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Smith, as Minister <Col N="1895" /> for Agriculture, speaking of the NFA in 1964: Get after public men and see that you get 50 per cent representation on county committees of agriculture. I want to know what has brought about the change?</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith, again speaking as Minister for Agriculture, said at columns 1355 and 1356 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>While I am suggesting the rural organisations and the co-operative movement as a likely source of suitable members for committees of agriculture, I have not found it practicable to provide in this Bill for giving them direct representation, although I have given a great deal of thought to the matter.  In view of the large number of rural organisations in the country, the varying strength of these organisations from one county to another, and the varying number of members on individual committees, I do not think that a statutory formula could be worked out which could be applied equitably to all counties.  I hope, however, that county councils will keep the rural organisations and the co-operative movement in mind when choosing members for committees, and that this broadening of membership will lead to a more general acceptance of the agricultural advisory services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The then Minister had decided that 50 per cent of each committee of agriculture would be non-county councillors and he advised the county councils to select them from rural organisations. As I say, there was a difference when the Bill was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas as to the percentage of non-council members and as to the method of selecting them.  There was even a division on it but there was general agreement in principle.  That was the case made by the Government three years ago in support of section 2 of the Act which they now wish to repeal, without ever allowing it to come into force.</P>
    <P>The local elections were due in 1965 and they did not propose to repeal it <Col N="1896" /> then.  They were due again in 1966 and there was no talk of repealing it then.  I want the Minister to say what has brought about the change, what has brought about the new thinking. As I have said, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture agreed to a change in 1964 but differed only on percentage.  They agreed, according to the Minister's predecessor, to 25 per cent non-elected members while the Minister's predecessor insisted on 50 per cent.  It was only a matter of degree. That is very important.</P>
    <P>The strongest case that can be made in favour of having non-councillor members of committees of agriculture is that you are likely to get onto these committees highly qualified and experienced people in the field of agriculture whom otherwise you will not get.  There are many well qualified, experienced farmers, farmers specialising in various fields, who are not prepared to stand for election.  Indeed I would go further and say that if they stood for election, they would not get elected.  Nevertheless they have a valuable contribution to make to these committees and I think it a pity that they are not given a chance of getting on such committees under the Act of 1964.  I know that when some people such as I speak of become members of committees of agriculture they do not adopt a Party line.  They adopt a constructive line.  They put forward suggestions which they think, from their experience, will benefit the agricultural industry and when matters of a strictly Party nature come up, they take no part.</P>
    <P>I repeat that when this measure went through the Oireachtas in 1964, it was for all practical purposes, an agreed measure.  It was agreed without question in this House; it was agreed in principle in the Seanad without any division on the Second Stage.  I am fully aware of the fact that in the Seanad there was a discussion on Committee Stage, that some members of the Seanad thought that a register of rural organisations should be compiled and that membership of one of these voluntary rural organisations would be a necessary qualification for nomination <Col N="1897" /> as a non-councillor member.  The Minister for Agriculture did not agree with that because he said it would be impossible to compile a register or to define qualifications.  I am quite well aware that there was a division in the Seanad on that particular issue, as to whether section 2, as it was then drafted, should stand part or whether it should be altered so as to meet the wishes of members of the Seanad who advocated that a register of rural organisations should be set up and that membership of one of these rural organisations would be necessary to qualify a non-councillor member for nomination to a committee of agriculture. However, that was the only issue in the Seanad and there was no issue at all in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is particularly unfortunate at this time, when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture are seeking the goodwill of all sections of the farming community, that they should introduce a measure like this which, on the face of it at any rate, would seek to prevent farmers with a specialised knowledge being co-opted on to committees of agriculture.  It is particularly unfortunate that it should happen at this time.  It would appear as though the Minister and the Government intend and hope to try to retain a political grasp of all advisory councils in the country such as committees of agriculture, just as the people of the country think the Minister has exercised a political stranglehold on the National Agricultural Council, which was put beyond doubt when he himself became chairman.  I think that is deplorable.  It is not calculated to lead to a better relationship between the agricultural community as a whole and the Government.  It cannot be denied that there are very many people who would ornament a committee of agriculture who would have a worthwhile contribution to make, who are not prepared to allow themselves to become involved in the system of election today which involves Party politics.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish's approach to this Bill was by far the sanest I have <Col N="1898" /> heard in the short time I have been in the House.  Deputy Fitzpatrick seems to wonder why there should be any amendment of or any change in the present legislation.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that since the 1964 Act there have been a number of changes in the country.  He himself has moved from the Seanad to the Dáil.  The Minister for Agriculture has changed and the personnel of the Government has changed.  Indeed the position of the entire House has changed to a considerable degree.  Therefore everybody is entitled to view things in the light of what they consider to be best and what they consider to be just.  Deputy Fitzpatrick in the Seanad emphasised that he considered the 50 per cent representation from outside the county council which was mandatory under the 1964 legislation far too high.  He also emphasised that the Bill, while making it mandatory that 50 per cent should come from outside the county councils, made no provision that any of these people, this 50 per cent, should necessarily have any qualification.</P>

If a person takes it upon himself to present himself for election by the people and is successful, surely he must represent a fair cross-section of opinion in the county council area for which he stands?  By making it mandatory that 50 per cent <Col N="1899" /> must be from outside the county council, you are depriving people who are elected of representation.</P>
      <P>I am a member of one committee of a local authority and in the county council we have a situation in which every Party has at least one representative. In some places we find that there is a Fianna Fáil man only in a particular area or a Fine Gael man only in that area, and due to the fact that outside people are nominated they would be precluded under the terms of the 1964 Act from being represented. It does not matter what Party or what councillor, every councillor is entitled to be represented if he so desires on those committees, especially a councillor who stands on a Party ticket because he reflects a considerable weight of opinion in that area.</P>
      <P>The benefit of an elected representative being on a committee such as an agricultural committee is very obvious. He is charged with the responsibility of striking the rate and of ensuring that value for money is obtained.  If he is negligent, he can be dismissed quickly by the electorate at the next election, whereas a person who has no such responsibility can completely disregard the consequences of any proposal he might make, in the certain knowledge that he does not have to render an account of his stewardship at the end of the term of the committee. I am not saying this would be the case, but it is a likely case.  Most of the Fine Gael Senators seemed to be very much against the 1964 provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of elected representatives fulfil all the qualifications.  By virtue of the fact that they are elected representatives they have come from farming stock and they are intimately connected in one way or another with farming interests. They are as well qualified as anybody from outside their ranks.  They fulfil their duties on county committees of agriculture in the knowledge that they have been selected by the people to do so&mdash;in the knowledge that they are charged with definite responsibilities. Members of county councils, particularly at rate-striking meetings, are pressurised every day by various people with vested interests of one kind or another.  They are pressurised to a great extent and they take cognisance of this by ensuring beforehand that their deliberations will stand the acid test of full responsibility.  The same holds true of elected representatives who are members of county committees of agriculture.  They do not pander to anybody and, therefore, do not find themselves in the invidious position of having given way or of having favoured any particular aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the majority of the members of county committees of agriculture have strong political affiliations, to their credit they spend 90 per cent of their time disregarding their political affiliations and acting for the good of agriculture as a whole.  Therefore, I see nothing wrong with the present composition of these committees.  I feel that the provisions of section 2 (1) (a) would be to the detriment not merely of elected representatives who, to a degree, would be precluded from acting on these committees, but also to the detriment of agriculture because the people with the greatest interest in the <Col N="1903" /> community at large might not be allowed to serve on these committees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick used the phrase &ldquo;sinister motives&rdquo;.  Nobody can say how many people with sinister motives might find themselves among the 50 per cent of county committee members outside the elected representatives.  The Minister had no such sinister motives as have been attributed to him by his proposal to repeal this section.  When the 1964 measure was going through the same people opposed it who are now opposing this repealing Bill.  For their own personal reasons, I do not know what they are, they have now turned about and are completely misrepresenting the purpose behind the Bill now before us.  There has been no local election since 1964.</P>

      <P>Under the present composition of committees of agriculture, members may occasionally become partisan but they spend the majority of thei time and of their deliberations working for the common good of the agricultural community, <Col N="1904" /> refusing to take peculiarly Party or selfish lines.  This has been the case in the past and I see no reason to change the representation system in regard to the composition of committees of agriculture.  We had this system of composition from 1931 until 1964.  It has stood the valid test of time and I cannot agree that the 1964 legislation was wise.  I do not see the reason for it.  I should not like to find myself committed to decisions made by other people at other times.  If I did, I should disregard modern methods of transport, for instance, and suggest that we revert to the time when a man walked in front of a car with a flag.</P>
      <P>The 1964 legislation, to my mind, militated against the best interests of agriculture because it tended to decrease and to lessen the importance of elected representatives.  Indeed, it may well have influenced people not to participate as candidates in the local elections now coming up because many may have taken the notion that if they are not to be regarded as good enough as public representatives to be on county committees of agriculture they are not good enough to go forward for election.  I fully support the Bill, feeling that through its introduction we shall revert to an obviously worthwhile position in regard to the constitution of county committees of agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was amusing to hear the Parliamentary Secretary conclude with an argument that is complete rubbish.  The 1964 Act has never been tested.  In 1964 Fianna Fáil brought in this measure on their own initiative.  Since then, their political acumen has led them to refuse to hold the local elections so that, in fact, the provisions of this Act have never been tested.  For some queer reason&mdash;discernible, of course, to those who keep a finger on the pulse of the present situation&mdash;we want to revert to the old position in case rising embarrassment might become more acute if certain well-recognised organisations, such as the ICMSA and NFA, were to play an effective part in the development of agriculture at local committee level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a realist, and I think this Bill <Col N="1905" /> is codology.  I want the Minister to tell me what it has cost the taxpayers to have this bit of foppery and nonsense this morning.  I am sure it would have spread artificial manure on a good many holdings in West Cork, which would have been of some assistance to the land rather than to the talkers.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to live up to his own argument and go along with the times, the purpose of the 1964 Act was to allow organisations who could contribute something of value to rural Ireland to get representation that would not normally be available to them from the ballot box.  We all know well there are certain types of people who have a valuable contribution to make in various fields who have about as much chance of being elected as those who do not stand at all.  It takes a hardy breed to face the electorate and all the hazards of the ballot box results.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, who, like myself, can be partisan when his point of view is challenged, knows perfectly well there are many people of good standing in Tipperary who could make a valuable contribution on the local committees of agriculture, but who would have no more chance of being elected than people dead for many years.</P>

Nobody should be naive enough to talk about a change of heart in the Fianna Fáil Party.  In many ways the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the political genius of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  He can see that some of the largesse they might be able to distribute by virtue of their majority would disappear because of this Act and this Act, therefore, must be scrapped.</P>

      <P>It is not a question <Col N="1906" /> of suspicion as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  They have built up a megalomaniac organisation.  I have experienced all the hazards and vicissitudes of political life and I have come back smiling and fighting.  I am not a bit afraid, and never have been, to say what I really think.  I am not saying that Fianna Fáil are not right according to their own lights, but it is time they told us what the real object of the exercise was and not try to cover it by the pretentious nonsense and verbose tautology we have listened to all morning.</P>
      <P>Let us come to grips with the net issue.  This child, born in 1964, has not been let out of the pen.  It has never been tested.  But the political perspicacity of certain people has discerned a realistic danger in that certain organisations, which we say are of great assistance to the community, might become on the agricultural committees an effective block to the Party machine.  There is no doubt that organisations such as the ICMSA, the Beet Growers Association, the NFA, Macra na Feirme and even Bantracht na Tuaithe can make a most valuable contribution to the betterment of agriculture generally, not only from the point of view of improving productivity but also from the point of view of the integration of rural communities, the development of the social side and the promotion of homecrafts in rural Ireland.  Outside of politics, is there anybody who does not appreciate that fundamentally such contributions could be very helpful at agricultural committee level?  I am able to talk on this with objectivity, I hope, because in my lifetime I have never been a member of a local authority.  I have seen people nominated to membership of committees of agriculture who proved they had a worthwhile contribution to make to these committees.  We should encourage as far as we can the integration of these big organisations into our agricultural scheme of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act should have been given a fair chance.  I have always been a great believer in the dignity and effectiveness of elected public representatives.  I believe completely in the power of the <Col N="1907" /> ballot box and in the representative voice it gives the person deemed worthy of representation.  We at the highest level in this House are the custodians of national policy.  In the final analysis, it is the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who lays down the broad policy lines.  But surely nobody must realise more than the Minister himself that, with goodwill and co-operation from the various sincerely progressive farming organisations, he could derive considerable help in moulding policy for this most vital of all our industries?  No matter what people talk about in this House, it all comes back to the fundamental reality that basically, fundamentally and extensively, it is on agriculture that the survival of this nation depends, in or out of Europe, in or out of the GATT.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davern, was protesting that agriculture be removed from the caprice of <i>ad hoc</i> decision and vicarious decision in difficult circumstances.  I want to see agriculture, as I have always advocated here, put on the basis of an integrated progressive plan where the necessity for immense investment was recognised, where the various types of production would be stepped up to expert productivity, to the most keen economic productivity that can be reached. That can only be done if we get the co-operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the submission I make.  I am going to pass from it now.  As I suggested to the Minister, on local committees of agriculture, in a spirit of co-operation and understanding, they could be valuable contributors to the immense effort that has to be put in.  I think the Minister will agree that local committees of agriculture and up from them the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, have a vital part to play and if that part is played with goodwill and understanding, the contribution will be all the greater.</P>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House any longer except to say&mdash;and I say it deliberately&mdash;that there is some indecency in the annihilation of this statute at this stage because we are all aware of the fact that there are certain esoteric undercurrents in the agricultural field that, at least, arouse a very serious consideration as to whether there is any genuiness in the Government's argument and lead many of us to the belief that there is an ingenuous type of argument to cover a reversion to power politics and control at all levels by the Party machine.</P>

      <P>I fail to understand why the Fine Gael Party are so perturbed about this amendment of the 1964 Agriculture Act and, in particular, this provision dealing with the composition of the committees of agriculture. When the 1964 Bill was passed in this House, while I was not a Member of the House, I was then chairman of a committee of agriculture, as I am today, and I was also a member of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick gave a very clear picture of the mounting opposition to that provision in the 1964 Act.  The <Col N="1909" /> reason that opposition was increasing all the time, was simply that county committees of agriculture throughout the country and the General Council itself did not realise that the measure was before Dáil Éireann or that it would go through without a division. That happened and I doubt if the Members of this House were fully aware that the measure was going through at that time because I am sure that if they were, there would have been opposition to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so.  When the Bill was going through Seanad Éireann on Second Reading, there was opposition to it and I suggest that that opposition was brought about by reason of the pressure from committees of agriculture and from the General Council itself.  It is on record that many committees passed resolutions opposing the measure.  The General Council of Committees of Agriculture passed a resolution opposing it and, if my memory serves me aright, they also appointed members from the General Council to lobby Senators in order to create opposition to the measure.  That was how they felt about it at the time.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that they were willing to accept that 25 per cent of the members of committees of agriculture be people outside county councillors. They were willing to accept that as some relief from the drastic measure, as they considered it, that had been passed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has said, and perhaps he is correct, that the Members of this House were aware that the measure was going through but they were not aware that it was going to meet with such stiff opposition from county committees of agriculture throughout the country and from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  It has met with stiff opposition&mdash;no one can deny that&mdash;and it is only right that we should acknowledge that opposition and should agree to alter something that the Dáil did on a previous occasion, and did without the knowledge <Col N="1910" /> that it would bring about the type of opposition that it did meet with.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong in now meeting the wishes of the elected representatives who serve on committees of agriculture throughout the country.  At the present time there is nothing to prevent committees of agriculture from co-opting persons who they think would be useful to serve thereon.  It is high time we appreciated and respected the qualities of the elected representatives, people who have gone before the public, who have got the confidence of the electors and who have been given responsibility through the ballot boxes.  These are the people for whom we should have respect and whose views we should honour.  These people are fully capable of making decisions. If there are persons, and we know there are in every county, who would be an asset to a committee of agriculture because of their specialist knowledge, we know that the elected representatives will avail of this knowledge and will co-opt the persons concerned to the committee without any compulsion from this House or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>The elected representatives are responsible to the ratepayers.  The funds of the majority of committees of agriculture are contributed as to 50 per cent from the rates.  Somebody mentioned the composition of a vocational education committee.  In the case of the vocational education committee, there is a difference inasmuch as the county council representatives are the people who have the final say in deciding the amount of the rate for that committee. There is no such provision in relation to county committees of agriculture in the 1964 Bill.  If we were to be serious about it, there should be such a provision because the elected representative is responsible to those who elected him and, that being so, he will always be conscious of his responsibilities because he will be aware that on the occasion of the next election, if he has not worked in the best interests of the people who elected him, they will deal with him and he will not be able to hold his place on the committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>If I had been a member of this House in 1964, I would have opposed <Col N="1911" /> the measure because I would resent strongly the fact that anyone should try to debar elected representatives from taking their place on committees of agriculture because this is exactly what the 1964 measure meant.  In my own county at present we have people who are so interested in being on the committee of agriculture and serving the agricultural community that they decided not to go forward at the county council elections.  They felt by doing that they had a better opportunity of getting on the committee of agriculture because, as things stand, only 50 per cent of the county councillors would be allowed on as members of the committees.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is very advisable to bring this change about, and I congratulate the Minister on meeting the wishes of the elected representatives. As I said, these are the people who are responsible to the ratepayers.  These are the people who have gone before the public, and these are the people who will appreciate anybody within their own areas whom it would be helpful to have on their respective committees.  I have no doubt they will avail of the help and advice these people can give by co-opting them as members of the committee.  However, I think we should leave them that right, and I cannot understand why the Fine Gael Party are opposed to this, why they have so little respect for the elected representatives.  Deputy Clinton, as a member of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture will appreciate the interest that body has shown in opposing the 1964 measure, and it is only right that we should not stand in their way and that we should allow this amendment to go through.</P>

      <P>There is a history attaching to this Bill.  The Deputy who has just spoken is probably not aware of the fact that it was I who established the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  My recollection is that when Deputy Smith introduced the 1964 Bill to this House, he informed us that the General Council of Committees of Agriculture approved the proposal he was then recommending to <Col N="1912" /> the House.  What I want to remind the House is that when Deputy Smith, who was then the Minister for Agriculture, recommended this proposal that 50 per cent of the members of committees of agriculture should be drawn from representative farmers and farm workers who did not happen to be members of a county council, he said at column 888, volume 210 of the Official Report of the 9th June, 1964:</P>
      <P>I believe that the time has come to reshape our legislation so that persons, who are not members of county councils but who are playing a leading part in the improvement of our agriculture, and in raising our rural living standards, will have a greater opportunity to participate in the membership of committees of agriculture.  I feel sure that the change now proposed will bring to committees a new source of inspiration and strength and that it will lead to a more general acceptance of the educational and advisory services by the rural community.</P>
      <P>I believe that our present agricultural advisory system, which consists of a partnership between the Department of Agriculture and the county committees of agriculture, supported by the results of the research work undertaken by An Foras Talúntais and the universities, is basically a good one and that, subject to the improvement to be effected under this Bill it is calculated to make a great and vital contribution to our further agricultural progress and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Smith clearly had in mind when making that recommendation to the House, which I can assure the Deputy who has just spoken, was fully debated here and carefully considered, that there are a great many farmers, large and small, and a great many farm workers who are not called in the ordinary sense to public life.  I hope Deputy Fahey shares with me the belief that our participation in public life is, in some sense, a vocation for which not everybody is suited.  Nevertheless, there are a great many people who have a great deal to contribute on a committee of agriculture who <Col N="1913" /> may not share our vocation to public life.  It is not everybody who is suited to the dust of the arena, but I think Deputy Fahey will agree with me that a lot of people who think they are and believe that they could&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I agree with Deputy Dillon, but I think we should leave it to the discretion of the local county councillors whether these people will serve on committees or not?  They would be in a better position to judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see Deputy Fahey's point of view, but there are a great many people who make the prodigious mistake of believing that with the specialised knowledge they have, they should enter public life in order to make that knowledge available for the betterment of the society to which they all belong, and they discover that the rigours of public life are quite beyond their capacity to endure. They get broken up by public life because, as we all know who are experienced in it, it has its rough side as well as its deliberative side, and unless one is prepared to accept the dust, one must not seek the laurels of public life.</P>
      <P>The fact remains, however, that where you are dealing with committees of agriculture you do not necessarily require altogether people who have a vocation to public life.  What you want is people who understand the agricultural circumstances of the area in which they work and live; and what you especially want, or certainly what I especially wanted when I was Minister for Agriculture, was to get on the county committee of agriculture not only farmers who did not feel able to enter the arena of public life, but farm workers whose primary interest was in agriculture and working on the land and whose prospect of getting elected to the county council, never mind the county committee of agriculture, was relatively remote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this proposal was made by Deputy Smith, I must say I saw in it the chance of getting certain farmers and certain farm workers on to the county committee of agriculture so that <Col N="1914" /> every problem would not be considered exclusively from the outlook of the farmer himself but would be reviewed at the county committee of agriculture by farmers and farm workers sitting together.</P>
    <P>I observed the reform in Deputy Smith's approach to agricultural organisation with edification.  I said: &ldquo;This man has learned a very valuable lesson, and there is no one better pleased than I am that he should have learned.&rdquo; If ever there was a man who had a vocation in public life, it was Deputy Patrick Smith of Cavan.  It was the dust he liked; he was not so concerned about the laurel wreaths.  But when I heard so rough an operator as Deputy Patrick Smith&mdash;I remember him as a Parliamentary Secretary telling us to chuck the Supreme Court out if they did not do what we wanted them to do&mdash;you, a Cheann Comhairle, were then sitting on the Labour benches.  When I heard Deputy Patrick Smith, with that record, say he believed the time had come to reshape our legislation so that men who were not represented on the county committees but who were playing a leading part in our agricultural economy and raising our real standards should have a better chance to participate in the county committees of agriculture, I said: &ldquo;Here is a Daniel come to judgement.&rdquo; Remember, there was a Daniel once cast into the lions' den.</P>
    <P>I listened last night with edification and admiration to a powerful speech delivered here by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  He was speaking in a very much wider debate than we are participating in now.  He urged on farmers that the most powerful weapon they have to vindicate their point of view is not the road blockade, not the breach of the law, but in our democratic society, the vote in the ballot box.  My mind went back to the interesting fact that we are celebrating a most interesting anniversary; it is just 20 years, almost to the day, since Deputy Patrick Smith made a famous pronouncement in the history of agriculture. I invite Deputies to compare what I quote him as saying on 9th June, 1964, with what he is on record <Col N="1915" /> as saying on 19th February, 1947.  He was speaking in Navan then, with the dust rising round him in clouds and this is what he said:</P>
    <P>I would have had inspectors tucked after them, and I would have tucked them out into fresh land, and I would compel them to break fresh land, and if they did not do it, I would tuck in the tractors through the ditches and through the gates and tuck out the land for them... If the Lord Almighty provides us with good weather that will enable us to make a start, and if there should be a necessity next season to be as rigid as heretofore&mdash;and there may be&mdash;I am going to tell them here and now that I will recruit the full of ten fields of inspectors, and I will spend plenty of money in paying them travelling expenses and everything else, and I will hire all the tractors and machinery I can get and I will go down and pick every one of the &ldquo;cods&rdquo; out, and I will say: Take down that piece of wire and put it around the other corner. ...When I do that, you can call me a thug or a clod or a driver, whatever you like, I do not care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a speech made by Deputy Patrick Smith, Minister for Agriculture, at Navan on 19th February, 1947.  Consequent on that speech no roads were blocked; no demonstrations were held.  Silently anonymously and effectively, the farmers went to the poll and, using the most powerful instrument of which any man disposes, be he great or humble, in a democracy, they wrought a marvellous reform.  Deputy Paddy Smith was put out on his ear.  Now, here is the lesson&mdash;I have preached it again and again and again in this House, and outside it; farmers should not attack the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture represents the farmers in the Government.  If the Minister for Agriculture is not doing his job, then that is the Government's fault.  In 1948 the farmers recognised that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and produced a marvellous reform.  That operation on the Government to which Deputy Patrick Smith belonged produced in Deputy Smith the astonishing reform that, in 1964, when he got back to office, he was all solicitude to see that the farm organisations should be adequately represented on the county committees of agriculture, even though they were not men who normally participated in the tough life of politics.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Blaney, the present Minister for Agriculture, is the spiritual heir of Deputy Smith&mdash;the spiritual heir of the Deputy Smith of 1947. The reason is not far to seek.  Twenty years is a long time, though, perhaps, it does not look so long to the Ceann Comhairle and myself as it does to Deputy Blaney; he has forgotten the lesson that Deputy Patrick Smith learned 20 years ago and he is beginning to say again in 1967 the kind of things that Deputy Patrick Smith was saying in 1947.  Organisations representative of farmers are now, in the eyes of Deputy Blaney, the enemies.  Deputy Blaney, Minister for Agriculture, feels that he should tell them here and now that, if they do not do what he tells them to do, he will recruit ten fields full of inspectors and he will spend plenty of money and pay travelling expenses, and everything else, and he will hire all the tractors and machinery he can get, and he will go down and pick every one of the &ldquo;cods&rdquo; out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give all and sundry notice that Deputy Blaney, Minister for Agriculture, is on the warpath. He is going to go down and pick all the &ldquo;cods&rdquo; out.  If you are a member of the NFA, or of any farming organisation that does not make obeisance to his sovereign will, if you do not attend cap-in-hand when he calls, if you do not repudiate your colleagues and become his true and faithful servant, he will go down to pick you out as one of the &ldquo;cods&rdquo; who does not realise that the Minister for Agriculture is a god, before whom everyone on the land of Ireland must bow.  He is Rimmon and all who call themselves farmers must bow low <Col N="1917" /> before him.  That was not my view of the job he occupies.  I believed the Minister for Agriculture was the servant of the farmers.  My view was that, even when the NFA was being at its most difficult, and, God knows, they were often difficult enough, I was still their servant; there was one rule in the Department and that was that, any time the President of the NFA wanted to see me, his requisition for an appointment took precedence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that it is not easy to discern the implications of this Bill, but does it not strike you, a Cheann Comhairle, as rather odd that the Minister for Agriculture in a Fianna Fáil Government should bring in a Bill to provide that 50 per cent of the members of the county committees of agriculture should be drawn from outside the membership of the county council and that that Act should come into operation after the next local election and that, before the next local election is due to take place, his successor in office is engaged in exactly the same kind of wrangling with the farmers that Deputy Smith was engaged in 20 years ago and that he seeks to repeal the Act passed by his predecessor, Deputy Smith, before it has ever come into operation or been given a trail?</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahey has now disappeared. I would ask any Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party if he does not think it is a good thing that the county committees of agriculture should be representative mainly of those who are primarily concerned with the land, if he does not think it is a good thing that the county committees of agriculture should primarily be constituted of farmers and farm workers, if they are effectively to administer the various schemes committed to their care.  I would ask any Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party if he does not think that that situation is more likely to be realised under the 1964 Act than under the situation which would be created if this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> Deputy Fahey is&mdash;I do not blame him&mdash;consternated.  He asked how it was that thos Bill ever went through, that it cannot have been debated.  He asked how it was that the whole Party to which he belongs voted for this Bill.  Deputy Fahey must not have known what was going on.  I admit that Fianna Fáil often do not know what is going on in the House but on this occasion they were made to know because Deputy Donegan explained it carefully to them.  It is going a little far when even so constructive and civil a Deputy as Deputy Fahey comes in here and asks: &ldquo;How did the Bill pass?  Did anybody know what was in it?&rdquo;, when it was a Bill introduced by his own Government.  I can assure Deputy Fahey that everybody knew what was in it.  Everybody knew that there would be a conflict of view.  It is on record, however, that Deputy Fahey said that the council of county committees of agriculture was opposed to it.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, when introducing the Bill, said that the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture was in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I think everybody knew what was in this Bill and, on its merits, were determined to give it a trail.  I am still in favour of the 1964 measure.  I think it ought to be given a trail. However, I believe this Bill has political overtones.  I do not believe the Minister seeks to improve the county committees of agriculture by the introduction of this Bill.  I think this is another case of a Fianna Fail Minister announcing that some people are more equal than others.  There is the carrot and there is the stick.  The carrot is now spelled Taca in this country.  If you are prepared to pay £100 a plate for dinner, then you are more equal than others but if you do not agree, if you do not submit, if you do not come back in sackcloth and ashes when you are called, then you are no longer to be regarded, in the words of Deputy Smith, &ldquo;as a person who is not a member of a county council but who is playing a leading part in the improvement of our agriculture and in raising our rural living standards.&rdquo; Surely, if this belief of mine is correct &mdash;and I think it is&mdash;surely, if we are <Col N="1919" /> serious in trying to bring to an end a situation which is deplorable and which should not exist, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is the last man on God's earth at this time to introduce a Bill of this character?</P>
    <P>Bear this in mind.  The local elections have long been postponed.  The Minister has been a member of the Government during the whole of that period. If this is a desirable reform, there was plenty of opportunity between 1964 and 1967 to bring this matter forward and to have it considered calmly and deliberately or are we in the situation that Deputy Blaney, as a member of the Government, sharing joint responsibility, was urging this course down the years and was overruled by the Cabinet?  What has happened that substantially the same Cabinet has changed its mind?  Is it because Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, has got himself involved in this acrimonious struggle with the NFA?  Does he expect anybody seriously to believe, when he introduces a Bill within a month of the next local elections after which the 1964 Act provides this new arrangement is to operate, that the decision to do that is divorced from the current acrimony which exists between himself and the NFA?  Does anyone in this House want to see fuel heaped on the flames of the ructions that are at present going on?</P>
    <P>Is there any justification of expediency or anything else which could possibly justify the introduction of this Bill at this time except as a proclamation by the Minister that, in so far as lies within his power, he is determined that members of the NFA will not be, in any substantial number, members of county committees of agriculture?  Observe that the NFA have declared that it is part of their policy not to participate in politics. They do not want to go into political elections&mdash;and county council elections have become political.  Now, that may be right or that may be wrong but it is part of their declared policy.  Therefore the numbers, if they are members, who are likely to become members of <Col N="1920" /> the county council is minimal.  Yet, on the eve of the county council elections, the Minister introduces this Bill and assures us that he does not want Dáil Éireann to adjourn for the summer recess until the Bill becomes law because he wants it to operate promptly so that the provisions of the 1964 Act will never even be given a chance.</P>
    <P>Well, Sir, there is a moral to be drawn from this situation, a moral which was drawn by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins last night, and which I have no hesitation in endorsing emphatically. He said that there is no language this Government understand but that of the vote and the ballot box.  If an independent agricultural organisation such as the National Farmers Organisation&mdash;which I am happy to recall I urged the farmers at a meeting in Robertstown to organise as an independent body, representative of the farming community&mdash;are to survive and are to function, they have got to make it as clear in 1967 as they did in 1947 that they will not suffer any Government to trample them into the ground. Their resolve, however, must not be directed primarily to the Minister for Agriculture, who is only one member of the Government; it must be directed to the Party who constitutes the Government by whose authority he acts.  If the farmers make it manifest by their votes&mdash;and they have a unique opportunity in the local elections&mdash;that they resent the attitude adopted by the Minister, of which I have no hesitation in saying this Bill is a peculiarly provocative example, I guarantee, and I speak from long experience, that the Minister who now feels himself to be the master of the farmers will come obsequiously with hat in hand to those same farmers if he is made to feel the lawful, democratic spur of the vote.</P>
    <P>There is one thing the members of this Government cannot dare to contemplate: power gives them access to the loot and one thing which would strip them of that access is the vote. If that power is used, their minds will be haunted by nightmares of what might subsequently happen at a general election.  Just as Deputy Smith phrased his description of the farmers <Col N="1921" /> as the &ldquo;cods&rdquo; through whose ditches he would drive tractors, whose gates he would break down and through whose hedges he would deploy ten fields of inspectors, and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that in two other lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he came to recognise these same farmers as people, who are not members of county councils, but who play a leading part in the improvement of our agriculture and raising our rural life and standards, so the nightmare of being separated from the loot will bring Deputy Blaney, as Minister for Agriculture, to discover himself suddenly to be a servant instead of a master.  If the farmers cannot wake up or be awakened to that fundamental fact of life, then they must expect to be treated as Deputy Smith thought it right to treat them in 1947.  If they do wake up, they can walk again, as I am happy to think I played a part in enabling them to walk after 1947, with their heads erect, independent men with no ambition but to be given the opportunity of earning their living in their own home in dignity and peace.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to undo what was done in 1964.  The Bill of 1964 opened the doors of these committees not only to farmers but to men who worked at farming and whose voices ought be heard in the settlement of the policy of county committees of agriculture. The effort to undo that is an effort not made with merit but as part of a vicious vendetta.  I want to convey to those against whom that vendetta is directed that they have the weapon and the means to make that vendetta fail.  No one can make them use those weapons; all we can do is tell them how to defend themselves, in the certain knowledge that if they take our advice, this will be the last of this kind of Bill this Minister, or any other Fianna Fáil Minister, will introduce for another 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the last speaker, one would want to have a pretty long memory, or a fairly fresh one, to realise the comparison drawn <Col N="1922" /> in regard to Deputy Smith's actions, as Minister for Agriculture, and his conversion, as Deputy Dillon has described it in 1964, does not stand up to any great examination.  If I recollect clearly, the matter which brought up Deputy Smith's speech in Navan was a long series of refusals by certain farmers who held the biggest tracts of the best land to make any contribution to the staff of life, the wheat and bread required at that time.  It is only right that Deputy Dillon, of all people, should remember that in regard to that situation, and the election which followed, where the votes he attributes to the farmers were used in that particular part of the country to change the Government, because Deputy Dillon never liked wheat.  Whether in war time or peace time, he condemned it right, left and centre.</P>
      <P>I shall not give the litany of such statements that can be taken out of the records but I shall just say that he did go on record as saying he would not be found dead in a field of wheat. It was much more flowery than that, as only Deputy Dillon could put it. He can go back and read some of his outbursts of that time when wheat was vitally needed.  We know how he described wheat and how he described the bread made from wheat.  It was only fitting that he should align himself with the people who had the most land and the best land and who refused to co-operate with the Government in the interests of the community to feed the people when we could not find food elsewhere.  If the Deputy wishes to go back and hold that view, he is quite welcome to do so but I daresay nobody in Fine Gael would join him, or on the Fianna Fáil or Labour benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have wandered very far from the Bill.  Why should the Bill be introduced now?  Because the local elections are being held on 28th June.  Deputy Dillon has great respect for the electorate provided, of course, they vote against Fianna Fáil.  That runs through his entire statement.  The vote is a sacred thing, provided it has the effect of taking Fianna Fáil out of office and out of the councils, but there is never a word that the vote is a good or sacred <Col N="1923" /> thing and a weapon to be used by the public when it has been, as it is consistently being, used by the public to put Fianna Fáil into office.  That has happened very recently.</P>
    <P>Why does Deputy Dillon not get rid of his pink-shaded glasses and look at this sacred vote?  If it is sacred in putting Fianna Fáil out, it is sacred in putting them in, and it has put Fianna Fáil into office far more often than it has put them out.  The Deputy should be well aware of that and when this vote was used on his Government&mdash;if it was a Government&mdash;surely he must realise that what he says of Fianna Fáil being put out by the vote of the people was even more true in his case and the case of the Government of which he was a member.  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot regard this weapon in the hands of the public as sacred only when used in one direction and of no consequence or even&mdash;to take an inference from his praise of the vote being used against Fianna Fáil&mdash;that it was a bad thing when used by the public by free choice to vote Fianna Fáil into office as they have been doing consistently down the years.</P>
    <P>I want to bring this Bill through the House because of the fact that the law under which we have been operating in relation to the composition of our committees of agriculture for many years is the law under which we still operate today.  Whatever may be the faults that are picked out here and there from year to year and committee to committee, I believe it has worked well and that the thoughts that brought about the amendment in 1964 are not likely to be realised any better under this amendment that was put into the law at that time than under the law as it stood and still stands at present, for the simple reason that what we are saying is that we will compel the county council to choose not less than 50 per cent of the membership of their committees of agriculture from non-councillors. Why should we compel the elected representatives of the county councils, why from Fine Gael Benches of all places should they ask us to refrain from deleting the amendment <Col N="1924" /> that compels the county councils to put people on committees of agriculture whom they, as elected representatives, may not wish to put on?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The deletion of the 1964 amendment is proposed now because the local elections are imminent and because in the time since the enactment of the amendment, it has been made clear by the committees of agriculture, through <Col N="1925" /> their council of committees and through various individual committees that they do not want this change.  The General Council of County Councils has made it clear since then that they do not favour the change and quite a number of county councils have indicated that they do not want it either.  Let us look at what, in fact, is and will be the situation.  Under the present law, which has operated since 1931, all the members of any committee of agriculture, with one exception, may be outsiders.  If we wish to look at it in that way, we can regard the county councils as the selectors of the agricultural committee.  In the 1964 amendment, we did not change the selectors or attempt to do so but we said to them: &ldquo;We will compel you as selectors to put on 50 per cent outsiders.&rdquo; How or in what manner was it proposed to ensure that whether they put on 50 per cent by compulsion or 90 per cent voluntarily, they would put on any particular class of people?  How could that be secured?</P>

      <P>The definition remains. The point is that it is not proposed to change the selectors.  Therefore, the point that the Fine Gael people would try to get across at the moment is that by the deletion of the amendment, we will prevent persons going on the committees of agriculture who otherwise would and should have got on. The councils will still select them, regardless of whether or not the amendment goes through or does not go through.  All that it means is that they will have the freedom of ordinary people to put on more than 50 per cent or less than 50 per cent if they think fit.  Are Fine Gael, the great protectors, as they like to see themselves, of the autonomy of our local elected representatives, now advocating that this Bill should not be accepted and that they would indicate and make it known that they wish to compel their elected bodies to do their bidding? This, coming from Fine Gael, so hot and so quickly on the heels of many <Col N="1926" /> of their protestations of the reverse, comes badly from them and can show them to be, as I have always accepted them to be, political opportunists.</P>

Let them say that they are doing what they feel Fianna Fáil will do, choose Party political hacks who have nothing to add to agriculture and no interest in the community.  This is what Fine Gael are saying here in this House today.  They are then going out around the country to their selection conventions, to their local election meetings and they are asking good people to come forward and to stand as their representatives on the county councils and they are imploring the electorate to come out and vote for those good people.  At the same time here in this House this morning they are telling us they cannot and will not allow the people who will be selected on the 28th June, by virtue of the electorate, to do their proper job in the selection of committees of agriculture. This is what Fine Gael are saying to us today.  They cannot have it both ways.  They are seeking to have it both ways as they have tried to do over the years.</P>

      <Col N="1927" /> You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  That is what Fine Gael are doing.  A few matters were raised which were relevant and I should like to comment on them.  Committees would benefit from outsiders being brought in.  Outsiders are brought in.  They have traditionally been brought in and at present with the exception of five councils out of the 27 outsiders are brought in.  This amounts to 22, if I remember rightly. Of those 22 there are five with less than 25 per cent outside representation. Seventeen out of the 22 have 25 per cent outside representation and over.  Many of them have figures approaching 50 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did not take the Deputy up wrongly he said that members of his council, probably this is understandable because of the type of constituency it is, have, in fact, no knowledge and so forth that would make them useful members of their committees of agriculture.  To make up for that they have been given freedom that is already there under the old law of 1931.  Deputy Clinton's council has brought in 45 per cent outsiders.  If the qualified people are so few why have they not brought in 90 per cent outsiders?  Why should we take it if it is true that there were few qualified people to put on the county council as councillors that not more than 45 per cent outsiders are brought in?</P>

There is Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and then <Col N="1928" /> there are others on the county councils but by a particular coincidence Fine Gael always seem to have a knock on others.  When they want to use the majority of the others to go with them to do Fianna Fáil on something they have them but when it suits them they will not have them.  That is what Deputy Clinton means when he says that we are equal.  They are equal when it suits them.  I wonder how some of those who have been supporting that equal part in Fine Gael all those years since the last local elections would like it if, in fact, it was said that they had the same regard for Fianna Fáil as for Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>You want those outsiders when it suits you.  Outsiders are on most of our committees of agriculture. The stipulation that we must put on so many will not necessarily bring on one useful person on any of our county committees.  It could happen in certain instances that you would deny useful people the opportunity of being members of the committees. This should not happen and it will not happen if we rescind the amendment of the 1964 Act, which is what I am asking the House to do. I think it was Deputy Clinton who said that there is a feeling that county committees are purely political.  Could I be impertinent enough to ask if Deputy Clinton thinks that county committees of agriculture are purely political?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  It is of no relevance.  The Deputy did go on to say that a great role could be played by school teachers on committees of agriculture.  He said the same with regard to farm labourers.  Could anybody tell us whether in the amendment of the 1964 Act, which Fine Gael are making such a song and dance about here today, there is anything which will result in more school teachers and more farm labourers being put on the committees, even if we do not pass this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wide open.  Under the existing law, under the law as it was up to 1964 and as it will be if this Bill is passed, there is nothing that makes it worth while for school teachers and farm labourers to be on those committees.  This is what is being defended by Fine Gael.  It is interesting to note that in the course of the opposition to this measure in his opening speech, Deputy Clinton quoted extensively from Deputy Tully and thereby implied that the Labour Party were fully and absolutely tied to the amendment of 1964.</P>
      <P>I am sure he must have felt rather sad to find that the one member of the Labour Party who was in the House to hear him immediately followed him to make the only contribution from the Labour Party.  He said that he was in favour of the amendment before the House.  As he spoke, I could only say to myself: &ldquo;There goes a speech I should be making in reply to this debate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not explain why he changed his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of you over there give us any explanation of your change of mind?  Take, for instance, Senator MacDonald whose remarks are the first I see before me here.  In the <Col N="1930" /> Official Report of the debate on the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1964, he had this to say:</P>
      <P>The Minister should, perhaps, not have insisted on the clause whereby 50 per cent of the members are to be non-county councillors.  It will be rather difficult to work out a solution whereby there are five or six permanent voluntary agricultural organisations in a county.  How will we allocate the places on the committee? Will we find in succeeding years that one organisation seems to thrive and another organisation perhaps declining a little?  The situation could well be that, after a few years, an organisation would be almost extinct in the county but it will have as good a representation on the committee of agriculture as the big representative organisations.  That may arise and it would be much better had the Minister left the appointment solely at the discretion of the county council.</P>
      <P>Perhaps he has not changed his mind and that he is not against this amendment. This we will find out before long. Another thing I should say about this is that a change of mind surely is not a matter to be deplored.  What is wrong with changing one's mind, if, in fact, in the interim it has been borne in on those of us who have that change of mind that it would be a good thing to change one's mind?  There are elected representatives from the General Council of County Councils, from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, from various county councils and from various committees of agriculture.  These are the people at local level on whom we depend largely for local government activity.  This goes without saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the vocational side, we depend on these committees for a large amount of our more useful educational activity and on the agricultural side we depend on the committees of agriculture to an extreme degree in regard to advisory services.  Why should we not listen to those people who are, by and large, the local representatives mainly elected by the legal vote of the people? If they have, as they have, outsiders <Col N="1931" /> on their committees at the moment they are chosen freely and without obligation placed on them by any laws of this House as to the number of persons they may so choose.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have the elected representatives of a rural community on these county councils with freedom to contribute to the agricultural wellbeing of their county.  We give them that freedom and it is right that they should have it.  It is completely democratic that they, as the local people, can have their own members on the committees or, if they wish, they can bring in outsiders, but they must retain one councillor on these committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with that?  Does it make that law wrong merely because we had an amendment in 1964 compelling those elected people to put on not less than 50 per cent of outsiders willy nilly, whether such people were there or not, whether they had made a contribution to or would make a contribution to the agricultural community. What is wrong with having a change of mind and saying: We will leave you the freedom you had up to 1964 and after the next election you will have the freedom to choose your committees as you had heretofore.  If there is anything wrong with it I cannot see it.  I can see a lot of good in it.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael go to great lengths to show their concern about the autonomy or otherwise of our locally elected representatives.  That is part of what we are restoring to them today.  Fine Gael, the champions of local authority autonomy, are against restoring to those local authorities the very thing which would give them back something which we did take from them in 1964.  But, because no local election has since been held it never came into effect.  Surely Fine Gael will have second thoughts in regard to their position in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister think again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be able to read it and I will not worry <Col N="1932" /> the House by going all over it again. The reasons are good, substantial and I hope, generally acceptable to all, even the Opposition, because back behind the minds of all of you who have to stand for local elections is the knowledge that what I am saying is right.  You know in your hearts it is right and you know from your experience that as locally elected people of county councils you are entitled to this freedom which you have always enjoyed in connection with selection of these committees.  Furthermore, it is these committees that determine to a large degree the amount of money to be spent, part of which comes from the rates.  Would it not be a rare situation for those of you who are members of a local county council consequent on this unjust amendment of 1964 to find yourselves on a local committee of agriculture of your own creation confronted with a situation wherein money required by the actions of your committee and their deliberations and resolution was far greater than that which members of you local county council were prepared to have on mandate from the ratepayers?  Would it not be ludicrous having to defend the action of your committee of agriculture, which was a creature and creation of your council, in making these payments, spending these moneys, and having them participate in that committee as councillors and yet having no control?</P>
      <P>Surely it is mad when you think of it?  I should hate to see members over there placed in the awkward position. even though they are Fine Gael, in which undoubtedly they would be if they leave the 1964 amendment stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins seemed to think that he could speak with a great degree of objectivity in this matter, as he was never a member of such a committee. I would say that this is no proof whatsoever of the objectivity of Deputy Collins, or anybody else, in regard to this matter.  The people who could be expected to have a fair outlook on this matter are those who have had the experience of being on their local county councils and, as a result of that, being on their local committees of agriculture.  They have had experience <Col N="1933" /> and the opportunity over a number of years, on a number of committees, to observe how they work and in what manner they function. There are quite a number of people who have spoken here today who have that qualification, but whether or not they are all objective I question very much.  But, at least I reckon they are in a better position to judge the situation than somebody who has not, by his own admission, been a member of such a council.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Collins did say something with which I agree very much&mdash;that he is a believer in the worth of public representatives.  All I can say is I wholeheartedly agree with him, and I would ask him to show his regard for public representatives by supporting the measure now before the House, because it is the worth of our public representatives in our local councils which really is at issue here.  The speeches made by his colleagues on the Fine Gael Front Bench have been, in their own way, a reflection on the worth of our local representatives.  I do not think this was intended.  I think Fine Gael, in their opposition for opposition sake, let themselves run away with this thing and placed themselves in an awkward position, at this very delicate time for them, whereby they are reflecting on their existing local representatives and may now bring about certain withdrawals of some of their candidates in the time I provided when I was Minister for Local Government, which would be from 12 noon tomorrow, which is the closing date, until 12 noon on Saturday. I should not like this to happen to Fine Gael, to see some of their very worthy candidates, already chosen at great trouble and inconvenience pulling out tomorrow, in the time allowed for withdrawal, because of the fact that opposition, for opposition sake here in the Dáil, led willy-nilly some of their Front Bench people to condemn and reflect on the worth of public local elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputies Reynolds and Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan</i>)&mdash;and I do not know who else &mdash;in various ways waffled&mdash;at least Deputy Reynolds was straight-forward about it&mdash;as did others, as only Fine <Col N="1934" /> Gael speakers can waffle&mdash;that the measure was anti-NFA.  If Fine Gael want to make this out to be the case &mdash;in order, of course, in their best judgment to help make peace at the moment&mdash;well, I shall leave it to them. As I said at the outset, Fine Gael are great peacemakers on the surface but they are very far removed from it underneath.  Quite a few of them across on those Benches know exactly what I talk about when I talk about the NFA in this House; so, let us not get away from this thing&mdash;that you can talk about the Government being anti-NFA and indicate that you are making peace.  The whole reason for the waffling, and possibly for the straight-forward statement of Deputy Reynolds &mdash;it is the wafflers one must be wary of rather than the man who speaks out what he has to say&mdash;is they are hoping that by making these inferences they have been making and the innuendoes passed here today, it will cause further friction between the NFA and the Government of this country.  That is what they are hoping for but they have not the guts to say it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>That is what those Deputies are trying to do.  Then, at the same time, you get those who speak, as I think Deputy Collins spoke earlier, about platitudinous nonsense.  You get all the platitudinous nonsense from the very same wafflers who maintain they are concerned that there should be peace between the NFA and the Government.  These wafflers do not want peace.  They are making the innuendoes and inferences and we are to draw from what they said here today not any spirit of trying to bring about peace but the reverse.  They are so barefaced about it that they would almost challenge my reading of what they have said here today&mdash;waffling around trying to make trouble.  Wafflers they are, and at the same time, coming out and saying they want peace and they are not, in fact, prepared to make peace.  They do not want peace and they have not been trying to make peace during these months past.</P>

That has been the situation and Fine Gael are not playing any useful role, nor have they done so in the dispute in these past months, or, indeed, in any dispute that arose where the Government was affected, if that Government was Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, one can admire Deputy Dillon's oratory.  I cannot say the same for his arguments and conclusions. I agree with him that the great leveller is the vote of the people. I agree with him that it is the instrument that is in the hands of the electorate whether it be in a local election or a general election.  Regardless of what the outcome of voting may be&mdash;which is distinct from what Deputy Dillon talked about&mdash;it was sacred, it was good, it was the ultimate instrument in the hands of the community in this democracy of ours, but all the time, and only if it was used to defeat the Fianna Fáil Party or a Government, so long as it brought about, in its wake in some queer way, a Government in which Fine Gael could participate and ultimately dominate, without having the majority of the people behind them, then, this sort of voting was fine.</P>

However, as I say, the ultimate instrument in democracy is the vote.  It is the great <Col N="1936" /> instrument.  It is the great leveller.  It is sacred provided it is used to defeat Fianna Fáil and put in office Fine Gael, about which Deputy Dillon speaks, in whatever way they can; it does not matter; they will crawl in any way at all.  It is sacred up to that point but there was not a word from Deputy Dillon about what happened shortly after he and his people got in on two occasions.  The use of this same sacred weapon was visited on the heads of those who had abused their office while they were there and booted them out on both occasions.  But Deputy Dillon I take it, does not regard a vote cast in that way sacred or good or an instrument of the democracy of this country.  It is only when it is used and happens to fall against Fianna Fáil it is good, sacred, or an instrument of democracy.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to consider this amendment as a re-institution, to some little degree, of the autonomy of our local elected representatives which, for better or for worse in 1964, we decided, in our wisdom&mdash;or lack of it&mdash;to take from them.  I am asking that it be restored to them now and I think everybody in this House will realise that what I am asking to have done is the proper and right thing to do, that we will have better councillors and workers on behalf of our community if we give them this back, rather than keeping it from them as we proposed to do under that amendment of 1964.  If there is anything one can say which may not already have been said about the good or ill that may have come from the postponement of the local elections it is that this never did get into operation until we got sufficient knowledge and insight into the matter to change our minds and be sufficiently forthright to come into this House and say we had changed our minds and why we had changed our minds.  I commended the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Redundancy Payments Bill, 1967: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first comment that should be made on this Bill is the fact that it is so long overdue, even though for some years the people and the workers have been getting lectures from and been advised by the Taoiseach and Ministers about the situation which will face the country in 1970 or thereabouts in respect of Ireland's application for membership of the EEC.  This will have very serious effects.  The Government have had plenty of time, but they have done very little to deal with manpower problems.  Their efforts up to the present time, as the Government responsible to the community which elected them, to secure increased employment and increased employment opportunities have resulted, as has been mentioned on many occasions before, in a smaller number of workers <Col N="1939" /> in employment than there were some years ago.  There is no doubt whatsoever that there was no factor of any kind that delayed the introduction by this Government of a reasonable redundancy compensation Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that certain discussions had taken place with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents the over-whelming body of organised workers in this country, and has authority to speak on behalf of the workers generally.  This was only a short hiatus, if you like, and it resulted from efforts to secure what could be termed an acceptable redundancy compensation Bill so far as the workers were concerned. We cannot place the entire blame on the shoulders of the Minister for Labour.  However, Deputy Hillery was a member of the Government before he became Minister for Labour and during his occupancy of his earlier appointment, the Government were strangely slow to do anything concrete in connection with a problem which they now say will result from efforts to increase productivity, to modernise methods and to bring about changes in industry.</P>
      <P>Now they bring in this Bill, having their eyes set on membership of the EEC, and its provisions not only fall far short of the situation in member countries of the EEC but of the needs of our people who may become disemployed at home.  It is correct to say that we have in the Bill provision for lump sum payments and for weekly compensation but these will be funded by contributions from employers and workers, unlike the situation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland where there is no direct charge on the workers, where the employers pay the contributions.  One of the main criticisms against the Bill will be the proposal to impose a charge on workers who may well think they are in secure employment.  Having read the Minister's introductory statement, one can readily entertain doubts as to whether, in the circumstances forecast by him, there will be any secure employment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to resistance <Col N="1940" /> by workers to redundancy.  I do not think there is anything wrong in workers endeavouring to resist redundancy operations in firms, having regard to the fact that in many of those firms the efficiency of the managements has long been in question.  This has been shown in a number of reports issued by the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  The worst feature of the problem is that workers, who have been employed in firms for many years, working conscientiously, giving of their best, in many cases working in difficult circumstances, should be asked to accept redundancy when there appears to be no available suitable alternative employment for them, despite statements made by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Labour and other Government spokesmen.  The trouble is that no initial provision has been made and an essential initial provision for workers who may be affected by redundancy is that there should be alternative employment in reasonable conditions and at rates of wages comparable with those enjoyed by them in their old jobs.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is too much to ask of the Government.  For too many years they have continued to accept a continuous fall in the total number of people at work.  It has been illustrated that they had neither the will nor the ability to deal with that problem.  I shall not talk about the numbers of people forced to emigrate each year, though I might well do so to the Minister for Labour, who represents a western constituency, or indeed to any member of the Government who has connections with rural areas.</P>
    <P>Each year there is a decline in the number of people working in agriculture; yet there have not been sufficient jobs created to absorb those people. On top of that, even in such industrial employment as exists, the Government are prepared to accept to some extent that there will be a reduction in numbers. Even workers who have been employed for a number of years in industry may lose their employment.</P>
    <P>In the Bill it is provided that a worker must have had four years' continuous employment to qualify for compensation.  There is to be no immediate <Col N="1941" /> effort in respect of casual employment or of people starting in employment.  The Bill deals only with people who have had four or more years' service in industrial concerns.  On the question of weekly compensation, the Bill exposes the Government's approach because it deals in terms of weekly compensation of half a week's pay between the ages of 18 and 41 years and a week's pay for those who are more than 41 years of age.  In view of the fact that for many years now it has been the policy of employers generally not to recruit people over 40, the reference to payment for those over 41 is a reference to workers who may well have spent ten, 15 or 20 years working in an industry.</P>
    <P>If their particular firm is affected and they become redundant, instead of being able to go from one employment to another at proper rates of wages and with reasonable conditions, we have introduced for them a Redundancy Payments Bill.  This reflects the thinking of the Government.  It appears to be putting the cart before the horse.  Instead of providing employment, this Bill is to deal with people affected by unemployment. Under that heading alone, it is reasonable to describe the efforts of the Government in this regard as being somewhat late.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever, in view of the speeches they were so fond of making in various parts of the country, that the Government were satisfied a problem would arise.  Therefore, they had the responsibility to deal with it by providing employment&mdash;this they have signally failed to do&mdash;and of providing a scheme of redundancy payments at a much earlier stage.  Workers have already lost employment or become redundant.  They had no redundancy compensation available to them except what could be negotiated by the organisations of which they are members. In some cases the compensation obtained was reasonable, but in others the problem was more difficult.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that do not appear to have received too much attention in the Bill is the urgency of making compensation available.  I understand that, even if this Bill were <Col N="1942" /> passed today or next week, it is unlikely that anyone could benefit from it until the beginning of next year.  What will be the position of people declared redundant in the meantime?  A few weeks ago we had the threatened closedown of Messrs. Dunlops of Cork.  We had Galway Textile Printers and workers were declared redundant at Flemings Fireclays.  There is threatened redundancy in the textile industry and in many other industries.  We have a situation in the coal-mining industry where, because of the failure of the Government to provide reasonable protection for the workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why the farmers supplying milk to creameries for distribution for liquid consumption have not been allowed the additional 2d per gallon that has been provided for farmers in the Dublin and Cork milk suppliers' areas; and whether he will arrange with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that creameries will be permitted to make the necessary adjustment in milk prices to permit of 2d being paid to suppliers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Minimum producer prices for milk for liquid consumption are prescribed only for the Dublin and <Col N="1948" /> Cork areas.  Producer prices for such milk in other areas are not subject to statutory regulation and the prices payable are a matter between the suppliers and the creameries or other pasteurisers concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the matter is one for the pasteurising firms concerned to have determined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with whose Department I understand the Pasteurised Milk Bottlers Association has been in communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary appreciate the fact that, while it is true that there is no control over the price of liquid milk in rural Ireland, outside the Dublin and Cork areas, a circular has issued through the Department of Agriculture warning creameries that, whereas they were entitled to pay 1d extra for quality milk to persons who were supplying the milk to the creamery for pasteurisation and retail distribution in their area, consequent on the introduction of the second penny for quality milk, the Minister for Agriculture directed the creameries to stop paying the supplemental 1d for quality milk to those suppliers who were supplying milk for pasteurisation and distribution for liquid consumption in rural areas and that this has resulted in many creameries reducing the price they were paying for supplies of liquid milk for human consumption as distinguished from liquid milk for manufacture in their area?  Perhaps he would look into this matter and particularly the circular he issued to the creameries, with a view to restoring equality between the farmer who supplies milk for liquid consumption to a creamery and the farmer who supplies liquid milk for manufacture to a creamery, so as to ensure that both who attain to the higher standard will enjoy the appropriate increase in the price receivable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Exchequer should not be involved in expenditure in connection with the liquid milk trade of creameries which are licensed pasteurisers.  That would be to give them an advantage over pasteurisers who are not creameries. <Col N="1949" /> If the Deputy's request were acceded to, the Department of Agriculture would be favouring creameries who are pasteurisers as against pasteurisers who are not creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How many pasteurisers who are not creameries exist in rural Ireland for the distribution of milk for liquid consumption?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree with me that it is rather a hardship on a farmer who is supplying milk to a creamery and has attained a standard which entitles his neighbour to a supplemental payment of 2d for quality to be denied that 2d simply because his milk is destined for liquid consumption instead of manufacture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, to my knowledge, has always been an advocate of private enterprise and there are large numbers of pasteurisers in the country who are not creameries and it would be totally unfair that the Government should militate against these people by paying subsidies.  The question, in fact, was somewhat mis-stated because the increase of 1d per gallon has always been paid, not 2d as stated in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary is more concerned, as I am, with the milk producer than with the milk distributor. Does he not agree with me that it is a hardship that a man producing milk in rural Ireland finds that because his milk is orientated to liquid consumption he suffers a reduction of 1d a gallon which he was getting before the Minister's circular was issued, whereas his neighbour is getting an increase of 1d, giving him an advantage of 2d over the man who is selling his milk to the creamery for subsequent distribution for liquid consumption?</P>

    <P>The returns for the year 1966 would indicate, however, that if advances were made for the purposes of property development, the number was very small.

Even supposing all of these to have been for office premises, and there is no evidence of this, they would at the most represent 2.5 per cent of all advances made in the year by these <Col N="1960" /> societies.

    <Title>Redundancy Payments Bill, 1967: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking before Question Time, I was referring to delays in relation to the making of regulations and administration.  I expressed the view that, in these circumstances, the Government should have regard to the position of workers who may be declared redundant between now and the time the Bill comes into operation.  The House will recollect that when the heavy fall occurred in cattle prices, a special headage grant was made available by the Government. The House will also be aware that from time to time, special assistance has been rendered to sections of industry.  Forms of assistance <Col N="1972" /> in other cases exist to encourage industry by way of grants, income tax concessions, and so on.  However, fellow-citizens, workers in concerns, may, between now and the time the Bill comes into operation and through no fault of their own, be thrown on the labour market.  Surely it is possible for the Government to make special temporary assistance available to them by introducing a special grant for workers whom redundancy would normally bring within the scope of the Bill when it comes into operation?  There is no doubt that the Government have the power to do so, if they have the will.  I do not think it is impossible to do this or unreasonable to ask the Minister to do it.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that we cannot entirely throw all the sins of the Fianna Fáil Government upon the shoulders of the Minister for Labour but he must accept a share of them.  He must accept his share of the sins of dilatoriness in attacking the manpower problem and the problem of providing employment which has been with us for a long time and which was certainly with us before the Minister became Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the worker who is declared redundant must wait four weeks before he may draw benefit. Is this some hidden economic lever which will be applied to force the worker to accept unsuitable work or work that would not provide him with a reasonable income or work which would not in any circumstances be suitable to his family or domestic needs?  The section provides for payment of 50 per cent of normal earnings up to a maximum, including social welfare payments, of 90 per cent but I think few cases will occur where, with the addition of social welfare payments, the total income will come to within 90 per cent of the worker's earnings except in the case of a very low-paid worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why, for the purpose of this Bill, overtime earnings are excluded from the calculation of weekly compensation.  I am aware of arguments in relation to other matters but not in relation to this Bill.  The Minister is well aware that a considerable <Col N="1973" /> number of firms operate on the basis of regular overtime.  They work overtime regularly and this is not done at the request of the workers.  The worker does not go along and say that he is working a 42½ hour, or 45 hour, week and that he will work an extra five hours this week, or an extra five hours every week for the next three or four months.  He does overtime because he is required to do it.  In many cases where overtime work is the pattern, the worker who is not prepared to do his share of overtime discovers either that his job disappears or that the attractive jobs in the industry are not open to him because he is treated as an individual who is not very co-operative. The problem here is that these people who regularly do overtime because of the exigencies of their employment will, if they are declared to be redundant, get redundancy compensation based only on what would be the normal week's wages, exclusive of overtime.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this again.  The Bill, which has taken account of bonuses, is either related to earnings or it is not.  As far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, overtime earnings are rated as income and if workers go to the Labour Court to argue their case in regard to wages and conditions, very frequently the employers will make the case that their earnings are to be taken as including overtime.  I think it is correct to say that in the statistics supplied by the Department of Commerce and so on, where they deal with wage rates, the earnings refer to total earnings of males and females.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand either why the Minister says that a worker must have four years with an employer in order to be compensated.  I do not know where this particular magical figure of four years comes from.  Why did the Minister not make it three years, or two years?  The Minister might look again at that particular qualification. That qualification is important in regard to adult workers but a more important point is one to which I have already referred, that is, that a person has to wait for four weeks after being declared redundant before getting compensation. Surely one of the purposes <Col N="1974" /> of redundancy compensation is to maintain the worker and his family and to ensure that the dislocation shall be as little as possible, pending the worker's re-absorption, it is hoped, into industry.</P>
    <P>It appears to be completely illogical to provide that a worker who qualifies as being redundant may have to receive the ordinary social welfare payments for four weeks.  Is it hoped that in this way the fund will be saved that expense, or is it hoped that by having a worker go within the scope of receiving the ordinary social welfare payments for four weeks, it will attune his mind and that as a consequence he will be more amenable to accepting work that otherwise he would not accept?</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised by one of the arguments in the Minister's statement. If it were accepted, the Minister, the Government and this House would have little hope of ever seeing the country developed.  It is implied in the statement that if the compensation payments were too high, workers would not accept work.  I should like to express the most emphatic resentment against that implication, that a worker who through no fault of his own is signing on at the unemployment exchange does so because he does not want to work.  This is the suggestion that is clear in the Minister's statement when he says that the benefits must be sufficient to enable redundant workers to maintain standards relatively close to their pre-redundancy level while they are placed in, on retrained for alternative employment.  Of course, this does not apply to the first four weeks. If they go on social welfare for the first four weeks, they will not be meeting what the Minister says is an objective.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says that the benefits should be substantial enough to effect the necessary change of attitudes towards redundancy, and must not be so high as to add significantly to production costs or act as a disincentive to the seeking or accepting of alternative employment.  This last point is of particular significance in regard to the weekly payments.  This is the part of the Minister's statement which is being given effect to in the Bill and which I <Col N="1975" /> think should rightly be challenged in this House.</P>
    <P>There is little use in members of the Government telling industrialists who might be interested in establishing industries here that we have available manpower, because, to our shame to some extent, we have had manpower available for years when most European countries were short of manpower. It is little use to say that the workers here are intelligent, capable and adaptable and ready trained to take jobs in industry and at the same time, say in this Bill what in fact is said by the Minister, that the level of compensation payments must be kept a bit lower than it might otherwise be because workers might not be encouraged to accept employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is proved by the fact that so many of them are prepared to do voluntary work.  Also there are people at present who, because of various industrial schemes and arrangements with the employers, if they were out of work for a period through sickness, might actually draw a little more than if they were at work and yet that does not worsen the sickness situation.  I take it from the Minister's remarks that his suggestion underlies this Bill&mdash;I am surprised at him; I do not know if he is serious: I hope he is not.  He seems to think a considerable section of the Irish people do not want to work.  I do not accept that or agree with it when we know that we have people leaving their homeland and their families and everything else and taking all the risks entailed in emigration to secure employment.  Yet it is said that if this compensation were a little higher, people would not accept employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that whatever the level is, <Col N="1976" /> there will be people who will not accept employment because the employment offered will not be suitable. This is one of the problems: we are dealing with the situation in reverse. We are not dealing with questions of manpower and placement and treating workers as human beings.  It is not just a question of work but of work in areas where workers can give of their best and get satisfaction from their work. We are inclined to think nowadays that workers are purely cyphers.  I trust the Minister will have another look at that section but I am doubtful of this, having regard to his remarks.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why, as I said earlier, it seems that every member of the Government would like to be camped in some part of Europe engaged in discussions aimed at getting this country into the European Economic Community if they do not start thinking in terms of trying to provide social benefits.  The workers in that Community get not less than 80 per cent of their normal earnings when not employed.  In our situation they get 50 per cent, plus social welfare benefits.  At least the Bill is finally before the House.  No doubt there will be a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister was not a little more generous in regard to redundancy payments especially in relation to certain employees for whom I was negotiating for many weary weeks.  The farthest they got at that time, regarding lump sum compensation was a half week's pay for each year's service and a full week's pay for those over 50.  I should say we had 50 years of age while the Minister has 41. Again, why the maximum of 16 years? This is one of the aspects of redundancy compensation that to my mind has been completely overlooked in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there is a number of fairly large-scale undertakings in the country, not very many, that in recent years have been faced with some of the problems to which the Minister refers in his introductory remarks.  Some of these are firms&mdash;I shall not use names as I do not think the place is appropriate but I can give the Minister a list of them, if <Col N="1977" /> required&mdash;that are financially fairly sound and employ workers at reasonable rates of wages and provide pensions and sick pay schemes and so on. Faced with the problems of new methods and techniques, equipment and machinery, it meant in their circumstances a run-down in the manpower employed.  Their attitude was&mdash; and I think the same approach was made in CIE at one stage&mdash;to encourage workers who are coming near the pension age to retire somewhat earlier and as part of the encouragement, it was agreed that they should pay the workers the full pension at an earlier stage than they would normally qualify for it and, in addition, give them lump sum compensation.</P>
    <P>In this case we have a situation in which the benefits of the Bill do not apply to anyone over 65 years of age.  Possibly the Minister does not know that there are people in various industries today over 65 years of age who are still working.  If in the industries concerned they are faced with the problem of increased mechanisation and new techniques and they feel that the solution to their problem would be to encourage older people to retire earlier, as far as this Bill is concerned there is no assistance whatsoever for these people.  Naturally, people of 65 years of age or over will try to maintain a position in which they have a week's wages coming in. They will be supported in this by their fellow workers.</P>
    <P>Suppose the Minister looked at this from this point of view.  I am sure the Minister can get a list fairly quickly from his Department of the older people who are working if he does not know immediately the number of such people who are working.  In some industries there are workers of 63, 64 and 65 years of age who are still capable of fairly good work.  They may not be able to work quite as fast as previously but they certainly can do a good day's work.  There are some firms which, in order to increase their competitive position may find it necessary to instal new machinery and new equipment so that they may sell large quantities of goods but there may be an actual reduction in the manpower <Col N="1978" /> involved.  Everyone who has considered the matter reasonably and rationally thinks that in such a situation one thing which should be encouraged is that the more senior people, if they were so desirous, would voluntarily retire but there is no provision in this Bill which would enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>Some of those industries have no specific statutory pension scheme so those older people will continue working. They hope to continue until they can draw the somewhat inadequate old age pension.  Surely when dealing with redundancy compensation the special position of those people should be taken into account.  If the Minister contends, as he does, that there are circumstances wherein there would be some run down in labour which would inevitably be justified, it would be rational and reasonable to provide where such run down is permitted that the older people would retire with redundancy compensation, weekly payments at least on the lines in the Bill rather than let the people with 4, 5, 6 and 10 years' service who are readily capable of being retained in the changes in industry go.  People with three and a half years' service would get nothing and in respect of people with four, five, six or ten years' service there is a most inadequate lump sum compensation and there is the added problem, if they are married, of having to wait for four weeks.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the four weeks period.  It strikes me as something like the waiting period for social welfare benefits.  It should not be in any redundancy payments which have any real objective. Secondly, I would ask the Minister to consider this half week for every years' service.  This means that somebody of 40 years who may have worked for 20 years would get ten weeks as a lump sum.  There is no golden handshake or no silver handshake there.  We agree that the weekly compensation payment and the lump sum is better than purely a lump sum payment.  Nevertheless, we think that the amount set out in the Bill is certainly inadequate.  It falls short of what has already been negotiated by trade unions and employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> I would again press the Minister to look at this question of the maximum and take into account overtime because in certain industries overtime is part of the very structure.  In an industry such as the papermaking industry, where there was a dispute for nine weeks last year, overtime is the structure of that industry.  If there is redundancy in that industry it means that the workers declared redundant will get a much smaller weekly redundancy compensation than workers whose average earnings were about the same but who are working in an industry in which overtime is not so heavy and incentive schemes applied without the question of fairly continuous overtime.</P>
    <P>I would make a special plea to the Minister to have a look at the other point I raised, that is the question of elderly workers.  None of us wants to see workers of 63, 64 or 65 years of age out of employment but there are circumstances in which they would be prepared voluntarily to give up employment.  That has been the experience in most cases.  It has been the experience not alone in the case of manual workers but in the case of clerical workers and administrative workers.  This would at least get over the problem of a run-down in employment in an industry in which they have to re-equip.  The effects of this would be less heavily felt by the workers concerned if the older workers could voluntarily retire and were given some adequate compensation.</P>
    <P>While certain criticism has been made, we are at least relieved to see that at last the Redundancy Payments Bill is before the House and we are given an opportunity of not only discussing it but having it passed through the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I, again, ask the Minister to look at the position of the workers who may be redundant&mdash;we must accept what the Minister says with regard to the difficulty he has with the administrative machinery, the drafting of regulations <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;before this Bill comes into force and at least not treat them in any less humane way than the farmers were treated when the price of cattle fell or in the <Col N="1980" /> case of industries who sought special grants and special assistance at various times.  The probability is that between now and the date on which this Bill is in force, there may well be a large number of workers becoming redundant. Once this Bill is before us, I think the Minister will have no difficulty, in so far as this House is concerned, in getting support for the introduction of some <i>ex gratia</i> payments until such time as the Bill will have the force of law.</P>

      <P>As I said when introducing the Bill, I thought, because of the many imponderables in the preparation of such a scheme, that the sensible course was to introduce the scheme as quickly as possible.  As quickly as possible has turned out in the event to be quite a slow procedure because of the complexity of the legislation: the difficulty in getting the drafting done and the attempt to have a wide measure of agreement between the two sides of industry.  However, I thought we should do everything in our power to introduce the scheme as quickly as possible and to learn whatever lessons we have to learn from the actual operation of this scheme.</P>
      <P>I am quite willing to make whatever modifications or improvements that appear to be necessary in this scheme, in so far as I am responsible for it. Whether we should try to make these improvements in anticipation of the working of the scheme is a matter of opinion.  As somebody remarked, this will largely be a Committee Stage Bill and it may be that we can make some alterations at the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>My work up to now has been to try to anticipate developments, drawing on the experience of other countries and on our own knowledge of industry and the labour force here, and to come as near as possible to a scheme that will work within the manpower policy of the Government and one that will most effectively meet the needs of that manpower policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion on Second Stage gave me the impression generally that most Deputies accepted the need for the Bill. Even if some felt it was overdue, the understanding of all the implications in <Col N="1981" /> the preparation of the scheme is possibly limited to those who in their work, or in their special interests in Parliament, deal with this work.  The general run of people do not find it easy to comprehend the complexities of a redundancy scheme.  The contributions made and the changes in detail to be asked for at Committee Stage seem to loom largest in the minds of speakers.</P>
    <P>I think it would be worth while between now and Committee Stage for everybody interested to try to appreciate the principles on which this Bill is based.  It would be worth my while to restate the main principles which were in my mind in promoting the preparation of the Bill.  I would stress again that in a dynamic and changing economy, a certain amount of redundancy is inevitable.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;economic and technological changes take place and give rise to redundancies.  We can take it that if we are to have a developing and dynamic economy, we will have redundancies.  I do not anticipate large-scale redundancies.  Even though the overall incidence of redundancy may be small, the workers likely to be affected, whatever their number, will have to be protected.  This Bill is obviously primarily social in its purpose. It provides for financial assistance to redundant workers in the difficult period between the loss of one job and the securing of another.  The Bill has the secondary object of reducing resistance to change, and resistance to change could retard economic progress and the creation of new jobs and a higher standard of living.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises the principle that over the years a worker builds up certain rights in his job, and if he is deprived of these rights by circumstances outside his own control, he should be compensated.</P>

      <P>These rights which a worker has in his job arise out of his employment, and recognise that over the years the worker has contributed by his labour to the well-being of his employer's business.  In doing that, he has created for himself a right in that business and it is up to that business to compensate him for loss of job.  I have taken the line that a minimum of four years should elapse with the same employer before a worker can be said to have established a right in that job with that employer.  There have been arguments that four years is too long.  Deputy Larkin has just spoken about that.  If we stick to the principle that here we are compensating for rights established in a job, I think four years is about right.</P>

      <P>If it were more, you would object to it; the period would be too long.  This scheme will provide, broadly, that the worker will be entitled to a week's pay for each year. Depending on service and age, many workers would get more than that. This period compares quite favourably with redundancy provisions in Britain and Northern Ireland.  There is deliberate stress on weekly payments <Col N="1983" /> rather than on large lump sum payments. The restriction on the amount of the lump sum payment is such that the worker could by having these weekly payments &mdash; by receiving the money in weekly payments&mdash;maintain as near as possible his pre-redundancy standards of income and standards of living.  This should be so while the worker is being trained or retrained for suitable alternative employment.</P>

      <P>There is certain thinking behind the various parts of the Bill.  It is developed from what we would think would be the behaviour of employer and employee in certain circumstances.  It might be that some of our deliberations on Committee Stage will change the thinking on some of these things.  I am quite open on this.  Certainly if our experience of the actual working of the scheme suggests that we should change, I think we should be willing to make any change necessary.</P>

All the important social legislation since the State was founded was introduced by this Government.

This is based, I think, on a misunderstanding of the type of scheme involved in redundancy legislation.  If this were a piece of social welfare legislation, the criticism would be valid but it is not.  It deals with the rights which a worker acquires in his job through service with an employer. It deals with the compensation that should be paid to that worker when the rights which he has established are terminated through circumstances outside his own control.</P>

      <P>What I have been trying to do, and it is very difficult, is to establish&mdash;I do not mean to be offensive&mdash;what a redundancy scheme is because no matter what type of scheme is brought in there will be all sorts of hard cases and extraneous things brought in and what I am trying to do is to show clearly the principles which were in my mind when this Bill was being formulated.  Then I think we can argue better on the Committee State about deviations from the principles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is fair.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is social, to minimise hardship but payments will also be made to people where no hardship arises, payments for rights lost, rights already established in a job.  It is appropriate that the cost should, therefore, be borne by industry and that the taxpayer should not be asked to contribute.  Deputies should ask themselves whether industry and the people in it are better off or worse off than the ordinary run of taxpayers and whether the ordinary run of taxpayers should contribute more to industry than they are doing already.</P>
      <P>In opening this debate, I said that apart from any contribution which the taxpayer is making to industry the main manpower services will already be a charge on the taxpayer.  For example, take the training and retraining schemes.  The Budget this year already allocated £250,000 for training to the new body set up under the legislation which passed through this House. The resettlement allowance scheme which is in this Bill will be a further charge on the Exchequer, on the taxpayer, and the extended employment service and the improved placement service will also cost the taxpayer money.  These are contributions by the ordinary taxpayer to industry.  If Deputies think it out, they might agree that the person in industry, whether an employer or a lucky employee in continuous employment, should not expect more contributions from the general run of taxpayers.  If Deputies think it out, they will agree with me that the Exchequer should not be asked to contribute to this redundancy scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> The White Paper on Manpower Policy made it clear that the concern of the Government for redundant workers would not end with this scheme.  When this Bill becomes an Act and the scheme is in operation, it will enable the worker to maintain as near as possible the standard of living which he has been used to in his employed days, while the employment service is attempting to place him in alternative work or while he is being retrained under the scheme provided as a result of the Industrial Training Act which the House passed this year or while he is being helped financially, again by the Exchequer, under a resettlement allowance scheme to take up employment in a new area where employment is available.  The House ought to be reminded of the total manpower policy when considering the details of discussion on Committee Stage and the amendments which Deputies have adumbrated in their speeches here.</P>
    <P>I have a couple of times recently in speeches outside the House asked managements and people who make big decisions in firms in industry and commerce to help to minimise the problem of redundancy by implementing progressive personnel policies.  Any firm properly equipped with people trained to do so should be able to plan its manpower requirements so that it can have early retirement schemes and so that it can retrain and upgrade skills of workers and prepare them for new jobs in the undertaking which will be available if their own particular jobs become obsolete.  The trouble is that Irish management have neglected personnel problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They have neglected very greatly this aspect of management. We cannot expect to escape the ill-effects of such neglect, and I do not think we have escaped the ill-effects of the neglect of personnel management. Many of the problems, I believe, of redundancy facing workers and management today would be well on the way to solution if managements <Col N="1990" /> had appointed personnel officers and developed proper personnel policies.</P>

      <P>I do not know how we can bring this about.  There has been a really serious neglect by management of personnel policy.  Neither individual firms nor this country can get away with that any more.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jones spent a fair amount of time on the question of separate appeals machinery for the purpose of the scheme.  We must recognise the fact that there is in existence already the appeals machinery of the Department of Social Welfare, which would I think be adequate for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another practical problem which might require experience of operation to tell us what we should do.  It is the emphasis in this Bill, as distinct from the British Bill on weekly payments.  There is a link between the weekly payment which a redundant worker would get and his normal benefits from social welfare insurance</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that relate to the 90 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; when a man is on redundancy payment of, say, 50 per cent, he will still draw his full employment benefit.  To prevent a man getting more than he got when he was at work, I have a limit of 90 per cent.  The point I am making is that in the event of a man drawing from two sources, redundancy payments and unemployment benefit weekly payments, there could arise the example of a person being dismissed and both payments being in question.  If I had separate appeals machinery as advocated by Deputy Jones, he could appeal on the basis of his redundancy weekly payments, and he could appeal to the social welfare machinery for unemployment benefit, and it is possible that there could be two different decisions.  That is a possibility. There could be conflicting decisions on the same case.  I am not that much afraid it would happen in practice, and I am quite willing to scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at it between now and Committee Stage.  As I said before, any improvement that can be made in the scheme should be made. If we find that our decisions on Committee Stage do not in practice bear out what we envisaged, we should be prepared to change the scheme after experience of its operation.  Of its nature, it is an experimental scheme, and we will have to learn by experience. All Parties are agreed that we have certain objectives and that we should try to prepare a scheme that will achieve those objectives.  Any scheme we produce therefore will have to be kept under constant review, and we will have to agree to make any modifications or improvements which prove necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will try to get this scheme into operation before 1st January.  My advice is based on the amount of work that has to be done in bringing this into operation.  Regulations have to be drafted.  I am told that about 20 forms will have to be produced and printed. <Col N="1992" /> Advice and directions will have to be drafted and printed in leaflet form. There is a good deal of work to be done.  The stamp by which the fund will be financed is not produced by my Department, and the advice I have from the people who will do it is that it will take quite a considerable time to produce it.  While I will do my best to have the scheme in operation before 1st January, the best estimate I can make from the different people involved is that it will be 1st January before we have the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish was anxious to know if it will be a later date because of the desire the Chair has expressed to the Whips, for the House to be free at the end of June.  I have asked the people concerned in my Department and other people to start preparing as if we had the legislation, so that if we do not get all Stages this month, the preparation can proceed so that there will be no postponement of the operative date which I have in mind.  Our deliberations in this House should not affect the operative date and any changes that we can envisage occuring in the Bill as a result of Committee Stage work we can provide for in our preparations in the Department, so that if we get only Second Reading through, it will not delay the implementation of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>As a city Deputy speaking on this very important Estimate on behalf of a very important section of the community who consume most of the farmers' produce, the housewives of Dublin city, I said last night that it is only fitting that city Deputies should make their voices heard in relation to the commodities that flow from the farmers to the consumers.  I said on last year's Estimate that the city housewife was being robbed by the middleman.  I mentioned many instances of how this was happening in relation to some of the produce which appears on the Dublin market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a lot can be said in this House about such things as potatoes, fish, meat, beef and bacon.  The unfortunate <Col N="1994" /> situation is that the Dublin housewife is called on to pay a price far in excess of what is fair and reasonable.  I understand that the farmers get their fair return.  I believe they have problems, as we all have, but some serious consideration must be given to the consumer.  For potatoes, I am led to believe the farmer receives between £16 and £20 per ton.  For that price, the farmer has to till the land, buy the fertilisers, take care of the crop and dig it up again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty pounds a ton for potatoes?  Come up to Monaghan and give it to us and you will get a royal welcome.  We will roll out the red carpet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes the case far more serious&mdash;if the farmers are not getting £16 to £20 per ton.  Would £12 to £14 be a fair estimate of what they are getting?  For these potatoes, for which the producer gets £12 to £14 per ton, the housewife pays at the rate of £45 per ton.  She picks up her potatoes and they have tears in their eyes for the poor housewife who has paid £45 a ton for them.  I have great sympathy for the man who produces them for £14 to £16 per ton, but is there not something wrong somewhere in the line between producer and consumer? I ask the Minister to pay special attention to this and to ensure that some of the rings or suspect groups in operation in this city are not allowed to continue a situation which means that housewives in this city cannot get their potatoes at a reasonable price. Housewives here are the victims of groups, rings, cartels or whatever one might call them.  They have their hands in her purse from one end of the week to the other.</P>
      <P>This Department deals with Fisheries. I do not know where one would get fresh fish in the perimeter areas of this city.  The only fresh fish visible in those areas is goldfish, if one is lucky to have them.  Here again, the marketing procedure, the availability of the produce, is lacking, though it is said there is a vast volume of fish around our shores and though we seek to assist fishermen in the matter of new and better boats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, I suggest that standards be applied to the sale of the various agricultural produce.  It may be difficult but standards should be spelled out in no uncertain terms so that housewives will not be victimised by people who are far removed from the source of production.  When I was a little fellow, I was told about the goose that laid the golden eggs.  It seems that now hens are laying them, if one considers the price of eggs, if they are obtainable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to institute an inquiry into the marketing of all farmers' produce to ensure that standards are observed right through the line of supply so that the Dublin housewife will get foodstuffs at reasonable and fair prices.  After all, the great bulk of the subsidies payable to agriculture comes from the families who live in Dublin.  A little girl goes to work and from the time she begins to earn £6 a week, she pays income tax, one of the forms of raising the money <Col N="1996" /> for paying the subsidies.  Though I have no desire to limit in any way aids to farmers, providing they are used in a proper manner, the Government should see to it that the housewives in this city get better value for their money in the matter of foodstuffs. Dublin housewives have no dish-washers or potato peelers and I do not see why they should be forced to pay high prices for foodstuffs whose production they have helped to subsidise.</P>
      <P>Recently we had a produce strike. This strike by a section of the farming community deprived the housewives and little children of this city of the necessaries of life.  This diabolical situation, whereby foodstuffs were turned back from the city and housewives and little children deprived of them, created a most serious situation, and I impress on the Minister and the Government the need to ensure that every means at their disposal are used to provide a free flow of necessary foodstuffs at all times.  That strike hurt no one but the housewives and little children of this city.  Coming to the end of that week, high prices were charged for the few vegetables and other produce that were available and by then the money was exhausted and the children had to do without these foodstuffs.  This situation was forced on them by an irresponsible band who do not think along those lines.  Whatever about the other actions of these people, that was a diabolical one and I again impress on the Minister the necessity to ensure that supplies of foodstuffs reach this city freely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was but a repetition of history. It happened in this nation before during the Famine when foodstuffs were shipped out of the country while our people were starving.  So long as we have the disciples of those who caused the Famine dictating to decent Irish farmers, history will repeat itself.  We have also a new outlook on Christian doctrine.  If an attempt were made at that time to supply the housewives and children of this city, if a farmer thought he was fulfilling his obligations by getting a supply through to them, he found himself up against the threat that it would be rammed down his throat.  There we had a new situation <Col N="1997" /> with new individuals carrying out the doctrine of those who caused the Famine.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Dublin Deputies to protect the people they represent and ensure they get a fair crack of the whip, that whatever is available will be made freely available to them, and that no obstacle will be placed by any group or organisation in the way of that supply.  The items I am concerned about are those which provide the main meal of the table.  The marketing arrangements are not suited to dealing with the situation.  We should have immediately proper marketing arrangements so that the essential foodstuffs for the citizens of this city will not fall into the hands of middlemen, bandits and others who will hoard them until such time as prices rise and then extract as much as they can from the small purse of the Dublin housewife.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the discussion in relation to the dispute with the farmers. All I can say is that in the working class area I represent&mdash;Crumlin, Drimnagh, Walkinstown and Inchicore&mdash;few of the main breadwinners in the homes in that area have a yearly income sufficient to pay the rates of the defaulters we read about in the &ldquo;no rates&rdquo; campaign.  This is a serious situation.  It comes back to the consumers. Every effort should be made by the Government to establish proper marketing arrangements.  We are prepared to pay a reasonable price for food, but the rate we were asked to pay in the past was far too high. The Government should also ensure there will be a fair supply by farmers willing and able to supply this city with the necessaries of life.</P>

      <P>I am almost glad, in the light of the first matter to which I want to refer today, that the Deputies of Dáil Éireann have gone home.  I wish I could believe that the statement appearing on the front page of the <i>Irish Times</i> today is untrue, but I am afraid it is inescapable.  It refers to a circular signed by Mr. J.C. Nagle, Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, issued to officials concerned with the administration of grants under the Farm Buildings Scheme, the Land <Col N="1998" /> Project section, the bovine TB eradication scheme and the potato officer. The circular was not forwarded to agricultural instructors employed by county committees of agriculture.  The circular stated:</P>
      <P>If you are informed by any milk supplier that he is being intimidated in any way in connection with the supplying of his milk to his creamery, you should obtain full details of the case from him, including details of the alternative transport facilities proposed, and notify the Department immediately by telephone... The matter should be reported to any of the following officers...  If it is possible to do so without delaying your report you should inform the local gardaí who may, perhaps, be able to supply some further information.  If that is not possible you should in any event contact the gardaí after reporting by telephone to the Department.</P>
      <P>A written report should be furnished immediately through your superior officer and this should be sent by him without delay to the Department (Section 3).</P>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister realise the road on which he has embarked? I know when I was Minister for Agriculture, it was a sacrosanct principle of the administration of the Department that officers of the Department who entered on the holdings of suppliers did not act for the purpose of detecting any breach of regulations. We had pushed that to the extreme situation that, even where an officer of the Department detected a breach by a farmer of any departmental scheme for which he was not personally responsible, it was not his duty to report it.  No technical officer of the Department and no advisory officer of the Department was expected, much less required, to constitute himself an agent either of the Garda or any other law enforcing agency in this country, including the Department itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read to the House this morning the tragic, if not ludicrous, words employed by Deputy Smith at Navan in 1947 when he was Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1999" /> about breaking down the farmers' fences and forcing open their gates.  That situation arose, of course, in connection with compulsory tillage.  I remember the relief that was expressed all over the country when for that philosophy was substituted a general rule that no officer of the Department would enter on any man's holding until he was invited and the revolution in the relationship between the Department of Agriculture and the agricultural community as a whole which was created by that new departure. I cannot understand how the Department of Agriculture that I knew could conceivably be associated with the kind of circular for which the present Minister has made them responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might say something, Sir, the circular was intended so that people who produce milk would be allowed to have it sent to the creamery.  Surely the Deputy appreciates the right and entitlement of any man to earn a living in his own fashion without joining an association or any other group of people?  This is one of the tremendous heritages of farming in this country&mdash;the farmers' independence and the right not to be coerced by anyone into joining an association with any group or any individual against their wishes.</P>

      <P>I have sufficient sentiment left in me for the Department over which I presided during the happiest days of my life to wish to hear it acquitted of what appears to me to be a horrible departure from its ordinary practice.  If this circular confined itself to saying: &ldquo;If any farmer finds difficulty in getting his milk delivered to his creamery, let the officer of the Department co-operate in arranging an alternative method of delivery, and, if it is beyond his capacity to do so, let him ring the Dairy Produce Division of the Department and invoke their aid,&rdquo; all this I could understand.</P>

      <P>I want to believe the Parliamentary Secretary but the final paragraph of the quotation which I have already given, taken from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Thursday, June 1st, 1967, ends by saying:</P>
      <P>If it is possible to do so without delaying your report you should inform the local gardai who may, perhaps, be able to supply some further information.  If that is not possible you should in any event contact the gardaí after reporting by telephone to the Department.</P>
      <P>A written report should also be furnished immediately through your superior officer and this should be sent by him without delay to the Department (Section 3).</P>

      <P>The Deputy ignores with complete abandon the earlier portion of the letter which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>If you are informed by any milk supplier that he is being intimidated in any way in connection with the supplying of his milk to his creamery, you should obtain full details of the case from him, ...</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I could quite understand an officer of the Department being told that, if he finds a farmer in difficulties and he alleges that he cannot get his milk to his customary branch because somebody is intimidating him, he should ring the Department and they will help him to get his milk delivered.  This is not what this circular implies.  This circular says: &ldquo;Set the machinery of the law in motion on the information which you have obtained&rdquo;.  That is not a function of an officer of the Department of Agriculture.  If the person believes himself to be intimidated or otherwise to have his lawful rights trepassed upon he has the right to go to the local <Col N="2001" /> Garda station and make such report as he thinks proper but I warn the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that if the correct relationship is to obtain between the officers of the Department of Agriculture and the individual farmers down the country they are not to be converted into an information service for the Garda or to be turned into a supplementary service of the Garda Síochána.</P>

I am sorry to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that as the circular is reproduced here in this newspaper, it cannot bear the construction he seeks to put upon it.  If it is incorrectly reproduced here, I would be very glad to have a copy of the circular between now and the resumption of this debate which will presumably take place on next Wednesday or Thursday and, rather than pursue a line of criticism which may be based on inaccurate information&mdash;and the only information available is what is published in the newspaper&mdash;I will depart from the topic if I may assume that a copy of the circular will be made available to me over the weekend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a second remarkable and, to my mind, shattering piece of news in today's paper, to which I refer again.  It appears under the headings &ldquo;The Livestock Trade&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fall in Prices is Disastrous&rdquo;.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is bewilderment among cattle producers at present.  Everybody, including the Department of <Col N="2002" /> Agriculture and I, have told them that the right time to sell cattle was in the first half of the year.  A favourable winter made this possible and now they are faced with the worst May trade in memory.</P>
    <P>At any time, a farmer can expect that weight gains will counterbalance the fall in price per cwt. during the months of May and June and even up to mid July.  This year the price per cwt. has fallen so fast that bullocks are losing anything from 10s. to £3 a head for a month's grazing.</P>
    <P>This week last year, farmers were complaining about a bad trade, but they were getting 20s. a cwt. more for fat bullocks then, and 22s. 6d. a cwt. more for fat heifers.  Supplies coming into the Dublin market were bigger then, and we had no subsidy from Britain.</P>
    <P>On the other hand we did have buying for the Continent, and in fact at this particular period we were in the middle of the British seamen's strike.  Now the only people buying cattle are factory operators.  They claim that the new grading system is ruining the business, but there is no official statement from the Government on the subject.</P>
    <P>Listen to this&mdash;I continue my quotation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>No-one can say this time that the drop in prices is due to a bad trade in Britain, because, in fact, there is a scarcity of beef there and prices are rising rapidly.  Many markets quoted live weight prices up by 10s. a cwt. yesterday, and wholesale prices for carcase beef were up 1d to 1½d a lb.</P>
    <P>I have heard a great deal of talk in the course of this debate about the mind and feelings of the farmers in rural Ireland and about the resentment begotten by the dispute with the NFA and the treatment the farmers have had at the hands of the Minister for Agriculture.  I have heard the case put with unparalleled eloquence, force and logic by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins last night when he pointed out how gravely wrong it was to break the law but how heavy was the responsibility of <Col N="2003" /> the man, not to speak of the Minister, who provoked his neighbour into breaking the law.  But, bearing all those things in mind, I am thinking of my own neighbours, small farmers, men who are farming ten, 20, 30 and up to 40 acres of land.  They do resent being spoken of with contempt; they do resent the feeling that they are almost pariahs in their own country.</P>
    <P>In all my long contact with country people&mdash;and I have lived amongst them and served them from behind my counter 40 years and I have represented them in County Monaghan for 30 years and in Donegal before that for five years&mdash;I never remember a time in which an atmosphere of such utter despair descended on the small farmer as has descended now and the reason is the collapse in the price of store cattle.</P>
    <P>The plain truth is that even the Deputies representative of the agricultural interest in the south-east of Ireland and the midlands of Ireland do not understand the position of the really small farmer, the sheet anchor of whose life is store cattle.  There has been a great deal of rubbish talked by pseudo-experts that rearing store cattle was the least economic activity a farmer could engage in.  That is all eyewash and cod.  I have lived all my life amongst small farmers who have reared doctors and priests and bishops and engineers and accountants on farms of 20 to 40 acres which were devoted entirely to the breeding and rearing of store cattle.  That is why I was so happy about the 1948 agreement, that it was into their pockets that the agreement poured the gold, derived from their store cattle that were firmly linked to the guaranteed prices obtainable by British farmers for their cattle in Great Britain.  All the benefit flowed back to the small farmer to the point that the big graziers and other wealthy farmers complained that stores were becoming too dear in Ireland.  They could be no longer fed profitably on the fat lands of Meath, Kildare, Westmeath or in the stalls of the well-to-do farmers in the better-off counties.  But they had alternatives to which to turn.  They had tillage, grain, crops, and diversification of a hundred <Col N="2004" /> kinds available to them if that form of trade did not yield a profit.  The small farmer had not got that.  Without the young cattle he was utterly destroyed.  From 1948 to 1963 there were ups and downs but steadily young cattle paid for their keep and left a profit sufficient to pay the rates, to pay the bills and even to pay for a week by the sea.</P>
    <P>Then came catastrophe.  I remember saying last July 12 months: &ldquo;You are on the eve of the greatest catastrophe that has ever struck the congested areas of this country.&rdquo; Nobody believed me then, but by autumn the catastrophe had come.  I want to warn the House that there is spreading now over the congested areas an atmosphere which if it is allowed to continue for another year will be absolutly irreversible.  I have stood beside a boy on a platform at Boyle station who told me he was the last son on a 45-acre holding.  He was going to Birmingham because he would not take a present of the place. That derives from the fact, admittedly, that wages in the English industrial cities are substantial, but what has finally spread this impenetrable pall of gloom is the fact that a small farmer is going out with young cattle and he cannot find anyone to ask him where he is going.  It is not a question of taking a lower price.  It is a question of being unable to sell.  I know this from personal experience.  I went out a fortnight ago to buy a Friesian bull calf and I paid £8 for the calf; eighteen months ago it would have cost me £80. Farmers will tell you that in the south west of the country calves are selling for substantially less.</P>
    <P>Farmers getting 2d. a gallon extra on their milk feel in some measure compensated for the loss.  The man on the small holding in Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Galway has no corresponding compensation.  I know they have the creamery in Lough Egish, the creamery in Monaghan, and the creameries all over County Cavan, and in so far as creamery facilities are available to the farmers in those counties the burden they have to bear is far less than that borne by those in Leitrim, North Roscommon, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> Frankly, I cannot fully understand what has happened.  I believe when Deputy Haughey, the then Minister for Agriculture, came home with the trade agreement he thought he had achieved something.  When he came home and told the people he expected this trade agreement to increase the price of store cattle by £6 or £7 a head.  I think he believed it.  I think he believed that, in spite of the advice he got from his own experts, because I do not believe anybody in the Department of Agriculture believed it.  I know them too well, their skill and experience and their anxiety to give the Minister their honest advice whether it is accepted or not.</P>
    <P>I have been thinking over and wondering what actually happened, and I am forced to the inescapable conclusion that it was this accursed heifer scheme.  We made the ghastly mistake, without any realistic calculation or without giving due weight to the experienced advisers in the Department of Agriculture, of allowing the so-called technocrats, the boys who formulate the Programmes for Economic Expansion and the programmes for this and that, to tell us that the thing was to increase the number of cattle.  I remember saying that if these figures were to be realised every cow would have to start farrowing, but they did not start farrowing.  What happened was that the increase that took place had two effects: (1) having taken 40 years to eliminate the scrub bull, we brought back in two years the scrub heifer; and (2) we have done what I did not believe it was possible for human folly to do: because we did not organise a market related to our intended output, we have got an artificial surplus.  What nobody seems to have thought of is: if you create a surplus of a commodity like livestock, then the lowest price payable for the first surplus beast will control the price of the entire livestock output of the country.</P>
    <P>I remember saying in this House: &ldquo;You are boasting of unlimited access <Col N="2006" /> for store cattle to the British market.&rdquo; When were we ever restricted before except by one consideration, the readiness of the British farmer to buy our store cattle?  Why do you want unlimited access to the British market for our cattle when there is no one to buy them?  Are you going to race them around Aintree or Ascot?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the situation we have created. We have created an absolute surplus and it is the price available in Great Britain for that surplus that tends to control the whole price level of the store cattle trade in this country, with the consequent ruin of the most vulnerable section of our community. It appals me that over the next 20 years there is the prospect of the disappearance of the entire population of the congested areas.  Do I exaggerate when I say that Michael Davitt must be turning in his grave.  The people were hanging on desperately with bare hands and in their bare feet to the holding their fathers had passed down to them, and it took, not a British Government, not a foreign power, but an Irish Government to create a situation in which they cannot survive anymore.  That is a dreadful indictment to have to make of a Government chosen by the Irish people.</P>
