    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in order to ensure that the problems of agriculture can be discussed in an harmonious atmosphere, he will take immediate steps to end the present nationally dangerous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not defined what he means by &ldquo;the present nationally dangerous situation&rdquo;. If he is referring to the unlawful campaign being conducted by the National Farmers Association over recent months which includes road blockades and non-payment of rates, this situation can be ended not by Government action but by the Association reverting to methods which are within the law.  The Government are anxious to have harmonious and constructive consultations with farmers' representatives and this is the purpose of their recent proposal to set up a National Agricultural Council.  The Government must, however, continue to enforce law and order and must be in a position to decide on policy freely and not under pressure from any section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware while, without question, breaches of the law are reprehensible, and while two wrongs do not make a right, partial and vindictive administration of the law by a Government is also wrong?  Is the Taoiseach not further aware that every industrial dispute is always ended in the long run <Col N="1938" /> by mediation and will he not now take immediate steps to end the present dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I repudiate emphatically that any action that has been taken is partial and vindictive.  The members of this organisation put themselves at variance with the law, deliberately, by their action in blockading the roads.  The law acted in due process by having those individuals summoned and fined.  The sentence of the court was that in default of the payment of fines, certain prison sentences should be served.  That is the usual form of court decisions in those matters.  Default in the payment of fines happened in this case.  The default continued over several weeks and then the due process of the law took place. That is what happened.  So far as compromising matters like this is concerned, there is compromise in industrial disputes but those industrial disputes are usually carried out within the law.  What has happened now is something outside the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach's memory not go back a short time to another case in which sentences imposed by the courts were reduced substantially by the Minister for Justice?  Does he not consider that in this case there is an equitable comparison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In that other case to which the Deputy referred, once the court sentences were imposed, no further action contrary to the law was pursued by that organisation.  Fines were paid, even though at a reduced rate.  There has not been any suggestion in this case that reduced fines might meet the case.  If any hardship would be imposed by the amount of fines imposed and if representations were made to the Minister for Justice in the usual way, then I can assure the Deputy that sympathetic consideration would be given to such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not condoning any breaking of the law in regard to the non-payment of rates or road blockades, the Taoiseach must be prepared to admit that non-preservation <Col N="1939" /> of law and order was not the question in dispute in the first place although it has become so now.  In this alleged dispute between the Minister, the Government and the NFA, would the Taoiseach now state clearly so that the public will understand the issue, the conditions on which he or the Minister for Agriculture will meet the NFA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation which now exists has been created by the NFA.  If the NFA wish to resume normal negotiations with the Government, then they will have to desist from unlawful agitation.  They are perfectly free, as far as this Government are concerned, to engage in any lawful agitation they like but this Government will not put itself in the position that it will be dictated to by any section of the community to treat with it otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is it not a fact that this Association has not engaged in any unlawful activity since 9th January last and would the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether the Attorney General has taken the most unusual, if not the unique step in these particular proceedings of demanding from the courts minimum sentences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts are always independent of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General can instruct his counsel or whoever appears on behalf of the State in any way he likes.  It is for the court to enforce its own decision as it sees fit.  As the Deputy mentioned the 9th January, I would like to throw the Deputy's mind back another couple of weeks to another date, 21st November last, three days after this Government were elected. when I, with the Minister for Agriculture, met the executive of the NFA.  Within a day or two of that, there was another request from the Chairman of the NFA to meet the Minister for Agriculture.  He replied&mdash; it was a request by phone&mdash;that he had not yet had an opportunity of studying the points that were put before us during the four-hour interview on that Monday.  On the Friday, within a few <Col N="1940" /> days of it, I got a letter from the Chairman of the NFA asking that they meet the Minister for Agriculture and me again on the Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.  I replied to the effect that it would be physically impossible for me to meet that organisation on any of those three days because of prior commitments I had made, one of these being, in fact, a meeting, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, with members of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  My letter would have been received by the NFA on the Saturday.  On the Monday another letter was written to the Minister for Agriculture asking him to meet the NFA again and still within a week of the previous four-hour meeting to which the Minister for Agriculture replied on the following day, on the Wednesday.  That letter would have been received in the normal course of post by Thursday in the NFA headquarters but before that letter had been delivered or opened, before it was opened certainly, the NFA representatives were again sitting down outside the office not only of the Minister for Agriculture but my office also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On that very day they announced the first road blockade of 9th December.  It was in circumstances like that the Deputy expects the Government to meet that organisation. They have already met them in what appeared to be a calm atmosphere and that was upset by the association itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am afraid the Taoiseach has not answered either of my supplementary questions.  Is it not a fact that the NFA have not engaged in any illegal activities of any description since 9th January, nor have they indicated that they propose to do so and I suggest in those circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Taoiseach and the Government have at their disposal adequate machinery for collecting rates.  The law is there and the machinery of the law is there.  I would suggest that the Taoiseach has not given any satisfactory answer to my question as to whether this is the first occasion on which the Attorney General has sent his advocates into court to demand specific sentences, seeking to take the discretion from the courts.  Does the Taoiseach approve of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the situation has reached such a dangerous stage, I would like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of the fact that the whole agricultural industry is in a state of chaos at the present moment and not only the people who are directly engaged in the agricultural industry but workers in industries such as the bacon industry are in jeopardy?  Would the Taoiseach not think that it is his duty in the national interest to take the initiative at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear, nor am I, in any way vindictive towards this organisation.  The Government want to meet this organisation in peace and harmony and in circumstances in which benefits for agriculture can best be secured and especially at this time when approaching the Budget, there is much to be discussed.  As I said already, it is a matter for the NFA to restore that situation whereby we can meet them in reasonable harmony and in this particular council, but as I have said before, if any Government, whether on this side of the House or on the opposite side of the House were to give in to this kind of activity, then we may as well abdicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to say that if the NFA desisted from <Col N="1942" /> seeking the non-payment of rates, their representatives would be met by the Minister for Agriculture?  I only want to get this clear.  Is this the only one issue?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the public are entitled to know.  The Taoiseach has stated now that the Minister for Agriculture will not meet the NFA because they are engaging in illegal activities. One of them is the no-rates campaign. Are there any others?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that this is not a simple administrative practice of the American Government: this is the law.  It was passed by Congress, and the law would have to be repealed or amended before any action other than the one the American Government are now taking could be embarked upon.  This is not just administration, and ordinary representations to the Government would be of no avail.  Congress would have to change it.  There is a very representative and very powerful committee of people who are interested in Ireland and who have this matter under consideration.  I am sure they can be relied upon to do what they can do in this matter.</P>

      <P>Individual charges are calculated by the ESB in accordance with the principles which I mentioned in my reply to a question asked by Deputy P. Hogan on 13th May, 1965. The householder referred to by the Deputy was quoted terms which include a high special service charge because of the very isolated position of the premises and the consequent high cost of extending supply.  As regards special service charges generally, I would refer the Deputy to column 21 of the Dáil Debates of 20th October, 1965, in which I gave a very full reply to a question on this subject; to column 176 of the Dáil Debates of 28th September, 1966, and column 84 of the Dáil Debates of 6th December, 1966, in which I also dealt with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 15th February to questions put down by Deputies Flanagan and Clinton regarding membership of the National Agricultural Council.  There are, as I stated, over 100 farming organisations in the country, and a number of important sectors such as sheep breeding, pig breeding, horticultural production and the production of liquid milk are each catered for by a number of different organisations; in one case there are some 12 different bodies.  It would not, therefore, be feasible to select one of these organisations and invite it to nominate a representative on its own behalf and on behalf of other organisations in the same field.  However, as I stated in my reply to Deputies Flanagan and Clinton, I should not like to think that membership of the Council was settled for all time on its inauguration and I would hope that arrangements would be sufficiently flexible to enable membership to reflect changes which might from time to time occur in the organisational structure of farming bodies.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that since the date on which he gave the answers referred to, there has been a change inasmuch as it is likely now that the appointed representatives who already know they are on the council may not attend at all? An offer could be made now to the people in conflict with the Minister if he would at this stage say that where a representative of a known organisation wishes to take his place on the Agricultural Council, he would leave the selection of that representative to <Col N="1950" /> the organisation itself rather than, as Minister for Agriculture, picking that man, seeing that there will be some suspicion if he picks him himself.  That would not mean that he would have to do that in all six cases, but if he would allow the organisation to select the man themselves, that might mean that his council would be able to get off the ground and the people concerned in the present unharmonious relations with one organisation in the country would be given an opportunity to come together and make peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Land Registration Fees (No. 2) Order, 1966, Land Registry fees must be paid by means of Land Registry stamps.  These stamps are available at the Stamp Office in the Four Courts, at the Custom House in Cork and at various post offices throughout Dublin city and county and guaranteed cheques are accepted in payment for them.</P>

This requires people to join long queues of people purchasing stamps for other reasons.  Would the Minister see to it that this ridiculous practice is ended and that solicitors' cheques are acceptable directly in the Land Registry without imposing this ludiccrous restriction, which only causes frustration and slows the speed at which the Land Registry is supposed to work?</P>

      <P>When the allegations in question were first published on 23rd February, I issued an immediate public denial of the statement about the prison conditions.</P>
      <P>As regards the heating of cells, the position is that the entire prison is heated from a central boiler house and the cell temperature at night time at this time of the year is kept constant at 55 to 58 degrees which is shown on the thermometer as &ldquo;temperate.&rdquo;  The Prison Medical Officer regards this temperature as comfortable and satisfactory in sleeping conditions.</P>
      <P>As regards the cell windows, the position is that occasionally a prisoner may say that for health reasons he is accustomed to sleep with an open bedroom window; and then, subject to security precautions, his need for fresh air may be met by the removal of a small pane of glass (6&rdquo;x4&rdquo;) from his cell window.  When the complaint in question was published on 23rd February, missing panes of glass in some cell windows occupied by the prisoners in question were replaced but, on the following day, one of them asked to have the glass again removed.</P>
      <P>I may add that none of the prisoners referred to in the NFA propaganda statement has made any complaint to the Prison Governor or to the members of the Visiting Committee as to prison conditions, although all prisoners were informed on reception of their rights in this regard.  In fact, a member of the Visiting Committee visited the prison on 23rd February, spoke to a number of these prisoners, found that they were all happy and recorded his conclusion that there was no foundation for all allegations given to the newspapers.</P>

      <P>With a view to reducing the time-lag between the service of notices of trial and the hearing of actions in the Dublin Circuit Court, the President of the Circuit Court has arranged for a fourth judge to sit in the Dublin Circuit.  I expect that this additional assistance, together with certain internal re-organisation of business which is being effected by the judges attached to the Dublin Circuit, <Col N="1972" /> will result in a substantial improvement in the position with regard to the hearing of civil actions.</P>

      <P>Some delay was inevitable during the initial stages of the operation of the Act notwithstanding the provision of additional staff in the District Probate Registries.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to highlight the powers An Chomhairle will have to provide or arrange for the provision of training courses for older workers or disabled persons.  Section 9, as it stands, would empower An Chomhairle to take action on the training of older people and disabled persons.  However, I agreed with the Seanad that specific enabling powers should be given An Chomhairle in this respect to highlight their function. There are already a number of bodies providing excellent training schemes for handicapped persons, bodies such as the Rehabilitation Institution, the Central Remedial Clinic and the Board for the Employment of the Blind.  It is the intention that An Chomhairle would co-operate with such bodies to provide improved training facilities for handicapped persons.  There are provisions in the Health Act, 1953, relating to the training of disabled workers.  It would be desirable that An Chomhairle would consult with the Department of Health as well as the organisations concerned as to the adequacy of the training facilities and the medical aspects of the training they undertake to provide for any person.</P>

The Bill itself limited the activities of An Chomhairle to areas where courses were not already in existence so that there would not be duplication.  Certain Senators put forward that there should be specific mention in the Bill of these disabled people. By specifically mentioning them they felt it would highlight the particular need of handicapped people and older workers.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can be sure that the many worthwhile organisations which are already doing excellent work with little or no encouragement in this activity will be constantly at the door of An Chomhairle Oiliúna seeking assistance, advice and financial help to improve what they are already doing and to extend that kind of work.  There is no need to fear that this phrase or any other provisions in the Bill will be only so many empty formulae.  They will be used constantly once the power is given and it is important that we extend this description as it were, lest there be any doubt on the part of An Chomhairle Oiliúna as to whether they had power to assist and what the scope of their assistance should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it does help to highlight a problem which faces those people who are already giving excellent training facilities for the disadvantaged, that is, that at present they are obliged to consult with many Government Departments, many State agencies and many other voluntary agencies in order to get a little done.  As a result, they waste a great deal of time and energy in carrying on these negotiations.  They might be in a better position to assist the disadvantaged if they were able to concentrate directly on the work and not have to engage in so much negotiation. It is admirable that we are extending the help which society&mdash;and by that term I mean to involve everybody&mdash;will give to these people but we are also at the same time obliging them to consult with yet another Government Department, the Department of Labour, or the child of the Department of Labour, An Chomhairle <Col N="1980" /> Oiliúna.  It helps to support the argument that we in the Fine Gael Benches have been making for a considerable time that there should be one statutory body dealing with the disadvantaged in our population so that each charitable body or organisation would not be obliged to spend week after week in a series of negotiations with different Government Departments in order to get a little done.</P>
    <P>However, that is perhaps another day's work but we should not fail to take cognisance of that problem at present, that while we are helping, we are nevertheless imposing an obligation on these organisations to consult with another organisation before help will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that under the amendment An Chomhairle Oiliúna will be given the responsibility not of just consulting but of assuring that some of these bodies which are doing excellent work will get help to do that work and also advice and supervision to ensure that the particular course of training is adequate for those who are being looked after.  I take it this will also apply in the case of handicapped people who are at present in the care of local authorities and that An Chomhairle Oiliúna, with the Department of Health, will be in a position to ensure that where any therapeutic practices for the training of people are carried on, these will be of benefit to the handicapped and not just undertaken to provide some interesting exercises.  I should like to ensure that the exercises will be undertaken and that the training will be for the purpose of benefiting the handicapped.  An Chomhairle Oiliúna will have to bear in mind, as its predecessor, the Apprenticeship Board did, the availability of employment in order to the training given.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add. It has all been stated in the Dáil during the many Stages of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill was to set up a training authority with powers for training.  They were given the power to examine and require standards in various training courses.  They could set up the courses themselves or, if courses were already in existence, see that they were brought to the required standard.  All their activities must be geared to the realities of the situation and the possibility of outlets and the <Col N="1982" /> needs of the community.  I think we should leave this to An Chomhairle itself. Naturally, they will have to work with a view to the possibility of outlets for employment for the people they train.  I think this Comhairle, which will be composed of employer and worker interests, will have a full knowledge of what is required by the disadvantaged worker.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 17 but in part II, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>17. An Chomhairle may, with the consent of the Minister, given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, borrow temporarily by arrangement with bankers such sums as it may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditure.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage in the Seanad, it was suggested that An Chomhairle should be given specific powers to borrow money.  On further consideration, I felt it was desirable to empower An Chomhairle Oiliúna to borrow money by means of temporary overdraft for current expenditure.  This amendment provides for that.  There would not be much point in making provision for the borrowing of moneys for capital purposes since the only real source of income for An Chomhairle will be the annual grant under section 16.  It is very doubtful whether it would be appropriate for An Chomhairle to borrow long-term in such circumstances. I am satisfied that any funds An Chomhairle would require for capital purposes &mdash; that is, to build training centres and to equip such training centres&mdash;can be provided by means of the grant-in-aid provided for under section 16 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is up to the banks to mind themselves and the Minister for Finance would set a limit with the Minister for Labour.  As originally drafted, the Bill did not have this provision.  It was intended that the grant-in-aid would cover these instances. A body such as this might find itself, at the end of the financial year, requiring moneys.  I was persuaded by the Seanad about it.</P>

      <P>(2)  An Chomhairle shall not accept a gift if the conditions attached by the donor are inconsistent with the functions of An Chomhairle.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad, and on the Committee Stage of the Bill, it was suggested that An Chomhairle should be given power to accept gifts.  An Cheard Chomhairle had this power under the legislation of 1959.  The amendment is similar to section 65 of the Apprenticeship Act, 1959.</P>

      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 6 might be taken together.  During the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, doubts were expressed as to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (2) of section 18.  In particular, it was feared that the provisions of that subsection would preclude An Chomhairle from making a grant for the training of additional workers in a process in an industry where a grant had already been paid for that process or a similar training scheme for other workers in the undertaking.  It was not the intention that a limitation like that would be imposed on An Chomhairle but, as it read, the Seanad thought An Chomhairle could be precluded from making a grant to another set of workers in the same process.  The word &ldquo;process&rdquo; was used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on Wednesday last, unfortunately I was forced to devote most of my comments to mis-statements by some of the junior members, backbenchers who, like the person who does not know how to swim, when they got into deep water, proceeded to say things that they would not have said if they were on dry land.  I am quite sure that the gentlemen whom I describe as being very decent fellows when they know what they are talking about, and who sound desperately foolish when they do not, will be a little more careful in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will turn to the Estimate and point out that there are so many things which can be debated on the <Col N="1987" /> Estimate that it is difficult to know where one should start or where one should finish.  I regret very much that the Minister in his opening address should have given to the House and the country the impression that he, starting off in a new Department, on his first trip to the House, was taking out the big stick and waving it around. From my knowledge of the Minister, it is not in his nature to do this and I should hate to think that his nature has been changing in the short time that he has been in the Ministry of Labour so that he is now going to act the tough guy.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that nobody has a greater interest in the success of this country than the workers have, for the reason that those who depend for their livelihood on work by hand or brain will be able to earn that livelihood only if the country is proceeding successfully Those who have plenty of money can be cushioned against temporary reverses.  Those who have not have to depend on what they can earn and they can earn only if things are going well.</P>
    <P>While disputes have occurred in industry many of them have been due to the fact that the employers, while doing very well, were not prepared to deal fairly with their employees.  I am not referring in particular to the private employer.  I have a sneaking regard for the man who employs a number of persons.  He is only being human when he tries to get away with paying wages or applying conditions which are not what they should be.  It is out of his own pocket that he is paying the wages.  While disagreeing with him, at least I realise that it is a human trait to try to hold on to as much as possible.  He does not believe in giving away more money than he can get away with.  When we find public companies and the State adopting that attitude something should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have been much better employed if in his opening speech he had referred to the necessity for more encouragement being given to those who are in fact producing the <Col N="1988" /> nation's wealth.  It seems rather extraordinary that while practically everybody is prepared to agree that there are two sides in industry&mdash;labour and management&mdash;management should feel that, in addition to ownership of industry, they should be entitled also to very high profits.  They are not prepared to agree that the people without whom they cannot produce anything are entitled to a fair share of what is being produced.</P>
    <P>There were a number of remarks made by people, some of whom should know better and some of whom obviously do not, and there were questions asked in the House, as to the number of days lost through stoppages of work.  As I mentioned the other evening, I am a trade union official.  I can safely say that the trade union officials in this or any other country where trade union officials have a reasonable approach to these matters spend most of their time patching up difficulties, attempting to get the best for their members without an actual break taking place.  Indeed, when strikes take place, trade union officials work might and main to prevent the head-on clash because if the head-on clash occurs in most cases the people involved in the strike suffer much more than the employers or the employers' representatives.  Realising this, therefore, we ask the other side to appreciate the fact that there must be a very compelling reason in most cases for people to take the extreme action of withdrawing their labour.</P>
    <P>I posed a question here the other evening and want to repeat it now. How many people in this House have been on a picket line?  How many people in this House have had the doubtful pleasure of walking up and down outside their employers' premises in wet and cold and snow with no wages and no hope whatever of being able to get the wherewithal to buy the food, clothing, fuel and light and all the things that a family need? Is it reasonable to say that disputes which have occurred in this country have arisen because workers like punishing themselves?  Surely, that is not the case?  It must be realised that the employers, in most cases&mdash;I will not <Col N="1989" /> say in all cases&mdash;have been frequently very unreasonable in regard to what to them may seem minor matters but which to the workers may be matters of principle.</P>
    <P>The one thing that the Minister could do and should do is to try to bring home to the employers, whether they are private employers or semi-State employers or the State, that it is not sufficient to lecture the workers; it is not sufficient to threaten the workers; it is not sufficient to say: &ldquo;If you do not do this, we will bring in legislation to make you do it.&rdquo; The Minister could be very well employed trying to prove to the employers that there must be a team effort and that the persons who do the hard work and produce the wealth are entitled to a fair return.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that from time to time situations arise where employers are inclined to say that the loss to them will be too big and after keeping their workers on the streets for weeks and perhaps months have decided to concede what was originally asked for and the loss to them has not been too big.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court is doing a reasonably good job but do not forget that the Labour Court is very much over-worked.  Do not forget that relatively small cases going before the Labour Court take months before being decided.  I can give the Minister instances where, with the best will in the world, the Labour Court have not been able to give a hearing to cases lodged with them in September of last year.  I can also cite at least one case which went through conciliation and all the rounds that can be gone through and finished up as a Labour Court case.  There was a recommendation which would require a further conciliation conference, the chairman to be supplied by the court.  That conciliation conference has not taken place.  Either the court has not got the time or one of the parties in the case did not bother.  There were three trade unions involved.  Two accepted.  The third, a union with very few members, apparently just did not bother accepting or rejecting.  Because of that, the Labour Court said: We cannot bring the matter to fruition; we have to <Col N="1990" /> wait.&rdquo; Those are the things from which serious strikes arise.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the fact that a number of sarcastic remarks were made last week on the question of the number of man hours lost as a result of industrial disputes, and whether or not we were going to win the triple crown because of this.  I should like to say to the Minister, and to those who are trying to be funny at the expense of the workingclass people, that if we take on the number of people who have not been working over the same period, not because they were not on strike but because there was no job for them, we will see who will win the triple crown.  We will walk away with it.  No country in Europe has a situation like ours.</P>
    <P>We should put these things in their proper context.  It is foolish of people who come from the silver-spoon-in-the-mouth class to make these comments. I regret that Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who claim to have come from a trade union and workingclass background, feel they are getting themselves well in with the Front Bench by condemning the running of the trade unions and the operations of the workingclass people.  It pains me to hear this sort of thing and it is too bad that it should be indulged in.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat what I said to the Minister on last Wednesday night.  There is a suggestion in his opening speech about legislation being brought in.  Before he does so, let him remember that no matter what legislation he brings in here, the man who does not want to work will not work. You cannot force a workman to work against his will.  That is where the ESB Bill, brought in last year, fell down.  If it had to be brought into operation, it just could not be done. The Government know this as well as we do, and the sooner they stop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of those people who are unemployed at present, according to the figures given by the Department, roughly 64,000 plus 11,000 are in the peculiar position that they are like Mohammed's coffin, suspended between heaven and earth. They are unemployed for the purpose of seeking the dole but are not unemployed according to the figures <Col N="1992" /> given by the State.  It is extraordinary how a man can be two things at the one time.  There are 75,000 people at present who feel they could do with jobs.  In addition to that, the number who have emigrated has gone well over the estimated 30,000, which leaves us in the position that we need jobs immediately, in order to retain those who are unlikely to go, for 70,000 to 100,000 people.  Where these jobs will come from I do not know.</P>
      <P>We had the Industrial Training Bill before the House a short while ago and reference was made to the training of old people.  An extroardinary thing that strikes us is that the older people are, in many jobs, being replaced by younger people.  While it is possible to train young people, it is not so easy to train older people and this is the big problem that has to be faced now.  I do not blame the present Government for this.  It has been going on for a number of years and this is true in other countries also. It is remarkable that as the years go by people who have been on a job all their lives are edged out and the younger people are coming along and filling their place.  There is need for a system of early retirement or displacement compensation.  Otherwise, we will have a continuation of what has become the pattern over a long period. Particularly in the past five or six years, we find the old people going to the labour exchange, eventually finding a home there and not being able to get out of it.  It is a shocking thing and I do not know whether the Department can do anything to have it changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as disabled people are concerned, we shall be discussing the Department next week on Deputy Seán Dunne's Bill.  While there are a number of voluntary organisations attempting to help disabled people, their results are not heartening.  I find that the number of people placed in employment as a result of training through these organisations is small. The number of people who have been offered the facility of training is only a fraction of those the medical people feel could avail of it.  I believe an effort should be made to do something for the disabled and I am quite sure that <Col N="1993" /> Deputy Seán Dunne's Bill, if accepted by the Government, will be the answer to a lot of these problems.</P>
    <P>I referred to farm work and I should like to repeat what I said when the Bill was passed.  It is a pity that training for people in agriculture is not included.  The Minister would do well to consider bringing all workers, including those in agriculture, under his Department.  So long as they are left out, it simply means that we have this old system of two different grades of workers&mdash;those entitled to the provisions of the Bill and those treated separately, as if they were lepers. Something must be done about this.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that this is not the time for reducing hours of work, and so on.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of what has been happening over the past few years, here and elsewhere, in local authority employment.  Is the Minister aware that local authorities who ten years ago employed full-time nearly 700 people are now using machinery to such an extent they have reduced the number of local authority employees to about 300&mdash;less than 50 per cent of the number employed a few years ago.  The Minister may consider that I am not making a valid case but I believe that apart from the right to leisure or anything else, to which the worker is entitled, if we do not have a substantial reduction in the working week within the next few years the number of people who will be declared redundant will grow and grow. Where employers instal new machinery and speed up production, it is unfair that they should not be asked to reduce the number of working hours rather than reduce the number of employees.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure there could be a great difference of opinion about this between the employers' side and the workers' side, but we have reached the stage at which the number of people who are employed in industry are being reduced drastically as a result of new techniques.  If something like this is not done, it will mean that in ten, 15 or 20 years, the number of people employed will be decimated and the wealth of owners of industry <Col N="1994" /> will increase to such an extent that they will be fabulously wealthy while people who will be depending on social welfare will be unable to find employment.  This must follow.  If people are to be rendered unemployed because machines take their place and at the same time output can be increased, this must follow unless there is a drastic reduction in the working week.  I can see nothing at all wrong with a reduction of very many hours in the present working week.</P>
    <P>One thing which makes everybody on our side mad&mdash;perhaps it should not&mdash;is to hear the sort of statement made by people like the Minister for Transport and Power, who is also the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;he has the longest title of anybody in this House.  He blandly goes out to speak to a group not of trade unionists or to a group of his constituents in Monaghan, but to some chamber of commerce where he feels he is among kindred souls and tells them what they like to hear.  He tells them about these terrible fellows, the workers, and the need for preventing them from looking for more cash.  Usually he ends up by threatening to wipe out the remainder of the railways unless something wonderful happens.  I do not propose to tell the Minister for Labour what he should say to his colleagues but his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, is doing no good to labour relations when he talks like this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour spoke a lot about not having received any constructive suggestions in regard to the running of his Department.  I understand, from what Deputy Briscoe said, that he said that he received some proposals but that there was nothing in the proposals made by the unions.</P>

      <P>I am very glad the Minister does not think that because, as he knows, a number of trade unions, including my own, put their views to the Minister.  We were all impressed by the courteous manner in which the Minister and his officials treated us. The Minister did not do as so many Ministers do when one goes on a deputation to meet them, keep looking at the clock or thinking about an appointment which they may have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We were under the impression that what we put to the Minister was worth considering. We are all with the Minister as far as preventing unofficial strikes is concerned. We do not want, and the trade union movement does not want, unofficial strikes.  However, the Minister must remember that where an employer instantly dismisses a worker, he it putting himself completely outside any agreement that has been made.  If he instantly dismisses a worker, he is looking for trouble.  It is hard to say to a group of workers, who think that the dismissal is unjustified: &ldquo;You cannot stop work, you cannot down tools&rdquo;.  In cases like that, there should be some arrangement that the workers are entitled to treat the employer in the same way in which he treats them.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the arrangement which is now made with so many companies and firms that there is no such thing as instant dismissal.  If a man or woman does something which he or she is not supposed to do and which merits dismissal, the worker in question is suspended until the matter can be fully discussed by both sides.  This system has prevented a lot of trouble in some trouble spots, as the Minister knows.  If this arrangement were extended, perhaps we could achieve greater peace in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he was going to train people in the employment exchanges as placement officials.  When I hear reference to a placement officer, I think of the ombudsman, a person who is supposed to do everything for everybody.  The only sensible thing to <Col N="1996" /> do would be to train those already in the exchanges because they would be familiar with the way in which people who come looking for jobs think. Somebody on the Government benches commented that on many occasions we find people in the employment exchange bringing in their own worries and because of the fact that they had a disagreement with somebody at home or outside, they snap the head off some unfortunate who has arrived for the first time for unemployment assistance or looking for a job.  Those people should not be allowed to continue in that manner.  The Department of Labour should deal in the severest way with any evidence of discourtesy.  A great number of these people are decent people but there are the odd ones who cause the trouble.  I had experience some time ago of a man who could not speak properly and who got absolutely no assistance from the lady who was there.  She literally chased him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I did.  He was due some money and he was looking for a job.  The person concerned knew him and would have been well able to understand him if she had taken the trouble to listen, but because he was only a casual worker, she felt she was entitled to chase him.  This sort of thing should not be allowed.  If there is any training to be done, these people should be trained in psychology.  Even if a person does not get a job, at least if he is met with a smile and a kind word, it does help.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to an information officer and could he tell me if the advertisement for this post referred to journalistic experience or has the post being filled?</P>

      <P>I should like to refer now to the question of safety.  I am quite sure the Minister has a copy&mdash;as a matter of fact, I know he has&mdash;of <i>The Building and Contract Journal</i> in which there is an excellent article on Safety, Health and Welfare in Industrial Employment by Patrick A. MacSweeney, BE, AMICEI.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A series of articles.  I think the Minister will agree that the information contained in those articles spotlights the difficulty in this country as far as accidents are concerned.  Accidents&mdash; whether they be road accidents, industrial accidents or accidents on the farm&mdash;tend to be regarded by people in this country as things which happen to other people; they do not happen to us.  That is the attitude of everybody to accidents.  That is the reason nobody seems to worry very much about this whole question of setting up safety organisations within the industry itself.  I have a complaint which I made on the debate last year on Industry and Commerce&mdash;and I <Col N="1998" /> think the previous year also&mdash;that is, from my experience, I found that employers generally felt that the setting up of a safety council, or rather, the selection of those for a safety council from both sides was their prerogative. The result was that they tended to look for the fellow who had the reputation of not saying very much, of not being inclined to kick over the traces.  As a result of that, the safety councils were not so hot in very many cases.  In know that a number of inspectors are supposed to visit industries in the country over the year.  I was shocked to find there are 21 only for the whole country.  As a matter of fact, I can tell the Minister what they are, in case he does not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a chief inspector, four senior inspectors, 16 inspectors, and that makes 21.  There may be one we did not count.  These include civil, mechanical and electrical engineers and industrial chemists and scientists.  But even if those people visited three factories per day for every one of the 210 effective working days they have to do the whole year, they could visit the factories only once a year and, if there is some special case on which they are held up&mdash;a court case or anything else for which they are required&mdash;the number drops further.  Even with your 26 inspectors, I believe there is no effort at all being made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the Minister doubled the number, he would still not be anywhere near the number required.  It is quite obvious that while ordinary factories are being inspected, in addition, your inspectors are supposed to carry out further duties.  Of the 10,889 registered premises in 1964, 9,773 were inspected; in 1965, there were 11,570 registered and 11,047 were inspected. <Col N="1999" /> But, in addition to that, your inspectors are also concerned with the enforcement of the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act, the Holidays Act, the Office Premises Act, the Carriage by Sea Act, <i>et cetera</i>.  How on earth could they do that job?  How could 21, 22 or 28 do the job adequately? I do not think it is possible, and we are merely fooling ourselves if we think it can be done.  There are 12,000 registered premises under the Act, which gives 600 per inspector. Apart from anything else, I do not think that is right.</P>
      <P>In addition, these inspectors are responsible also for the inspection of building sites.  The Minister must be aware that the most dangerous places of employment in the country are the building sites.  Forty per cent of the fatal accidents occur on building sites. Why?  In most cases, because absolutely no care is taken at all to have the normal safety precautions carried out. In fact, it appears as though very many of the building sites operate without the Department being aware of their existence at all.  Therefore, they can never be examined.  That may not be the Department's fault.  If they have not got enough inspectors, it would be impossible for them to go round to every building site.  I notice that the Minister, when presenting a safety prize on one of the sites in the city, made what I would consider a very sensible speech there.  The trouble about it is that, apart from those who read <i>The Building and Contract Journal</i>, very few people will be made aware of the highlights of the Minister's speech when, in effect, what he says is that if people really considered the necessity for preventing accidents, accidents could be prevented.  That, of course, is the situation.  Even on some of the modern sites in and around the city serious accidents have occurred and the big trouble about those accidents is that they are usually fairly serious.  There is a list of them given in this document and I think it shows how easily accidents can happen.</P>

      <P>For instance, on page 23 of <i>The Building and Contract Journal</i> of 16th February, 1967, certain facts are given briefly.  It gives the number of people who were injured, taken from the report of the factory inspectorate. In this article we can see how simply people can be killed.  One example given was of a man engaged in demolishing a building; a worker standing on a wall.  He was using a hammer to break up and demolish the wall, when he slipped and fell 40 feet to his death.  The next example was a carpenter coming down a ladder for a tea-break who slipped and fell seven feet on to the chipboard floor which he hit with his head, and he died.  The next example was of painters engaged in a factory, painting the inside of the roof.  They were standing on a working platform about 20 feet above the ground.  The tie bar of the roof members, which supported the platform, broke and the men fell to the ground. One man was killed in the fall.</P>
      <P>There is a list of people here who were killed because of the fact that simple safety precautions were not taken.  On top of that, there are hundreds of people who have been seriously injured in the building trade year after year.  The Minister might do very well if he made an effort to tie up the arrangements in the building industry.  Here particularly the majority of the employers do not appear to encourage the workers to be interested in safety.  They certainly do not encourage them to take part in the safety councils or the setting up of safety councils.  The Minister could do a good job by trying to help out in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past couple of years we have had quite a surfeit of advice from Ministers about the necessity for good relations between employers and workers.  Although they have been referring to good relations between <Col N="2001" /> employers and workers, the Departments of State have been giving such a bad example to outside employers that there is no point at all in the Minister, at public functions or here in this House, saying: &ldquo;There must be good relations and we must see to it that the relations between employers and employees must be very good. There must be no delay in discussion and it must be through negotiation.&rdquo; The Minister is surely aware that practically every Department in the State which employs men and women do it in such a way that they pay what they like.  They give what they like and they literally thumb their noses at the trade unions.  Why is this?  It is because of the fact that they feel the trade unions cannot go on strike.</P>
    <P>Some two or three years ago, to give one example, when a strike took place and the Department of Agriculture was involved in that Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture, how did it turn out?  The first thing they did was to send for the leader of the trade union and say: &ldquo;You cannot go on strike because you are breaking the law.  You cannot picket our premises. You are not entitled to do it.  You can be put in prison for doing this.&rdquo;  The picket stayed.  The strike was not successful because negotiations could not be carried out in the normal way.  The same position obtained in the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands, whose officials are most courteous and most satisfactory, will not threaten us with Mountjoy but will discuss matters with us and say: &ldquo;We are very sorry but it will take some time to process this.&rdquo; A situation was put before that Department on 11th February, 1964, and still no action has been taken.  The whole thing has become ludicrous when you find even the Minister for Lands shouting from the housetops about the necessity for good relations and saying that those conditions should be straightened out.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which the State is involved is this House: I do not mean any of the Deputies.  We have got a number of people who have been working here for years.  Some of them, <Col N="2002" /> because of peculiar twists in the system of employment, are not able to get the rights to which they are entitled.  The reason I raise this matter&mdash;I know it is not relevant to the debate&mdash;is that it is ideal for Ministers of State to preach about outside employers while they are in fact not keeping their own house in order.  They must keep their own house in order.  They must set an example and they must point out certain things that should be done.  If they do this, they will find that the general public will be prepared to do it far more quickly.</P>
    <P>There is one final thing I want to say.  We have in fact, at international level, agreed to promote equal pay for equal work.  This is one thing in which the Minister can definitely set an example for all.  While we signed the Convention, we do not appear to be desperately anxious to put it into operation.  I do not want to embarrass the lady taking the notes in any way but here we have the situation where people do exactly the same type of work with a difference of £7 to £10 a week between them.  It is not good enough to have all this talk about those things while the State itself is not setting an example.  I would suggest that one of the things the Minister could do to improve the situation is at least to set an example in such matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that I was greatly impressed by the Minister's introduction of his first Estimate for this new Department. I have further been impressed with his almost infinite patience in dealing with the many problems with which he has been faced.  In spite of his quiet manner and his reasonable approach, his infinite patience and above all his willingness to listen to people, many of his speeches have been either ignored or misquoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to try to underline again that the whole purpose of this Department is to ensure that we build up a proper policy for the workers and to develop even more the magnificent record which this Party have built up over the years.  It was, therefore, something of a disappointment to hear some <Col N="2003" /> of the contributions of Deputy Cluskey. Before I criticise him, I hope he will not mind if I actually agree with him on another point.  He spoke at column 1659 on the subject of the transfer of certain functions from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Labour.  I must say I find myself in complete agreement with him when he encouraged the Minister to do something really dramatic so far as the employment exchange premises are concerned.  I would like to go slightly further and follow Deputy Tully a bit more on the question of the appointment of placement officers.  At the moment I agree with Deputy Cluskey that employment exchanges are very dismal and depressing places, even for people whose morale is high, but for people whose morale is low through unemployment, they must be just about the last word.  They are a very doubtful heritage which has come down to us.  I hope that as soon as possible we will have them drastically improved.</P>
    <P>So far as placement officers are concerned I feel, with Deputy Tully, that we have got to have men and women who are really well trained in industrial psychology.  We do not want people sitting behind a hatch and saying: &ldquo;Here is a job.  Will you take it?&rdquo; There is something more than that.  We need to have somebody there to study the personality, the temperament, the ability, both physical and mental, of each applicant. First of all, he must study the man or woman and then he must look for a job which will suit that person and which he will suit.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is no confidence by the workers or employers in the employment function of the employment exchanges.  Employers tend to regard those who register in the employment exchanges as being the dregs of society, the misfits and so on.  Amongst unemployed workers you will find people for whom it is almost impossible to find suitable employment but we cannot rest content until we can build up a system whereby a real effort will be made to study those who are out of work and find work for them.  In particular, I <Col N="2004" /> hope that we will follow the Minister's example by talking about &ldquo;unemployed workers&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the unemployed&rdquo; or &ldquo;the handicapped,&rdquo; you are bringing these people right down to the level of statistics and you are losing the essential value of the personality.  I hope all of us in this House and all other people in public life will keep this matter before them so that we regard unemployed workers as basically people and not just digits.</P>
    <P>When I come to criticise some of the speeches which have been made ostensibly in reply to the Minister's speech, I should like to stress again that there is a constant effort made by Deputies of the Labour Party to speak as if they and they alone represented the workers and they and they alone knew anything about them. Nothing could be further from the truth.  In actual fact, the Minister has stressed repeatedly that his guiding principle is to ensure that workers will be properly provided for and that conditions will improve in real terms. I would be the first to express pride that the standard of living in the country has improved dramatically over the past five or ten years and particularly over the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, wages have increased at a far higher rate than the improvement in the actual standard of living.  Many of the wage increases have, unfortunately, been illusory.  The amount of benefit workers have got by achieving an increase of, say, £1 or £2 a week has not really represented an additional spending power of that amount simply because it has not been appreciated that when wage increases get ahead of our increase in production, those wage increases just do not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey referred to the Minister making some threatening remarks about workers striving for better conditions.  He was not, of course, quoting the Minister.  He was saying what he hoped the Minister <Col N="2005" /> could be deemed to have said.  I would ask the Deputy and other members of the Labour Party and members of the public to look at what the Minister did say.  He was not threatening anybody with dire penalties for being naughty.  What he was saying was that if any sector or sectors of the community were found to be acting against the national interest, the Government would have to act in order to safeguard the community, including the workers themselves.  We must be very careful that we do not separate the workers from the community as if they were two entirely separate bodies of people. Deputy Cluskey was trying to say that the Minister was threatening workers that if they asked for better conditions, he would chop their heads off.  That is not what the Minister said for a moment and I think it was terribly irresponsible of Deputy Cluskey to try to get that point over. It is a very easy thing to misquote people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote from the Minister shortly if the Deputy can bear with me.  What the Deputy was accusing the Minister of saying in effect was not, of course, true.  I should like to refer the Deputy to a statement of his own at column 1667 where he stated: &ldquo;To try to tell the workers that there is no conflict between worker and employer is ridiculous.  Of course there is a conflict between them.  There must be conflict between them.&rdquo;  I could say, rightly or wrongly, that, in effect, what Deputy Cluskey was saying is: &ldquo;There has got to be conflict <Col N="2006" /> because I want it that way&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that would be correct for me to say.</P>

      <P>It is in his own wilful imagination because he has not got the power or the will to think.  There is nothing inevitable in conflict between <Col N="2007" /> workers and employers and between reasonable employers and reasonable workers.  There can be the utmost harmony, and there often is, and that is the time when the trade union must come in, not to stir up trouble, and most of them do not, but to exercise the proper function of a trade union which is the raising of the standard and raising of conditions of employment of their members, raising the standard of training and doing everything they can to improve their situation.  But there are some little men amongst trade unionists, and there are little men amongst employers, too, little men who believe that the only thing they are there for is to get an extra 6d an hour or 7½d an hour, and there is much more to being a trade unionist than that.  At least I know that even if Deputy Cluskey does not, and if he does not, it is about time he did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We come to this whole question of industrial relations.  How are we to avoid industrial disputes? How are we to build up reasonable industrial relations?  They will not be achieved simply by the utterance of pious platitudes.  We have to get some system whereby disputes which may arise from time to time can be brought to a logical and reasonable conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before, and I will go on saying it until someone else sees the point, that in every other sphere of human relationships, disputes must be referred to the law and must be made subject to the rule of law at all stages. It is only on the question of industrial disputes that the rule of law does not exist.  There is no earthly reason for that.  There was a time, 50, 60 or 70 years ago, when the worker was in such a helpless position that he could not believe in the possibility of ever <Col N="2008" /> getting a straight deal from his employer, but those days are long gone. The trade union movement is now very strong, indeed, and workers are very conscious of their own power. Employers have power, too, but to try to settle disputes by means of a test of power between workers and employers is sheer nonsense.</P>
    <P>There is no question for one moment of anyone wanting to make strikes illegal.  One of the things we have to do is make them entirely unnecessary because, as Deputy Tully said a few moments ago, the people who get hurt by strikes are the workers, not the employers.  That is the wrong way around if you are trying to run a strike, because the purpose of a strike is to hurt the employer and force him to take some action which he is not otherwise willing to take.  Strikes are so crazy, for example, because not only do they hurt the workers directly involved in them and their wives and families, but also they affect workers who have no hand, act or part in the dispute at all, and who become disemployed owing to their loyalty to their fellow workers which compels them not to pass a picket.  I know that no one ever wants a strike.  No one ever wants an atomic bomb either.  A strike is as useless a weapon as an atomic bomb because it only creates disaster all round.  We have got to find some better way of settling disputes without causing that unnecessary suffering.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to the Labour Court and reported that during the year the Court issued 124 recommendations, of which 52 were rejected by the workers. That is an impossible situation.  I know that certain recommendations have also been rejected by the employers, but that is very rare.  By far the greatest number of rejections are by the workers.  That is a reflection on our society and it is a reflection&mdash;and a quite unjustified reflection&mdash;on the Labour Court itself.  When two parties come before a court, it is very rare for both sides to leave the court thoroughly satisfied with the result. The judgment of a court is rarely a compromise.  Normally it is weighted in favour of one party or the other. <Col N="2009" /> We cannot expect the Labour Court to act in such a way that, when a dispute is referred to it, both sides will welcome the decision.</P>
    <P>To my mind, it is utterly crazy to have a labour court which can go through all the formalities of hearing both sides of a dispute and give them earnest consideration before reaching a recommendation, then issue a recommendation and find it thrown in the ashcan.  If it were completely thrown in the ashcan it would be bad enough, but when it is used as a jumping off board for fresh demands, that makes it even worse.  That is the sort of situation which makes the Labour Court of such doubtful value in its present organisation.</P>
    <P>This is something which we have to discuss very coolly and quietly together, but there must be some way in which we can make industrial disputes subject to the rule of law.  The advantages far outweigh any conceivable disadvantages.  I know it can be said that the Court in certain cases will be giving decisions which are unpopular with the workers, but it is equally clear that in some cases the decisions will be against the employers. If we are dealing with facts, and if we want justice, we have to accept the judgment of an independent and well qualified body.  If we could do that and save the workers the agony of having strikes, of suffering loss of income, of having to disemploy themselves by failing to turn up for work because it would involve breaking a picket, we would have achieved a tremendous amount.</P>
    <P>The only reason why people will not refer a matter to a labour court with power to issue a decision is that they have a built-in lack of confidence in the justice of their own case and because they believe that can achieve more by force than by reason.  I do not believe that the trade union movement is basically in favour of the use of force, nor do I think it is basically unreasonable, but I do believe it has got to take a jump forward to the present day and away from the out-dated 19th century conceptions of labour relations by which it is damned at the moment. The trade union movement is struggling <Col N="2010" /> forward and making progress, but it is getting very little assistance from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I would hope, therefore, that further negotiations and discussions would take place between the Minister and the Department and the Trade Union Congress and the employers' organisations, until we find some way in which we can have a settlement of industrial disputes by reference to a court of law where the decision shall be final.  There are many factors of employment, apart from the rate of wages and the hours of work.</P>
    <P>I do not agree for a moment with Deputy Tully that there is this urgent need for a further reduction in the hours of work.  I believe he was genuine in his remarks but I think he was entirely misguided.  If he looks into it, he will find that the men who have achieved a five-day week are only too anxious to have another part-time job on Saturdays, and that the practice of having more than one job is one which is already creeping into this country just as it has crept into America in a very big way already. That will not help the overall employment situation.  But do not let us start codding ourselves that a 40-hour week is too long as far as workers are concerned. Anyone can work a 40-hour week and not be unduly pushed, but what many people are looking for, and everyone knows it, is either overtime or another job with the extra amount of so-called leisure.  With the extra amount of so-called leisure workers have achieved, it is a common question for an applicant to ask his prospective employer: &ldquo;What are the chances of overtime&rdquo;?  It is not a question of what the hours of work are.</P>

      <P>Could I get one other point clear and it might, in turn, clarify some of the points bandied around here during the past couple of minutes? The Minister in what he is trying to do <Col N="2012" /> has not been able to achieve the agreement of the workers or employers. There has been a certain measure of agreement only.  I know that many workers, and possibly some trade unionists, feel that the Minister is dragging his feet in the matter of getting the maximum benefits for the workers; and I know, as the Minister has said, that the employers are convinced he is playing the trade unionists' game and letting them down, right, left and centre.  As long as the Minister can keep himself in the position where each side feels he is working for the other, I am perfectly happy that he is steering a proper middle course in the interests of the community.  The manifest lack of enthusiasm shown by the employers has shown he is not an employers' man.  What he is trying to do, a damnably difficult thing, is to hold the balance in the interests of the whole community.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated in Cork, the Government are the custodians of the common good and must look for the advancement of the interests of the community as a whole.  This brings me to the question of free collective bargaining.  If we were existing in a society as it was 60 years ago, it might have been possible to regard the free collective bargaining system as ideal. In fact, most people, and I, certainly, do not regard it as ideal because no one situation can be dealt with in isolation. We are living in a complex, interlocking society.  When one wage rate is increased or one working week is reduced, it has an immediate effect on numerous other sectors of the economy and there is a general reaction so that if one section of employees in a certain factory have their week reduced from 42½ hours to 40 hours, everyone else in the factory says his week must be reduced also.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's stupidity is almost beyond belief, unless he is being hypocritical.  I think he is being stupid.  Never mind, he will get sense. What we have got to do is to achieve a situation whereby there will be a reasonable settlement of wage rates, <Col N="2013" /> hours of working and so on which will mean something to employees. There is always this craving for justice and equality but there is a basic human weakness which reacts right against what I have been advocating. All you have got to do is to suggest there should be a minimum wage rate of £10 per week without any proportionate increase for other wage-earners and you will see what I mean.  There are people working for less than £10 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We must build up a reasonable wage and salary structure. Some efforts have been made, particularly by Aer Lingus and Arthur Guinness &amp; Sons, to make a reasonable settlement on a wide basis but, mind you, it took a long number of years.  We have got to expedite that because the main worry, to my mind, at the moment is that there is a group of people living at far too low a rate and they obviously have the first priority.  I know there are Deputies on the Labour Party benches who would resist it but we would be tackling the problem reasonably if we introduced a minimum wage of £10 per week and agreed that all other wages would not go up proportionately. Unfortunately there is this built-in class system which is more damaging to the trade union movement than it ever was to the employers. There are signs of both employers and workers coming to see the need for an overall approach but we are still bedevilled by this sectional approach.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Cluskey believes that I am very much against trade unionism.  I cannot see how we can evolve a proper state of affairs in this country unless we have a strong, active trade union movement supported by loyal members, and that is what the trade union movement has not got. Far too often we find the wise guidance of a trade union being completely disregarded by its own members, many of whom do not wish to know what are the issues which are at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could give instances nearer home but a typical instance was over in Britain recently where there were 35 men on strike and their stoppage of work led to the disemployment of about 30,000 men.  That in itself was crazy, unjust and unjustifiable.  When it came to the solution of that strike <Col N="2015" /> and the 35 men were called together by their union to give a final judgment on a settlement of their dispute, only 17 turned up.  That showed that the British trade union movement is not far ahead of ours, if indeed it is at all. How can you imagine a situation where 35 men could have put 30,000 out of a job, and when it comes to the final decision as to whether they will settle their dispute or carry on with it and keep those men out of a job, only 17 out of 35 would bother to attend a meeting to vote, which means that half of them did not know what the strike was about, that half of them did not care what it was about?</P>
    <P>One finds in all sectors of the country a complete irresponsibility, and the only way in which we can get over this, to my mind, is to have properly elected union executives who will have authority, so that the trade union movement and the employers' organisation shall be truly democratic.  At the moment neither side is truly democratic, because the essence of democracy is the delegation of authority by the members to an executive which is authorised to act on behalf of the members during its term of office.  That is something of which both employers and workers have got to get the hang, and the sooner the better.  That means, I would hope, that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would grow in strength and that its executive would become more powerful and more able to negotiate a final settlement, without this dreadful business of having to refer everything back.  The employers are little, if anything, better.  At least the trade union movement has an Irish Congress.  The employers have the Federated Union of Employers and numerous other smaller employers' organisations, sometimes acting with one another and sometimes acting at cross purposes.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to commend to the Minister's attention &mdash;I am sure he has given it his attention already&mdash;a proposal for the seting up of some national employers' organisation.  The suggested title was the National Industrial and Business Organisation.  I hope the Minister and <Col N="2016" /> the members of his staff will keep this under review and will give every possible support and encouragement to it. I am not appealing for a strong employers' organisation in order to be able to fight back against the trade unions.  I do agree there is very often an inevitable difference of point of view between employers and employees, but there need not necessarily be conflict.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that we should do as other countries have done and build up a strong trade union organisation, which will cost the workers money.  The actual amount which trade union membership costs the average member in Ireland at the moment is ridiculous as compared with what it costs in other countries. But in other countries they do get value for their money.  They do get top grade executives and top grade experts on all aspects of the industrial situation: psychologists, industrialists, economists, financiers, the whole lot. I know that the Congress is beginning to get more experts on its staff, and more power to it.  I am delighted, and I am delighted to see, too, moves towards amalgamation of trade unions, because these amalgamations can only do good to the worker and to the employer.  I only hope my recommendations will not damn the idea, but I do feel it is essential, and I hope it will be equalled on the employers' side.</P>
    <P>If we can do that, have an employers' organisation and the Congress of Trade Unions authorised to negotiate on behalf of their members and to reach a final settlement, we shall be able to produce order and discipline in our society, and that is something which it needs more than anything else at the moment.  We are being damned by sectional interests and pressure groups, and these are things which produce no concrete results.  I would hope, therefore, that the Minister's Department will go from strength to strength.  I would also hope that they will not lose their patience, as they very well might do.  I would hope that, if agreement cannot be reached between employers and trade unions, they will realise that they have nobody to blame but themselves <Col N="2017" /> if the Government have to step in in the interests of the whole community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that manual employees of the Departments of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries and Defence and the Office of Public Works should have access through their trade unions to the Labour Court in matters affecting wages and working conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reason for putting down this motion, worded in this way, should be <Col N="2019" /> clear to all who know the way in which the State deals with its lower-paid employees.  I do not know how or where the idea grew up, but it is quite true to say that manual employees have been treated by the State, particularly since 1946, as if they belonged to some type of inferior race.  Until 1946 these manual employees were covered by the provisions in the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.  Subsection (10) of section 5 of that Act applied to civilian employees of the Crown Government and section 11 made the Act applicable to the Agriculture Department.</P>
    <P>In 1946, the Fianna Fáil Government repealed that Act and left these employees at the mercy of a group of civil servants.  There is no other description for it because the situation now is that, when the trade unions representing these employees in the Land Commission, in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands, in the Office of Public Works, the Department of Defence and the Department of Agriculture, service a demand on behalf of these workers they get a merely formal acknowledgment.  They may or may not be invited in at a later date to discuss the matter.  After that the civil servants decide unilaterally what is to be done.  There is no appeal, no further discussion, and that is it.</P>
    <P>It reminds one of the old tag because it is a case of going to law with the Devil and holding the court in Hell. We go to the Department of Lands, or whatever Department it is, and we are there met by these very civil civil servants who discuss the matter with us, assure us they see both sides, but never give a decision there and then; they will consider the matter.  Occasionally the Department of Lands may be persuaded to come along with an offer as far as wages are concerned; they make an offer and we are then in a position, perhaps, to accept or reject it.  As far as other Departments are concerned the usual practice is that they listen to what we have to say and, after that, it is they who will have the matter considered.</P>
    <P>I believe there is some type of inter-departmental committee which meets occasionally to compare notes <Col N="2020" /> to see how far they can go or how little they can give; these people make a decision which is supposed to apply all round.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why it is that these employees should be in the position in which their unions or they themselves have to accept this sort of thing while everybody else has his own particular brand of arbitration or appeal board at which wages, conditions and so forth can be discussed, and improvements made.</P>
    <P>Let me give one or two examples of what has happened.  On 11th February, 1964, the trade union that I represent interviewed the Department of Lands and put before the Department a case following on a demand for certain things, which included a sick pay scheme, something that is now almost universal, and also proposals for a pension scheme.  The matters were discussed for about two hours.  The officials said they would take the matters to the committee and would refer back to us at a later stage.  It may be hard to believe this but every letter we have written to the Department since then has received the reply: &ldquo;The matter is under active consideration&rdquo;. Slightly over three years after the discussion took place &ldquo;The matter is still under active consideration&rdquo;. I wonder if the Minister knows of any other employment in which that kind of thing can be got away with and does the Minister think this sort of thing should be allowed?</P>
    <P>Up to recently the manual employees of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries were working a 50-hour week.  Notice was served on the Department that the men wanted a reduction in working hours.  Following a breakdown in discussions, which got us nowhere, strike notice was served.  A strike took place.  It lasted for six weeks.  During that strike one of the officials of the Department warned officials of our union that we were breaking the law.  The Department did not go so far as to try to invoke any powers and, after six weeks, our men had to go back to work, without any change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Paddy Smith was then Minister for Agriculture.  Not one <Col N="2021" /> inch would he budge.  A remarkable thing happened: a week after the men had gone back to work the card steward was sacked&mdash;just to show there was no ill-feeling, I suppose.  I will say this for Deputy Paddy Smith: when I took the matter up with him the man was reinstated very quickly. But all this gives one a pretty good idea of how things can work out.  We have since got a reduction of sorts in working hours for employees in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, but we have not got anything like what has been granted in industry generally.</P>
    <P>As far as these employees in the Land Commission and the Forestry Division are concerned, when local authority employees had their working week reduced to 45 hours the Department of Lands agreed their people would also be reduced to a 45 hour week.  So did the Board of Works.  The only way we could get some local authorities to agree to operate a five day week all the year round was by agreeing that the people concerned would work a slightly longer than 45 hour week in the summer, for nine months, so that in the other three months of the winter, when they could not work a 45 hour week, they could be allowed off with less than 45 hours; in other words, an average 45 hour week.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands and the Board of Works refused to operate this, giving the excuse that they could not break the law.  They said the people concerned would have to work a few minutes over nine hours in the day and that they could not agree that they should work more than nine hours.  We pointed out that certain local authorities were giving a 45 hour week in the summer and whatever number of hours could be worked&mdash;40, 41 or 42&mdash;in the winter. We asked that this be applied, but the Departments concerned could not see their way to do it.  This just shows the thinking, because the same people who were insisting on those unfortunate men working out in the forests and rivers, working in muck and dirt for a very low wage, that they should work the necessary number <Col N="2022" /> of hours on a Saturday to make up their 45 hours in the middle of winter, were people who themselves finished work at 5 o'clock on a Friday evening.  It looks a little odd that this should be allowed in State employment. It is typical of what I have just mentioned: the attempt by certain people to class manual workers as some type of inferior being.  According to those people, they are only labourers; it does not matter, they are not entitled to anything better.</P>
    <P>Most public employments now, even local authorities, who cannot be held up as any great example of how things should be done, have at present pension schemes and sick pay schemes.  We attempted to get the Departments to apply this to their manual workers. Nothing doing.  They said they would have the thing considered.  This consideration has been proceeding for over three years.  When the Forestry Division introduced a bonus system some years ago, they tied up with that scheme, which was being introduced gradually, that when it was in operation in all the forests in the country, they would then introduce some type of arbitration within the service for the purpose of discussing wages only.  We objected to this because we felt, and still feel, that you cannot discuss wages without also discussing hours of work.  There is no point in saying you are giving a man £15 a week if for that £15 he has to work 80 hours.  We felt it was reasonable to suggest that the terms of reference of this proposed committee or board should be wide enough to cover that aspect of it.  The forestry people were adamant.  They would not move. But we need not have bothered our heads.  It has not been found possible to get them to establish this committee, although the full scheme has been in operation all over the country for years.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we serve demands on people.  A typical example is the demand we served on the Land Commission about nine months ago.  It was acknowledged.  After waiting a reasonable time, we asked for a decision on it.  It was acknowledged again.  We have been doing this regularly and getting an acknowledgment for the past five or six months.  About six weeks ago my <Col N="2023" /> executive told me to write to the Forestry Division and to the Land Commission and ask for an interview with the senior officials.  As I said, on every possible occasion Ministers hold forth on the necessity for good labour relations.  They say the one way to prevent disputes is to talk the matter over.  All disputes, whether they are workers' disputes or farmers' disputes, must eventually be settled round the table.  On this occasion we asked these two sections of a Government Department to meet us.  We got an acknowledgment. Despite telephone calls and letters since, we have not been able to get discussions going with the officials of those Departments.</P>
    <P>Could anything be more ridiculous than that situation?  Do you know the reason why?  Because the officials of those Departments know that, if 4,000 or 5,000 men working in the forests all over the country stop work, the forests will still be there as they have been for thousands of years.  That is the thinking of those people.  They know quite well that if a strike takes place it will be a long time before any pressure can be brought to bear.  If those men picketed Merrion Square or Merrion Street, I am sure the law would be invoked, they would be told they could not picket Government offices and that they were breaking the law.  If there was room for them, perhaps they would finish up&mdash;maybe all of us would&mdash;in Mountjoy.  It may be funny; in some ways it is.  It is funny to find a Department of State under a Government who have been constantly preaching the necessity for good labour relations, blatantly ignoring even fundementals of this kind, blatantly ignoring the right of these workers to be treated in the ordinary way as if they were workers in any other type of employment.</P>
    <P>I come now to the workers employed by the Department of Defence.  They are usually the people who do the dirty jobs around a barracks.  Those employees engaged on maintenance work are classified as building trade operatives and, as such, the building trade agreement applies to them.  Can <Col N="2024" /> the Minister think of anything more ridiculous than 12 men working in a barracks&mdash;carpenters, painters and so on engaged in the repair of buildings&mdash; all doing practically the same work? Yet two of them, who clock in at the same time in the morning, have a five day week and who clock out at the same time in the evening, who do practically the same work as the other people, who lend them a hand when they require it, are not classified as building trade operatives, are paid a lesser rate by about £3 a week and are asked to work for two and a half hours a week longer.</P>
    <P>Surely this is absolutely nonsensical? It is something that should eventually be the subject of a comic opera.  It is so funny to see somebody trying to classify two groups of people doing the same work, working with each other, trying to get that little bit of difference to prove that one or two of them are not what the others are.  There is one way to do it and solve the whole problem and that is to give the right to those people to go before the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Some years ago another Government were in power and decided that the repeal in 1946 that had put this type of worker and employees of local authorities outside the scope of the Labour Court was not good enough and they altered it but only in part, because they did allow local authority employees to have the benefit of the Labour Court.  The Minister may not be aware of it, but for the information of the House this had the effect almost immediately of jumping up wages and improving conditions of employees out of all recognition.  Until this happened a local authority sat back and said: &ldquo;We will give you this&mdash;take it or leave it.&rdquo;  There was no way of testing whether they were right.  They felt quite happy when their decision was final but when they found it was possible to have another look at it and have people not involved passing judgment on it and possible to have brought out before the public the unfair conditions in which these people were working, it became very much easier to talk to local authorities and to get county <Col N="2025" /> managers to see the light and see that improvements had to be granted, with the resultant advance we have seen.</P>
    <P>The whole question of employees of the State&mdash;I am not talking about salaried staff because, in my opinion, they are well able to look after themselves and have this right which we are seeking for the others&mdash;can be solved only in one way so as to give justice to these people and that is to do what this motion seeks.  It does not call on the Government to take any major decision: it wants the Government to put the clock back and allow these workers in 1967 what the British Government allowed them in 1919.  It was in 1946 that the right to have their disputes heard by an outside body, a court which would give a recommendation, was taken away.  We are now asking that it be given back.</P>
    <P>In talking of these workers, I may be talking about conditions of which the Minister may not know much, but I am sure that as a Deputy in his own constituency representations have been made to him particularly by forestry workers&mdash;I am sure there are forests in Clare&mdash;about conditions of employment and wages.  While at present we feel we have got a certain distance on the question of wages and bonus, there is absolutely no reason why conditions of employment should not be improved.</P>
    <P>The Board of Works are in a peculiar position because while we have been working for, and had hoped to get, both sick pay and pension schemes for the people employed by the State, and while it is easy enough to deal with the Board so far as the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and certain others, those employed in parks and so on around the city are concerned&mdash;I am sure Deputy Larkin knows more about this than I do&mdash;those who are employed on arterial drainage are a different matter.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever bothered to look at men working on arterial drainage.  I think it is the dirtiest and most slavish job in the country.  I understand one of the big objections to <Col N="2026" /> reducing the working hours in that type of work originally was that there was a considerable amount of overtime done in the summer and I was told on one occasion that they were not very anxious to pay pretty high wages because it was felt that it would reflect so much in overtime and would mean that, possibly, people would have sufficient wages without working overtime and, therefore, would not work it.</P>
    <P>I have been visiting gangs working on arterial drainage who start at 8 o'clock in the morning in the summer and are still working for the State at 9 o'clock at night and the excuse always given is that they must take advantage of the fine weather.  What does this do?  A certain amount of money is allocated for a particular job at the beginning of the year and, as happened last year at one of the rivers in the west, a big number of men may be laid off over the winter period because the money runs out. What I could not understand in that case was that when very many of these people went to the labour exchanges and signed on they received as much as or in some cases more than, they had got for working the full week.  These people would rather work but the State decided in its blindness that was how the matter should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The argument in favour of giving the right to appeal to an outside court to the State employees to whom I have referred is, in our opinion, unanswerable. I am very anxious to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter. Possibly he will stand up and shorten the discussion by saying that he now proposes to give full rights to these people straight away in which case we shall not need to continue the discussion. We feel that our argument is unanswerable and that the Minister and the Government must at the earliest possible time decide that these people are entitled to have their cases heard and so put an end to this business of fair claims being put to State Departments, getting a reply that the matter is under consideration and finally having it dealt with unilaterally <Col N="2027" /> by civil servants stating that the matter has been disposed of by the Minister. They always quote the Minister as having made the decision but in many cases the poor Minister does not even know the cases are being considered; he would not know anything about it, in any case.  I ask the Minister in this case to make the necessary decision and have what is sought in the motion granted as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The existing position about this matter is a statutory one.  As Deputies know, under the Industrial Relations Act of 1946 a person who is an employee under the State has not access to the Labour Court.  That position can only be changed by legislation.  As Deputies are aware, in the proposals for the amendment of the 1946 Act which I circulated last April, I indicated my intention to provide that industrial workers employed by the State will have access to the Labour Court for the purposes of trade disputes.  My intention is to provide that such workers as do not come within the ambit of the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration machinery will have the Labour Court and its conciliation service at their disposal to assist in solving their disputes.</P>
      <P>A very wide variety of workers is involved.  It would not be practicable to specify them all in an Act one by one particularly as some of them are within the scope of the conciliation and arbitration machinery and others are not. It is intended that provision will be made whereby the Minister for Finance will identify the workers employed by the State who are not within the ambit of conciliation and arbitration schemes. The object of that is not to keep anybody out but to make sure that those who have not got the benefit of conciliation and arbitration machinery will have access to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in line with the general declared policy of the Government that the Labour Court and the conciliation service should be used as widely as possible <Col N="2028" /> for disputes about wages and conditions of service.  It is a matter for legislation.  Deputies will have a chance of discussing it more fully on the Bill which I intend to have before the Dáil after Easter, if possible.  I think that the general principle of the motion is acceptable.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister indicated the intention of the Government to accept the principle contained in the motion.  I asked the Minister whether these schemes of conciliation and arbitration will be maintained for the people who had them.  I do not think I had a clear answer from the Minister in regard to it that there was that intent to maintain conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service, as such.  The Minister now says that he intends to introduce legislation to throw the Labour Court and its conciliation service open to the types of people Deputy Tully has been speaking about and who have been awaiting it for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says further that the Minister for Finance will determine who will have these services open to them.  Does he intend, within the <Col N="2029" /> framework of that legislation, that the Minister for Finance will have the determination of the classes of people who may proceed to the Labour Court or the people who will still be assigned to conciliation and arbitration?  We have to await the legislation but perhaps the Minister knows his mind on this matter now.  There may be people who feel they should have the right to go to the Labour Court but who will nevertheless still be confined to the type of conciliation and arbitration which exists at present and on which, indeed, there has been a good deal of comment as being unsatisfactory from the point of view of those people.  A great many people in the lower echelons of the Civil Service were not so satisfied with it.  I want to know whether the people for whom Deputy Tully has been speaking on this motion will, broadly speaking, have direct access to the machinery of the Labour Court and the conciliation service within the determination of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>There are people who already have conciliation and arbitration. It is reasonable that, after that, they would not go to the Labour Court.

It is also intended and hoped that, in time, the arbitration part of conciliation and arbitration schemes &mdash;the schemes in which the Deputy is interested&mdash;will be dealt with in some form by the Labour Court so that, instead of an Arbitration Council with a chairman appointed, there will be one arbitrator in all the conciliation <Col N="2030" /> and arbitration machinery, and this would be the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully has outlined the reason for putting down this motion.  There may be a small modicum of satisfaction from the Minister's indication that he intends to introduce legislation to deal, however, with only part of the problem.  In his statement referring to the classes of employees excluded from conciliation Labour Court machinery or, in fact, from the right to be engaged in effective negotiations under the 1946 Act, the Minister indicated that, as Minister for Labour, he will not do what has been asked, namely, provide for the employees of the Department of Lands, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defence, and so on, the same opportunities of having their cases negotiated as are open to workers generally who come within the ambit of the Labour Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have agreed to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed to do portion of it.  He has gone on to speak about workers who do not come within the scope of conciliation and arbitration machinery.  Is the Minister for Finance, in the view of the Minister, the person to indicate these classes or sections of workers?  There are quite a number of sections of workers in public employment who have almost a backdoor approach to conciliation and arbitration machinery.  They are the orphans of the storm.  At times, they are the people who are supposed to be represented by an organisation called &ldquo;The Government Employees Federation&rdquo; who have an indirect approach to the conciliation and arbitration machinery but, to all intents and purposes, they might not have this machinery available to them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are grades of workers employed in the Department of Lands, in the Department of Defence, in the <Col N="2031" /> Department of Justice and in every other Department who have this distant relation to conciliation and arbitration machinery.  I shall not say it is fully satisfactory as far as general Civil Service grades are concerned but at least, as Deputy Tully has pointed out, they are a large enough body and an important enough body to be able to look after themselves.  These may be persons who, at this stage, the Minister may be leaving to the Minister for Finance and who are still being excluded while he is now prepared to grant to other workers the opportunity of having their cases dealt with publicly, in the light of public opinion, and this is rather important.  A watchman or minor employee in the Department of Justice may be working in the Four Courts.  He may be covered by, as far as he is concerned, the alleged conciliation and arbitration machinery.  He may be working 50, 60 or 72 hours a week, whereas, in industry, in recent years there has been no instance of watchmen working such hours.  If the case is dealt with by conciliation and arbitration machinery, there is no comparable case on which to base his claim.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the conciliation and arbitration machinery provided for the Civil Service deals primarily with the matter of salaries and there are certain standards of duty hours and conditions.  Everyone in this House and those outside the House who have any knowledge of the circumstances know that the working hours of the persons mentioned by Deputy Tully, those employed in Forestry, the Board of Works, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defence, apart from certain grades in the city of Dublin in whose case agreement was reached after prolonged bargaining, considerably exceed the hours applicable to industrial workers.</P>
    <P>It may be of some satisfaction to learn now that the Minister proposes to introduce legislation to extend access to the Labour Court to certain employees but the indication is that he is proposing to extend it only to certain employees.  The situation of certain others is still unclear.  The House is entitled <Col N="2032" /> to be informed fully on this matter.  The Minister for Labour should give a full list of the categories and classes to whom he is prepared to extend access to the Labour Court.  If he does not do that at this stage, he should do so at a later stage.  We have had first a statement that the legislation will apply to all those the Minister for Finance agrees are not already covered by some form of conciliation and arbitration machinery.  The Minister does not indicate who these people are, the Departments in which they work or the number in question.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is not replying to the motion moved by Deputy Tully on behalf of the Labour Party.  That is the function of the Minister for Labour.  If the Minister for Labour were prepared to say that he was bringing in legislation to cover all the people referred to in the motion in the name of the Labour Party, then it might well be that, in the interests of having the matter dealt with as expeditiously as possible, we might consider withdrawing the motion.  But the Minister for Labour does not say that.  He says that he will introduce proposals in this House at a later stage. He has not given us a date or any indication as to when any proposals might become effective as far as these workers are concerned.  He has not given any clear indication as to the grades of workers that will be covered or that will be excluded.  The exclusions might not affect a very large number of workers but the Minister has not been very helpful in this regard.  The House could be faced with the situation that the exclusions proposed by the Minister for Finance might involve a large number of individual workers, whether employed in the Board of Works, the Department of Lands, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defence or any other Government Department.</P>
    <P>What is being sought for the workers in these Departments is a right that is enjoyed by workers in industry, commerce and the distributive trades, the right to negotiation.  That negotiation should not be limited to the type of negotiation that Deputy <Col N="2033" /> Tully and others have had to engage in over the years.  I refer to negotiation which consisted of talking to a sympathetic senior officer of a sub-department such as the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands or talking to a principal officer of the Office of Public Works who might be quite sympathetic and willing to meet one in a reasonable way but the person acting for the workers knew very well that all he was doing was making a case and that the officer concerned had no authority to give any indication as to what might be the outcome of the representations.  Even if the workers' representative went further and accompanied a deputation of workers to a Parliamentary Secretary who would be in the eyes of the ordinary worker an individual of some importance and authority, he would be received courteously but would know when he came away that all he had got was courtesy and that he might get a communication within a short time stating that the matter was one for the Minister, meaning, of course, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This structure of delay and frustration may not appear to be of any great significance to persons in receipt of fairly substantial salaries who may be working in reasonable conditions in offices and who can return to their homes at five o'clock on a Friday evening and have the weekend free to play golf or to go fishing or to go to the strand but it is very important to persons who may be working long hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is now in the House.  I am quite sure he knows the problems and difficulties confronting persons in his constituency in the west of Ireland who may be working on arterial drainage schemes.  The Minister for Labour must know the problems.  Rural Deputies know the problems of those engaged in afforestation and the conditions in which they have to work.  The least that might be secured for these workers is that legitimate applications made on their behalf in respect of wage improvements or bonus payments for productivity or reduction of working <Col N="2034" /> hours or for improved conditions should be dealt with reasonably and expeditiously.  One approach should be to deal with applications in a reasonable manner and expeditiously. Deputy Tully will agree with me, as we have had experience in dealing with these Departments, that if you get a decision in 12 months, it is a major miracle and if you get something in two years, it is a minor miracle.  Two or three years constant representation to and negotiation with senior officers, Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers is the usual lot of those who are trying to do something for these workers.</P>
    <P>I said in an earlier discussion, and I repeat it without fear of contradiction, that in certain grades of Government employment, the worst employer is the State.  Every Deputy must take responsibility for that situation. Deputies on all sides of the House have not been vocal enough in ensuring on behalf of these workers that at least the basic social justices are applied.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us on these benches encouragement this evening but, again, it is qualified.  At this stage we have not been made fully aware why the Minister is responsible to the extent that his proposals will be qualified by decisions of the Minister for Finance.  Surely the Minister could indicate in his reply the measure of his responsibility, when he says he is introducing legislation to bring these workers within the ambit of the Labour Court conciliation and arbitration machinery.  Surely he could also indicate that, in respect of the others, he would have their case examined to see whether manual worker grades who have some form of cover under conciliation and arbitration machinery have, in fact, any effective machinery at their disposal, or whether it is just a cloak that has been of no benefit to these workers for many years.  The value of conciliation machinery under the Labour Court has proved to be of vital importance in settling disputes, and full conciliation machinery under the Labour Court could contribute considerably to removing the widespread dissatisfaction <Col N="2035" /> that exists in all the ranks of Government manual employees.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the investigation procedure would give the workers' representatives the opportunity of bringing the case of those they represent out into the open.  This would place the responsibility on the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary responsible, to answer in public for his failure to treat the workers in the Department in a just, humane and reasonable way.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on our community that year after year when the question of those in the manual grades in the public service comes up, the attitude adopted by the Government is: &ldquo;We will be the very last in the field to bring in either adjustments in wage rates or improvements in working hours and conditions; we will insist on having evidence to show that practically every section of the community, the overwhelming majority of those employed in comparable work by private employers, have made the changes before we move.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely this is a sad commentary on a Government who at least claim to inherit responsibility for looking after the people, in particular for those who are physically or economically unable to protect themselves and improve their own position?  Surely in such a situation the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary who has just come in, will agree that it is a sad commentary on those who have sat in the Front Benches as Ministers of a Fianna Fáil Government for many years?  Those who need consideration, and who have not been treated with justice in respect of their wage rates and their working hours and conditions, are the people who do not get, and have not got, due attention.</P>
    <P>I suppose when the Minister for Labour comes along with his proposals he and his colleagues will go stamping around the country telling the people in the Office of Public Works, in the Department of Lands, those working in forests and on arterial drainage, and so on, how wonderful the Government are, what wonderful things they are <Col N="2036" /> doing, in the hope that the long years of injustice perpetrated by this very Government will be forgotten in the time of some improvement.</P>
    <P>We would be much happier if the Minister for Labour had indicated that he would bring in these proposals at an early date so that there would be an opportunity of having the case of the workers dealt with on the same basis as applies to workers throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would suggest to the Minister that the question of exclusion at the behest of the Minister for Finance might be examined so as to ensure that manual workers will not still be left without the opportunity of having their case dealt with publicly and under a type of machinery that has been accepted in the past as reasonable in dealing with claims for wage rates, conditions of work, holiday improvements, and so on.</P>
    <P>This is all that needs to be said on this subject this evening.  We hope the Minister will bring in this legislation before he thinks of making it part and parcel of the general industrial relations procedure.  It appears to us on these benches that bringing the workers within the ambit of the Labour Court would require only a very simple amendment of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946. It would only be necessary for the Minister to put in an amendment deleting the references to the exclusions of certain classes of workers.  If the Minister did that, that legislation could go through this House very quickly with goodwill and the workers could be brought within the scope of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I may have misunderstood what the Minister said but it appears to be his intention to bring in these proposals in relation to the workers affected by the motion in conjunction with his general proposals relating to a review of the industrial relations machinery. That could entail a prolonged delay. There does not appear to have been any agreement in regard to this.  The Minister said tonight that the principle has been approved but surely he <Col N="2037" /> can go the whole hog and bring in a short amendment to the Industrial Relations Act to secure, even prior to any proposed changes in industrial relations procedures, that the workers can be brought within the scope of the Labour Court.  That is what we are looking for and it could be done very quickly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is sincere about what he told us, this could be done very quickly as it would only mean changes in a few words in the sections in which it says that certain classes are excluded.  He would merely have to introduce an amendment deleting the references to the exclusion of employees of the Departments of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries and Defence in the existing Act.  This would make available to the workers something that all reasonable men in this House &mdash;I do not know if there are any reasonable men on those benches; sometimes I doubt it and sometimes I see a spark of reasonableness&mdash; would agree with.  It is reasonable and it would afford the workers the opportunity of having their cases dealt with in the normal way of conciliation, investigation and if necessary, dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party believe this motion has a great deal to commend it and we hope the Government will give it sympathetic consideration.  The theory behind the present erroneous conduct of the State appears to be based on an assumption, which has no basis in reason and which is not expedient in the light of experience, that the State can do no wrong.  I suppose this runs from the ancient and now dishonoured notion that the king can do no wrong and that on the part of the State all things are right and the State is a good employer and should not be submitted to the discipline and investigation and annovance of an independent tribunal like the Labour Court and that it should not be interfered with by an outside trade union. This is an unacceptable theory in these days, or should be unacceptable. Our own experience has been that our State, our Executive, even <Col N="2038" /> though controlled by Irish people, can be unfair.</P>
      <P>It is not now a question of hating the ancient enemy and of not wishing to be dictated to by a foreign Government. It is now a question of disciplining our own authority and being prepared to accept the independent advice which is available from the Labour Court.  It is an intolerable burden to impose on people who are working for the State to say: &ldquo;You may not get guidance or advice from the trade unions and people skilled in negotiating, and if you come in as manual employees in the Department of Lands, or the Department of Agriculture, or the Department of Defence, or the Office of Public Works, you must forgo your right to have an independent organisation to argue your case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an answer to the criticism which is offered in this motion to say that the workers may have their own organisations within the Department, within the control of the State, to argue their cases, because they are subjected to the disciplines which apply to employment in the State.  You have not got that independence of thought or that independence of approach to authority which could be available to the workers if they were advised by some outside body. As an example of the great wrong done to workers by a continuation of the present exclusions, I would instance the case of a worker who is injured while in the employment of the State.  Such a worker will be paid workmen's compensation which at present is at the frightfully inadequate figure of £4 10s a week maximum, but if, as not infrequently happens, the injury is sustained as a result of negligence on the part of the State, or is due to a defect in machinery or in the system of working, the worker has no redress and the limit of his compensation will be the £4 10s.  A worker who may be maimed for life, completely unable to work, who may have suffered some physical deformity, will receive no compensation from the employer other than that provided in the workmen's compensation code, which, as I say, is now <Col N="2039" /> £4 10s a week.  However, even if the Workmen's Compensation Act, which was passed a long time ago by the Oireachtas, were brought into operation, there will still not be available to employees of the State the ordinary rights available at common law and which are available to other workers, that is, the right to be compensated in respect of negligence or breach of duty on the part of the employer.</P>
    <P>Indeed, not only is the State not accountable for any common law negligence but even for breaches of statutory duty.  We have plenty of instances of where it was considered that the common law was not considered sufficient in providing protection for the workers and as a result the Oireachtas has passed legislation and in addition, ministerial regulations have been made, to provide additional protection and to provide onerous duties on employers to ensure that injury is not done to workers.  None of these duties lies on the State as against the employer.  While there is no legal obligation on the State, there may be a moral obligation but the workers have no redress.  I venture to make the case that if manual workers in State employment had available to them the full powers and influence of independent trade unions and if they were able to fix their grievances through the Labour Court procedure, this outmoded wrong would no longer be tolerated, because if any other employer were in such a privileged position, I venture to say there would be an immediate cessation of work and workers would not submit themselves to such a system, which is loaded so heavily against them.</P>
    <P>We think it also undesirable that the present pattern should be continued &mdash;the pattern to which Deputy Larkin made reference&mdash;that only the State holds back awaiting the outcome of negotiations, awaiting the outcome, in some cases, of strikes, awaiting, in some cases, a virtual state of economic war between employer and employee in the private sector, before improving the conditions of service of their own employees.  At the same time, one sees certain disadvantages which could flow <Col N="2040" /> to the community if the State were to lose its head and apply conditions of service which would unbalance the whole economy but there is not the tendency on the part of the State now, or at any time in the past&mdash;and I venture to say there will not be in the future&mdash;to be over-generous in remuneration and conditions of service in relation to its own employees.</P>
    <P>I do not see any damaging consequences to the economy if the State were to make its own decisions and not do as it does at the moment&mdash;oblige people in the private sector to make the decision.  The State has certain responsibilities it should endeavour to discharge and it should not endeavour to await the outcome of negotiations and fights in the private sector.  If the State is unwilling to take the decisions which should be made in these matters, the State could&mdash;as suggested in the motion before the House here&mdash;avail of the good offices of the Labour Court as a means of independent arbitration to make decisions in matters affecting wages and conditions of service.</P>
    <P>The present system might not be so bad if we had an ombudsman system here in operation because then grievances could be aired.  There would be some independent person, some independent authority to investigate the goings on in the executive arm of the State.  But while we have not got an ombudsman system and while we have not got any system of independent arbitration, such as is suggested in the motion here, it is not unlikely there will be injustices, in general, to the workers and certainly in particular to some workers.</P>
    <P>We have various other instances in which the State and public authorities are protected in this country because of the fallacious assumption that public authority, authority wielded by any public body, will not be unreasonable or unjust.  I do not want to widen the scope of the debate but I might perhaps be permitted to draw comparisons. The only tenants who have no rights in this country are local authority tenants or tenants of the few Government-owned houses available. This is because of a theory that local <Col N="2041" /> authority and State authority will not be unjust to those tenants.  There are very few Members of this House, very few persons in public life, who are not made aware from time to time of cases of particular injustice, of particular hardship, of cases in which, if the same set of facts were set before a court as between a private landlord and the private tenant, the court would uphold the rights of the tenant.  That is a very frequent experience.</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest to the House that what happens in relation to housing matters also happens in relation to wages and working conditions. Again, we have preserved here&mdash; I am sorry to say&mdash;the idea that a public authority cannot be made accountable for defects in the public highway unless it be proved that the defect in question arose out of a deliberate deed on the part of the public authority.  Some years ago this House and the Seanad, in their wisdom, amended the law so as to permit that sort of situation to be changed but the Minister was to make an order to bring this into operation later this year, and unfortunately, he has not done it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have bored you to such an extent that you thought I was speaking so long.  I must endeavour to make the debate more interesting.  I was instancing the case of a public authority being exempt from the ordinary processes of the law; I was dealing with the case of local authorities being exempt from any claim for damages arising out of their neglect.  But there are many cases of people who are severely injured because of defects in public roadways and footpaths, who have been maimed for life because those defects are there. Because public authority is protected in relation to claims for damages, those unfortunate people have received no compensation whatsoever from the <Col N="2042" /> community in respect of the community's neglect, and I speak of the community's neglect because the community has been neglectful through its public authority.</P>
      <P>If people in State employment are not receiving an adequate wage, the community is not treating those people properly.  It is very sobering to observe that of the people in this country who are on a very low wage level, a substantial proportion of those people are employed by the State.  It is frightful to think that after so many sacrifices having been made by so many people, particularly the lower-paid people in this country, the State&mdash;their own employer&mdash;should provide them with such inadequate wage rates and working conditions.  The fact that that is so is, I think, a sufficient condemnation of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another condemnation of the present system is the long delays which occur between the time claims are made and the time they are processed through, I suppose, the necessarily slow machinery of conciliation and arbitration, where such is applied.  Of course, we are also aware that even the Labour Court is much slower than people would wish it to be but whatever chance we have of getting remedial action we believe it does not exist within the present system.  That is why we believe this motion is worthy of support.  The State ought to submit&mdash; in matters of wages and working conditions&mdash;to the views of independent people such as would be available in the Labour Court.  I believe we should in all respects abolish so far as our law and administration are concerned the unacceptable notion that the State can do no wrong.  We should, in the light of our own experience, appreciate and recognise by taking appropriate action that the State has been a very cruel employer, an inconsiderate employer, and has not moved with the times.  I believe there would be a prospect of improvement in conditions of service in the State, there would certainly be a great prospect of substantial improvement in the whole industrial relations area in the economy and in the State service, in particular, if the Government would indicate a <Col N="2043" /> certain sympathy with the view expressed in this motion.</P>
    <P>I gather from what other speakers have said that the Minister has indicated he is open to considering this matter and that he is introducing comprehensive legislation dealing with industrial relations.  May I make the plea here&mdash;as has been made before &mdash;not to delay doing good because of an anxiety to cure all ills at the one time.  If a little good can be done by a simple piece of legislation to open the Departments of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries and Defence and the Office of Public Works to the trade unions and to the Labour Court, this should be done now, instead of bringing it into what are likely to be vexatious proposals dealing with industrial relations matter generally.  On that account, I hope that, before the conclusion of this debate, the Government will indicate their willingness to bring in the necessary amending legislation forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion.  It is a simple matter designed primarily to end the most unsatisfactory and intolerable state of affairs which condemns the State employees mentioned to the position of second-class citizens and denies them right of access to the Labour Court which all other categories of workers enjoy.</P>
      <P>The motion is indicative of the extent to which our industrial relations code is outmoded and archaic and quite unsuited to the needs of our time.  At the present time in this House we happen to be debating the Labour Estimate.  There has been much talk of industrial unrest, of the need to curb strikes and so on. Here we have a situation where State employees of the Departments of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries, Defence and the Office of Public Works are denied access to our own Labour Court.  This is obviously a situation seething with unrest, fraught with the danger of disputes and unrest of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State is doing nothing to remedy this situation.  The workers and the trade unions involved in this unsatisfactory <Col N="2044" /> situation are to be complimented on their restraint and the responsibility which they have displayed in what can only be described as a most intolerable situation, a situation in which the representatives of the various trade unions involved find themselves in the invidious position of making representations everywhere and raising questions in this House, directed to the responsible Ministers, in order to improve the lot of the workers concerned, to improve their wages, to shorten working hours, to provide a sick pay scheme perhaps, or a pension scheme, which most other categories of workers enjoy now, only to find that the answers given by the Ministers are evasive in the extreme.</P>
    <P>We have this excessive vacillation in which Ministers put off the trade union officials from week to week and year to year.  As I said, the workers concerned, in particular, are to be commended for the restraint they have shown in these circumstances.  We must consider that as far back as 1919, under a foreign regime in this country, the workers referred to in this motion were fully covered by legislation.  They were covered by the Industrial Act, 1919, which provided for them far better conditions than are provided for them today.  Indeed, that Act was amended in 1946 and it placed those categories of workers in the straitjacket in which they are confined today.</P>
    <P>We have sought to ascertain the reasons those categories of workers should be denied access to the Labour Court, and we can find none.  We can only conclude in the labour and trade union movement that the reason this Government have denied workers in the Departments of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries and Defence, and the Office of Public Works the right of access to the Labour Court is simply to put a State brake on the improvement of working conditions of all categories of workers.  This is the State brake.  You would expect that the State would be pathfinders.  Instead of giving a lead to industrial employers <Col N="2045" /> and the workers, we find they are dragging their feet, and expecting their workers to accept lesser conditions, lesser wages, longer working hours and a complete abandonment of those fringe benefits which are such an important factor in industrial work today.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, therefore, that we have to contend with this situation at a time when everyone is admonishing the trade union movement, in particular, to show restraint and responsibility. It is true to say that those categories of workers, being State employees, are technically denied the right to strike.  That is not to say that strikes have not taken place.  There is a move on foot today to curb the right to strike.  I submit that where there is any compromising of this fundamental principle to strike, the workers all over Ireland, outside those unfortunate categories, would find themselves in the same State straitjacket, restricted and condemned to inferior conditions.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party expect that if we are to have a Department of Labour which will achieve that kind of harmony, responsibility and co-operation which is desired by all of us today, the Department of Labour will show the lead in respect of their won employees, and forthwith through the various Ministries involved permit their workers to have access to the Labour Court through their trade unions.  This would save the intolerable situation we have whereby the producers of quite a large proportion of the wealth of our country are relegated to the position of second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>Up to now the efforts of the various trade union officers to promote the lot of these categories of workers has been a futile exercise, utterly frustrating. It is not good enough for the Minister for Lands to say: &ldquo;We have not yet agreed on a sick pay scheme for the employees in my Department until such time as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Defence and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and perhaps others, have made up their minds also.&rdquo;  This is merely dragging a red herring across the trail.  We have heard a lot about <Col N="2046" /> Cabinet responsibility.  The Labour Party submit that the various Cabinet Ministers involved in this unfair dealing to their workers should get down to it and concede to those people the same rights, the same duties and the same responsibilities as any other category of workers has.  My time is almost up but I hope that this is the last occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress, I was making the point that when speaking on this Estimate one must come down either on the side of labour or on the side of capital.  No matter how much we might beat about the bush, we will ultimately declare ourselves on one side or on the other. We in the Labour Party do not deny the fact that we are naturally on the side of labour.  The Minister wants to give us the impression that he is taking a middle-of-the-road course, that he is on no side, so to speak.  When we and workers generally, those people whom we represent, hear the Minister <Col N="2047" /> in his opening speech on this Estimate state that he is concerned only with those unions who might make claims in the future and only with those employers who might concede those claims and make no reference at all to all the employers who might resist those claims, no matter how just the claims might be, we would be pardoned, I think, for assuming the Minister was rather on the side of the employers.</P>
      <P>We find the Minister talking about his being concerned with settlement of wage claims which are in accordance with the general interest, but when we find the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, entering into a conspiracy, if I might say so, to increase prices over the last few months and deciding these price increases should not be made public, and deciding that it was in the general interest that they would not be made public, I think we might be pardoned for assuming that in the Government's mind the general interest is not synonymous with the interest of the workers of this country.</P>
      <P>We and the workers generally have another reason for being suspicious. Over the last 12 months most Deputies will recall wage increases of a maximum of £1 per week were granted to lower paid workers as a result of arbitration awards.  In the case of county council workers and workers employed by health authorities, by the Department of Lands and Forestry they were dated from 1st May. The various Minister concerned, the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health and whoever else they may be, refused to sanction this increase from 1st May.  This was an indication of the attitude of the Ministers, the Cabinet and the present Government to even the lower paid workers and these are the very people about whom the present Government profess and express themselves to be most concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are only a few general observations.  I want to be perfectly honest.  I rise principally here tonight to endeavour to ascertain the attitude <Col N="2048" /> of the Minister and that of the present Government to the question of equal pay for equal work.  I want to know exactly what the attitude of the Minister is on this.  I want to know, for instance, what the Minister meant when replying to the debate on 9th November last when, at column 687 of the Official Report, Vol. 225, No. 4, in reply to questions raised by Labour Deputies, he states:</P>
    <P>The matter of equal pay for what has been called equal work was raised.</P>
    <P>This might be a manner of speaking but to me it suggests that the Minister for Labour is one who believes that there is no such thing as equal work. I am just wondering if he is one of those people who feel that women are just not capable of doing equal work. I hope I am wrong because I believe that the present incumbent of this office is a man particularly suited to the post, a man whose characteristics are just right for the public relations type of work the post demands, but I would hate to think that he is possessed of such a Victorian attitude towards women as those few words of his seem to indicate.</P>
    <P>In the same debate the same principle seems to be involved when he replied to a question raised about women factory inspectors.  At column 681 the Minister for Labour said:</P>
    <P>Much of the work of the inspectorate would be in areas which could not easily be done by a woman, so that the area of their activities would be quite limited.</P>
    <P>I do not know a great deal about factory work or factory inspection but I should like the Minister to point out to me why he thinks women's activities in this particular field would be so limited.  Is this another indication of his opinion of women workers generally and their capabilities, either physically or mentally?</P>
    <P>In the same volume at column 687 the Minister, when replying to questions raised regarding the Government's attitude towards ratification of Convention No. 100 of the International Labour Organisation, goes on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> The matter of equal pay for what has been called equal work was raised.  I answered this in the Dáil as reported in column 2055 on Question No. 37 on 24th May last. I said that the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 100 provides expressly that this principle may be applied by means of national laws or regulations, legally established or recognised machinery for wage determination, collective agreements between employers and workers or a combination of these various means.  The normal method employed in wage negotiations in Ireland is that of free collective bargaining.  Before taking a decision on the possibility of ratifying Convention No. 100 I said that the Government should have regard to the trend in free, collective bargaining in the direction of equal pay and that, having regard to the general existing pay structures, it would not be appropriate for us to ratify the Convention at this time. That is still my attitude to that problem.  Other countries have set out to achieve this but I do not know if they have made any marked progress.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour he will, I hope, find out now if they have made any progress.  He gives the impression that he does not care and does not believe in the principle at all.  This is my impression and I hope, for the sake of women workers whose lives will be affected a great deal by this new Department, that I am wrong.  We have a right to know where exactly the Minister stands.  I personally feel so strongly on the matter that I would go so far as to say that national law should be applied.</P>
    <P>I am insensed, and I am sure many women on factory floors, in offices, professions, or wherever they may be, are insensed when they find Labour Court findings of £1 a week for males and <i>pro rata</i> increases for women and juveniles.  <i>Pro rata</i> increases are all right for juveniles.  That is a transient stage and if one is a male one leaves it after a few years, but there is no such reprieve if one is a woman.  I feel very strongly about this.  It is something <Col N="2050" /> we should get the Minister's attitude on.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about collective bargaining.  My Party is aware of this but if it is not expedient to set the trend to that extent surely it must be possible for the Government to cut out the discrimination that exists in the service of the State, in other words, in the Civil Service, the discrimination against women as a sex that exists there.  I am inclined to believe that when the Minister speaks about the trend, the trend is going in the opposite direction as far as I can see it. When one looks through the Book of Estimates one sees various wage rates, so much for a man, and possibly a couple of hundred pounds less per year for a woman.</P>
    <P>We see here in this Chamber today women working&mdash;and this brings me back to what the Minister referred to as what might be called equal work&mdash; and in a few moments this work will be taken over by a man.  That man gets more pay, for no other reason than that he is a man.  There is no question that this is equal work and yet the man who takes over in a few minutes gets more pay for it.  That is something I cannot understand.  In this age when a number of injustices are being wiped out, and when a number of Victorian ideas are being discarded, I am surprised that this is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In fact, there are other instances of discrimination against women within the Civil Service.  I was a civil servant and I feel very strongly about this.  If I had taken the advice of, I think, the Minister for Lands at the time of my election, instead of entering this House, I would have been sensible&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;and gone back to the Civil Service.  If I had done so, I would get no marriage allowance for rearing my two children.  Women who have gone back to the Civil Service have to pay back the gratuity they got, and they get no marriage allowance. Yet, their male colleagues, having once qualified for large amounts, continue to enjoy that privilege, whether they have a wife or family.  That is another instance of discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Labour <Col N="2051" /> to set his mind to rectifying this glaring injustice.  In this age, the role of a Government should be to eliminate injustices and oppression which definitely exist as much today as they did years ago in the case of women working side by side with men.  We have a very enlightened view on this question on these benches, but even from the most conservative point of view, it must be realised that women today are occupying posts which could be occupied by men, but women are being used as cheap labour.  I can understand that the Government in their present straits need cheap labour to keep down production costs, but they are doing so at the expense of women particularly, and also at the expense of the less organised, less protected and lower paid.</P>
    <P>They are doing so particularly at the expense of women and even more so at the expense of young girls between 14 and 16 years of age.  These young girls are, in fact, being held out as incentives to some foreign industrialists.  I am not condemning all foreign industrialists, but employment is being given to these little girls between 14 and 16 years of age, who are not even of insurable age, for paltry wages of 30/-, £2 or £3 a week, in very bad conditions. Not only that, but when these girls reach the age at which they might draw even the inadequate female rate of wages, they are replaced by girls of 14 to 16.  At the age of 18, they are let go.  This is something with which the Minister and the Cabinet as a whole might concern themselves.</P>
    <P>As I said, my principal object in speaking on this Estimate was to ascertain once and for all the Minister's attitude towards my sex as employees, but I want to refer briefly to a few other matters as well.  I want to make a brief reference to the question of career guidance.  The Minister told us&mdash;and I was glad to hear it&mdash; that he is looking into the whole question of career guidance.  He said he is trying to publish the basic information on the various occupations for our school leavers, and those who are staying on at school, and that he will <Col N="2052" /> have before the year is out a series of 100 leaflets setting out in tabloid from the basic information on the particular types of employment.</P>
    <P>That is a step in the right direction, but a great deal more is needed.  It is certainly necessary that our boys and girls who are still at school and who are in the process of leaving school should know the qualifications required for various posts which they might like to take up, or various careers on which they might like to enter.  I do not know if the Minister intends letting these boys and girls know what openings there are in the various grades.  From reading his speech, I do not think he has gone that far.  This is very important, because already even before we have this new deal in regard to education, there are too many with pass leaving certificates looking for openings in academic careers and too few with technical training.  I believe that with the advent of the abolition of fees and with free school transport in the rural areas for our boys and girls, there will be a greater tendency towards this academic training.</P>
    <P>We have a sort of unenlightened attitude towards technical training&mdash; I suppose this is historical &mdash; and a number of our people still feel that there is something more respectable about academic training and academic jobs.  The trouble is that the jobs are not there.  We all know boys and girls with a pass leaving certificate, perhaps with two honours, whose parents are not in a position to spend more on their training, and who would in fact be better off if they had had career guidance earlier on.  It is very important that the career openings available should be made known as well as the qualifications needed. Indeed, for many of our parents education is a means to an end, a means to a job.  It is very important that they should know so far as possible what the job prospects are.</P>
    <P>I know that retraining and training are an enormous task.  This has been dealt with pretty adequately by my colleagues on these benches, and I shall not dwell on it at any length, but I should like the Minister to give <Col N="2053" /> me an assurance on the question of selection.  Unfortunately, we have more material than we need.  I want the Minister to assure me that on the question of selection, no injustice will be done.  We hear it said that it is not a question of what you know but whom you know.</P>

      <P>I do not subscribe to that saying, but I do know that in some instances it is justified in the field of training.  Perhaps this is more a matter for the Department of Education than the Department of Labour, but I want to give a specific case.  I know of a case where leaving certificate candidates are chosen for further training which is, incidentally, heavily subsidised by the State.  When they appear for interview for this further training, the results of leaving certificate examination are not known: indeed when they are selected, the results of that examination are not known.  They are asked questions at the interview which have nothing to do with educational matters.  They are asked, for instance, what their fathers do, where their sisters are, where their brothers work.  No question is asked to determine their educational merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I have found, and it is generally known, that the higher the social standing of the parents, the more suitable is considered the candidate for further training. This interview concerns girls. Many of the girls whose parents could not afford further training of any kind were forced to go into positions which were not suitable for them.  Some of the girls chosen for further training left the course for various reasons after a few months.  I will deal with this more specifically on the Vote for Education.  This is purely a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for an assurance that this sort of thing will have no place in his Department.  Perhaps I <Col N="2054" /> am being naive in asking it: it may be unnecessary to ask the question, but I am asking it all the same, just as I ask him to reassure the workers and us who represent them that he is not as biased as we might think he is, as he has given us, Members of the House, to believe.  Finally I wish to know from the Minister&mdash;this was the primary purpose of my intervention in the debate&mdash;exactly what his attitude is towards women workers.

It is the duty of every public representative to help him inside the House and outside it.  I have watched him very carefully since he took over this very hard job and have seen his efforts to reconcile labour and employers, the trade union movement and the employers' federation. It is easy to misrepresent the Minister's purpose: it is easy to say he is against labour.  We on this side could not be against labour.  Umpteen times I have repeated that as far as we are concerned we must continually be striving for the good of every section of our people, irrespective of class or creed.  Our country is too small to concern itself with sectional interests. I do not ever want to hear the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; used in it.  We must get away from that and strive to leave something for posterity so that we can say honestly that we endeavoured as far as possible to be fair to all our people within the limits of our resources. May I say that the present Minister has no interest beyond that of our people as a whole?  He is a man of charity and he has the background of a man of goodwill.</P>

      <P>I do not usually descend to the level of personal abuse to which the Deputy descends from time to time.  This is a very serious matter.  It is easy to say that the Minister will introduce legislation but that we will not obey it.  I do not want to see legislation introduced that will not have the goodwill of both employer and employee.  I want to hear everyone in the country saying sincerely: &ldquo;We will help you in the job you have&rdquo;.  It is the easiest thing in the world to condemn a man who is doing something worth while but it contributes nothing to society or to the future of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech here we find he has had many conferences with the trade union leaders and with the employers' representatives.  I <Col N="2056" /> want that approach to continue and to see these conferences going on and on.  It is inevitable in human society that misunderstandings will occur. They will occur in our homes and in our everyday life.  That is inevitable where human beings meet and discuss things together.  However, commonsense should prevail.  It is up to the leaders of the Labour Party, the leaders of the trade unions, the leaders of the employers' federation to solve their problems sensibly.  I am not coming down on one side or the other, because I have intervened in more disputes possibly than most other Deputies here, and successfully, thank goodness.  What I want to emphasise is that there are a number of employers who have brought trouble on themselves and a number of workers who have brought trouble on themselves, through some misunderstanding or other, or through being too proud to discuss a problem round a table.</P>
    <P>I was a Member of this House at the time the Industrial Relations Bill was going through, and there was a trend of thought at that time that similar powers to those exercised by the courts should be given under the Bill, that when anybody went before the tribunal, the ruling would be final and binding both on the worker and on the employer.  I opposed that at the time because I wanted the Bill to be completely free and I wanted relations between the worker and the employer to evolve slowly and smoothly.  We had many discussions, even at our own private meetings, about this matter.  Deputy Lemass, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced at that period a very fine Bill.  The Labour Court has succeeded in doing an excellent job. It has succeeded in solving many disputes. It may not have succeeded in all cases, but it has done so in about 98 per cent of the cases, and that is a big advance.</P>
    <P>We must remember that that human machine was built up at a time when the trade unionists and the employers were not so well trained to put their respective cases.  Today the trade <Col N="2057" /> union official is as competent as a barrister in speaking on behalf of his men.  It is the same with the employers' representative.  Even so, in the old days, we had the best trade unionists of all time, because times were bad and they had to fight hard and adopt tough tactics.  Neither the Minister nor the Party to which I belong is going to interfere with the right of people to strike.  Nobody wants to interfere with that democratic right. What the Minister and his Department are trying to do is to eliminate as far as possible any misunderstanding that might be responsible for bringing about a strike.</P>
    <P>In our semi-State concerns, the training of foremen in industrial relations would seem to be desirable. Whether he is a foreman on the factory floor, or in a workshop, he lacks that training in industrial relations which is involved in good leadership and good management.  I am not saying he should be a softie, that he should not try to get higher production for his firm, or that he should see a worker sitting down and say nothing. However, he should know how to approach workers.  He can do a great deal to improve industrial relations. The director may be the best executive of all time but he has his own job to do and may be immersed in trying to sell the products of the industry. The worker is more concerned with the man who is immediately over him than with the director sitting in his office.</P>
    <P>I have heard many stories in regard to our semi-State industries.  One will hear it said of the foreman: &ldquo;He has a down on me&rdquo; or &ldquo;The foreman is doing this, that and the other.&rdquo; Possibly this is a man who was one of themselves and was promoted. This is a big field the Minister for Labour has to go into, and it is only with the wholehearted co-operation of the trade unions and the employers that he will achieve anything.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond made a good case here for the ladies.  We are all anxious to help the ladies and to see equal pay for equal work.  That is gradually coming, of course: <i>Tempora <Col N="2058" /> mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis</i>.  The wind is blowing that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened pretty carefully to this debate.  I have listened, in particular, to the sentiments expressed on the Government benches and, having done so, I am of the confirmed opinion that the Fianna Fáil spokesmen, especially Deputy Booth, Deputy Dowling, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Andrews, have done nothing whatsoever to help the Minister to attain his ideal of peace, harmony and progress in our economy.  Seldom in a debate of this kind have we heard such vitriolic statements from Government spokesmen.  Seldom have we <Col N="2059" /> heard such a denigration of the labour and trade union movement.  Seldom have we heard such threats and seldom such slander and abuse of trade union leaders and trade union members as that which emanated from those benches in the past few days.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not so foolish as to think that statements like these will help his cause?  We realise, of course, that when a Deputy like Deputy Booth speaks with a slanderous tongue in this House, denigrating the Labour Party and the trade union movement, he speaks for and on behalf of his own class, the capitalist class.  I congratulate him on having the courage of his convictions in saying what he said.  On the other hand, Deputy Dowling, and others in the Fianna Fáil Party, who purport to be trade unionists and who, no doubt, carry trade union cards in their pockets, are a disgrace to their class.  They pretend to represent the interests of the workers.  We know full well that Deputy Dowling and his ilk have the same love for the labour and trade union movement in this country as a greyhound for a hare.  What they have been seeking to do in this debate is to tear down the foundations upon which the trade union movement has been built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to reconcile the Minister's brash, arrogant statements in his opening speech on this, his main Estimate, with some of his earlier statements.  Indeed, in his opening statement, he set a headline for all the enemies of the workers in this country, especially those in his own Party; he invited them to show their hands and use their tongues in this debate.  The responsibility is his.  It is difficult to understand how the new Minister for Labour could have the audacity to issue the threats he did and indulge in the intimidation in which he did in relation to this Party and the trade union movement when he said he would curb collective bargaining; he was going to go ahead with the preparation of a new Trade Union Bill and an Industrial Relations Bill without waiting for full agreement with either the employers or the unions.  In <Col N="2060" /> the context of that statement, one can forget at once about the employers. That he should threaten to go ahead with this repressive, anti-workingclass legislation without the support and concurrence of the trade union movement is to invite chaos instead of the industrial peace he alleges he is pursuing.</P>
    <P>This repressive legislation is of interest not merely to trade unions; it is of vital interest to every citizen in our society who appreciates the democratic way of life.  There are fundamental issues involved.  There is the fundamental issue of the right of free association, the fundamental issue of the right to strike, to withdraw one's labour in intolerable conditions.  To attempt to do what the Minister says he will attempt is, and this is what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has said the Minister intends to do, to place the trade union movement here under State control.</P>

      <P>It is the September issue.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ruadhrí Roberts, the General Secretary, stated that he must oppose the Minister's proposal on trade union law in so far as these proposals appeared to be designed to abolish the right of freedom of association and places the trade union movement under Government control. This viewpoint received the support of Conference.  He was speaking at the Annual Conference of last year and the second part of the report, together with the executive's proposed observations, were unanimously adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> It is hard to reconcile the threats made now with the attitude of the Minister some 12 months ago.  I shall quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13th December, 1965.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was then Dr. Hillery, now Minister for Labour, was addressing the Ennis Chamber of Commerce in the Queen's Hotel.  Talking about this aspect of strife in our society, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us hope that we can find a balance between common sense and law which will ease us through our difficulties without the need to diminish the freedoms we have today.&rdquo; Industrial peace in good measure was not for us a luxury but a necessity, and nobody could opt out of his responsibility to foster and maintain it.</P>
    <P>He asked:</P>
    <P>What then should be done to make things better?</P>
    <P>Here he was referring to strikes in particular.  He went on to ask:</P>
    <P>Should the Government force a betterment or seek to induce it in some way?  He had been advised &ldquo;that the Government should do something about it, to be firm&rdquo; and to &ldquo;see that justice was done&rdquo;, and to &ldquo;take my courage in my hands&rdquo;, by persons making a horseback appraisal of the difficulties, seeing the facile solution and galloping away to advise someone else on other problems.</P>
    <P>He invited deeper examination of the problems and the implications of attempting to solve them.  There was no easy course.  There was a lot of woolly and unfinished thinking on the subject of industrial relations and particularly in relation to the powers of the Labour Court and the question of strikes.</P>
    <P>In the same speech, he said:</P>
    <P>To people who asked why there should be strikes the simple answer was that industrial relations were essentially human relations and history was a record of the failings of human nature.</P>
    <P>These are very sensible sentiments and ought not to be gone back upon. It goes on:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2062" /> The implication in the suggestion that the Government should do something about it was that force should meet force, but this was not the way to produce harmony in industry.</P>
    <P>I could quote at length from this unbiased and rational speech dealing with the difficulty of securing harmonious relations in our society and the dangers of using coercive measures where persuasion could suffice.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a little admonition for the employers on that occasion:</P>
    <P>He reminded employers of the 1957 Working Party on Unofficial Strikes, in which it was reported that questions regarding wage rates contributed less to the incidence of unofficial strikes than did matters related to working conditions, including supervision and worker-manager relations.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>It was essential that effective machinery should be provided in each employment for the early ventilation and examination of grievances.</P>
    <P>What caused the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Minister for Labour, to go back on this rational approach and to come into this House the other day armed with a threat to all concerned that he was going to go ahead, whether we liked it or not, with this repressive legislation, which, in our opinion, is repugnant to the Constitution, inasmuch as it affects fundamental human rights?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate all that. The Minister cannot deny that he stated in this House, introducing the <Col N="2063" /> first Estimate proper for his Department, that he intended going ahead with the preparation of new legislation, possibly dealing with industrial relations, the introduction of a trade union Bill without the full consent or agreement of the parties concerned, the employers and the unions.  He felt a sufficient length of time had elapsed to bring matters to a head.  It would be rash in the extreme if, for the sake of a little extra time in which agreement might be arrived at, the Minister introduced such legislation, which can only have disastrous consequences for this country.</P>
      <P>I rather felt that the Fianna Fáil Party, after their spurious victories in Waterford and Kerry, had once again become drunk with power, thereby displaying this threatening attitude, this arrogance and this disdain for the rights of others.  We have the evidence of it today in farmers being jailed and now a threat to the trade union movement that this Government intend to put them in shackles if they are not good boys.  The Government would do well to rethink this problem.  They surely cannot expect to put the clock back to 1913, although, mark you, there are a good many would-be little William Martin Murphys in their ranks today. These people would curb the right to strike.  They believe in the profit motive to such an extent that they would love to cut down the barries of trade unionism and proceed to exploit and dehumanise as they did in 1913.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We submit the workers of Ireland today are of the selfsame mettle as their fathers were in 1913.  They would resist this legislation with the same fervour.  They have the same desire for sacrifice as their fathers had in 1913.  The need for strikes in this country and the need for a strong trade union movement is as important today as it was in 1913.  We still have exploiters in our midst.  Even the very State itself relegates its own workers to the status of second-class citizens.  Before this measure was resumed tonight, the Labour Party had a motion before the House <Col N="2064" /> merely asking that Government Ministers give to the employees in their respective Departments, in Lands, Agriculture, Defence and the Board of Works, the simple right, which all workers enjoy, of going to the Labour Court in respect of disputes.  That right has not, as yet, been given to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the things being done in this legislation you say is repressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard the Minister for Labour speak on the subject tonight.  He did not satisfy the spokesmen on this side that he was doing all that was to be desired in this matter.  He passed on the responsibility for the kind of legislation we desire to, of all people, the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Labour can check on that.  I hope this pending trade union legislation will not come into the House until there are further talks with the officers of Congress and its constituent unions.  I have already told the Minister how unwise that would be.  The Minister must be aware that Congress is absolutely opposed to the proposal that the Minister should have power to decide whether a union should have its effective existence terminated, and whether an organisation of workers should be permitted to obtain as a matter of right the legal status necessary for the conduct of its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, a lot of odium has been heaped on the Labour Court in this debate.  The enemies of trade unionism are now anxious to turn the Labour Court into a court of law, a court of arbitration, where the decisions of that body would be binding on the unions concerned.  This, of course, is wholly unacceptable to the trade union movement.  This is what the Minister would desire, but this is the negation of democracy, that we should have a situation in which the Labour Court could be turned into a court of law and strictures would be laid down for workers who must accept them whether they <Col N="2065" /> like them or not.  This would be compulsion of a kind wholly unacceptable to freedom-loving people.  The trade union movement considers that the Labour Court has demonstrated in practice its effectiveness in dealing with industrial disputes of various kinds and the various unions affiliated to Congress have considered the Minister's proposals and are satisfied that they can be properly described as proposals to abolish the court in its present form and establish in its place an arbitration body.</P>
    <P>It is further to be noted that if the Minister's ideas are to bear fruit the court would no longer have the balanced character of a tripartite body composed of employers, workers and Government nominees but would be a Government dominated body.  The manner in which the proposed new court would be constituted is a further reason for believing that the new court will not, in fact, be used.  Most unions, I feel certain, have already indicated to the Minister that they would not be prepared to avail of the services of a court of this kind which would not dole out justice but would merely be comprised of a junta of Government nominees whose duty it would be to conform to Government policy.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to deal adequately with this subject having regard to the many things that have been said to could the issue and the many voices to be heard on it, which, to say the least of them, have done no service to the Minister or the Government in regard to the ideas he has in mind.  Whoever advised the Minister to say what he said in his speech on the introduction of this Estimate have done the Minister, the Government and the workers at large a very great disservice.  It was particularly lamentable because the Minister's threats were made at a time of comparative peace in industry. It might have been understandable had the spate of strikes which we experienced in 1965 and in the early part of 1966 continued.  We ought to know that the reason for this outburst of industrial unrest was the stupid policy of the Fianna Fáil Government and Taoiseach at that time in insisting <Col N="2066" /> that the only increase in wages and salaries that we could afford to pay despite a steep increase in the cost of living was a meagre three per cent. This was an indication to the Labour Court to reject all claims over that amount.  There alone you had a headon clash between the trade unions and the employers and the State.  That the Minister should issue these threats when there was to his own knowledge a great fund of goodwill built up among the trade union movement for many things he had in mind such as legislation to bring about mergers between the unions and to facilitate the retiral of officials of unions, to do away with the multiplicity of trade unions, in other words, and many other good points which the Minister had in mind, is hard to understand.  It is to be greatly deplored that for the sake of a little more time he should throw away this great fund of goodwill and co-operation and have the audacity to say that he was prepared to go it alone as if there was any hope of success along that path.</P>
    <P>I could spend all night and all day replying to the various spokesmen of the Minister, but it would be a foolish exercise.  Some of the statements, however, require to be answered.  Deputy Booth made a particularly vicious attack on Deputy Cluskey of this Party.  He said that he was typical of the irresponsible trade union leaders of this country who were seeking to create conflict.  He implied that Deputy Cluskey was an irresponsible leader of a trade union, unfit to hold a position in his union and was setting out to create trouble on every possible occasion, that he loved conflict and was essentially a troublemaker. He painted the same general picture of most of the leaders of the trade union movement and went on to say that the whole thing was undemocratic, that he wanted a strong trade union movement of top grade executives. What he meant by that, nobody knows.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey, like all our trade union leaders, instead of fomenting trouble, precipitating strikes and unrest, spends all his working days, and indeed his working nights also, <Col N="2067" /> trying to stave off trouble, trying to maintain peace and harmony, trying to win better conditions for his people and would only have recourse to the strike weapon in the last resort. Deputy Cluskey, like every other responsible trade union leader, does not have it all his own way, as Deputy Booth should know.  Deputy Cluskey does not have it in his power to call men out forthwith: he is responsible to his executive council and before strike action is taken, the executive council of his union is consulted.  Not only that, but the executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is consulted and, above all else, the members are consulted.  These sweeping, slanderous statements of Deputies Ryan, Booth and others have done much harm and destroyed much of the fund of goodwill which had been built up for the Minister and the various facets of his Department in labour, industry and commerce in particular.</P>
    <P>It is greatly to be deplored that the Minister would precipitate this all-out onslaught on labour and the trade union movement by various elements of the Fianna Fáil Party, without recognising, in particular, the magnificent contribution which many of the officers of Congress and its constituent unions have made to the betterment of our society, without recognising the part they have played in the Committee on Industrial Organisation, in the NIEC, in the productivity committees and in the many other committees with which the Minister has been associated for so many years.  It would take a long yardstick to measure the intrinsic worth of this contribution and the earnestness, the sincerity and the devotion of these officers of Congress and the other unions in co-operating with the Government in very many important schemes for the expansion of our economy.  It shows terrible ingratitude that such calumnious statements should be issued from Government benches over the past few days.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Minister has shown a complete and utter disregard for the contribution which the working-class <Col N="2068" /> people of this country make to the prosperity of our country.  The real producers of wealth in this country are the people who are being legislated for in this penal repressive code which the Minister has in mind. There is not a tittle about it in so far as employers are concerned.  The Minister's attitude would seem to be that the workers are the only people who are at fault&mdash;bring them to heel and all will be well.</P>
    <P>If we have an incomes policy&mdash;as the Minister, I understand, is tinkering with&mdash;we shall have thereby a Standstill Order on wages, and profits and prices may soar unbridled.  To Deputy Booth, Deputy Briscoe and the rest, profits are sacred and untouchable. The Fianna Fáil Party dare not move in there but do what you can, do all you can, to put down the working classes.  This is not social justice and it is wholly unacceptable to those of us who are in the labour and the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to deal with other matters in the Minister's speech and matters appertaining to the effective working of the Department of Labour but I shall deal now only with one or two of them because we prefer to remain somewhat silent and watchful of the actions of this Department in the next few months, in particular, to see how the land lies, to see whether the Minister is sincere in seeking peace as distinct from chaos in our society.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that the number of factory inspectors has been increased somewhat from 22 to 28.  The Minister must be aware of the unsatisfactory state of affairs appertaining to decent conditions in very many factories in the Republic.  The trade union movement is not blameless in this matter.  Indeed, it is regrettable that the many unions have not as yet educated their members to the need to avail of the concessions legislated for them in this House in the Factories Acts introduced and carried through this House by the late lamented Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The fact remains that there are working people in overcrowded, insanitary, cold and dilapidated buildings in this city <Col N="2069" /> and I have seen them there and in very many parts of Ireland as well.  There are places of work where obviously a factory inspector never calls and would seem to be unaware of their existence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obligation devolving on trade unions, workers and employers, I should like the Minister to take such steps as will ensure that every industrial establishment with a reasonable number of workers will be visited by one of his inspectors, irrespective of whether or not there is a safety committee in that factory.  Only in that way shall we eliminate the terrible conditions, usually in non-union shops, that prevail.  We want to see our work people in modern conditions where there is proper ventilation, and where, in particular, there is an adequate heating system.  The question of heat in winter, in particular, is of paramount importance.  I have known workers to walk out of their jobs&mdash;unofficial strikes, if you like&mdash;by reason of the intolerable conditions in which they have to work.  Sometimes the conditions are Arctic.  The cold is such that they cannot manipulate with the fingers the various machines on which they are employed.</P>
    <P>In many instances, employers show a callous indifference to the question of heating.  Many of them are so Victorian in their ideas as to think that by keeping the atmosphere cold, they will get the workers to work all the harder. There is not adequate lighting, heating, ventilation or sanitary facilities&mdash;again, a very important factor&mdash;in quite a lot of our factories.  It is futile to have a team of factory inspectors if places where workers suffer and where there is an obvious threat to their health are not properly investigated.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider issuing through the post&mdash;as is done in respect of the leaflets on social welfare, the White Paper on Health, and so on&mdash;especially to places of employment, large numbers of that booklet on the Factories Acts so that workers will be educated as to their rights in regard to the provision of proper conditions.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear the Minister say that he envisages something tantamount to a transformation <Col N="2070" /> of employment exchanges.  That is long overdue.  It is a herculean task.  I wish the Minister well.  Having regard to our economic climate, I cannot see that he can do much with these awful places.</P>
    <P>A positive manpower policy designed to raise living standards, to provide full employment, job security, stability of prices and so on, can be implemented only in an economy where there is full employment or near full employment.  In an economy such as ours, reeking with unemployment that is at present reaching the alarming figure of 70,000, there cannot be a manpower policy.  In addition to the 70,000 registered unemployed, one must take into account the rural workers who are prohibited from signing as being unemployed and who will not be granted a qualification certificate because the attitude is that they could or should have got employment on the land.  Taking these into account, it means that our unemployment figure is standing at the 100,000 mark.  I defy contradiction of that statement.  It is well known that emigration has increased steeply in recent years and is again spiralling to the 40,000 figure.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, what hope have we of giving effect to the Industrial Training Bill and what chance have we of transforming our labour exchanges into places of real employment opportunity?  None.</P>
    <P>The Minister has on his hands the impossible task of bringing progressive thinking into the cobwebbed corridors of the Department of Social Welfare, in particular.  The atmosphere in that Department has percolated down to all those controlling the labour exchanges, from the managers to the clerks, whose attitude towards the unfortunate people coming in to sign is one of indifference and contempt.  The employment exchanges are hated and despised by the working classes.  There is issued there nothing but contempt, disrespect and humiliation.  A few miserable shillings are doled out every week.  The decent man or woman, boy or girl, who has to go there realises what humiliation and degradation mean.  Very few of them continue to sign there for long.  They quite in desperation. <Col N="2071" /> They go to England.  As I have said, the employment exchanges are places where Irishmen and women suffer humiliation and degradation for a little while until they go to England.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the employment exchanges are now to all intents and purposes taken over by the Minister and his Department I want to assert and to demonstrate that there has been no change whatsoever in the intimidatory, tyrannical and abusive approach of the personnel running the exchanges towards the unfortunates who go there.</P>

      <P>In any progressive country where there is an unemployment problem, there are employment exchanges in the real sense of the word and there are replacement officers such as the Minister has adverted to.  People who attend at the labour exchanges during periods of redundancy or unemployment are treated with the utmost respect.  They are treated with dignity, as human beings.  They are brought into the office and their problem is discussed in strictest privacy.  The skilled placement officers ascertain the skills and aptitudes of the unemployed persons and do what they can to place the persons in employment suitable for them.  Does that happen in our country?  Not likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is already an army of unemployed persons to contend with. There are no jobs available in the employment exchanges except of the most menial kind from employers of dubious character who could not obtain workers through the normal channels, usually blind alley, badly paid jobs, if at all.  We are coming to the conclusion that all this talk about <Col N="2072" /> the Minister of Labour, the threats to the trade union movement, the references to transformation of employment exchanges, the Training Bill which has just gone through the House, are nothing but political window-dressing for the Fianna Fáil Party and are incapable of being implemented in the foreseeable future.  It is nothing more than a pretence at conforming with more progressive legislation in other countries such as Britain and the EEC member States.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that you can implement a positive manpower policy only in a country where there is full or near full employment.  It is an impossible exercise in a country such as ours that is ravaged with unemployment, under-employment and emigration. Apart from the fact that there are nearly 100,000 unemployed and an exodus of about 40,000, we have to contend with an annual outflow of an average of 40,000 boys and girls from our schools.  This is clearly an impossible task.  The Minister would have us believe that he intends to make our labour exchanges places of real employment possibilities to which the worker can go when he is unemployed, declare his skills, his experience and aptitude and he will be quickly placed in a suitable job.  Mark you, he would be a very gullible worker indeed if he accepted that kind of statement these times.</P>
    <P>I want to explain to the House that only quite recently a worker of very high educational standards, outstanding integrity, unblemished character, who had been working for a number of years in a semi-professional capacity, became unemployed for the first time in his life.  He was obliged to sign on at the local labour exchange in order to get money to maintain his wife and two young children.  This was for this man a rather humiliating experience, one to which he certainly was unused, but in order to provide the wherewithal for himself and his family he was obliged to sign on as unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime he was trying earnestly to secure a job.  No one in this employment exchange helped him to get a job or advised him what to <Col N="2073" /> do.  He applied for this particular job and he was called for interview.  He was obliged to come to Dublin for the interview and he accordingly advised the officers of his labour exchange on the Tuesday previous to his coming to Dublin.  That was on 10th February last.  He related the full facts and he asked to be excused from signing on as unemployed on that occasion.</P>
    <P>One would expect the re-orientated labour exchanges to be quite pleased about this but instead of helping him to secure this job they did everything possible, I contend, to upset him and obstruct him and they penalised him for going for the job.  When he asked not to be disallowed for the day in question he was told that he would have to sign on as unemployed in the city which was 105 miles away from the town to which I refer.  He pointed out to the clerk and later to the manager of this Exchange that this was an unfair imposition, that he had enough worries on his mind going for this particular job and that he had to face an interview board on that morning at 11.15 in an office not 100 miles away from this House&mdash;indeed, very few yards away.</P>
    <P>No reasonable attitude was adopted. If the officers in the exchange had any doubts as to the truth of his statement they could consult with the office concerned but the management of this labour exchange insisted on his signing on in Dublin.  He pointed out that the interview was at 11.15 a.m.  He did not know where the labour exchange was.  He refused to be so humiliated and said that he would not conform to this archaic regulation.  He travelled to Dublin in his own car on the morning in question, went for interview and returned home.  He was disallowed to the extent of 19/- unemployment for that day.  So much for the transformation which has taken place in our exchanges.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the story.  Our friend did very well at the initial interview. He is coming to Dublin again next Thursday for a final interview for this important job.  Having heard his story, I made special representations to the clerks in that exchange and to the management to exempt this man <Col N="2074" /> from the responsibility of signing on as unemployed next Thursday, pointing out the unreasonableness of the request, that it was virtually impossible for him to sign on as unemployed in Dublin and at the same time attend an interview board for a job and that instead of hindering this man they should help him.</P>
    <P>I got no satisfaction whatsoever.  I believe this man will be disallowed on next Thursday as well.  Yet, we in the Labour Party are expected to believe all this bluff and pretence about the new Utopia to be created for the working classes when we know, as a result of our association with this class of people, that the contrary is the truth.</P>
    <P>I want to place on the record of this House not the name and the address of this man but, for the Minister's reference, his insurance number so that this matter can be retraced.  His insurance number is 1475685.  A decent man who never thought he would have to sign on as unemployed signs for the first time in his life; he goes for a job over 100 miles away from his home and he is blackguarded to the extent that he is directed to sign on as unemployed in this city, and because he does not he is penalised to the amount of a day's benefit.  The same thing will happen to him next Thursday unless the Minister's gratuitous ideas are put into effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to the fact that some employers were conceding increases in wages and conditions of employment too easily. This makes us in the trade union movement laugh.  We have never yet found an employer who made a concession in relation to wages or to conditions of employment without a hard, difficult and bitter struggle. Where the Minister gets these ideas it is difficult to know.  He also implies in his remarks that our working class people are too well off&mdash;earning too much money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's whole policy could be summed up in the philosophical observation that if you work for nothing you will always have <Col N="2075" /> work.  The statistical facts are that out of roughly one million people employed, 100,000 are earning £10 weekly, and of all the women employed 50,000 have wages of £5 a week or less.  Some 250,000 people are receiving wages of between £10 and £14 a week, and some 400,000 workers receive wages which vary from £5 to £14 a week.  Despite that we have employer classes here telling us that we are too well off.</P>
      <P>In debates leading up to the formation of this Department, I stressed one aspect of the manpower policy which is most urgent, and that is the provision of the redundancy payment fund.  I noted in the Minister's statement that legislation providing for this is pending, but the Minister must be aware that, while we are talking about the necessity for such a fund, which will provide for payments during unemployment and during retraining and until there has been reabsorbtion in alternative employment, there are thousands of workers queueing up at our labour exchanges and redundancy is being declared in many factories in towns all over the country every week.  Yet there is nothing in the Statute Book to provide monetary assistance for these people except unemployment benefit.  Nothing is being done to speed up legislation for the implementation of redundancy payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard this as a fundamental to any manpower policy and as the most urgent aspect of the work of the Minister's Department.  We expect that positive legislation should be introduced at the earliest possible date to cover this aspect.  I was very disturbed when I read the Minister's speech&mdash;I was not present when he delivered it here&mdash;in which he threatened the foundations of our trade union movement and of our democratic society.  This is all the more surprising coming from a man who has earned for himself the reputation of being kindly, gentle and understanding and the most co-operative of <Col N="2076" /> men.  I can only assume that some bad influences have been at work on the Minister, and that he has allowed these sinister influences to set him on this road which threatens disaster if he continues along it.</P>

The Minister has shown to Deputies of all Parties, including back benchers of his own Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the very thing which the Labour Party have been asking for has been taking place, plenty of discussion and as much understanding in order to get an agreed measure as far as possible.  This is what the Minister has been doing.  I should like, however, to deal with one or two aspects which arise out of the Minister's speech.  He refers, on page 12, to the formulation of our policies having regard to the change which will be involved by EEC membership.  This is a matter which we must always keep in mind when deliberating on this subject.  The first thing that should be said&mdash;and everybody will agree that it can rightly be said here&mdash;is that it is the aim and object of every Party to try to increase the affluence and wellbeing of all of our citizens.  If we disagree on the ways and means, I hope it will not be suggested that any Party is deliberately trying to depress the standard of living and affluence of individuals in the nation.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned that sometimes perhaps in the quest for this growing affluence that the price of it&mdash; in the context of the EEC and the United Kingdom&mdash;might make inroads in our political unity and national independence.  The problem of reconciling national economic goals and other national goals is not unique to Ireland. In fact, it is becoming increasingly urgent in countries all over the world as we tend to take steps which will enable us to get into the mainstream of technological advances which will make it possible for all citizens in all parts of the country to share in this affluence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a situation wherein the leaders of the superpowers in the United States and Russia are appealing for reductions in trade barriers; they want <Col N="2078" /> more trade at all costs in order to raise the welfare of the people of their own countries and, they hope, also of the countries with whom they trade.  Unless we retain an all-round position of competitiveness, we will not be able to benefit and avail of the opportunities presenting themselves to us today. Dividends must be declared with the maximum restraint or, I believe, it will be the duty of the Government to try to enforce that restraint.  Profits must be kept within a reasonable proportion of capital investment or the Government will have to enforce further the steps they have already taken for price control, to ensure profits do not exceed a reasonable percentage in relation to the capital invested. These things are vital now when it is so urgent&mdash;as the Minister has already pointed out&mdash;for industry and business in this country to prepare themselves for the inevitable days ahead in or out of EEC, certainly for free trade with the United Kingdom or EFTA.  This is not a time for profit-taking; it is a time for reinvestment.  I think also a serious look must be taken at the problem of capital gains.</P>
    <P>I should like to diverge slightly here to show that we have a problem here now with the high cost of housing which is causing some unrest among the workers and their representatives. This has been caused by the inability of the authority, vested by the State, to provide the necessary services in the way of drainage and proper waste disposal methods, and to accept the responsibility for providing these services.  Therefore, if the Government have failed in any way to force those local bodies to make the necessary plans and take the necessary steps which would prevent such inflation and the bringing about of such problems as large capital gains, then the Government must now take steps to intervene directly in these matters, thereby preventing the condition which might create discontent and an unbalancing of incomes and investment in a way not to the best advantage of the State.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the sacrosanct idea of <Col N="2079" /> differentials being maintained between various grades of workers is something which will have to be very seriously re-examined.  There is no good saying we want to improve the lot of lower-paid workers unless the higher paid skilled workers are prepared to take a smaller share of the national cake in so far as differentials are concerned. They must allow the lower-paid workers to narrow the gap between them.  Means will have to be devised whereby, if it is felt the highest-paid workers should get 10/- or £1, then the lowest-paid workers must get £1 or £2.  Something must be done to re-examine this entire system of differentials, because any time a serious effort is made to better the lot of lower-paid workers, it then starts to spiral along and people try to maintain the differentials they consider to be their right in their particular section of industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also pointed out that, while there is a policy of a wage standstill in force in England&mdash;largely with the support of the trade unions &mdash;and now while there are further discussions going on&mdash;apparently not so much with the support of the trade unions at this stage&mdash;for a severe restraint to follow this period, our trade unions&mdash;if they want to maintain their present position, will have to take note of what is happening in England and restrain themselves, in order to prevent a situation arising which would greatly reduce employment opportunities for Irish workers. Statements have been made by trade union leaders which make me quite confident about this restraint which is, in fact, in operation by the majority of trade unions and that they are approaching the situation very sensibly. But, if there should be a serious worsening of the position, then the Government will have to do, as they have done in the past&mdash;try to counter the situation by fiscal methods, which are more discreet and less politically damaging than those adopted by Harold Wilson in England, the direct <Col N="2080" /> method of enforcing national guidelines.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset&mdash;in the context of large trading groups of nations, which we must join if we want to benefit from the technological advantages&mdash; I should point out we are living in an age when there are many new and independent nations trying to assert their national identities.  But this is also an age when men have dared to dream that all people everywhere can share in the good life and material abundance modern technology makes possible. Economic growth and development should be our prime aim, not the protection of differentials and the class distinction inherent in such a system; but national growth for all, aimed in the direction of a classless society.</P>
    <P>I agree we do not want to be contaminated by foreign ways, to be dominated by foreign influences, or depend upon foreign goods, but we want easy access to the goods, the technology, the skill, the markets and the capital of other countries.  Nationalism can be a highly emotional subject and any emotional subject can lend itself to a quick solution.  But international commercial relations are a very complex subject and if anybody tries for a quick solution, he is invariably wrong. Prosperity and independence go together. They are the basic test of national success.  The basic test of national success is a rising standard of living.  Economic growth is not a goal totally in itself but is the foundation for national unity and self reliance.</P>
    <P>Economic development in Ireland depends on foreign trade and foreign investment.  Our nation, as a nation, will not be weakened if many of its business enterprises are owned or controlled by foreign companies.  Businessmen are guided by economic circumstances only and these have no nationality.  If we in Ireland can rationalise all our trade union movement, as two of the major engineering unions have already done, as the major general workers' unions are exploring: if we can direct attention to national aims instead of sectional aims; if we can expand the meaning of patriotism in the 1960s and 1970s, we can achieve an expanding population and the rising <Col N="2081" /> standards of living we had during the first period of the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has been told, perhaps with some justification, that he seems to speak more about wages and salaries than he does about profits and price control.  This is quite true because, when the Government agreed that now was a good time to set up this Department they were faced with making a Soloman's judgment, this is a judgment as to how far you can go in getting co-operation from the people concerned with incomes and salaries without losing political support and how far you can go, on the other hand, in controlling dividends and restraining profits without damaging the position of business investment.  The Government, like Solomon, solved this problem and cut the baby in half and it was the only way it could be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, if he were given the full responsibility for price control, would find that this would lessen his ability to talk to both sides of industry in the way he is now doing because, politics being what they are, the next time we went out to fight a general election, Fine Gael, and probably Labour, would have some leaflets out to show what prices were when we took office and what they will be when the next election will come along, which will be some years from now.  I should like to conclude with some words from Charles de Gaulle who said in 1944 that the State can only serve its citizens if the citizens lend their services to the State.  That applies to businessmen, trade unionists, workers and farmers as well.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Department of Labour was established last year under an Act of the Oireachtas to deal with industrial relations which had then got out of hand.  Relations between industry and commerce, on the one hand, and labour, on the other, had gone completely haywire.  There is no doubt that was the state of affairs which existed last year.  The establishment <Col N="2082" /> of the Department of Labour was fully justified.</P>
      <P>This had been advocated by the Fine Gael Party since 1963 when a motion was put down in the Seanad to discuss industrial labour relations. The Government did not seem to think that a special Department of Labour was necessary then and they let things rip.  There is no doubt that in the year 1966 positive action was necessary if the economy of the country was not to be completely disrupted.  As the Minister has said in his speech, a couple of notable records were established in 1966. The Labour Court had to deal with more cases than it ever dealt with before.  The record set up in 1965 was beaten.  In 1966, there were more man-days lost, due to strikes, than there were in the record year of 1965.  The Chief Conciliation Officer of the Labour Court became the best-known man in the country.  He became better known than the pop singers or the television personalities.</P>

I hope <Col N="2083" /> the Minister will get down to work and deliver the goods because I think there is nobody who has a better right or a more serious obligation to rectify the deplorable position which existed last year than the Fianna Fáil Government.  They brought it about themselves.</P>
      <P>We hear the Government, through their Minister here, talking nicely and reasonable when there is no election in the offing.  They advise the trade unions to be responsible and to accept reasonable conditions and reasonable wages; they appeal to management to keep down prices so that we can become competitive, but the Fianna Fáil Party speak with a very different voice when there is a general election or any other election in the offing.  They are then prepared to let things rip, as I said, and take the chance.</P>
      <P>The Minister said at some point that at the beginning of this year, they were faced with two alternatives, to insist on wages being kept down to a figure which the economy could afford and risk strikes and that sort of thing or, on the other hand, agree to concede wages which they knew the economy could not afford and hope things would be all right.  That was done in the face of the Presidential election.  That was done to try to ensure that the Government Party and their candidate would not be embarrassed by industrial strife in the country during the Presidential election campaign.  That is the sort of policy that has been pursued by this Government for the past ten years and that is the sort of policy that landed us where we were last year and where we are, perhaps to a somewhat lesser degree, at the present time.  I can only describe the Government policy on management-labour relations over the past seven years as green, red, stop, go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember shortly after I came into the Oireachtas that what I oft described as the bright young Ministers, then bright young Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party, of whom I suppose the Minister here was one, the present Minister for Justice, the present Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education, were all boasting about the buoyancy of the economy, about the <Col N="2084" /> enormous proportions to which the national cake would grow and were encouraging status increases and saying that everybody was entitled to have a fair share and an adequate slice of the national cake.  That was the situation in the early years of this decade.  Certainly that was encouraging something in the nature of an inflation.  Following on that, the cost of living was deliberately put up by taxing everything it was possible to tax: the necessaries of life, medicines, clothing, footwear, the lot were deliberately taxed.</P>
    <P>The Government were then warned that that type of taxation would increase the cost of living and following an increase in the cost of living would come a demand for wages to offset it.  The then Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, protested loudly in this House that the Government measures at that time would not increase the cost of living.  He described warnings from these benches and this side of the House as mischievous and as calculated to make trouble, as calculated to damage the country and damage the economy.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have no intention whatever of quarrelling with the Chair but surely the cost of living is relevant to the Minister's speech which asks that wages be kept down?  I do not intend to go into it in any great detail.  I just want to say that this Government are not consistent and that this Minister is not consistent in his pleas.  I am not going to deal at any length with the turnover tax but I say it has put up the cost of living, and then followed the ninth round which came as day must follow night and, as I said, was encouraged by the Government for political purposes on the eve of the two by-elections.  That is why I say that this Government speak with one tongue now and with another tongue when there is a general election around the corner.</P>
      <P>I only hope the Minister and the Government will be consistent and that management and labour will know where they stand because, for the past ten years, neither management nor labour knew where they stood in this country or with this Government from day to day, and that is what led to the chaos and disruption, the strikes and lock-outs we have had.  No appeal by the Minister will get the Minister any place unless company directors, management on the one hand and labour on the other, know a reasonable time in advance where they stand and where the Government stand with them.  In my opinion, that is where the Government stand condemned over the past ten years.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2086" /> I think it relevant to refer to speeches recently made by the Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs who recently has been going around the country delivering eloquent orations about the present trouble being due to what he described as a &ldquo;wild inflation&rdquo; brought about in 1964 to 1966.  I want to ask the Minister for Transport and Power: who is responsible for that inflation?  The Government of which he is and was a member at that material time are responsible and directly responsible.  You cannot control wages unless you control prices. This Party believes in an incomes policy.  It follows that if it believes in an incomes policy, it must believe in a reasonable prices policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the good in the early part of the Minister's speech was lost, in my opinion, because of its concluding paragraphs.  Many of the things he spoke of as coming within the province of his Department, such as retraining, forecasting of manpower pool and various other functions, are all desirable to hear coming from a Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, he lost a lot of the impact of an otherwise constructive speech by his concluding remarks.  I agree quite definitely with what Deputy M. O'Leary said in his speech&mdash;that the business of the Minister for Labour as seen by those of us who are trade unionists and members of the Labour Party should be to act as a neutral judge, as a go-between of management and labour, using his good offices with <Col N="2091" /> both sides to endeavour to achieve peaceful solutions.  He could do much constructive work in that way but not by using the threat that unless we on the workers' side do certain things, he and the Government will have to take steps to compel us to accept certain restraints.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the workers here as in Britain can accept restraint, provided they are satisfied that certain conditions will apply to such acceptance. I suggest the first condition is that the restraint applies to all sources of income, not just wages but profits as well.  Income is merely something which one part of society calls wages. It is what they get to keep their families and enjoy life; and if restraint is to apply equally to all people, I am quite convinced that trade unionists in this country will accept it as they have accepted participation in the national struggle since the beginning of trade unionism.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister would be well advised to rely on the possibility that he will get restraint and co-operation, provided he gives to the workers the assurances they are looking for.  As a second condition of that restraint, the responsible Minister and the Government must see to it that there will be no alternation in the circumstances of the cost of living so as to deprive them of the benefits of the limited amount of income that might be of any value to them.  Provided these two conditions are fulfilled, just as in Britain the workers here, by and large, will be happy to co-operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass wondered why our counterparts in Britain can accept restraint and we apparently will not.  Does he forget there is a Labour Government in Britain?  Does he forget that the workers in Britain elected that Government and can trust that Government?  Can we say the same of the Government here?  Can we be assured they are not on the side of the employing class, that the workers will get a fair deal?  Events up to the present have not proved it.  The average income of the working man here is below £10 a week, even below £9 a week, and when we hear industrialists <Col N="2092" /> on the other side of the House, with incomes of £3,000, £4,000, £5,000 and £6,000 a year, suggesting to the working people that they should be happy now and that they should take into account the national good and accept restraint, must we not ask what does the national economy mean to a working man who more often than not finds it difficult to feed and clothe his family and himself?  It is not much use talking about the national economy, the national good, the national interest to a working man in these conditions.  Some of those people on the opposite side must live far away from the everyday world.  I can well imagine people with incomes of £5,000 a year living in a dream world, not wanting to be upset by keeping in close contact with the conditions of trade unionists and the working people.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that in a competitive market the workers' income in Britain was increasing less rapidly than that of their counterparts in Ireland.  The reason for that is that the English worker had already reached a standard of parity, of fairness in wages, conditions and fringe benefits.  All these things we still have to get.  That is what trade unions are for.  There is no ideal wage structure in Ireland except, perhaps, in one or two exceptional firms.  There are no ideal conditions here.  Not very long ago we were told that the 40-hour week could not be managed.  In my town even the bankers were told that if the banks closed on Saturdays the economy of the country would be upset.</P>
    <P>The banks have been closed on Saturdays for a considerable time and the country has not suffered as a result. Time will come&mdash;it already has come in the world's greatest producing country, the US&mdash;when we shall be thinking in terms of a 30-hour week. We must adjust our ideas in this country.  Why is it that every time we ask for a wage increase, a fringe benefit such as a pension on retirement or a resundancy payment, people hold up their hands in horror and say: &ldquo;The economy cannot afford it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister in the earlier part of his speech displayed some progressive <Col N="2093" /> ideas.  Some of these progressive ideas, of course, have been forced on him because of the risk or the chance of entry to the Common Market.  That is a good thing.  If we go into the EEC, we shall enter only on conditions of equality in the matter of the various types of benefits that go to make up effective wages.  Those who have studied reports of workers' conditions in Europe must know that a big part of their wage structure is composed of fringe benefits which we have been endeavouring to achieve during the past year or so through our promise during the last round of wages agreements not to mention wages but fringe benefits.  It is only since then that we have made any progress towards the level our fellow workers in Europe and in Great Britain have been enjoying for years.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell on the threats contained in the latter part of the Minister's speech.  There is a working party still endeavouring to find solutions to many of our industrial problems. Perhaps the latter part of his speech is meant as a spur to both sides to endeavour to reach understanding between them.  If it is only that, well and good.  However, if it is more serious than that, I feel that rather than do any good it could do a considerable amount of harm.  It would cause me to think that workers would resent it so much that where they would, before that, have been more than willing to co-operate in any normal adjustment, they would then, just out of perversity, say: &ldquo;My back is up and I am just not going to participate in the implementation of any proposal.&rdquo;  I hope that is not so.</P>
    <P>Workers, and especially trade union officials, do not want strikes.  The worker and his family very rarely recover from the effects of a prolonged strike.  I have experience both of participating in them and leading and guiding them.  We have a saying in the trade union movement that the man who would strike for fun would go to hell for pleasure.  Nobody strikes for fun.  It must be a serious matter when 300 or 400 men will go out and leave themselves and their families short of the necessaries of life for 16 long weeks, <Col N="2094" /> as they did in the Waterford Paper Mills strike.  That is not done for fun, and it is not Red agents who come over here and tell us what to do.  These are Irish workers.  By their own democratic vote and without inducement from their head office, they decide that because their grievances, because their genuine grievances cannot be remedied by direct negotiations, by the Labour Court or conciliation officers, the only way to secure redress is to starve themselves and their families until such time as the loss of profit to the employer compels him to put his pride in his pocket and sit down at the table and discuss rationally terms that will be mutually agreeable.</P>
    <P>I note in the Minister's speech a proposal to increase the number of factory inspectors.  I welcome that, but one thing I find in connection with factory inspectors is that they notify the employer of the day they intend to call, or if they do not notify him in advance, they notify him immediately they call to the factory.  Do they consult with the trade union?  Do they notify the trade union concerned?  Is it not in the interest of the workers they are calling?  Is it not the safety precautions governing the conditions of employment of the workers that they are there to inspect?  If there is a concealed danger, surely it is the workers who could point that out, especially this favourite son of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the safety committee, about which the Minister is so keen.  Even in the factories with which I have been connected as a trade unionist, we have set up safety committees, but never did a factory inspector honour or notice any member of the safety committee.  They were never recognised, as if they had no function.</P>
    <P>These are the people with whom the inspector should consult instead of running around with the management. They should be up to every trick of the management.  When there is a faulty and dangerous machine, it always happens that that machine breaks down the day the factory inspector is about to call.  The dangerous machine is not being worked and it cannot appear on the inspector's report.  He could be told that the <Col N="2095" /> machine was working five minutes before he came into the building, and again he could be told it would be working five minutes after he went out.  These are the things on which the Department of Labour can take advice and get information from people connected with the workers' movement, whether they be in the Labour Party or any other party. Because we are in the Labour Party, we should not be accused of trying to obstruct; in fact, we are very anxious to co-operate if we get the assistance from the Government that we desire.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the way the Minister for Labour outlined the year's working of the Labour Court. He said that of 124 recommendations, some 52 were rejected.  Would it not be nicer if he put it that 72 were accepted?  Why not look on the good side?  Or was he building a case to show someone was wrong?  We know that, in the main, it is the workers who object, that employers are often only too happy to accept some of the suggestions or the solutions of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy about the Labour Court up to a point.  When the Labour Court was left free to give honest, fair decisions, when there were no directions issuing from Government sources, the Labour Court functioned reasonably well.  If I had any criticism of it, it would be only this, that the Court had not the facilities to hear cases quickly enough, that because of cases of national importance, such as the railways, ESB, Guinness and other big concerns, the small private rural factories and companies had their cases neglected and postponed, and what was simply a pinprick of a grievance developed into a running sore. Perhaps a conciliation officer could have effected a settlement speedily, but because of the delays for want of personnel, the Labour Court was placed in an almost impossible position.</P>
    <P>Of the 52 recommendations rejected, 30 of the disputes were settled later, perhaps by force, the Minister says.  I <Col N="2096" /> do not think it was by force in all cases.  A good deal of the trouble was that the employers did not make their best offer at the direct talks, at conciliation or at Labour Court level, but that, faced with a determined group of workers who may have known much better than the Labour Court the recources of a particular firm and the extravagance, perhaps, of the directors, and that there was enough to meet their legitimate demands, the employers agreed to those demands around a table in direct negotiations.  I do not think 20 failures out of 124 is any reflection on the Labour Court at all.  I think it is a good sign of co-operation between workers and management.  My complaint is not against the Labour Court itself; it is because the personnel are not numerous enough.  In my opinion, there should be courts simultaneously sitting in Dublin, Cork, and various areas around the country, to ensure that there would be no long delay and, therefore, no festering of grievances.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about strikes and the hours lost because of strikes.  I know quite a good deal about strikes.  We had a very serious strike in Waterford during which 340 men were out for 16 weeks.  I wonder does the Minister know why they were out.  I can tell him.  They were out because management demanded that, in the interests of progress and economy in the firm, the firm being the National Board and Paper Mills, the workers should be prepared to work four shifts continuously night and day, Sunday and Monday.  A bitter struggle ensued. After 16 weeks a compromise was reached.  A team consisting of workers and management visited European paper mills and, after a time, the workers returned to work and decided to agree to this proposal.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Six months ago the strike ended.  The workers are now working five days a week.  There is no work for them and management never had any intention of putting the proposal to which I referred into effect. What is worse, they are now being allowed to import manufactured American Kraft paper; Irish workers could be engaged in Waterford making this <Col N="2097" /> paper.  The firm got a grant of £50,000 from the Government to provide a store for wastepaper, the raw material for the manufacture of cardboard.  That store is empty of wastepaper but it is full of American Kraft paper which is allowed in free of duty as waste.  This is resold to the firm's competitors for use in their manufacturing processes. All this has been told to a Parliamentary Secretary.  The workers are willing and anxious to meet management and to meet the Minister with management to argue out and prove the truth of what I am stating.</P>
    <P>Is it likely men will go on strike for 16 weeks to oppose something unless they know that what is being put forward is only an excuse?  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Having got agreement, this firm has not yet put into practice what they promised. They have not even attempted to do it. They say that some of the machinery there is not capable of doing the work. There are adaptation grants for this firm as there are for all firms throughout the country.  Is it not odd that they do not accept these grants?  We were told the machines would cost £1 million.  The machines have not come yet.  Would it not be preferable to go on working with the old machines which have produced suitable quality board in the past for manufacture into cartons rather than import finished raw material?  The threat now is that the men may be laid off; they are working on a week-to-week basis.  The livelihoods of 144 workers are in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about an officer of his Department who will go out to ease uneasiness, find out the difficulties, consult and try to iron them out.  I suggest there is grave need for him. There is a great deal of room for him in Waterford.  I tell the Minister now quite seriously that unrest is beginning again.  The men are not looking for trouble but, if men are facing the prospect of being unemployed next week, next month, or even next year, they will be in no mood to be reasonable. They will have a grievance and they will endeavour in any way they can to thwart the people who are endeavouring <Col N="2098" /> to take away their livelihoods from them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal specifically with the cost of living but it must be admitted that, while cost of living increases continue, the position will not be satisfactory.  RGDATA accused a Minister of not publishing increases to which he has agreed.  Whether or not these increases are published, the ordinary consumer knows full well that prices are going up.  I understand there is an obligation on shopkeepers to publish a price list.  That obligation is not being honoured.  Were it not for certain supermarkets springing up throughout the country, God alone knows what kind of prices would be charged.  In my own town butter dropped by 7d. a pound when the supermarket came in.  Someone had been robbing somebody.</P>
    <P>Rents, under the direction of the Minister for Local Government, will increase 200 per cent.  Surely workers will not accept this rent increase without looking for more?  The only place they can get more is from their employers and, if the Minister endeavours to stop us, there will be a serious head-on clash.  Without any threats at all, it must be fairly evident to the Minister that one could take all the employers in the country, tie them in a bundle and throw them over a cliff and the country would survive. If, however, one did that to the workers, there would be no country at all.  One can translate a foreman worker into a manager and a firm will go on working with a manager, but one cannot translate a director into a factory worker or, if you do, you will have a damned inefficient one.</P>
    <P>It is not just as simple as the Minister apparently thinks.  Things cannot be done just by regulation and I do not believe the Minister thinks he can do that.  What the Minister is doing is, I think, using the old gimmick of saying: &ldquo;Look, unless you do this, I will have to take steps to make you do it&rdquo;.  I do not believe the Minister believes this can be done.</P>
    <P>There is another little problem at which I should like the Minister to have a look, the question of redundancy. <Col N="2099" /> There are about 115 workers in Waterford city and county who will become redundant; some of them will get redundancy pay and some will not. I know one case of a temporary railway gatekeeper with three years' service who will get a pension of 25/- a week.  A permanent railway official with 25 years' service will get no pension at all unless he transfers 50 miles away from his home.  Possibly a different Minister handles this problem. It is a CIE problem.  I do not know if the Minister for Labour has any function there.  Certainly the man nominally in charge of it has no function. I do not know who should deal with it.  There is room for a good deal of thought in relation to redundancy pay.  It is a problem some Minister should examine.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment Deputy Harte gave notice that he was raising the matter of Question No. 73 on the Order Paper for Thursday, 16th February, 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday, 16th February, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance the following question:</P>
      <P>... when it is proposed to commence drainage of the Cloon Burn, Carrigans, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>To this the Parliamentary Secretary gave the following reply:</P>
      <P>I cannot yet say when work on this scheme will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be a simple answer to a straightforward question, but the story does not end there.  I should like to give the House the background to this.  The Cloon Burn is a small river in east Donegal, serving a very fertile valley.  A small committee was formed to agitate for the cleaning of this river and for the past 20 years its spokesmen were made promises by people in high places that this river would be cleaned.  The promises were <Col N="2100" /> always made coming up to an election, particularly a general election.  The river was not in the electoral area of certain individuals and therefore did not arise at county council elections.</P>
    <P>My own experience in relation to this problem goes back to July, 1960, when I was approached by two individuals to see if the negotiations could be re-opened in order to help the local farmers.  I was not a Member of this House, but I was a member of the local authority.  I made inquiries from the OPW.  I was told this river was on the priority list, but that it would be many years before any drainage would take place.  This information was conveyed to a meeting to which I and many other public representatives were invited.  Again, many promises were made.  I took the matter up with the local authority and, because of the delay, as indicated by the Office of Public Works, the engineering section agreed, provided the money was made available, to do a temporary job on the river.  This had a certain amount of success, but then political manoeuvring began and the promises were repeated.  I am not terribly interested in who takes credit for the cleaning of the Cloon Burn as long as it is cleaned.  Some Deputies may wonder why I raise this question tonight.  I do so for two reasons.  First, because the House votes money for this type of work and, secondly, because there is certain confusion locally as to what the actual position is at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham is coming in here to interrupt the proceedings. He was very mute when we last met the local authority.  He was prepared to manoeuvre like the cutest salmon that ever went up the Foyle and have it shelved until such time as he might get the credit for it.  But there are smarter men in the Fianna Fáil organisation than Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Cunningham was outwitted.  He should not blame me for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> As I said, the House votes money for this kind of work.  Therefore, when a Deputy addresses a question to the person responsible for this type of work, I believe the House expects an honest reply.  Parliament ceases to be Parliament when a Deputy who asks a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary a straightforward question gets a dishonest reply.  As you will see later, something like this has happened.  I raise this matter because it is not the money of the Fianna Fáil Party which is going to the cleaning of the river. This is money provided by the taxpayers and ratepayers of this country. The people who have been paying through the nose for having land like this drained are entitled to be told the truth when a question is asked in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The second reason I raise the matter is that there is confusion locally.  When I received the Official Report containing the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I arranged to have it sent to the local newspapers in order to inform the people concerned what the actual position was.  The confusion arises now because last weekend there was in one paper the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to me that he could not say when work on the scheme would commence, but under banner headlines in another paper the Parliamentary Secretary is reported as having told the secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann that work would commence in another fortnight.  It is a sad state of affairs when a responsible Deputy who asks a simple, straightforward question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That was two weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and gets what appears to be a straightforward answer should go home to be told that the local Fianna Fáil secretary has been given a different answer.  I believe the integrity of the Parliamentary Secretary is at stake; my honesty is at stake and the records of the House are inaccurate. If for any reason I have made a mistake, then I apologise to the Parliamentary Secretary.  But I want to know who has been told the truth&mdash;the local <Col N="2102" /> Fianna Fáil secretary or this House?  I knew the Parliamentary Secretary when he was just an ordinary Deputy.  I met him during elections; he standing on a box spouting for Fianna Fáil and I for Fine Gael.  We could always see certain reason in each other's arguments and were always prepared to co-operate when it came to decide who should speak first.  I do not mind the Parliamentary Secretary trying to score a political point but I submit that there are more honest ways of doing it. Telling a lie in this House is not, in my opinion, the proper way to score a political point.  I know that Deputy Cunningham feels that a certain amount of wind has been taken out of his sails because, like many other Fianna Fáil Deputies, he is not without sin whenever it comes to making promises about the Cloon Burn. Promises were made by Deputy Cunningham and by other Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>

      <P>At the meeting at Monreagh national school, promises were made about the Cloon Burn by Deputy Cunningham but Deputy Cunningham is not as shrewd or astute a politician as certain other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and when it comes to taking credit for all the spadework that goes into certain things Deputy Cunningham has done, another person more powerful in the Fianna Fáil organisation can, for some reason or other, get in at the last minute and take full credit for himself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to the NFA, I would not say he is nameless or blameless but it would be unparliamentary to use those names.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries addressed a meeting in the locality and promised that work would commence. It was significant that this was about a fortnight before a general election.  Nothing happened until some time after last Christmas when I was again approached by local people to find out what was happening.  In conversation with different people with whom I came in contact, I explained the promises made by Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Blaney and the promises made by Deputy J. Brennan, when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and said that I was but a humble Deputy representing the smaller Party in North-East Donegal but that, as a Deputy, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary what the position was.  I said I would use all the resources I could muster to try to help in this regard, provided certain individuals who did not share my political views would contact their local public representatives and impress on them the importance of having this river drained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> The net result was that the Parliamentary Secretary, having answered my question, discovered that a political point could be scored. I accuse is of it, but I suspect that there is another person who is the architect of the manoeuver&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and who my have taken it upon himself to try to score that political point.  If that is the position, I accuse the Parliamentary Secretary of not knowing what is happening in his Department, of coming into the House and chancing his arm as did a certain other Minister of Fianna Fáil when asked a question by Deputy Dillon a few months ago.  He also chanced his arm.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary could have chanced his arm, that he was not attending to his own business when he answered my Parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>I have raised this matter because, first, I sent a copy of the Dáil debates for that particular day to the people concerned.  It found its way into the local newspapers and the Parliamentary Secretary has been quoted in the local newspaper as having told me one story&mdash;incidentally, it does not share the political views of the Parliamentary Secretary's Party&mdash;and as having told the secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann at St. Johnston that work would commence within the next fortnight.  I now want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House to whom he has told the truth.  Has he told the truth to the House or has he told the Fianna Fáil cumann secretary the truth?  I want to know; the House should know and the people most concerned most of all should be told the truth.</P>

      <P>But I should like to get on the records of the House <Col N="2105" /> because I think this is a matter which should not only be raised in the House but should also be raised before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Here we had a very simple question asked in the House by Deputy Harte: is the Parliamentary Secretary going to spend public money on this project in East Donegal?  His reply was: &ldquo;I do not know when I am going to spend it.&rdquo;  This is a very categoric, positive reply.  The project is a fairly substantial one.  Machinery is necessary and must be moved in. Such decisions are not taken overnight but within 24 hours of having given that reply, the secretary of the local cumann, who shares the same political views as the Parliamentary Secretary, is in a position to announce that work will commence within a fortnight.</P>

Deputy O'Donnell evidently does not know a damn thing about this affair of Deputy Harte's. The most serious thing Deputy Harte <Col N="2106" /> said was that the Parliamentary Secretary had told a cumann secretary, presumably a Fianna Fáil cumann secretary, that it was the intention of the Board of Works to carry out the scheme within a couple of weeks, having previously, or possibly simultaneously, told Deputy Harte in the House that I was not then able to say when this scheme was going to be carried out.</P>
      <P>Straight off, this simply is not so.  I was not in touch with any cumann secretary or any private individual, so far as I know, in County Donegal about this matter but I think the reason for Deputy Harte's discomfiture, his embarrassment about this is simply that the question he tabled about this matter came up in the Dáil when he was not here.</P>

      <P>The fact is that Deputy Harte finds it difficult to listen to the truth.  I have a general instruction in my Office to the effect that I require brevity and accuracy in a Parliamentary reply.  The question Deputy Harte tabled on this matter was answered accurately and briefly. We all know, as colleagues of Deputy Harte, that he is a pretty vigorous person when he does attend the House to ask supplementary questions.  The position that obtained when Deputy Harte asked his question was precisely <Col N="2108" /> as I said in my reply to his question. The position then was that it was not possible, at that time, to say precisely when drainage operations would start on the Cloon Burn.  That is accurate. If Deputy Harte had been in the House, he would obviously have asked, by way of supplementary question, if I could give any indication as to when work would start.  But, since Deputy Harte was not in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>What has that to do with your telling me one thing and your telling a Fianna Fáil cumann secretary another thing?  The Parliamentary Secretary is manoeuvring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No supplementary question was asked simply for the reason that Deputy Harte denies, that is, that he was not present in the House at all to ask it.  The arrangements for the drainage of the Cloon Burn had reached an advanced stage and we were almost ready to roll but we could not at that time say precisely when.  One thing very often arises in this House when a phrase like &ldquo;in a short time&rdquo; is used.  Some facetious person in the Opposition will stand up and ask what precisely &ldquo;in a short time&rdquo; means.  If Deputy Harte had been in the House at the time I replied to the question he had tabled, I could have told him that it would be in a few weeks: that is the position. But Deputy Harte's disappointment and anguish at the prospect of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are other <Col N="2110" /> Deputies from Donegal in this House who are much more zealous than Deputy Harte.  In the couple of weeks that ensued from the time Deputy Harte tabled his casual question, and was not here to ask a supplementary question that might have been based upon it and that would certainly have elicited more information, the position in regard to the Cloon Burn had clarified itself and, to his dismay, I am now able to say that the drainage of the Cloon Burn will go ahead. Deputy Harte, plainly, is very embarrassed about this.  He started the tirade here to-night on the promises made over the years, presumably by my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, about the drainage of the Cloon Burn.  It will be drained and drained immediately, and that is the reason for Deputy Harte's embarrassment.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Harte's embarrassment.  It is clear that he based all his hopes on the fact that the drainage of the Cloon Burn would further be delayed.  It has been decided that the drainage of the Cloon Burn will go ahead, whatever Deputy Harte thinks.</P>
