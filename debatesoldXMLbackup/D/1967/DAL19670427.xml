To my mind, quite without precedent, he just refused to give the information.</P>

    <Title>Auctioneers and House Agents Bill, 1966 [Seanad]: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and Deputy O.J. Flanagan raised certain questions which I assured the House I would look into between then and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>First of all, Deputy O'Higgins suggested that in section 1 (4), line 39, the expression &ldquo;purchase or renting&rdquo; should read &ldquo;purchase, sale or renting&rdquo;. I have looked into this and I find it is unnecessary.  The drafting relates to a transaction between auctioneer and purchaser.  Therefore, &ldquo;purchase or renting&rdquo; in fact covers everything. It might be misleading to add &ldquo;sale&rdquo; when it would mean nothing.</P>
      <P>The second point raised was the meaning of the word &ldquo;deposit&rdquo;, particularly in relation to a situation where a full payment was put down.  I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who raised the point whether or not that could be termed a deposit.  The meaning of &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; covers a full as well as a part payment.  Popular usage equates &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; with part-payment because it almost always is only a part-payment but &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; from the dictionary point of view covers money put down whether in part or in full.  Therefore, &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; covers the situation mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins where all and not just part of the money might be lodged with the auctioneer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> Another point raised concerned the word &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  I have looked into whether or not there should be a definition of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  I think it is wiser not to have a definition.  There is a clear meaning of the word &ldquo;client&rdquo;, in the sense we are using it, that is, a person employing the services of a professional man, in this case an auctioneer. That is the plain meaning of &ldquo;client&rdquo;.  There is no ambiguity about it.  We might be creating an awkward situation for ourselves by defining &ldquo;client&rdquo; where it has a plain, ordinary and well-established meaning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; that is the well-established popular usage.  I think we would be unwise to seek to define it in the Bill.  Those are the only points which were raised and I am satisfied that the Bill, as drafted, adequately covers those points.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is certainly a step in the right direction, first, so far as the general public are concerned, and secondly, so far as the auctioneering profession are concerned. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing and placing on record the thanks of the profession to the Minister for Justice and his Department for the helpful manner in which they have approached the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also feel that Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has been extremely helpful, and the profession would like to express to him their profound thanks for the interest he has displayed in this matter.  This Bill has got what I consider to be a reasonable hearing and discussion in this House.  The Minister has certainly met all the points raised by the profession in consideration of this Bill.  The main reason the profession were anxious to have legislation of this kind coming before the House and included in our Statute Book is that they were very anxious that steps should be taken to protect the general public against persons who might not discharge their duties in the manner <Col N="310" /> one would expect from a member of the profession.</P>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to increase from £2,000 to £5,000 the deposit which a licensed auctioneer is required to keep in the High Court. This is most certainly a step in the right direction because it will ensure that when it comes to the granting of such licences by the District Court, a person who is a holder of such a licence will be bonded for the sum of £5,000.  The profession were anxious that the Minister might consider a sum of £10,000, but on reconsideration, it was felt that this might be a hardship on the smaller men.  I should like to say that there is not now, and never has been any intention of making the auctioneering profession a closed shop.</P>
    <P>The auctioneering profession have been endeavouring for many years past to raise their standards and their status.  We felt that since we are called upon to render to the community a very important service in buying and selling land, houses, factory buildings, in lettings of grazing, meadowings and conacring of land, the general public should have the best, specialised, fully qualified and trained personnel dealing with this very important business.  For that reason the profession asked to have the deposit increased.  After some discussion between the profession and the Minister the sum of £5,000 was agreed.  That is a reasonable sum, indeed, having regard to the fact that £2,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to refer briefly to the fact that since £2,000 was fixed in 1947, £5,000 cannot be described as unreasonable.  The keeping of separate clients' accounts is most desirable.  As I said on another Stage of the Bill, it is only right for the protection of the public that those in the auctioneering profession should be called upon&mdash;and I am glad that this will be the law in the course of the next month, I should imagine&mdash;to keep separate clients' accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has read the Estates Bill which was ordered to be printed by the House of <Col N="311" /> Commons on 8th December, 1965.  If he has not had an opportunity of studying the terms of the Bill, I should like to direct his attention to the section dealing with terminations, qualifications, certificates of registration, codes of conduct and keeping of accounts.</P>
    <P>I trust that this legislation is an instalment of more comprehensive legislation which we hope the Government will see fit to bring in early in the 1970s, and that he who wishes to become a member of the auctioneers' association must have passed the necessary qualifying examination, must have completed a course in the colleges that provide these courses, and if he is unable to do so, must have participated in correspondence courses which the association are now sponsoring.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that the auctioneering profession are devoting all their energies towards improving their standards and getting the best qualified people into it in order to give the public the benefit of their experience, their wise counsel and advice. For that reason I am glad the Bill has had the goodwill and approval of all Parties in the House.  I hope that in the early 1970s, if the Minister sees fit to review the situation, he will be able to give us registration.  I feel that by 1970 the auctioneers will have their own house in order.  I am sure that by that time we will be in a position to ask for most sympathetic consideration on the part of the Government towards registration.  I am sure the Minister will be pleased to give an undertaking that he will review the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to express to him on behalf of this professional body our thanks for his patience and kindness, for the friendship which he has displayed towards the profession, and the happy relations that exist between the auctioneers and his Department, and also, I am glad to say, the chartered accountants.  The chartered accountants are a very important section of the community who have a very important part to play in making this Bill a success. I should like to express my thanks to them for the helpful memoranda they submitted to the Department.  I <Col N="312" /> am glad that the Bill has received the approval of the House and I can assure the Minister that the auctioneers will avail of every opportunity to comply with the terms of this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night when the House adjourned, I was referring to the increased cost of building houses and I gave figures for the cost of building a four-room serviced house five years ago and the comparable cost today.  At that time grants were £300 and they have remained at that figure for a very long time.  While grants are available for the agricultural community, one very often experiences difficulty in getting these grants for people who are justly entitled to them. The record of the Government, as far as house building is concerned in my constituency, has not been very good over the past ten years.  From 1956 to 1966, only 200 houses were built by the local authorities in Roscommon. During the same period, in Leitrim, only six houses were built.  At the moment in Leitrim, particularly in Carrick-on-Shannon, there is a desperate demand for houses.  We have as many as four people living, or trying to live, in two-roomed flats.  That is not a very satisfactory situation in a town the size of Carrick-on-Shannon. I am afraid that the Government must <Col N="313" /> accept responsibility for the situation which has led to the increased cost of building.  This was brought about solely by the introduction of the turnover tax and more recently, the wholesale tax.  These two taxes have increased house building costs tremendously.</P>
      <P>I sometimes wonder about the operation of these taxes.  During the debate on the turnover tax, we on this side of the House pointed out that the shopkeepers should be relieved of the responsibility of collecting it.  The Government Party said that it would be utterly impossible to do that.  Yet, a couple of years later, they introduced the wholesale tax and decided to collect it at source.  I suggest that even at this stage it would be advisable to amalgamate both these taxes and have them collected at source.  At present in some counties we have inspectors going around harrying shopkeepers who probably find it difficult enough to exist. There is not much relief in this Budget for the unfortunate shopkeeper.  Competition has become very keen in rural areas because of the supermarkets and today shopkeepers are nothing more than glorified tax collectors.  They have to collect the increased tax on beer and on tobacco and they have to collect the turnover tax.  As I said, if these two taxes were amalgamated, it would be much easier for the shopkeepers and the people to pay the tax direct.  The shopkeepers are also asked to pay increased rates and there is no relief for them in this regard.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, I should like for old time's sake to mention the question of drainage in my constituency.  A few years ago there was a by-election there and the then Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the Board of Works found time to visit the constituency and in Castlerea I listened to him speaking and one would have thought from what he said that the Shannon was to be drained the next day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government are serious about doing anything for the West, they will have to provide the farmers with interest-free loans.  They have accepted portion of our policy from the &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo; in this Budget and I would ask them to go a bit further and accept that part of our policy.  The incomes of the small farmers in the West will have to be supplemented.  The Government are not making any effort to do this.  They withdrew the LAW schemes which provided employment for people who needed it.  Last year they withdrew the minor relief schemes which also gave much needed employment.  Nowadays there seems to be a game between county engineers to procure modern machinery which will eliminate employment for the small farmer.  The net result is that there is no employment provided even on the roads.</P>
      <P>On that point, county councils should have more authority in the matter of deciding in what direction money should be spent.  They should not be asked to spend 50 per cent of the money on main roads while some by-roads are in a deplorable condition.</P>

      <Col N="315" /> During the year we approached the Minister for Transport and Power in regard to the question of erecting a power station at Arigna.  He said nothing could be done about it and that it was cheaper to generate electricity from oil and turf.  If he is serious about giving employment in the West, another generating station will have to be erected at Arigna to use the coal which is mined there.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my constituents, I should like to thank the Minister for his Budget which will be of great benefit to the people in the West.  We have heard critical speeches by the Opposition; they want more benefits and so on but, throwing our minds back to the time when they were in power, we remember that they took a shilling off the old age pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must look at those times also.  The old age pensioners in general will benefit by 5/-from this year's Budget.  That is a step in the right direction on which the Minister is to be complimented. He is also to be complimented on introducing free travel and free electricity for old age pensioners to which I think they are entitled.  I am glad this has come about.</P>
      <P>People living in the West with over £4 valuation were able to get unemployment assistance in the past for only four months of the year.  That has been changed in this Budget and they are now entitled to unemployment assistance for the 12 months. That will help them out greatly, especially people living on small, uneconomic holdings and rearing large families. Also, the young men who are unmarried and who could get assistance for only six months in the past will now qualify for the full 12 months. That is also a decision on which the Minister is to be complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, people on the west coast have small valuations and the derating of land up to £20 valuation will be a tremendous help to them and <Col N="316" /> their large families.  It will give them a better chance of earning money from any work that may become available in their area.  The sliding scale between £20 and £33 is a wise provision.  It proves to the Opposition Parties and the country in general that the Minister and the Government have the West in mind and that they are down to earth in their efforts to help the West and the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>My only reason for speaking in this debate is that I have been asked by my constituents to add my voice to the praise of the Minister for Finance for his Budget this year and to express the hope that he will continue in the future to look after the West as well as he has done in this year's Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us in his Budget Statement that during the year under review it was only necessary to raise a net £16.2 million from the banking system or about half the amount raised from this source in 1965-66.  That may be so but I cannot believe there was any increase in bank credit in the year under review for the private sector.  Other Deputies, I think, have also referred to this fact. The Taoiseach, speaking on the Budget, referred to it as a good Budget, an expansionist and reflationary Budget.  I do not think it is good; it certainly is not expansionist.  I cannot agree with the Taoiseach, and I think the people of the country do not agree, that it is a good Budget.</P>
      <P>The Government have now been in power uninterruptedly for the past ten years and during that time we have had the advent of EEC and a lot of talk about productivity.  I should have liked the Minister to have done something about productivity in his Budget. I am thinking particularly of the derating concession he has given in respect of holdings up to £20 valuation. I agree with that, but I think it could have been linked in some way with productivity and it is a retrograde step not to have done so.  I am not suggesting at this stage how that could have been worked out but some link between the benefit and productivity could have been forged if sufficient thought had been given to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a frothy Budget: it gives <Col N="317" /> very small increases in the social welfare sector.  While I welcome them as increases, I was amazed to hear the previous Deputy going back to the time when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, as it then was, took a shilling off the old age pensions.  If my memory serves me right, I believe that was done in 1928.  Here we are in 1967 after ten years of uninterrupted Fianna Fáil government which they describe as good government and what is the position in regard to employment? We were told in a previous general election that there would be 100,000 new jobs, that people would come back from England and that there would be plenty of employment.  The <i>Irish Banking Review</i> tells us that today we have not one more person in gainful employment than we had in 1957.  That is all the Fianna Fáil Government have been able to do in regard to employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given benefits to the rural community but I represent an urban constituency and there is no relief in the burden of soaring rates in this Budget.  I must remind the Minister that in urban areas there are small shopkeepers who are very hard hit because of business difficulties and soaring rates.  What does the Minister propose to do about soaring rates? Is he prepared to take the health services off the rates? I should like to ask him what he proposes to do about the promise of the former Minister for Health who promised that the health services demand would be held at the 1965/66 level.  Dublin Health Authority still do not know what the position is regarding that statement.</P>
    <P>The day before yesterday, Deputy Andrews referred to the high rents charged for flats in Dún Laoghaire. The rents of flats, as the Minister well knows, are subject to supply and demand: if there is a supply of flats, then the rents go down.  I do not wish to be taken by the House as agreeing with the high rents being charged but I charge the Minister with responsibility for the lack of housing in all areas, and in Dún Laoighaire in particular during the past ten years.  Even today Dún Laoghaire Corporation are awaiting sanction for the erection of 104 <Col N="318" /> flats in Mounttown.  I think the Deputy I have referred to would be better employed in helping Dún Laoghaire Corporation to get on with the erection of those flats because that would house some of the people now homeless in Dún Laoghaire.  I should like the Minister to use his good offices to obtain sanction for those flats at Mounttown so that Dún Laoghaire Corporation can get on with the job of solving their housing problem.</P>
    <P>During the year there has been considerable delay at all stages in connection with local authority housing. I know there have been difficulties but I submit that the Minister should use his influence to speed up the procedure.  In that respect I should like to remind the Minister that Dublin County Council, if I may move into the county area for a few moments, have been told by the Department of Local Government that for the year 1967/68, they will be granted £1 million for local authority housing.  I hope that is not an election gimmick, that that amount of money will be paid to Dublin County Council for that purpose.  In relation to the granting of such money, some local authorities are in the happy position of being able to raise money themselves, a certain amount anyway.  My complaint is that when local authorities raise money themselves, it is taken out of its allocation from the Department; in other words, if Dublin County Council raise £200,000, the Department give only £800,000.  I ask the Minister for Finance to look into that because it seems to be imposing a burden on local authorities who can raise money.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said at the beginning that I do not think this is a good Budget.  It certainly is not an expansionist Budget and I do not think it is a reflationary Budget either.</P>

      <P>The national papers this morning carried banner headlines in relation to disturbances in the Stormont Government.  When I read that statement, I wondered which member of this Cabinet would go west.  The corridors of this House of Parliament are seething with rumours of corruption in housing in this city, of men who have <Col N="319" /> become very rich in this city at the expense of the local authorities and of the poor&mdash;the homeless people in the city who find it impossible either to procure homes through the local authority or to provide them for themselves by virtue of the scandalous inflation that has taken place, seemingly by design, in the suburbs of this city because certain people in high places are in possession of information which is not available to the individuals most concerned.  We have the racketeers and the privateers closely associated and prominently identified, hidden behind the scenes of the now famous association called Taca.</P>

Do I have to parade the mothers, fathers and children of Donegal to satisfy Deputy Crowley and the Parliamentary Secretary that what I am saying is true? Do I have to do that?  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I submit that one of the biggest scandals in recent times, certainly in my time in public life, is the scandalous housing record of this Government.  It is a dismal record I may add.  Just to get away from that point, I hope the Taoiseach gives the warning to every member of his Cabinet, every junior member of his Cabinet <Col N="322" /> and members of his back bench, that not alone should justice be done but justice should appear to be done. That at least is not happening at the moment.</P>
      <P>Housing, in my opinion, is one of the social benefits which any Government must and should provide for their people.  As a public representative, I have discovered&mdash;certain facts have been brought to my notice regarding this&mdash;the conditions which certain people must tolerate in this year of 1967.  I must ask myself where does the moral obligation lie in relation to the Government and to the people?  I am led to believe that a Government are elected by the people to provide for the people.  I believe that the people who voted for this Government in 1957, and who supported them, maybe not with the same majority, but who gave them another chance in 1961, and again in 1965, did so because they believed that this Government would carry out their duties to the people who elected them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crowley, like myself, is not a person who runs into a local authority office looking for a house. Fortunately enough, for reasons which we do not have to explain to each other, Deputy Crowley is in a position to provide a house for himself. I, likewise, am able to provide a house for myself but Deputy Crowley is no different from me inasmuch as he must receive complaints from people in Bandon and in mid-Cork. He must receive those complaints from individuals who go to him.  They are the same type of people as visit my home and complain about the slow progress being made by the local authority in providing houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crowley, much the same as myself, heads off to the local authority office, either on the day of the meeting or while he is passing through Cork on his way to Dublin.  He will find himself in the Housing Section of Cork County Council.  I hope when he tells, or writes to, the person concerned, he tells exactly what the position is.  I hope, like some of his colleagues in my constituency, and indeed in my native <Col N="323" /> county, he does not try to pass off the buck to the county manager instead of to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The position as I see it in Donegal is this.  In the years 1955, 1956 and 1957&mdash;I use the figures given by the Minister for Local Government in reply to a question by Deputy P. O'Donnell and myself a month or six weeks ago&mdash; Donegal County Council provided 447 local authority houses.  In the nine years since then, 462 houses have been provided.  In other words, 15 more houses have been built by the present Government in nine years than were built by the inter-Party Government in the first three years of the past 12 years. These figures reflect the reason why Deputy Crowley must pay attention and more visits to the Housing Section of Cork County Council.</P>

I was dealing with housing in Donegal, Sir, when I was interrupted by Deputy Crowley.  We, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;I should say Deputy Breslin&mdash; are in possession of the facts.  One of these is that in the year 1966 the Government allocated to the town of Letterkenny £1,000 for housebuilding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten Taca dinners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, ten Taca dinners. Perhaps we might have more money this year to build houses in Donegal. Perhaps that is what Deputy Crowley meant when he said &ldquo;We need money; we are not as rich a Party as Fine Gael&rdquo;.  I hope when you have collected money, you will provide more houses for the poor and needy in Letterkenny in 1967.  We find that this Government allocated £2,000 in the year 1966 to the town of Buncrana for houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the first three years when the inter-Party Government were in office, the local papers were full of statements by the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, by Deputy Cunningham, and, indeed, by Deputies in the other constituencies in Donegal, criticising the inter-Party Government for not building enough houses and pointing out that only for the high rate of emigration and migration in County Donegal, there would be a calamity.  The fact of the matter is that since those three years one-third of the effort has been put into housebuilding in County Donegal by the present administration.  These are not my figures but the figures of the Department of Local Government given to Deputy P. O'Donnell and myself a month or six weeks ago in this House.  In addition, the rate <Col N="326" /> of unemployment has increased in County Donegal during the past nine years.</P>
    <P>If there is one reason why this Government should fall, if there is a reason why Deputies should ask themselves: &ldquo;Have we fulfilled our obligations to the people who voted for us and who placed their confidence in us&rdquo; it is that they have failed miserably under the heading of housing.</P>
    <P>Certain benefits may appear to have been given in this Budget.  Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in reply to a Parliamentary Question I put down on 14th March concerning the cost of the erection of the Thomas Davis statue in Dublin said that that effort cost £19,800 to £20,000.  Would it not have been more fitting if that £20,000 were spent in providing ten local authority houses in County Donegal? I believe that if that noble man were alive today or if he could speak from the grave and were asked: &ldquo;How should we remember you; should we provide a statue in College Green to your memory or should we provide ten local authority houses to provide homes for ten families?&rdquo;, his answer would be: &ldquo;Build ten houses&rdquo;.  I wonder if the ten houses were being built would the lowest tender received have been accepted?  The Parliamentary Secretary declined to answer my supplementary question on that occasion to the effect that the lowest tender received was in fact the one accepted. Now, perhaps he might come clean and tell the House that he is now in possession of that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so long ago in Donegal County Council we had a discussion about the provision of different types of houses.  We can now provide them with SI cottages, with small farmers' cottages, with scheme cottages and with Cedarwood houses. We had a discussion at a county council meeting as to which of these four types of houses we should provide. We had a discussion on the type of house we might build if we had the money.  Having listened to certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party expound why we should build this type of house in preference to another type and why we should not build one house in preference to another, I must say I can foresee the day when the County Manager will announce that he has 13 <Col N="328" /> houses built; this is only a third of the houses he built last year.  I can see him announcing a raffle and that the first prize will be a small farmer's house, because these are the most difficult type to get.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, the then Minister for Local Government announced that these houses would be available at 7/6d per week but the trouble is nobody has got one yet.  The second prize would be an SI cottage, the third a Cedarwood cottage; and there would be ten additional scheme houses.  I can imagine a Fianna Fáil councillor going back to Moville, or landing into the Square in Malin, pulling down the window of his car, waving out and shouting: &ldquo;We have won a house&rdquo; and the people being amazed: &ldquo;What type of object is this?  Is it something like a satellite&rdquo;, it being so unusual for them to see a house built in a district like Malin by the local authority, and wondering which prize did you get &mdash;the first, second or third?</P>
      <P>I can see a similar situation arising in a town like Moville or in Carndonagh where no houses have been built by the local authority in the past ten years. This is the dismal situation in Donegal when people wish to obtain houses. Out of frustration they make application and wonder: &ldquo;Will I qualify for a grant and, if I do, how much money will I get?&rdquo; At this point we explain to them: &ldquo;Well, if you come under a certain income limit, you will qualify for a grant, but, if you apply for a loan, you will have to take your place in the queue&rdquo;.  Therefore, the position now is that if you want a small farmer's house, there are 340 applications ahead of yours; if you want an SI cottage, you will wait for 2½ to 3½ years; if you want a Cedarwood cottage, you must await approval of the design, as Deputy Breslin knows, and he speaks very strongly in favour of Cedarwood houses.  But the fact of the matter is none has been built yet.  Then, if you want a scheme house, if you are a newly-married couple, you must compete with fathers and mothers of families of five, six and up to nine, and the net position is that you have no chance of getting a scheme house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Therefore, out of frustration, they go to the public representative, be he a county councillor or a Deputy who explains that they will qualify for a grant but must take their place in the queue for the loan.  The position of one in a queue for a loan at the moment is that a county manager will guarantee that a loan will be paid; he will make a private arrangement; he will try to meet that loan at a certain date.  Then, the Deputy or the county councillor finds himself with that frustrated young couple in the private office of a bank manager asking him would he meet the amount until that date; would he finance the contractor; would he finance the local builder's provider until such time as the county manager would provide the first instalment of the loan?  Early on in the campaign I must say, in all fairness to bank managers, they stepped in to fill the gap and provided the bridging loans necessary but now the bank managers find it so impossible that we have come to a standstill.</P>
    <P>That is the sum total of the housing situation in Donegal.  These are the people who cannot provide houses and cannot get houses but what of the people who are a little more fortunate, who can provide their own houses and who have provided them, who have stepped into the breach and who have left county council cottages to build their own bungalows?  What thanks have they got?  In the past few months, the valuation officers have visited these homes and the people have been told: &ldquo;For leaving your county council cottage, or for abandoning the condemned home in which you lived; in appreciation of the fact that you provided a home for yourself and have taken the responsibility away from the local authority, we are now saddling you with a valuation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Indeed the people who repaired the homes in which they were living, at great expense, are also being told: &ldquo;We must increase your valuation&rdquo;, because this is a new way of increasing the rates in County Donegal and in every other county.</P>
    <P>In Donegal County Council we have <Col N="330" /> members of the Seanad asking for support from Fine Gael and the newly formed Progressive Party and whipping up their own backbenchers in order to condemn the Valuation Office in Dublin for daring to come down to Donegal to increase valuations.  But when the motion was amended to read that the protest should be made to the Minister for Finance and a copy sent to the Valuation Office, they threw their hands up in horror and said: &ldquo;You cannot accuse the Minister for Finance of doing such a thing as this.&rdquo;  One Senator declared he found it difficult to explain to the people who voted for him&mdash;and who, no doubt, would support him again&mdash;that the Government had no hand, act or part in the valuation of their homes.  It is a known fact that the Valuation Office is the direct responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  Most Fianna Fáil councillors do not know the facts or are not properly conversant with public administration.  Some of them even tell you that the Blueshirts were part and parcel of the Fianna Fáil Rearguard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it was the Blueshirts, led by Eamon de Valera, who introduced politics into the local authorities.  This has been said by a prominent Fianna Fáil councillor in Donegal.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is amazed at such a statement. So am I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things in this Budget which pretend to help the people of Donegal when in fact the reverse is the case.  I was dealing with the new valuations on homes in Donegal.  I was pointing out that this is the direct responsibility of the Minister for Finance and that there is no relationship between the valuations on a home in Donegal and the valuations on homes in more densely populated <Col N="331" /> areas.  Seemingly, these officers, for reasons best known to themselves, think of a figure, measure the floor area with a yardstick and then come up with a valuation.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the agricultural grant.  I am sorry Deputy Crowley has left the House, because I notice in this morning's paper he is quoted as saying that certain farmers may receive up to £1,000 each year by way of rates abatement.  That is typical of the attitude of Fianna Fáil backbenchers at the moment.  No doubt they are inspired by more prominent Ministers in the Party and influenced by the faceless individuals of Taca.  Put the urban voter against the rural voter. This seems to be the password in the Fianna Fáil camp at the moment. Create a division between the farmers and the urban voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>How did you find out?  Our secret is out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary it was not by way of Parliamentary Question because, had I tabled one, I would have got the same answer as I usually get.  Deputy Crowley should be more honest when he makes such a statement.  He may be able to suggest with figures that it is possible for a farmer to receive abatement in his rates up to £1,000 a year; but if the agricultural land of this country were paying 100 per cent rates, how many people could be paid for staying on the land?  We would have a chaotic situation.  This is the only country in Western Europe which has rates on agricultural land.  Deputy Crowley might explain to the people of Bandon and mid-Cork, when he makes such an outrageous statement, that unless this abatement were given to the farmers, our main industry would collapse.  I certainly give no credit to the Minister for Finance for his supposed benefit to the agricultural community in derating up to £20 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless my information is incorrect, I understand the position to be that a small farmer who owns four or five small holdings with a total valuation of <Col N="332" /> £21 does not get the benefit of derating. It is not all holdings under £20 valuation but all holdings of the one rated occupier which come under £20 valuation. No one knows better than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle what this means for Donegal.  In Donegal you can have many smallholders under £20 valuation, but very few of them live out of their own holdings.  The holding is usually to supplement a business, a handicraft or a profession.  Indeed, the reverse can be the case, that the small holding is being supplemented by the owner earning a living in some other occupation.  Here is the situation from now on: if a holder has £25 valuation, he will get no benefit from the derating of agricultural land, although that £25 valuation could be made up of two, three or four small holdings, although his entire income could be coming from those holdings. On the other hand, a publican, a hotelier, a butcher, a grocer or any other businessman can buy a holding of £19 valuation and, because that is the only agricultural land he owns, benefit fully from the Budget, not to any great extent but to the tune of about £15 per year.</P>
    <P>I submit that the thinking of the Government has been wrong in this respect.  I forecast, and I accept the advice of the Taoiseach when he says we shall enter the European Economic Community in 1970 or in the early seventies, if and when we do, then all agricultural land must be derated. There is no time like the present.  A new system of taxation must be found: new economies must be effected, and savings must be obtained to provide for the derating of all agricultural land.  When stupid statements are made in this Parliament like that made by Deputy Crowley yesterday evening, that the agricultural holder could receive £1,000 by way of rates abatement, they tend to mislead and confuse the urban voter, when anything but that is the truth.  It is my belief that many smallholdings will now be bought by businessmen and by other people who are not earning their living out of agriculture.  All such land below £20 valuation will be free of rates, whereas the man who has an <Col N="333" /> agricultural holding of £60 valuation benefits to no extent whatsoever; in fact he will be paying more this year than in any previous year.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to introduce some amending regulations to make the agricultural employment allowance more equitable in the various counties.  For example, the £17 employment grant has the equivalent value of £12 PLV abatement in County Meath, and it has the equivalent value of a £10 PLV abatement in County Dublin, but because of the high rate in County Donegal, it has the equivalent value of only £6; in other words, the £17 employment allowance in Donegal is half the value it is in County Meath.  If the agricultural allowance is to be of any benefit to the agricultural community in Donegal, a new system should be devised in relation to the qualifying age limit, the details of which are somewhat involved, but they have been explained to the House times out of number.  I have raised this point on a number of occasions, and I think it would be the unanimous view of all Deputies, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour, that a more equitable solution should be found in relation to the £17 agricultural allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power spoke last week about inflation and how this great enemy of inflation attacked the First Programme for Economic Expansion and how it rocked the foundations of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, and he told the House why these things took place.  He astutely explained that these things were completely beyond the control of the Government, that international forces, the economic situation in Western Europe, the Presidential election in the USA, the upheaval within the Conservative Party in Great Britain, all tended to have an effect on the economic situation in this country.</P>
    <P>I sat listening to the Minister for Transport and Power, for, I am sure, two hours, and but for the tone of his voice, had I closed my eyes, I could have thought it was Deputy Dillon speaking about four years earlier than the Minister.  If one reached for the <Col N="334" /> Dáil Debates of last Wednesday evening and refrained from looking at the name of the Deputy appearing on the top left-hand corner of each page, I venture to say that the speech made by the Minister for Transport and Power in this House condemning the evils of inflation, and describing the acid effect it had on the policies programmed by the Government in their First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion, then it could be closely associated and identified with the speeches made by Leaders of the Fine Gael Party, and certainly by the late Deputy Norton.  I wonder&mdash;here I echo what Deputy Dillon said a month or so ago&mdash;what was the frame of mind of the Minister for Transport and Power, when he listened to and read the speeches of the prominent speakers of the Opposition Parties two or three years ago.  I wonder is that one of the reasons Deputy Smith resigned as Minister for Agriculture.  I wonder is it one of the reasons Deputy MacEntee indicated to the Supreme Soviet that he also was retiring.  I wonder had the former Deputy James Ryan similar ideas when he refused to serve in this 18th Dáil.  If those gentlemen were really honest with themselves and with the people who elected them, should they not have said at the time that the policies programmed by the Lemass administration were shortsighted and destined to lead us to the depths of financial disaster?</P>
    <P>I do not claim for one moment that I have any more ability than the average elected representative but, with the limited amount of intelligence I have, and with the limited amount of commonsence, it was, I think, comparatively easy to evaluate the worth of the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion initiated by the former Taoiseach.  In the past 12 months we have heard very little about either the First or the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. When I first entered public life six years ago, Fianna Fáil speakers were spouting from every soapbox they could find. explaining to the people this new device which Deputy Seán Lemass had discovered to provide 100,000 new <Col N="335" /> jobs, more homes for the homeless and more social welfare benefits for those who needed them.  That was called the Five Year Plan.  That was later rechristened the First Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Seán Dunne explained last week, the language used by Ministers in after-dinner speeches, at cumainn meetings and at every function to which Ministers of State were invited, particularly prior to by-elections or general elections, was really high-class English to explain in detail what it was hoped the effects would be of the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion, language five or six degrees above the level of the common vocabulary of the man-in-the-street. It sounded fine.  However, whenever a warning was given to the workers, the lowly-paid, as Deputy Seán Dunne said, common bog English was used to get the message across. Let there be no mistake about that; the average man was told in blunt English what was expected from him.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power shared no doubt many of the dinners provided and accepted many of the invitations extended to him, subsequently using up many a valuable inch of public print to explain in excellent English the implications and the advantages of these Programmes for Economic Expansion.  How many times has the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government explained outside this House the system by which the former Taoiseach would provide 100,000 new jobs?  How many times has he availed of the opportunity to explain the details of the Five Year Plan and the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion? How many times has he prevented himself from being led into uncharted waters?  How many times has he avoided being taken to task by people who disagreed with the policy of the Government and who asked awkward questions?  I do not know how many times he availed of opportunities or accepted invitations, but, in the past 12 months, not alone has Deputy Paudge Brennan declined to mention either <Col N="336" /> the First or the Second Programme for Economic Expansion but so has every other Minister and Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I wonder why?  Were these programmes all flights of fantasy?  Were they introduced, like this Budget, for the sake of political expediency rather than in the interests of the common good and of the nation as a whole?  Is there any significance in the fact that, prior to resuming this debate on the Budget, we were debating the Auctioneers Bill?  Are the Government now bidding for votes in the local elections? Is there any significance in the fact that the Government have promised to pay the old age pensioners and certain social welfare classes a 5/increase in August and other sections a 5/- increase from 1st January next? Is there any significance in the fact that this is a first bid and a second bid? When the local elections day dawns, I hope the people will remember what happened in Greater London and the answer the people there gave to the Labour administration, which made similar promises, made the same mistakes, and met with the same failures as this Government.</P>
    <P>Lest some Deputies may forget, as I would were it not for the fact that I stumble now and again on the propaganda disseminated by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1957 prior to the general election, I would like to remind the House that this was one of the main points of policy which brought Seán Lemass back into power as Tánaiste of this House, in the full knowledge that within two years the then Leader would be retiring to another part in Irish politics and he knew too well that unless he could match up to the then leader, the Fianna Fáil Party were doomed to failure.  He knew it was a one-man show and that without that great leader, the Party would collapse. My humble opinion, for what it is worth, is that nobody realised more clearly than Deputy Seán Lemass that he could not match up and the only way he could overcome it was to start talking in fast terms, making as many promises as he could, get the votes and then try to fulfil the promises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> One of the ways in which he could supersede this mythical figure and replace the magic which he apparently possessed was to talk in terms of five-year plans, of 100,000 new jobs, of &ldquo;Get your husbands out to work; bring your sons and daughters back from England&rdquo;.  These were the phrases which caught the imagination of the electorate, phrases which influenced public opinion and phrases, no doubt, which, due to circumstances prevailing then, were popular.  Had I not been a member of the Fine Gael Party then and had I been an open-minded individual, I possibly might have voted for Seán Lemass.  I know that many people in my constituency have admitted to me that because they were not associated with any political Party they were free to vote and they believed in giving Seán Lemass the chance he asked for.  He got that chance.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion were based on the same wavelength of political thought, to establish Seán Lemass as Taoiseach of this country in the hope that when the mythical figure would retire completely from public life, he might be in the position of the founder and saviour, the great industrial miracle worker of Irish economics, to be rewarded with the highest honour the Irish people could afford.  However, this was not to be, simply because his policies were more short-lived than even he thought they were.  The bubble burst about 12 months before he could be paid the reward he was aiming at.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon says, it was a gambler's Government, a Government who took calculated risks, a Government who held on to power for the sake of power.  It was a minority Government in 1961 which stayed in power by virtue of influence which controlled two individuals in this House. Nevertheless, that Government stayed in power to try to fulfil these policies. If we take the speech of the Minister for Transport and Power last week, the action of Deputy Smith when he resigned as Minister for Agriculture, the actions of Deputy MacEntee and the <Col N="338" /> former Deputy James Ryan&mdash;of these four senior members of the Government, one resigned, two refused to serve in this 18th Dáil and the one who stayed on now speaks with his tongue in his cheek condemning outside forces for their reacting on the economic structure of the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion&mdash; we must conclude that they at that time knew that their policies were shortsighted but that if they were honest with themselves, their Party and the public, the whole structure of the Fianna Fáil administration must collapse and their positions in public life would collapse.  Therefore, I feel that this was a gambler's Government led by a gambler.  There is nothing wrong, a Cheann Comhairle, in a gambler placing a bet.  There is nothing wrong with anybody gambling on certain odds, provided that the money he wagers is his own.  However, when the ratepayer and taxpayer are called on to foot the bill, I believe that stricter standards should be adopted when one comes to assess and judge the present administration.</P>
    <P>The local authority elections are on the horizon.  I sincerely hope the people will take into consideration the deeds, the successes, the failures, the entire works of this administration when judgment day arrives at the end of June and will tell this Government in no uncertain terms that it is time to quit, that new thinking must be put into government, that new approaches must be made, that a new field of thought must be developed, opened and expanded to provide better housing for the people who need it, better social benefits for the less well off, better health services for people who must live with possibly an incurable disease because they know that it means financial ruin if they seek help in some of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>My concept of social benefits in any democracy or any society is basically that society wants, desires and aims at providing better social services for the less well off in our society.  It is to me very sound and fundamental reasoning.  I believe it is a fundamental thought in man that he should provide for the generation <Col N="339" /> of his father and the generation of his grandfather.  I believe that it is a fundamental thought in man that he should provide for the person who cannot provide a living for himself.</P>
    <P>I believe that whenever a person votes for a Party or a Government, he expects that Party is aiming at furthering the ideas he has in mind.  To prove this point, allow me to submit that most of the social welfare benefits and most of the social welfare services provided at the moment were started by voluntary organisations.  We had the National Foresters and the AOH; we had different clubs in large industrial centres.  Even certain businesses undertook such work for their staff.  The Freemasons and the Orangemen all played their part.  While they differed fundamentally politically, while they were poles apart in thought, the natural instinct in them was to provide better social services and protection for the classes that needed them.  They banded themselves into their own organisations and subscribed so much a week to provide those services.  If the weekly subscription was not enough to provide benefits for the people in need of them, then the subscription was increased. After some time, Governments sat back and took notice that these voluntary associations had spotlighted a new service which was in fact the responsibility of government, which was, in fact, something that required a levy not alone on the people who were prepared to pay but on every ratepayer and taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the increases in taxation and rates.  I am convinced that nobody would object to giving an old age pension, irrespective of means, to all people attaining the age of 70 and, maybe later on, 65.  I believe that human nature rebels against the idea of an inspector or an investigation officer being sent by any Department of State &mdash;directly or indirectly being sent by the Government of the people, duly elected, indeed, by, in many cases, the people concerned or the people who rebel against this action&mdash;to probe into the personal background, financial and otherwise, of decent, honest-to-goodness <Col N="340" /> citizens who have worked hard to provide a living for themselves, their families and indeed, their families in turn.  When they reach the age of 70, because they tried to save, to put something away to protect themselves in their old age, it is held against them, by, as I say, in many cases, the Government whom they themselves, their husband, wife and family have supported since the foundation of this State.  I think this is wrong.  I pledge here and now that I will use every agitation at my command, within the framework of the Fine Gael organisation to try to change that situation.  If we are given government of this country, it will be my complete desire that an old age pension will be paid to a person irrespective of means when he or she attains the age of 70, and, maybe at a later date, 65.  I pledge myself in that regard not alone because I think it right but because I think most of the people, irrespective of class or politics, believe and think along those same lines.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I believe that health services should be provided for the sick, the needy and indeed for all those who demand them.  I use the same arguments to support that belief, namely, that, by voluntary effort, many groups, seeing the need to provide security for themselves and their colleagues, for their wives and families, banded themselves into voluntary associations and paid weekly subscriptions to protect themselves against sickness.  They forced the powers that were to take notice and to provide those services and to spread the cost equally over the entire community.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment wish to condemn any Minister for Health or any Minister for Social Welfare who has served the people of this country in the past 45 or 46 years.  I do not wish for a second to criticise them unduly for falling down on the job because these services for which I now ask are things which evolve rather than are designed.  They are services that must be perfected through trial and error.  They are services which must be perfected and increased by experience. I am quite satisfied that the Ministers <Col N="341" /> for Social Welfare and the Ministers for Health who served in this House before I came into it and, indeed, during my time here have tried in some way to improve the standards.  However, I accuse them of not doing enough and of being out of touch with the political trend of thought in this country if they still believe that an old age pension should be awarded on the basis of a means test or that certain individuals should be deprived of medical services which they have provided for, or their families before them have provided for, simply because they tried to save or because they were more energetic than their neighbour. This is fundamentally wrong in society. I shall expose it and defend my argument on any platform in this House or outside it.</P>
    <P>I pledge that every force at my command will be used within this House, within the framework of the Fine Gael organisation, to see that the day is not too distant when the majority, at least, of the Irish people will be afforded free medical services and social welfare benefits will not be awarded on the basis of a means test.</P>
    <P>One of the ironic situations here is that in relation to the Budget the Government altered the regulation concerning unemployment assistance, or what is commonly called the dole.  I cannot too strongly criticise the attitude of the present Administration in this regard. I know that what I am saying now will be used by members of the Fianna Fáil Party in Donegal to say: &ldquo;Harte is against paying the dole.&rdquo;  Harte is against any Government making common beggars out of decent, honest-to-goodness, hardworking people, because that, in fact, is the sum total of the results of dishing out the dole.</P>
    <P>I remember a meeting in the town of Buncrana about 12 months ago when a few public representatives were called together to protest against certain people in that area being in receipt of unemployment assistance, namely, the dole, who had motorcars and were working on the sly.  I understand that members of the Government Party were invited, but, unfortunately, the only members of the Government <Col N="342" /> Party who accepted the invitation were two local county councillors.  No Fianna Fáil Member of this House or of Seanad Éireann attended that meeting.  A question was put bluntly to me in the course of a short and simple address: &ldquo;Do you favour the dole or do you not?&rdquo; In other words: &ldquo;Now, Harte, Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators are not here and we cannot say to your supporters what they think of it.  We will tell our supporters what way you are thinking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the spur of the moment, I explained the situation like this.  Most of the dole being paid is being paid to recipients in the congested areas, in the west of Ireland&mdash;in west Donegal, and to a degree in east Donegal, but mainly in the west of Ireland.  When these people in the west of Ireland rebelled against a foreign Government 50 years ago, 100 years ago, 150 years ago, and for the past 700 years, there was no dole.  There were no benefits and it could not be said to them: &ldquo;Stay there and we will give you so much but remember to vote for Fianna Fáil at the next election.&rdquo;  That is what the dole means. The strange thing is that there were four times as many people living there when this alien Government were paying them nothing.</P>
    <P>In those times if you did not work for a living you ended up in the work-house. In spite of working for a living and protesting against an alien Government telling them how to run the country, strangely enough, that alien Government provided them with a market for their produce.  They had an incentive to work and earn a living. The only excuse this Government can offer to these people&mdash;and the population is now one quarter what it was 50 years ago&mdash;is: &ldquo;We have failed to provide markets to allow you to make a decent living for your wives and your families, but we are paying you dole, and when it comes to election time, if you do not vote for us we will withdraw the dole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Someone said in this House during this debate&mdash;and another very noble Irishman said it some 50 odd years ago&mdash;that they have purchased half our people and now they have intimidated <Col N="343" /> the other half.  This is an indication of the need for the organisation called Taca.  This is all part and parcel of the political thinking of the Fianna Fáil administration which we must tolerate in this day and age.  There is no progressive thinking in the Budget.  It is simply a bid for votes in the local elections.  Its prime purpose is not to increase the productivity of the nation but to perpetuate an administration that is there much too long.  I have not got the answer as to how we should get rid of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In the late 1930s, the big power in Western Europe was Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.  One insignificant individual, one of the backroom boys of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, was Dr. Josef Goebbels.  His only function in that administration was in relation to propaganda.  He succeeded so well that he convinced what I can rightly describe as the nation with the highest degree of education, and with the strongest economy in Western Europe, that Adolf Hitler's policies were correct.  The whole basis of his argument was that if you tell a lie often enough, and if you tell a lie big enough, the people must believe you.</P>
    <P>I do not compare this administration with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany but I cannot help remembering the slogans such as: &ldquo;Get your husbands out to work.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bring your sons and daughters back from England.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Get the wheels of industry turning.&rdquo;, &ldquo;One hundred thousand new jobs.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do not turn back the clock.&rdquo;  That was all propaganda. Was this propaganda formulated by a backroom boy in Taca?  Was it formulated by one of the nameless ones none of the backbench Members of the Fianna Fáil Government knows exist?  Was it formulated by the straightforward thinking of a group of Fianna Fáil Deputies, who, I have no doubt, are sincere and honest-to-goodness individuals but who are being used by people in high places for sinister purposes?</P>
    <P>Just as the régime of Adolf Hitler collapsed, so too is the day of reckoning <Col N="344" /> fast approaching for the Fianna Fáil Government.  When that hour arrives and when they take their proper place on this side of the House, not alone will they have collapsed but they will disappear completely from the political scene.  The Minister for Finance smiles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears funny to Taca and to the Minister for Finance; it appears funny to any person who has no financial or social worries, but it is not at all funny to the person who has to wait five or six years for a house, to the woman who has her pension rights taken away because her husband went to England and earned a contributory pension and who is fined because the British Government increased the pension.  I hope that before the Minister for Finance opens his mouth again, he will ponder for a moment on the plight of the less well off sections in our community. One of the benefits in this Budget which the Minister has proclaimed is the provision of free electricity and free public transport for the old age pensioners.  He conveys to these unfortunate people that they should kneel down and thank him for his kindness but I give the Minister no credit for this scheme.  Deputies in the Fine Gael Party, particularly Deputy P. Byrne, and a few of the Labour Deputies, have been advocating this since I came into the House and, I am told, had been doing so for many years before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us picture the situation.  Many of us walk down O'Connell Street or along Talbot Street or Grafton Street <Col N="345" /> and see virtually every bus passing half empty.  At the same time, you will see an old age pensioner carrying two bags and walking down the street because she cannot afford to take the bus.  Not only is that the situation and not only does she spend little enough on herself, but in addition she is paying taxes to send that bus down the street empty.  CIE is being subsidised to the tune of £3 million per year.  This provision of free transport to old age pensioners should have been made many years ago.  It would have been done if a different Party had been in Government.  This is something against which every member of the Fianna Fáil Party voted when Private Members tabled motions to provide what the Minister now proposes in his Budget.  It is easy to imagine how the Minister must have been impressed on occasion&mdash;and this may sound funny also to him&mdash;when he floated down Kildare Street, along Pearse Street, heading for O'Connell Street in his Mercedes and saw the number of old people walking along carrying bags on their way home.  I wonder how many times did his driver have to sound the horn to warn the drivers of the empty buses to get out of his way.  It is an unChristian situation &mdash;public transport being subsidised by the ratepayers and old people unable to use it because they have not got the bus fare.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies in the rural areas.  Most of the public service vehicles pass by with one, two or three people in them.  Local motorists pull up at the boreens or at the street corners and inquire: &ldquo;Madam, do you want a lift home?&rdquo; An old man or an old woman has to depend on a free lift to get home or to arrive at his or her destination.  Very often you find that old lady or old man with a walking stick plodding through the rain and mud and being splashed by a public service vehicle flying past with two or three passengers in it.  Not alone should old age pensioners be provided with this free transport but so also should people travelling to or from a hospital, dispensary or any other building or on any business in connection with a service <Col N="346" /> to which they are entitled free of charge by the local authority.  I hope the Minister will make it clear that not alone are the people who use the public highways, the main arteries of transport, entitled to free public transport but that he will live up to his reputation of generosity and provide transport for those who have to walk two or three miles to a main road for public transport.  These are old people and perhaps there are only a few dozen in County Donegal but there are more of them in the city of Dublin and when an election comes they are the people who can be fooled most easily, the people for whom Fianna Fáil cars call five minutes before polling commences on election morning.  They are the people the Fianna Fáil mafia spot-light and mark their names with a red X in every register of electors and advise their key workers about &ldquo;old Mary So-and-so&rdquo; and &ldquo;old Johnny So-and-so&rdquo; who do not think too clearly.  Their votes count just as much as those of the smartest men paying their £100 to Taca when the ballot-boxes are opened.</P>
    <P>I have tried to explain to the House that this Budget was designed more from the point of view of political expediency than in the national interest and to explain&mdash;successfully I hope to the House and even more successfully to the people of my constituency&mdash;why these apparent benefits appear in the Budget and what they actually mean in terms of real money or generosity or clear thinking on the part of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to your ruling, but I should like to say that where service charges and rents for meters arise a very nominal amount is added to the total figure through actual consumption of electricity and that in many cases it costs more to disconnect and restore the current than the total bill owed by the customer. I ask the House not to be gulled into the idea that there is any real benefit in this for old age pensioners because these people use a very minute amount of electricity out of the national grid.</P>
      <P>The motto of the present Fianna Fáil administration seems to be not &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo; but &ldquo;To hell or to Coventry&rdquo;, because emigration has increased, employment has dropped, unemployment has increased, taxation has increased, rates have increased. We have had every organised group in the country protesting during the past four or five years against this maladministration.  We have had not only individuals emigrating but we have had them taking their wives and families with them because not alone can they not get work here but they cannot obtain living accommodation. The trend, therefore, is not to hell or to Connacht but to hell or to Coventry.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister for Finance &mdash;perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would take a note of it&mdash;to nail a rumour in relation to the derating of agricultural land.  In many cases the £33 grading will in fact benefit ratepayers only to the extent of devaluation of 8/- in the £.  I understand the £20 agricultural grant, which was calculated at eight-tenths until now, has been interfered with, readjusted so that people with a £33 valuation now will benefit only to the tune of 8/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the last Budget we have a new <Col N="350" /> Taoiseach and during the interval between the time Deputy Lemass announced he no longer wished to serve as Taoiseach and the evening on which the present Taoiseach announced he was a runner, many things were said and many rumours were loud in the lobbies and corridors of this House, in the city and throughout the length and breadth of the country, that the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, doubted the loyalty of certain Ministers.  This rumour has reflected itself in the happenings since the election of Deputy Lynch.  In a few words the Taoiseach has agreed that there is a difference of opinion in his Cabinet.  That is natural &mdash;it happens in every Cabinet.  I opened my remarks today by saying that in Stormont Mr. O'Neill had sacked Mr. West.  I hope the Taoiseach will give full warning, that he will be strong enough to sack any Minister in his Cabinet who happens to be doing something which is not in the national interest.  We know there has been a split in the Cabinet.  We know the split has been sealed up and mended but we know that old sores can break out again.  As surely as I am speaking, certain Ministers in the Cabinet are jockeying for position lest, perhaps, the present Taoiseach ceases to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of course he did this in an effort to bring about confusion in the minds of the public. <Col N="351" /> He tried to get public thinking away from the fact that this is a good Budget.  Despite what Deputy Harte has said, it is accepted as such by the public throughout the country.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Harte and the Fine Gael Party in general.  The Deputy made every effort to justify their action in voting against the many concessions provided in the Budget, and in order to confuse the issue, mentioned many other things, Taca among them, as if Taca were something we in Fianna Fáil were ashamed of.</P>

      <P>I can tell Deputy Harte and the other Fine Gael Deputies, as well as members of the Labour Party, that we are not in any way ashamed of Taca or any such organisation.  Like the majority of the Irish people, Taca realise that the future of this country depends on Fianna Fáil.  For that reason any group of people or the majority of the people throw in their lot with Fianna Fáil realising it is in the interests of the Irish nation to do so.  We are not ashamed of those people.  We are proud of them.  Nobody who supports Fianna Fáil has been given any concession to which he was not entitled.  We have always been honest in our approach to the people, but the Fine Gael Party, in their efforts to justify the fact that they voted against the concessions to the social welfare class&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They may say it is not true but is it not true that we must have the necessary finance to give any concessions?  They voted against the provision of the necessary finance when they voted against Resolution No. 3. Of course the people did not expect anything else from that Party.  The people have come to realise that Fine Gael have no interest whatsoever in the weakest section of the community. In this respect Fine Gael have a very bad record.  We on this side have a record of which we can be proud. <Col N="352" /> Deputy Harte regretted the fact that old Johnny so-and-so and old Mary so-and-so in Donegal voted for Fianna Fáil in the past and will again in the future.  He seemed disappointed about this.  The fact is, of course, that old Johnny so-and-so and old Mary so-and-so, as he described them, and other old people can recall the days when the Fine Gael Party, then known as Cumann na nGaedheal, reduced the old age pension from 10/- to 9/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The leopard does not change his spots.  We had Fine Gael in coalition with the Labour Party during a period of six years&mdash;two of three years each&mdash;and during that period the average increase given to one section of the social welfare class was 10d a year.  The people remembered this and that is why old Johnny so-and -so and old Mary so-and-so have voted for Fianna Fáil and will continue to do so, and that is why Deputy Harte's Party have not, and never will have, their support.</P>
      <P>As I said, the social welfare classes did not expect that Fine Gael would support the many concessions given to them in this Budget, which included the 5/- increase to this section, the free transport on CIE and the free electricity. Those are benefits which we were proud to give to those people.  We could understand Fine Gael not giving support to this particular section but it is very hard to understand why they voted against the concessions given to the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to understand this because throughout the year Fine Gael have been describing the small farmers as the backbone of this country and as people to whom Fianna Fáil were not giving worthwhile concessions.  Of course, the fact of the matter is that any concessions the farming community have got have been given to them <Col N="353" /> by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Here we have the greatest concession of all for the small farmers, that is, the derating of agricultural land up to £20 valuation and under and on a sliding scale up to £33 valuation.  The Fine Gael Party have said that this concession is not a great one.  They point to the fact that people with a valuation of £20 and under already have 80 per cent of their rates contributed by the State. That is so but it must be remembered that this is also a concession Fianna Fáil gave to the farmers.  Now we have gone the full way and we have given complete derating of agricultural land up to £20 valuation.  Like all the other concessions this Government have given, we had to give it in the teeth of Fine Gael opposition.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that we are falling down on the housing of our people.  I would like to point out that as far as my own constituency is concerned, South Tipperary and West Waterford, we built more houses during the past year than were built in any of the years the Coalition Government were in office.  Again, this Budget provides more money for that very essential purpose.  We know there is a scarcity of houses and that there were many vacant houses in 1956.  We had vacant houses then because people had emigrated.  Today, under Fianna Fáil, the population is increasing, the standard of living is improving and for that reason there is need to build more and more houses.  This is something we are doing and is something on which we are not getting any help from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have every reason to be disappointed with this Budget, coming as it did at the end of a year in which they said this country was bust, that we had no money for this, that or the other.  We were delighted to find, despite what was said, that the Minister for Finance had a surplus at the end of the year.  This is something the Opposition find very hard to swallow.  They are going out of their way to confuse the public and to try to create an air of gloom.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have always spoken in the past as if this country were <Col N="354" /> doomed and had no future.  Our thinking is entirely different.  We believe in the future of this country and in its expansion.  While we have given many concessions to the small farming community, I believe the only real help to be given to the really small farmer is to enlarge his farm by giving him more land.  For this purpose I would limit the number of acres any one individual could hold.  I am not going into that on this debate but it is something which I would advocate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte mentioned that there was disunity in the Fianna Fáil ranks. I can assure him, as a backbencher of Fianna Fáil, that there is no disunity whatsoever, that we are indeed a united Party working in the interests of the Irish nation.  He also mentioned that we had a new Taoiseach during the year.  Indeed we had.  Our former Taoiseach retired after a lifetime dedicated to the service of this country.  Now we have a new Taoiseach who is getting on with the job of building Ireland into the country we would like it to be.  He forgot to mention that since the last general election we had two by-elections in which the people of the constituencies of South Kerry and Waterford voted their confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government.  Indeed, I can say that their confidence has been fully justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Budget time was traditionally a time when the public were interested to discover what concessions were being given and how it was proposed to give incentives to production and reduce the cost of living.  I have been approximately 18 years a Member of this House and for the first eight years I was here, I remember the excitement at Budget time about what would come off cigarettes and tobacco and by how much petrol would be reduced.  We had successive Budgets doing the very things that were expected.  In 1956 I remember the President of Ireland, sitting in that seat there, as Leader of the Opposition saying, during the course of the Budget debate: &ldquo;We have reached the limit of taxation in this country&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what is the same gentleman thinking today when he examines <Col N="355" /> the taxation figures imposed on the Irish people as a result of the recent Budget?  The Budget is not the only thing that is blistering the Irish people.  We have many budgets throughout the country in the estimates for rates for the coming year.  One of the serious objections taken to the 1956 Budget was the levies imposed by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, on what was described as luxury imports in order to correct the balance of payments.  I remember Deputy Sweetman giving an undertaking in this House that those levies were merely temporary and that as soon as possible they would be withdrawn. In the meantime he said that the moneys collected from the levies would be put into a special fund for capital development.</P>
    <P>I remember the attacks made on Deputy Sweetman in this House for his audacity, first of all, in imposing those levies.  What has happened since? Those levies have now been woven into the permanent pattern of taxation by the present Government. There is no mention whatsoever of their being withdrawn.  What do the Fianna Fáil Party who attacked Deputy Sweetman at that time for introducing those levies, think today when they see their own Minister for Finance not only perpetuating the levies but using them for the purpose for which they were never intended, namely, for current capital expenditure as distinct from capital investment?</P>
    <P>Again, we hear a lot of talk about the magnificent success of the prize bonds scheme.  So it is.  In my opinion it is an ideal way of securing investment in capital in this country.  I wonder do Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the frontbenchers, who were in this House ten years ago, or rather who were not in this House ten years ago, remember what the Minister for Social Welfare said about Prize Bonds?  Do they remember what the Minister for Social Welfare said about the Prize Bonds? Do they remember the speech by Deputy J. Brennan in this House when he deplored the introduction of Prize Bonds and said that we were going <Col N="356" /> to run the country on raffles?  It sounded well at the time.  What does the Minister for Finance think of the raffles today?  I think he is damned glad to have them.  Were it not for the fact that Deputy Sweetman thought out that scheme of Prize Bonds, there would be a dearth of finance for capital investment in this country.  So the raffle has rolled on and has now become a success and Deputy Brennan, the present Minister for Social Welfare, told us the other day how proud he was to be able to secure some small concessions from the Minister for Finance for distribution among the recipients of social welfare.</P>
    <P>When we come to examine the Budget, apart from doles which are being dished out, where is the incentive for production in it?  That is one of the things I always look for in a Budget, incentives to production.  Let us take the small farmer and let me say at this stage that I personally welcome any concessions given to the small farmers; as I welcome any concessions given to the old age pensioners or the unfortunate person out of employment. I welcome all these concessions, but is there any incentive for the small farmer to increase production?</P>
    <P>We are reducing the burden of his rates and saying to him: &ldquo;That may induce you to stay on the land,&rdquo; but have we given him any capital incentive to increase production?  The small farmer of £20 valuation or under, up to the present enjoyed 80 per cent derating.  As the last speaker from Waterford pointed out, the additional 20 per cent is now being abolished.  Do not forget that Fine Gael advocated some two or three years ago that there should be complete derating up to £25 poor law valuation and the Government said it was absolutely impossible, that it could not be done.</P>
    <P>We now know how they did it.  They got the idea from the Fine Gael policy, but, in the meantime, they found a method of procuring the money.  They sent inspectors from the Valuation Office around the country and every farmer who did the slightest improvement, who carried out the slightest improvement on his farm buildings, his <Col N="357" /> out-offices of his dwellinghouse had his valuation increased.  I guarantee that any farmer with a poor law valuation of £20 and with any sort of reasonable dwellinghouse on his farm will pay as much in rates this coming year as he paid last year.  In my own county, for instance, rates have gone up by over 5/- in the £.  Admittedly, there has been a 20 per cent reduction by way of derating on agricultural land but the valuations have gone up plus an increase in rates and there will be very few farmers indeed who will pay less in rates in the coming year than they paid last year.</P>
    <P>I remember when the former Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance, wanted to give concessions to the farmers, he tackled it in a completely different way.  He subsidised fertilisers and ground limestone and made available capital for reclamation, drainage and other such schemes.  That was an incentive to production as distinct from a dole to placate the farmer and to persuade him to remain on the land.  There is no doubt if we enter the Common Market, and I pray God we will, one of the things we have to offer, our principal contribution, to the Common Market must be agriculture.  Are we geared for that at the moment?  Is there anything in this Budget, any incentive, to the farmers to increase production in anticipation of our entering the Common Market?  I fail to see it.</P>
    <P>This is a Budget, in so far as I am concerned, and in so far as the farmers are concerned, which merely asks people to hold on and hope that things will turn out all right.  The method, as I have said before, of incentive to increase production was a better method than this method of dole.  I can call it nothing else.  There is a rates remission of 20 per cent.  It is something which we wanted because it eases the burden on the farmer but then an incentive to production together with the easing of the burden is something which would be very good.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have advocated increased pensions for social welfare recipients and we welcome the increase given but we say it should have been given from the date of the Budget and not from a <Col N="358" /> date later in the year.  It is a peculiar coincidence that this year resembles last year in many ways.  Last year we had a Presidential election; this year we have local elections.  Last year we had two Budgets; this year we will have two Budgets.  We had ante- and post-election Budgets.  You will remember the ante-election Budget: it was not too bad.  One of the things said was that the old age pensioner was to get an extra 5/-.  When we came to examine that additional 5/- which was to be given to the old age pensioners, how many of them got it? When the Minister for Social Welfare was pressed, he informed us that that 5/- was merely for old age pensioners without means.  When we came to examine what &ldquo;without means&rdquo; meant, some of us got a shock.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, Sir, you will excuse me if I mention one case I know of a person looking for the additional 5/-.  He had an intestacy interest in a four-acre farm on Tory Island.  Wherever he will derive benefit from an intestacy interest in Tory Island beats me, but he had an intestacy interest there, on the barren rocks of Tory Island, and I am sorry to say that a man from my own county, the present Minister for Social Welfare, said that this pensioner could be classified as a man with means and would not qualify for the additional 5/- in old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has told us that old age pensioners will have free electricity; in other words, he said that the fixed charge will be abolished and they will have the first 100 units of electricity free.  We examined that carefully and found out that it applies only to old age pensioners living alone. One must live alone to procure any benefit from the Budget in so far as electricity is concerned.</P>
    <P>You see the dishonesty of these statements.  At first glance, one would imagine that this was a magnificent scheme whereby all old age pensioners will have free electricity, but, as I said, when we examined it, we find they have to live alone.  How many old people over 70 years of age can live alone?  If they even bring in some distant relative to look after them and <Col N="359" /> to reside with them, they are barred from free electricity.</P>
    <P>Again we were told the old age pensioner would get free transport from CIE.  It looks magnificent but, when we examine it, we find they will get free transport, except at peak hours.  You can imagine a poor old age pensioner standing above on the South Circular Road waiting for a bus and being told: &ldquo;Ah, this is a peak hour.&rdquo;  There is a big influx into the bus; there is a football match somewhere on the south side of the city or, on the north side, a football match in Dalymount or Croke Park, and &ldquo;You cannot have your free ride today; call again brother&rdquo;.  These are the dishonest statements contained in this Budget, statements which when we examine them, do not give us the true picture of the benefits alleged to be bestowed on these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>Talking about unfortunates, the Minister for Finance is treasurer of two organisations: in addition to being treasurer of the people's purse, he is treasurer of an organisation called Gorta, the Freedom from Hunger organisation which collects pennies to assist the hungry in under-cultivated and starving countries&mdash;a very worthy project.  But he is also treasurer of another organisation, of which he should be ashamed, that is Taca. What a difference in the two classes of people catered for by these organisations: the hungry, seeking the pennies to feed them; the other, the hungry for power, seeking £100 per plate for finance to feed their hunger.  I am told on good authority, whether it is £100 per plate or per dinner, that you are handed a banker's order for six years; you are expected to sign it and contribute your £100 annually for a period of six years and that you cannot possibly get out of it.  That is pure blackmail, nothing else.  What a contrast: the Minister for Finance as treasurer of Taca and the Minister for Finance as Treasurer of Gorta.  I shall not say any more about it but it is something for which he certainly deserves no credit.</P>
    <P>One of the main sources of revenue this country, is taxation on <Col N="360" /> spirits.  It has been the traditional method of taxation since the early days of the century but there is such a thing as breaking the camel's back by the last straw and I am afraid the additional taxation the Minister has now imposed on spirits will not bring in the revenue he anticipates. Spirits were very heavily taxed last year and I understand that the consumption or sale of spirits last year fell by 50,000 proof gallons.  If that continues, we shall have to find some alternative method of procuring excise to balance our Budget.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael always believed that our three main industries were agriculture, fisheries and tourism. Let us look at these three industries and see what incentives are given in the Budget to increased activity in those fields.  What incentive is there in the Budget to an increase in the fishing industry or to encourage the equitable distribution of fish at a reasonable price throughout the State? I respectfully say there is none.  I know the amount of good that could be done by making available moneys for the building and purchase of bigger boats. Quite recently, in my own county, two magnificent fishing trawlers were procured by young men in Killybegs but they had to depend on a French hire purchase company for the capital for these boats, which were built in France.  Would it not be much better if these boats could be built in this country and if capital concessions could be made to the builders.  so that they could be sold to Irish fishermen at a reasonable price and at a nonexorbitant rate of interest?  I shall not go into detail&mdash;because it is a matter which can be dealt with more appropriately on the Estimate&mdash;but I would like to say that sufficient moneys are not being made available in this Budget, in view of the decreasing value of money, for the development of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>Then, again, take afforestation.  I remember that when the first inter-Party Government came into power, we were planting something in the region of 4,000 acres per year in this State and the inter-Party Government set a target of 25,000 acres.  It was not <Col N="361" /> a very high target but still it was a big improvement on 4,000 acres, and they geared the industry to reach that target in a few years.  I am very glad to say that the present Government continued on the basis of that target of 25,000 acres for a few years&mdash;it was reached a few years ago&mdash;but last year the target was dropped from 25,000 to 23,000 acres.  That was a retrograde step; it was not progressive for I note that it is proposed to step up the acreage to 25,000 again.  But, instead of bringing it up to the level the inter-Party Government anticipated, it should, in my opinion, have been considerably increased.  At the moment, if it were for nothing but the labour content, it would be a most useful method of retaining workmen in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We welcome the provision for tourism, as we welcome anything that is good in this Budget.  I welcome the provision for farmhouse holidays, whereby grants will be made available to farmers to enable them to bring their houses up to the standard of guest-houses, to which visitors may come and spend a holiday, because I do believe that a holiday in a farmhouse is something a city person would be very glad to take advantage of as being most beneficial.  Unfortunately, our climate is such that we cannot offer the beach life or facilities we could offer if we had more sunshine. I believe that a good healthy holiday in farm surroundings is difficult to beat.  That is my candid opinion.  I believe we can attract more and more tourists from across the water who would be most anxious to enjoy the hospitality offered by the farmer and his wife, particularly in the form of home farm produce.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the farmers who apply for these grants will not suffer the frustration that guesthouse owners and hotels suffer in seeking grants for the improvement of their premises&mdash;the delay, the grandiose schemes and the red tape.  No person knows better than a farmer himself what amenities he should provide in his house.  I believe that if he provides the amenity of running water and sanitation, <Col N="362" /> a clean bed and good farm produce, his visitors will go away completely satisfied.</P>
    <P>In attracting tourists to this country, we should look much more to the east and less to the west.  Britain can supply a far greater influx of tourists than America.  While Americans are welcome here, the English tourist is much more beneficial to the country generally. We should therefore spend more of our tourist propaganda funds in Britain.  Every effort should be made to encourage tourists from the Common Market countries to visit here, and we should make available to them the amenities they seek&mdash;coarse fishing, sea fishing and such other pastimes, pleasures and hobbies as they require.</P>
    <P>Senator Dr. Ryan, in introducing his first Budget here as Minister for Finance in 1957, got a cheer and a clap from the Fianna Fáil Party when he announced he was setting up a commission of inquiry into the working of the Civil Service.  He went on to explain that he thought the Civil Service was overloaded, that there should be a reduction in the number of civil servants and that he proposed to set up the inquiry for that purpose.  Mark you, he got a cheer not only from the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil but from all around the House.</P>
    <P>The latest date in respect of which I could procure figures for the Civil Service is 16th March, 1966, nine years after the proposed inquiry was mentioned by the then Minister.  On 1st January, 1957, the number of civil servants was 30,723.  On 3rd January, 1966, that number had risen to 32,626 &mdash;and it is marked provisional&mdash;almost 2,000 more than ten years previously. The remuneration of civil servants had jumped from £15.26 million to £27.45 million.  I never heard what became of the inquiry but those are the figures, <i>ipse loquitur:</i> it speaks for itself.  We hear no mention in this Budget of any effort whatever to curb the numbers of the Civil Service.  Something could and should be done about it.  The Minister, being new in his Department, should take the initiative in this matter and endeavour to reduce the number of civil servants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> Again, it was last year or the year before that the Minister for Finance told us he was going to endeavour to reduce the rates burden and to find some alternative method, particularly in regard to the western counties, in order to reduce the burden of rates. Nothing has been done about it.  On reading the estimates over the past two months, we find that the estimate for rates in all the western counties has increased by almost 25 per cent in the £, which is considerable.  But no new thinking has been given to this matter.</P>
    <P>Some time ago Deputy T.F. O'Higgins suggested that the health services should be taken from the local exchequer and made a country at large charge.  He said it could be done by a contribution from the employer, the employee and the State.  That suggestion was tabooed by Fianna Fáil, although the present Minister for Health said some time ago it was worthy of consideration and he would look into it.  The time to look into that is before the rates are struck and before a Budget is introduced, so that something good may be secured for the unfortunate ratepayer.  I believe health services are costing the rates in the neighbourhood of 32/- in the £.  I was in this House when Dr. Ryan, the then Minister for Health, introduced the Health Act and told us it would cost approximately 2/- in the £.  If the Minister for Health is going to have a look at it, this is the time to do it, before the national bill for the year is totted up and before the local rates have been struck.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister for Education announced free transport for all children attending secondary and technical schools.  Quite recently I have had letters from him saying his decision in this matter in respect of certain areas has been postponed until 1st September.  That is typical of the promises of the present Minister.  When he was Minister for Health, he promised us a free health service.  He has left that scheme in abeyance in such a way that many dispensary districts at the moment have not got dispensary <Col N="364" /> doctors.  Then he announced, as Minister for Education, a free school transport scheme, free education in secondary schools and, the latest, the marriage of two universities.</P>
    <P>I do not see any provision in the Estimates for this shotgun marriage&mdash; incidentally a marriage which I, personally, welcome very much indeed. I do not see any provision for it in the Minister's Budget.  The Budget has been introduced before the Minister made his announcement.  Surely an announcement of such importance to the State would not have been made overnight, without due consideration having been given to it, which the Minister said was given to it at Government level?  If that is so, some provision should have been made in the Budget for whatever moneys to which this marriage may commit the State.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned local rates and national taxation.  The ESB is another quasi-State body which is causing a blister on consumers.  We all know about the increases which have been imposed during the past year and of the lack of incentive to consumers to take advantage of this amenity of light and power which should be given to them and of which they should make more use.  I wonder if these quasi-State bodies like CIE and the ESB do not deserve more attention by Government auditors, or should consultants be called in to advise on the more economic running of these bodies.  It is most peculiar that CIE has a monopoly of road transport and road haulage, and never appears to be a paying concern.  In my county, Donegal, the monopoly in the greater part of the county is given to a very small company known as the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. They run without Government subsidy of any description and give an amenity to the most remote parts of the county.  They give, in my opinion, one of the best services in this State, and each year they are able to pay a dividend of five per cent.</P>
    <P>I often wonder would it have been worth while to send some of our top-ranking executives to Donegal to find out how the Londonderry and Lough <Col N="365" /> Swilly Railway Company can so economically run their transport services and set a headline for the rest of the country.  From inquiries I have made, I have found they have not had a strike for years.  I hear no great outcries against their charges.  Their personnel are more than content in their employment, and certainly their shareholders should be with a dividend of five per cent.</P>
    <P>While we all welcome quasi-State bodies, we should not just accept them as such.  We should ensure that they are more than a social service.  If looked after properly, they might become an economic proposition. Having established them with the public purse, we have been tempted to hand them over to public servants to run them, without due regard to the know-how of those public servants.  I am not here to criticise individuals and I do not wish to do so.  Some of the persons who are the top executives of the quasi-State companies are my best friends and men for whom I have nothing but respect.  However, while they may be top-class in their own sphere, merely on their educational qualifications, they have been pushed into jobs of which they have no technical knowledge, and the ratepayers funds are&mdash;I would not say deliberately squandered&mdash;not being spent in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, when Budgets are introduced here, two of the topics usually referred to in passing, if I may say so, are the restoration of the Irish language and the Border.  This Budget is notable for the fact that neither is mentioned.  Now that I do come to mention the Border, may I refer to a very subtle move which the Government carried out prior to the coming into force of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain?  For some considerable time before 1st July last it was apparent&mdash;and the Government knew&mdash;that this Free Trade Area Agreement was about to be entered into, but a short time before that, the Revenue Commissioners, at the behest of the Government, stepped up the duty on many imports which were to be reduced by ten per cent as on and from 1st July last.  Had those original <Col N="366" /> duties remained static instead of being stepped up, these commodities would now be imported into this country much cheaper than they are, with the result that we would have a greater outcry about the loss of employment in Dunlops and many other concerns throughout the State.  The Government resorted to this subtle method of evading the actual terms of the Trade Agreement with Britain.  I do not think I should go into it any further in case it would have repercussions. but it was a mean trick; it was one that should not have been resorted to, and it was a most misleading trick so far as the people of this country are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is nothing further I wish to say on the Budget other than to repeat what I said at the beginning, that there is no incentive in it.  There is absolutely no incentive to the farmer, merely a dole to him to say: &ldquo;Stay put and hope for the best.&rdquo;  There is no incentive to the industrialist. While we welcome the concessions given to the recipients of social welfare benefits, there is no more incentive in it to any person to produce more to add to the total national income of the State than there was after the second Budget last year.  I describe this Budget merely as I described the first Budget of last year, an ante-election Budget, and God look to us when the post-election Budget comes to us next October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to this debate over the past two weeks.  I want to compliment the Minister for Finance on the manner in which he introduced his first Budget.  I want also to compliment the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party on making available the necessary moneys to give to the needy section of our community the benefits which they deserve, and which they have been receiving over a long number of years from the Fianna Fáil Government.  Because of lack of money, we were unable to give these people the increases everyone believes they should get and I hope this is but the beginning of further increases for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Fine Gael speakers because there is no doubt that they <Col N="367" /> all welcome the increases given in this Budget to the social welfare classes. Despite that, however, when it came to voting for the taxation necessary to implement these increases, Fine Gael went into the division lobby and voted against, thereby giving people to understand that they are against these increases for social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>With regard to the old age pensioners, ours is a young State and we have never been able to give them all the assistance we would like to give them.  So long as Fianna Fáil remain in office, however, it will be our duty to allocate all the money we can to help the aged, the infirm and the necessitous amongst us.  The worker of today will be the pensioner of tomorrow and any contribution he makes now towards pensions for the less well-off will be returned one-hundredfold when he himself comes to draw a pension.</P>
    <P>I am glad Fine Gael speakers welcomed these increases though there were quite a number of &ldquo;buts&rdquo; and &ldquo;ands&rdquo;.  Reference was made to the date of implementation.  Fine Gael forget their short term in office during which the old age pensioners were pushed aside.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of free electricity for old age pensioners. That will certainly be a boon in rural districts.  It will of course benefit the city pensioner, too, but the position of the latter is never quite so desolate as may be the position of the pensioner in rural areas.  Pensioners in the city do not lack society: pensioners in the country may live remote from centres of population.</P>
    <P>Free travel is a definite benefit.  It will be interesting to discover what exactly are the peak hours.  We all have our own ideas about this.  Deputy P. O'Donnell raised an interesting point when he asked if busy days, days on which there is a big match, the Spring Show, or something like that, will be regarded as peak travel hours.  Will there be days such as this on which old age pensioners will not be able to avail of free transport?  If there is any difficulty, I am sure it will be overcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> The Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on making another £5 million available for agriculture. Opposition Deputies have asked where will this £5 million go. How will the farmer derive any benefit from it?  Having agricultural inclinations myself, I fully appreciate the benefits the farmer will derive.  Complete derating on valuations up to £20 will be a tremendous advantage to the small farmer, particularly the small farmer in the West.  I believe this is welcomed by the farming community generally.</P>
    <P>The merger between Erin Foods and Heinz will be another great advantage.  It has been said that, as a result of this merger, the agricultural community will be in a better position in future from the point of view of producing more vegetables.  That will be an advantage, but, if it is to be availed of to the full, some assistance will have to be given to farmers to enable them to purchase fertilisers. There is a grant in operation but that grant is not being directed to the farmer.  It is absorbed by the manufacturers. Last year there was a fertiliser, 8668, selling at £22 per ton. Now there is a new fertiliser, known as 10-10-20 which is selling at £32 a ton.  The farmer will produce the same amount but at a dearer price.  Costs of production in agriculture have increased so much that it is difficult to visualise the farmer paying this increased price for fertiliser without some assistance from the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  I have already consulted a number of trade unions regarding a proposal from one local authority which would lead to greater co-ordination of nursing activities within the hospital.  Objections to the proposal have been made by one union but the reasons for the objections are not clear and I have asked representatives of the union to come in to discuss the matter with officials of my Department.  The local authority's <Col N="379" /> proposal in this case is in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on Mental Illness.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also stated that female nurses have an essential part to play in the care and treatment of male patients and that their presence in male wards has a most beneficial effect.  The Commission further considers that male nurses have a very important part to play and it has stated that for many male patients nursing care can most suitably be provided by male nurses.</P>
      <P>The integration of male and female patients has already taken place to some extent in some district mental hospitals.  I am not aware that this development, so clearly directed towards the welfare of patients, is causing dissatisfaction among psychiatric nursing staffs.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Commission on Mental Illness on the co-ordination of nursing activities and on the integration of male and female patients are being examined and the Deputy can be assured that any views in these matters put forward by the psychiatric nurses will receive most careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time, I was praising the merger of Erin Foods and Heinz Foods in the interests of the Irish farmer.  I referred to the price of fertilisers.  I should like the Minister to have a good look at the present method of distribution of grants to farmers.  I should like a thorough investigation as to whether the money really finds its way into the farmer's pocket or whether, between the Department and the farmer's gate, a large amount of it is absorbed in keeping Department men from the point of view of a time process, travelling expenses, and so on.  I hope the Minister will look into this.  I know it is his intention to have a good look at all methods of distribution regarding grants and other benefits at present available to the farming community.</P>
      <P>We welcome, again, the announcement about post-primary education. This was no idle boast on the part of the Minister for Education.  It is now about to be put into practice.  I appeal to those schools which have not yet entered the scheme to do so as quickly as possible.  I appeal to parents who will be circularised by such schools as to whether or not they wish to participate in the free education scheme not to hesitate to give their consent.  I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success but, like many other schemes, it needs the full support of the Irish people to make it the overwhelming success which I am sure each and every Member of the House wishes it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that those schools which have not yet co-operated with the Minister will not delay and possibly, by doing so, hold up the implementation of the scheme some few weeks or maybe months.  I should be very glad if, by the end of May, the Minister could announce that this scheme is on its way for implementation in September next. Approximately 56 per cent of the schools in the city of Dublin are prepared to participate in the scheme. <Col N="381" /> Although some have already opted out, those who are considering it should give a quick decision so that the scheme may be put into effect without further delay.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the pensions for public servants&mdash;gardaí, teachers and other people who gave very loyal service to this country and who, down the years, were somewhat unrecognised by virtue of the fact that we treated them as civil servants.  I am very pleased that particular attention is being paid to these people in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I was more than surprised at the low level of discussion in this debate. I was more than surprised to see members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party taking the Budget debate as an opportunity to cast aspersions on Government Ministers, and to cast a slight on the Government.  We are not intolerant of all criticism on this side of the House; we are prepared to accept criticism, but let it be constructive criticism.  Let Fine Gael and the Labour Party, commonly known as the Opposition, offer something constructive, and let them not have within themselves a general feeling that everything the Government do is wrong.  I do not suggest for one minute that nobody at some time or another makes a mistake; the thing is that if you make a mistake you must be prepared to rectify it.  The Fine Gael Party should remember this and try to offer something constructive during the debate.  They should not be persistently dragging it out just for the sake of speaking, or just for the sake of giving maltreatment to Government Ministers or to the Government as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year, and this year is no exception, this debate is availed of by Deputies to take stock of Government policy and of the general national situation. Apparently some Fianna Fáil Deputies feel that our treatment of the Government, of the Fianna Fáil Party, and of Ministers who apparently wish to be wrapped in cotton wool, has been unduly severe.  I want to assure the Deputy who has just concluded that, despite his protestations, we on this <Col N="382" /> side of the House will continue to point out their mistakes with vigour and energy, to demand from Ministers the highest standards of probity, and to demand from the Government the implementation of policies designed to achieve social justice.</P>
      <P>A few days ago I saw a Fianna Fáil university magazine which was reprinted in some of the daily papers.  It contained an expression of views by the Taoiseach as to where the Fianna Fáil Party stand politically.  He expressed the view that they stand left of centre.  Reading the Taoiseach's views, I was reminded of a statement made by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass&mdash;I think it was in 1963&mdash;when he said the time had come for the Fianna Fáil Party to take a definite step to the left.  He had no sooner said that than the Government announced a pay-pause which was interpreted by the trade union movement as a new wage freeze.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement of this wage freeze which caused dismay to the trade union movement in whose direction the Fianna Fáil Party had taken a certain step, there was a disowning of this document by the Government. The wage freeze was followed by the introduction of the turnover tax.  We had this Fianna Fáil Party who had taken a sudden step to the left proceeding to tax the food of the people, and the ordinary things which every working man has to buy to keep body and soul together.  I am sure a debate went on as to whether or not Fianna Fáil took a sudden turn to the left three years ago.  If the experience of the past three years indicates what a turn to the left means in Fianna Fáil terms, the left had better watch out and so had everyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This article to which I have referred also contained the views of Deputy Lemass.  He is now a former Taoiseach. He is still a Member of the House.  He is now so much wiser, and he disagrees with the Taoiseach.  He does not think Fianna Fáil are left of centre.  Oh, no. He says Fianna Fáil are middle of the road, so where are they?  This is the Party which comprise the Government of the country today.  The present Taoiseach thinks they are left of centre, <Col N="383" /> and the former Taoiseach thinks they are middle of the road.  Someone must decide for them.  I would recommend that they might leave the decision to the members of Taca and see what view Taca take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to whether or not Fianna Fáil are left of centre.  The time will come when the Minister will temporarily occupy a seat on this side of the House and that will be the limbo before he leaves the House altogether.  Taca may have a view as to what political philosophy now permeates the Fianna Fáil Party. I am suggesting there is none.  I am suggesting that in relation to principle and political philosophy, the Fianna Fáil Party know just one thing, that is, to stay in office so long as they can, whether left, centre or right.  No wonder the Taoiseach has one view and the former Taoiseach has another.  No wonder the hardheaded ambitious politicians of the Fianna Fáil Party make a ready appeal to the percentage man in our community who is anxious to join a secret organisation for his own material advantage, and has enough money to pay £100 per year for six years to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reiterate the abhorrence which has been expressed by decent-minded Deputies in this House with regard to the formation of this secret sign-giving organisation which is intended to cause further division amongst our people, and which is intended to create further little sources of political advantage in our community to puff up unimportant people as people of influence merely because they have £100 per year to pay to the Fianna Fáil Party for the benefit of getting Taca membership badges.  I should like to say to the Minister for Finance who is apparently a prime mover behind this organisation that he has demonstrated the true colours of Fianna Fáil.  He will live to rue the day that Taca first ticked because he will find that for every Taca tick there are a <Col N="384" /> whole lot of other people who have enough responsibility and courage to stand on their own feet and not be beholden to any political party for their welfare.  Fianna Fáil&mdash;left of centre. Fianna Fáil maintained in office, if the ambition of the Minister for Finance can contrive it, by the money of the few rich people and only concerned with achieving that end.</P>

      <P>He left turbulence behind him as Minister for Agriculture.  Before that, he had been Minister for Justice.  We all know the mistakes that were made then.  He is now Minister for Finance.  He is taking over an economy which has suffered harshly in the past two or three years at the hands of the Fianna Fáil Government. Three years ago this team of Ministers were so irresponsible in regard to the trust they had in the people that they allowed inflation to tear the heart from our economy.  They were so concerned with having slush money poured around the place that they paid no attention to the damage which was likely to be caused to the savings and investments of our people and the money our people needed to earn: 1964&mdash;slush money and wild inflation, permitted and directed by the Fianna Fáil Party as the Government. They were only concerned at that time, <Col N="387" /> as they always are, with achieving a situation in which they could win an election and remain in office.  I call that incompetence.  I call it a callous disregard for their responsibility to the people.  They succeeded in winning an election in 1965 and we have had the two years since.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister for Finance think of the Budget introduced in 1965?  What does he think of the Budget introduced last year when it was pointed out from these benches that our economy was in such a deflated condition that it required an urgent shot in the arm?  Instead of that, we had a March and a June Budget designed to cause a further depressing of our economy and create further unemployment.  Of course, the Minister disowns all that in his Budget Statement. In effect, he says that mistakes were made last year.  Of course they were, but it is not the members of this Government who have to pay for those mistakes but the unfortunate workers who lose their jobs or the unfortunate people who have felt hardship in the past 12 months.  Mistakes were made by the Government last year when they adopted a wrong budgetary policy just because they were not capable of realising what the economy needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the OECD Economic Survey pointed to the need for a drastic change in budgetary policy and indicated that the economy needed an urgent relaxing of existing restraints if the economy was to be got going again. So we have the new Minister and the new Budget.  He has received a lot of praise from his Party for this Budget. When this debate started, I indicated that it was a Budget formed and fashioned by public opinion, and I repeat that.  I do not believe the Minister had much choice as to what he would do.  He had to provide something for the farmers; he had to provide something for social welfare recipients, especially following the doubtful gimmick of a notional 5/-increase last year.  These things he had to do, but above all, in accordance with the OECD advice, he had to do something to get our economy expanding again.  To the extent that what <Col N="388" /> he had to do was done, we welcome certain measures in the Budget but we should remind the Minister, the Government and the House, that by reason of the mistakes and incompetence shown over the past few years, there are very serious problems now facing the country.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion&mdash;how often was it talked of by Fianna Fáil Party members a few years ago?  It was to be a blueprint for prosperity.  It represented the collective wisdom of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Where is it now, this Programme which was to provide some 85,000 new jobs.  This is the end of the third year of that Programme and there are 14,000 fewer people working in Ireland today than when it started.  We are now 50,000 short of the target and we are still supposed to look with admiration on Ministers talking economic theories and referring to the Report on Full Employment from the NIEC as if that were something cogent of achievement in our circumstances. We are slipping back; fewer people are at work each year.  We are not advancing towards the achievement of any goal or any aim simply because of the inefficiency and incompetence of the Government, failure by the Government to observe the discipline necessary to achieve their own programme.</P>
    <P>At the start of the Programme, the credit necessary to provide for worthwhile investment was dissipated.  Inflation was allowed to attack the very foundations of this Programme and from inflation we slipped back into depression and the economy has gone backwards instead of forward.  Employment is off target by 50,000.  Our growth rate target according to the Programme was a 4.6 increase per year.  It was 2.5 in 1965 and 1.1 in the year just concluded.  The best we can hope to achieve in the coming year is a little over three per cent.  Again, it is clear that the targets have disappeared as achievable aims and we are drifting along, hoping that things will get better with responsibility for direction in the hands of a group of Ministers who have no policy and, I believe, no political philosophy except to stay in office.</P>
    <P>

      <P>If the Minister looks at the record, he will find that he is in error.  The employment and growth rate targets in our economy have disappeared as achievable aims. In the case of agriculture, Fianna Fáil Deputies are so thankful to the Minister for providing £5 million more for agriculture.  I despair of that mentality. <Col N="390" /> We have no agricultural policy whatever. The Government regard agriculture as something likely to give them a pain in the head and, like anybody who gets a pain in the head, they provide an aspirin or aspro from time to time to quiet it down.  But where is the plan for agriculture?  I do not believe there is any evidence of fresh, worthwhile thinking in the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to agriculture.  Money is provided from time to time; schemes are introduced designed to get over a particular difficulty, a particular area of annoyance, such as the heifer scheme and so on.  They are not part of any long-term plan.  There has been no effort to devise an adequate investment plan for agriculture, to work out the proper place for our primary industry in the expected growth of our economy in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>In relation to agriculture, this Budget is merely a repetition of what we have had so many times before: dole out some money to agriculture that will keep them quiet and we shall carry on until next year.  Look at the record: over the past five years when every other country in the world, no matter what government or policy they followed, had increasing outputs and a rise in gross national product our output in the same period rose by only one per cent.  That seems to be indicative of a Government who must be blamed because they have the responsibility, a Government who have just washed their hands of agriculture and left it there.</P>
      <P>I do not want to talk about difficulties and dissensions in relation to agriculture.  They are frequently symtomatic of an inner malaise, but I do call for some urgent thinking in relation to a proper balanced agricultural policy.  Mistakes have been made and it is appalling to reflect on a situation in which there has been a break down of communication between the Government and those serving our major industries.  I hope that will taper off and disappear because I am certain that this country cannot afford its continuance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, it is well to remind the Minister and Deputies <Col N="391" /> that there has been in this debate and the Budget Statement the usual reference to Europe.  Does any member of the Government have any real comprehension of what Europe may mean to this country?  If things go well, we may be in Europe in the next 24 to 30 months.  From time to time there has been the usual ministerial speech about preparing.  It is about time the Government started to prepare.  If we go into Europe, it can be a Klondyke for Irish agriculture, provided the necessary steps are taken here and now, provided we know the kind of goods we should be selling and how we should sell them and provided farmers and the Government co-operate one with the other in working towards a proper export drive in the European market.</P>
    <P>Of course, none of that is taking place.  Individual Ministers are sitting on their dignity and many other people are behaving as if they had no knowledge of what this country requires. The result is dissension instead of preparation. The Government have a direct responsibility as trustees for the country to ensure that this situation ends as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, I do not know whether it will be officially buried or not.  We got an indication some months ago from the Taoiseach that the Programme was ill, that its demise was expected soon and that a new Programme would take its place.  When shall we have that new programme?  It is perfectly clear that new targets must be started and that we must have a revised and attenuated series of targets if aims are to be attainable.  I wonder when will we get that.  If we do get it may I suggest to the Minister that in future, when these various reports come out at Budget time from his Department, from the NIEC and so on, they will contain a statement of progress each year towards the achievement of whatever new targets are put before us?  If that is done, if the people can be convinced that the mistakes made so clearly and obviously during the last two or three years will not be repeated, if people can be convinced <Col N="392" /> that whatever new Programme is announced is understood by the Government&mdash;that at least the Government are prepared to exercise the discipline necessary to achieve the targets&mdash;then progress can be made, I believe.  But if we continue as we have up to the last three years, with Government decisions changing from month to month, with different financial policies being followed at different periods, with the Government giving the wrong lead and the wrong example, then I do not believe we can make progress.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before, it is interesting to note that the only target that has been reached in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, the only target that has been covered has been that of taxation and the taxation level now is some seven per cent higher than was envisaged in the Programme for 1970.  Is not that indicative of something very seriously wrong?</P>
    <P>Apart from any criticism of progress under the Second Programme, there are many other things that require to be said and that should be said.  We appear to be coming back into a cost of living problem.  That should be appreciated in relation to the 5/- increase that Fianna Fáil Deputies are so proud about in relation to social welfare benefits.  In fact, there has not been an increase for social welfare recipients since the Budget of 1965. We had an illusory 5/- last year and when all these unfortunate people stretched out their hands to grasp it they found it was not there.</P>
    <P>During those two years there has been an increase of 16 per cent in the cost of living, a very marked and steep rise.  I cannot say that what is being done this year for old age pensioners and other welfare recipients is anything more than simple justice, anything more than an effort to provide a reality in terms of money.  I want to say a word about housing.  Again, I hope no one will get hot under the collar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been talk from one member of the Government, the Minister for Local <Col N="393" /> Government, about speculation in relation to land.  I do not know what is behind all this, who is supposed to be codded by pious expressions on the one hand when, in fact, speculation is rife not only around the city but throughout rural Ireland.  If a Fianna Fáil Minister is to be taken seriously about the speculator who buys land for development let him have a full examination.  In my view it represents a matter of grave public concern.  I recommend that there be a full investigation and a full disclosure because there is this to be said: we have a bottleneck now around Dublin city and around other parts of the country where there are centres of population because of serious Government neglect of drainage and the provision of amenities in the last decade or so. Money was not provided to develop land in the areas clearly mapped out for a growth in population.  The result of that lack of attention, that inefficiency and that lack of planning, has been that now in the areas capable of development, where there are drainage and facilities, there is a Dutch auction with regard to the provision of lands suitable for development.  Therefore, when the Minister for Local Government talked about clamping down on the speculators, he is talking about closing the stable door after the horse has gone.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, in most places the land available for development has already been bought out.  Those who bought it are selling it now in some places at £1,000 an acre for private building.  I do not know whether that is advisable or not.  One Deputy defended it here.  Maybe it is defensible, but if it is, what is the purpose of the Minister for Local Government talking as if this were something he was going to end?  Double talk gets no one anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend to the Fianna Fáil Party, if they want to be taken seriously in this regard, that they put the full facts before all of us.  Where is the development going to take place? What kind of plans are there to be to provide urgently and quickly the necessary amenities to allow building to progress in an orderly way without <Col N="394" /> fancy profits being made by those fortunate enough to buy land well in advance of the need?</P>
    <P>I notice with interest that in Britain they are establishing a Land Commission to deal with this problem. The new Land Commission regards its statutory duty to be to provide and make available developed lands for houses, to have a pool of developed land to prevent the large profits and the exorbitant demands because of the price of sites.  We need something similar to that here.  We certainly need a situation in which the Government take the people into their confidence and clearly indicate what help and assistance will be provided to get suitably developed lands available for future building.</P>
    <P>Some of the things which are not in this Budget have already been pointed out.  A number of Deputies mentioned the glaring omission this year in relation to a revision with regard to the implementation of a health policy.  Just for the record, I think it should be said that certainly since 1961, if not longer, but so far as the records of this House are concerned, since 1961 we on these benches have persistently and consistently demanded the introduction of a health policy which would eliminate the defects of what we have at present.</P>
    <P>Our demands were fobbed off by the establishment of a Select Committee which sat and doodled for close on three years achieving nothing except what was the real desire it should achieve&mdash;to silence the people on health.  Then we had, just two years ago, the fandango of Deputy O'Malley, who danced in here as Minister for Health, waving a White Paper on Health before Deputies, promising much and telling us that his new health scheme, which contained about half of what we demanded, would be introduced by last November.  It did not matter that in neither of the Budgets of last year was any provision made for health.</P>
    <P>Even so we were to believe from Deputy O'Malley that somehow instant money would provide instant services for the people of this country by last <Col N="395" /> November.  I do not know what has happened to it.  November is now part of our history and Deputy O'Malley, as Minister for Health, is also part of our history.  Deputy Flanagan is now Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance holds the purse strings.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Budget for a new health programme.  There is nothing at all in it.  We are going to carry on as we did in every year since 1961 with the creeping Victorian system of medicine we have had for almost 100 years.  We are going to carry on with medical cards and the situation in which a person has to prove poverty in order to get urgent medical attention.  We are going to carry on as the limping, poor relation of Europe with no money for health.</P>
    <P>The money could not be provided last year because the Minister for Finance was facing a deficit.  We all thought this year, with the Minister being able to announce a Budget surplus, that there would be provision for health.  No&mdash;it has to be postponed: some other time, some other day. Again, I doubt the sincerity of those who act in this way.  If there were a political philosophy in the Fianna Fáil Party, if they knew where they stood and had plans, those things would have been achieved long ago, but no. So far as this Government are concerned, it is apparent that what is boiling hard is the thing that is going to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>That may change from time to time. If there had been a grave subject of controversy this year about health, then provision would have been made for health in this Budget.  The people accepted the White Paper as indicating a promise and a commitment and are quite happy about it.  They do not seem to realise that health is again forgotten.  I think that is a tragedy and I have no doubt that it will be rectified in due course.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in relation to health which I think should be recorded here.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us, if he is still not hot under the collar when replying, what has happened to the freezing of rates.  Last <Col N="396" /> year the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Malley, announced to Seanad Éireann that he had the Government's authority to say that he was going to freeze the impact of health services on the rates and that this was a necessary step he was taking just to carry over the short period before the implementation of his new health scheme.  That is gone this year. Apparently that was a commitment that was only valid so long as Deputy O'Malley continued to be Minister for Health.  I do not think that is right.  If there were any semblance of a plan and real policy behind this Government, that kind of thing would not happen.  But there it is.  Whatever was said last year, the freeze is now off and in most cases the sky is the limit.</P>
    <P>I think it right to say that Deputy O'Malley, now Minister for Education, is at least being consistent.  He started off as Minister for Education having again read Fine Gael policy. As he did as Minister for Health, so he does as Minister for Education.  I only hope that this time, as Minister for Education, he will see these things happen.  I would like to wish very well his proposal which is our proposal, with regard to the future of University College, Dublin, and Trinity College.  I think it is the only logical step to take and I believe that goodwill undoubtedly exists for the future which will be constructive and useful for both centres of learning.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I have charged the Government with incompetence, incompetence because of the events of the past three years.  It is not necessary to go back further than that.  I charge them with a lack of policy.  I do so because their policy and their programme was supposed to be the Second Programme which has now been completely torn asunder and forgotten and has been replaced by nothing&mdash;incompetence, without a policy.  They have been staggering along from crisis to crisis, producing gimmick after gimmick, endeavouring to paper over a variety of different crises, and all the time the economy has been suffering and more and more people are going out of work.  We are getting poorer month by month and we cease to measure up to what will <Col N="397" /> be required of us in competition with other countries in Europe.  Europe remains still a distant vision, but whether distant or close, it is certain that we are not being prepared for it.  Apart altogether from the official speeches made from time to time by different Government Ministers, in practice, nothing is being done.</P>
    <P>Our great agricultural industry is at sixes and sevens, with no one knowing what precisely should be done and nobody knowing how to do it, with the Minister not speaking to the farmers and the farmers not speaking to the Minister.  All this is bad.  It adds up to a very serious position for the country. Then, we have developments in our public life&mdash;this Taca organisation and the rest of it.  What can that mean except further to unsettle people, except further to convince people that this is a political group in office who are concerned only for their political future, without a policy, without a programme, depending on silent, secret organisations to maintain them in office.  I think that is bad, and I think the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Minister in particular, would be doing a great service to proper standards in politics if he disbanded that organisation and did it quickly.  If he does not do it, he will find it has been a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>However, our duty as an Opposition is to carry on, to produce our policies, to endeavour to get them understood and to take satisfaction from the fact that occasionally some of the things we advocate are adopted and carried out by the Government.  But we will continue to be an effective Opposition and continue to be a vigorous Opposition, whatever difficulties we may have to contend with from time to time.  Without the services available to the Government, we will carry on.  I believe there is now a growing awareness in the country that a change of Government, a change of men and a change of ideas is urgently needed, if this country is to take advantage of the opportunities which Europe will bring, we hope, in the next 24 months.  That cannot be achieved immediately.  I believe the local elections will indicate that desire, but it will be achieved sooner or later, and when that is done, <Col N="398" /> I believe this country will really start to advance.</P>

      <P>It has become increasingly clear to me, at any rate, while Deputy T.F. O'Higgins was speaking, that his main emotion is one of jealousy and in many respects, I am not surprised.  One of his colleagues met me immediately after the Budget speech and he was looking rather sad. I said to him: &ldquo;What do you think of it,&rdquo; and his reaction was &ldquo;How the hell can we in Fine Gael win a local election with a Budget like that?&rdquo; I think this has been a disappointing Budget from the point of view of the Opposition because it was almost impossible to criticise it and that must be very frustrating.  This has led to a Budget debate which in my ten short years of experience has beaten all records for sheer boredom and irrelevancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it has been the custom of the Chair at all times to allow a wide scope in the debate on the Budget, but this year the Budget itself was the subject which received least attention in the speeches of the Opposition.  They were so obviously annoyed that speeches from the Government side of the House tended to be more relevant. It is easy, of course, to throw out criticism and it is obviously just as easy, as Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has demonstrated, to throw out abuse and to introduce subjects like the formation of a group called Taca.  My mind is perfectly clear that his main criticism is that some of our supporters thought of it before he thought of it.  That, again, must be rather annoying but, to allege that there is something improper, something secret, something sinister about supporters of Fianna Fáil agreeing to subscribe regularly is just nonsense, that is, unless we are to assume that anyone who supports Fine Gael is simply a loyal and well-informed Party member, whereas anyone who shows any prejudice in favour of Fianna Fáil is a dirty political hack. This is the sort of childish nonsense I would have thought we would have outgrown.  One's opponents are not certainly Party hacks and the whole tone of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins's speech during the past threequarters <Col N="399" /> of an hour or so has been a desperate endeavour to prove that everything is going badly and that we are in a unique position of depression and despair.  That is typical of Fine Gael speeches, and always has been, but, as usual, it is in direct defiance of the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has tried to persuade us that everyone is progressing rapidly except ourselves, everyone, that is, except the United States of America, which is having considerable financial difficulties and employment problems, the whole six Members of the Common Market, considerable areas of Scandinavia, the EFTA members, including the United Kingdom.  We have not got any direct comparison between ourselves and the Soviet Union or Red China, but the general trend of economic conditions at the moment is that we are slowly emerging from a period of economic stringency, for reasons which are not always immediately obvious, but we are not out on our own.  Everybody has been having this.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins says that instead of the economy making progress, we are slipping back and, in the next sentence, he went on to comment on the fact that our rate of growth was not sufficiently large.  You cannot be slipping back if you still have a rate of growth at all, and I would be the first to admit that our rate of growth is not anything like what we would like it to be but Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and some of his colleagues should try to face the facts and realise that it is not in the public interest to try to delude people into believing the situation is worse than it is.  In actual fact, the situation is under control, in so far as it is within the power of a national Government these days to control anything. We are living in a very closely inter-related community of nations and, while we may make decisions of our own, the results of these decisions must, of necessity, be greatly affected by the policies of other countries.</P>
    <P>Another evidence of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins's failure to keep to facts was his comment about the financial provision <Col N="400" /> for the Department of Health. As far as I remember his comment was: &ldquo;No money has been provided for Health&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the actual words of the Deputy were: &ldquo;No money has in fact been provided for Health&rdquo;.  If we go back to the year 1961, we find £9 million were provided and, in successive years, this amount has risen as follows: £10 million, £11 million, £14 million, practically £16 million, practically £19 million, last year, and Estimates for this year are practically £21 million.  And Deputy T.F. O'Higgins blandly says: &ldquo;No money has been provided for Health.&rdquo;  To my mind, £21 million is a fair amount.</P>
      <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins's comments on the health services generally could not have been justified, had he paid any attention to the evidence which was given before the Special Committee on the Health Services, of which both he and I were members.  In fact, that Committee did receive ample evidence that, basically speaking, there was little necessity for improvement of the health services.  There were some points on which improvements could be made, and in fact many of those improvements have been made already, or are in course of being made.  But that Committee, while it did not produce a final Report, was of tremendous value, in that it produced an enormous amount of evidence, almost all of which was in support of the health services scheme as it stands today.</P>

      <P>It is most gratifying to hear Deputy O'Higgins ask me to publish it.  I have not got the funds to do so myself.  It is a matter for the direction of the House, rather than of one Member.</P>
      <P>Just to make one further point about Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and his comments&mdash;he was, as usual, very upset because he was accusing Fianna Fáil of stealing Fine Gael policies and putting them into effect.  It can not be stated too often that there is a basic difference between an Opposition Party and a Party in power.  A Party in power can produce a policy only when it has the determination and the means to put that policy into effect.  A Party in Opposition can&mdash;and Fine Gael have proved that they can and have&mdash;produce policies by the hundred abandoning those which appear embarrassing at any time and inventing new ones.  It is always easy to produce policies when you have not got the agonising responsibility of implementing them.  If you produce enough policies&mdash;and God knows, Fine Gael have produced plenty&mdash;on the law of averages, you must come up with a good idea once or twice&mdash;they cannot be that stupid; I do not think they are really&mdash;but you cannot then say that all the good ideas come from Fine Gael.  They do not, and, if they did, Fine Gael would be on this side of the House, a situation which does not seem likely to arise in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the Budget, first of <Col N="402" /> all, I should like to comment on the general frame of the Budget speech itself.  It was novel in its presentation; it was very clear; it was produced in a methodical way and in language understandable to the ordinary man in the street.  There has been a tendency in such matters previously to speak in a jargon which the ordinary man can never understand.  This was straight, honest-to-goodness stuff.  It was produced in a way which anyone who really made the effort could&mdash;and, I think, did&mdash;understand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon in his criticism made some references to the practice which he deprecated of allowing civil servants to become members of councils and so on, like NIEC, to sign those reports and thereby to identify themselves and lose their anonymity.  I know in past years it has always been the practice that these senior officers of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance have tended to be faceless men.  I do not see any advantage in that at all.  I know from my reading it has been freely discussed in the United Kingdom that certain leading officers of the Treasury in London have been responsible for certain actions.  This is something we have got to face.</P>
    <P>An increasing responsibility for Government rests now on the permanent Civil Service.  They are advisers at a very high level, and in many cases they may be actually taking decisions.  Whether we like it or not, we have got to live with it.  If we are going to have people in that capacity, I would much rather know who they were.  In that way we could get to know them, get to understand their minds and thereby be more constructive in our criticism of their decisions and advice.  I think we can in this way achieve rationalisation between that part of the Executive furnished by the Civil Service and that part of the Executive furnished through election procedures.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to restraint in our wage rates and in our spending at this time.  To call this an election Budget, when it contains an appeal and, in fact, a direction for <Col N="403" /> restraint in spending, is just nonsense. This is a down-to-earth, factual statement. The Minister was perfectly right in pointing out that our ability to export, in particular to the United Kingdom, had been greatly handicapped last year by reason of rising costs here. That was a very necessary warning. We have got to put the facts clearly before the people, as, in fact, we always try to do.</P>
    <P>You have this business of chasing the additional £1 a week, £5 a month, £50 a year, whatever it may be.  Even if it is only sixpence an hour, there is a 40-hour week and you are back to the £1 a week again.  Many of these wage increases can be quite illusory when rising prices make their value somewhat less.  I find the ordinary man in the street has at last realised that.  We have got to get this across to everybody, not just a few, that increasing wealth in this country can only be achieved by increasing production at a highly economic rate.  That is the way we get more money to spend.  But just raising wage rates is not the solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech paid very proper attention to the increasing needs of education, and I think this is something which has received widespread support.  Here, again, the Minister for Education has made it clear&mdash; I think we should continue to make it clear to people&mdash;that education, like health, cannot be provided free of charge.  Somebody is going to pay for it.  It is right that those better able to pay, should pay, either by way of direct charge or by way of taxation.  We must not allow ourselves to get into the feeling that the community as a whole can get more and more for less and less.  The hard facts of life just do not make that possible.  Consequently, we have had to have tax increases.  They are small enough, but they are there and we have got to accept them.</P>
    <P>This so-called election Budget has made small but very well justified concessions in respect of medical expenses, dependent relatives, child allowance and sur-tax earned income relief.  This last is the one which has come in for most criticism: simply <Col N="404" /> because there are very few people affected by it.  So the mass of the people prefer to court popularity by saying &ldquo;Do not give any relief to the sur-tax payers.  Soak the beggers more and more.&rdquo;  That may appear to be a popular approach, but, thank heavens, our people are becoming sufficiently mature to know that that does not make sense.  In fact, we need more people in this country liable to sur-tax. If we had more people liable to sur-tax we would have more employment. These are the people who are providing the initiative in the private sector, who are helping with the increase in employment, who are giving employment in their own right and who are subscribing very largely towards the overall cost of State services. It is crazy that we should have a sur-tax system which should make it cheaper for people with incomes of £3,500 and £4,000 a year to live in England than to live here.</P>
    <P>In this connection there is just one other point I should like to mention which was not dealt with in the Minister's speech, the question of death duties.  I hope the Minister will keep under review this whole question because I believe the present policy is bad business.  I have known several cases.  I have one in mind in my own constituency where a very elderly man, who came from Northern Ireland to the Republic because he found it more congenial, was eventually forced to emigrate to the Bahamas where he could die more cheaply than he could here.  He was a loss to the country.  While he stayed here he was paying income tax and sur-tax and giving employment.  If we had cut out death duties altogether, or reduced them very considerably, he would have stayed here and contributed that way also.  In fact, what happened was that we killed the goose that might have laid the golden egg and he is gone.  It would attract more money into the country if this system of estate duty were drastically revised.</P>
    <P>There is the matter of the increase in social welfare payments which was decried by Deputy O'Higgins.  There, again, I found it in heart to sympathise with him.  It must be maddening for <Col N="405" /> him to know, as he does, that every year a Fianna Fáil Government has increased social welfare benefits.  It must be maddening to know that, particularly when he thinks of the record of his own Party in that regard.  However, it becomes a little bit boring when he comes up with the same crack again: &ldquo;Why was it not more?&rdquo; There is only one reason and that is there was no more to give.  If we wanted to have an election Budget we could have put the country further in debt and given everyone 10/- a week increase.  What would have been the reaction then? &mdash;screams from the Opposition that we were buying votes.  The really annoying thing for them was that we were seen to be doing the right thing and not to be buying votes.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his very comprehensive speech, dealt with a tremendous number of matters.  I do not want to deal with them all, but I should like to commend him for his very personal approach to all aspects of national policy.  I am particularly glad that he has clarified still further the matter of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965.  This was something which should never have been introduced.  It was a mistake from the start.  It was made while the present Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  It was something on which he was doubtful himself, but he was the first Minister that I have ever known to approach such a complex bit of legislation in this way.  He said: &ldquo;I know this is something which should be done in some way.  I am not certain that this is the right way to do it.  Let us try it and if it does not work out I shall introduce amending legislation which will be retrospective.&rdquo;  Deputy Lynch, as Minister for Finance, did that in the Budgets he introduced and did, in fact, rectify matters retrospectively.  That, to my mind, is a man's approach to a very difficult matter.  Part VII of the Finance Act, 1965, would have been a disaster if it had ever actually gone into effect, but my information is that no final assessments have ever been made under that part for the simple reason that it was unworkable.  I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister for Finance has decided that he will extensively recast this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> The purpose of this legislation is ostensibly to tax profiteering and speculation in land.  I react immediately against people who use words like &ldquo;speculation&rdquo; and &ldquo;profiteering&rdquo;.  It is so easy to throw names around.  It it so easy to accuse people of profiteering or speculating, and it is impossible to define what speculation really is.  A profiteering speculator is usually a man who is making more money than I am &mdash;just as easy as that.  Anyone who is making more money than I am is bad and wicked and should be suppressed or taxed out of existence,</P>
    <P>That is not the way to approach it. It must be approached on the basis of making land available for housing at a reasonable price.  To say that anybody who buys land at any stage is bound to make a stack of money is not true.  A speculator is essentially a man who takes risks.  It would be just as logical to say that a person who puts money on a horse is bound to make money.  Many Members of this House have found to the contrary.  The speculator is a man who takes risks, and if he makes a profit it may be profiteering in that his profit is excessive, but he may make a loss as well. There is already adequate power in the hands of the Revenue to tax the income of anyone who is engaged in the buying and selling of land as a venture of trade.  There is a propaganda element involved in this piece of legislation.  I think the Minister at the time was wrongly advised, and it is excellent that that mistake is going to be rectified.</P>
    <P>In particular, I am glad the Minister has decided to produce two Finance Bills, one to cover the actual Budgetary Resolutions and the second one to deal with tax provisions to reform income tax law.  There is a tremendous amount of reform still necessary.  The Minister and his Department and the Revenue Commissioners have done a wonderful job in the production of the Income Tax Act of 1967 which provides a complete codification of tax law.  That in itself is a step forward, but I think it is only one step.  When we look at this enormous piece of legislation we must appreciate that something should be done to substitute this by some form <Col N="407" /> of taxation which is more readily understandable.</P>
    <P>It is intolerable that one has to employ not only chartered accountants but senior counsel to advise one as to what one's liability may or may not be under the income tax laws of 1967. That has been the situation for years. This is only the first step.  We must go a good bit further and amend it very drastically so as to produce a general form of taxation, preferably, to my mind, indirect taxation on expenditure rather than taxation on income.  Taxation on income tends to reduce the incentive to earn more, whereas taxation on expenditure encourages saving. We are already moving along that road, and we could move further and faster.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with the very difficult but very important matter of the decimalisation of our currency.  It looks at the moment as if British Government policy is tending towards the decimalisation of the £ as a unit. Why they have done that goodness alone knows, because there is an increasing body of public opinion in the United Kingdom which is very much against it, and justifiably so, because the smallest item in that currency would be worth 2.4d. which is ludicrous.  Then one gets down to a half cent system.  The whole purpose of the system is to decimalise, and one does not want half cents in it.  The American cent system is obviously better, though this takes you down to, I think, the smallest unit of 1.2d, and there are many things in relation to which halfpennies are still valuable.  In the case of tea, sugar, bread, a half-penny is very often an essential unit.</P>

      <P>This intervention by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach is most offensive.  I hope I will have an opportunity of discussing this matter later.  As I was saying, we have to get a balanced approach and obviously there is a great deal to be said for the Minister's suggestion of a 2/- cent system because, looking at the position in Europe, most European <Col N="408" /> countries deal in a standard unit of currency of approximately 2/- in value &mdash;francs, Deutschmarks, and so on.  It would be far better if we had a similar system.  If necessary, we should adopt the florin, even though the United Kingdom goes on to the £, because we could easily tie that in with the proposed British system; our florin would be one-tenth of the British £ and there would be no difficulty.  In fact, there would be a tremendous advantage in that our coinage could be maintained very largely.  It would not mean a number of very strange coins. We could even have notes: the 10/-note would be a five florin note and the £ a ten florin note.</P>
      <P>We should have further discussion on this.  I, for one, would welcome the intervention of members of the public and public bodies because this is a matter in relation to which we could easily walk ourselves into something and discover the dangers too late. There is still a chance, I think, that Britain will adopt the 10/- unit.  I would also say, without very much hesitation, that if we take the bit between our teeth and say we are going on with the florin, the 2/- system, we might easily swing the United Kingdom over with us.  We could, at least, give Britain the excuse because there are some big bodies, vested interests, which have plumped for the £ unit, but an increasing number are becoming most unhappy about it.  If we come out with the 2/- unit, it would not, I think, do us any harm and it might easily lead to a revision of the whole situation elsewhere.  On the face of it, the florin is a much more workmanlike unit of currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, this Budget is a realistic and encouraging one.  It shows that the Minister has taken a very deep personal interest in every word of his speech.  The speech was, in fact, his speech.  It demonstrates what I have always known: he is a man of great ability in matters of finance, a man of great originality and a man with the courage of his convictions.  I have known this for many years and these qualities will, in my opinion, prove of inestimable value.  This is the Minister's first effort and he has done <Col N="409" /> extremely well.  There must have been a temptation to make flashy decisions. There must have been a temptation to say that he was really going to get things moving.  But he resisted the temptation and produced a Budget which proves that he is a statesman and a man of vision, a man who is looking ahead with real excitement but a man who is not going to lose his head in the process.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this Budget is deliberately designed to make sure that Fianna Fáil remain in power. That is far from the truth because we could so easily have made this a more popular Budget, had that been our aim.  The Minister did not do that.  The policy of Fianna Fáil has always been to frame a Budget which will work, a Budget which will show equal concern for all members of the community and which will play its part in redistributing the national wealth fairly as between all classes.  Anyone who hopes to satisfy everybody is engaging in the rather useless exercise of crying for the moon.  We do not work on that basis. Yet we are making progress.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest confidence in the Minister.  His first Budget is an excellent one.  He has, of course, been fortunate in that a very good foundation was laid for him by his predecessor, the Taoiseach, but nevertheless I think the Minister has taken full advantage of all the opportunities given to him and, in doing so, has done really well.  He has produced a Budget which is essentially sound.  If he continues, and I believe he will, to work along the same lines, we will not produce miracles overnight, but we will continue the reflation of the economy at a sound and steady rate. As a businessman, I do not like slumps. I am almost equally frightened by a boom.  There is something unhealthy about a boom.  I do not like to see trade fluctuating rapidly up and down.  The recent credit squeeze resulted in a certain slowing down of the economy, but nothing really disastrous happened, and now we are gradually reflating the economy and moving forward faster.</P>
    <P>We are moving in the right direction. All the figures show that.  The external assets of the banks are rising.  The prospects <Col N="410" /> for the tourist season are excellent. There will be a substantial increase in farmers' incomes this year if they concentrate on production rather than on efforts which tend towards disintegration of the whole agricultural industry.  Industrial production is rising and, with the abolition of the British import surcharge, our chances of breaking into the British market will be greatly increased.  What can be done is being done.  Everything is not just gorgeous but everything is, at least, moving steadily forward.  We have a lot for which to be thankful.  I reject the efforts of Deputy O'Higgins, and his like, to spread alarm and despondency everywhere.  They do this kind of thing out of sheer jealousy. They accuse us of clinging to power. They are inspired by nothing but jealousy because we are here and they are over there.  This is where we shall stay because we have the support of the people; that is where Fine Gael will stay because they have not got that support.</P>

      <P>One cannot but be impressed by the vast difference in the speeches made this year from the Opposition benches and those made last year from those same benches after the rather severe Budget the Fianna Fáil Government found it necessary to introduce to keep the economy on the right track.  It has always been the policy of Fianna Fáil and this has been stated time and again on these benches and on public platforms, to do the right thing for the people at the right time, irrespective of whether it is popular or unpopular.  If one accepts the tremendous responsibility of Government, then one must have the courage of one's convictions. One must be prepared to take an unpopular stand in the best interests of the community.</P>

    <P>Last year the Opposition speakers felt that this was a glorious opportunity for them to attack the Government and to attack the economy which was not making the progress which had been projected in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  Because these target figures&mdash;and they were only target figures&mdash;were not being achieved they tried to decry the <Col N="411" /> efforts of this Government.  One must always take into consideration the many external factors which bear upon our economy.  This was carefully stated in the Second Programme and it was always warned in regard to the projections that were made in that Programme that those who were committed to carrying out that Programme could and would find themselves in a position where factors over which they had no influence could intervene.  We saw what happened.  We saw the difficult situation which arose in England, the difficulty which arose in the world because of international shortage of liquidity, this being mostly due to the large foreign aid programmes of the great states.  These things could not be foreseen.  Other governments had to face their difficulties.  We only had to face repercussions as they hit us in this country.</P>
    <P>The Government last year, when Deputy Lynch introduced the Budget, took the courageous step and made the moves which we said at that time would correct the faults which had been seen to appear.  Now that these faults have been corrected, now that a vast improvement has come about in our economy and now when the country is ready to move forward again, what do we get from the Opposition benches?  We get speeches about last year's Budget.  This, in itself, I feel is sufficient indication to the ordinary people that the Opposition in this Parliament do not really know what they are here for.  They do not seem to have any specific policy. They do not seem to seek to guide the people along any particular path of progress.  There is and has been a purely destructive effort from the Opposition towards the constructive efforts of the Government.  However, we are not greatly influenced by the utterances that come from the benches opposite us.  We know our goal; we know our aim.  We know the path is a difficult one but we wish to stay on that path and improve the lot of the people.  I feel that one should qualify the speeches that come from the Opposition and one should point out that they themselves have been astounded at the tremendous improvement <Col N="412" /> which has come about in our economy.  They should honestly acknowledge that.  In some instances they did, but the general pattern has been purely destructive.</P>
    <P>We in the west of Ireland like to call this Budget the West of Ireland Budget.  People have tried to state that in the past the Government were not showing sufficient interest in the special problems which existed in the west of Ireland.  Indeed, it has been stated by Members of the Opposition and by other people not entirely in favour of this Government that the Government were not aware of the problems which existed in the west of Ireland.  I can only say to those people that they must think that we Deputies who come from the west of Ireland and who are Members of the Government Party are a lot of dummies if we cannot ensure that our people are properly looked after in regard to the division of the wealth of this country.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous resources of wealth in the West which to my mind have been completely untapped.  I sometimes experience a great feeling of dismay when I hear and read speeches under the heading &ldquo;Save the West&rdquo;.  We in the West wish to develop the West.  We know the potential that is in it.  We know the great wealth that is there in the land and in its natural amenities.  We wish to see these things properly utilised and properly developed in such a way that more and more of our people will be able to find good employment in the west of Ireland and to supplement the excellent employment given there at present.</P>
    <P>This Government, since 1932, have striven to improve the way of life in rural Ireland, and particularly in the West.  The success of that programme can be seen by any person who wishes to travel the roads in my constituency. One cannot but be greatly impressed by the tremendous amount of new housing in my constituency and, indeed, in every other constituency in the west of Ireland.  It has been the great commitment of our Government to see that the people in rural areas were properly housed.  Other aspects of development and Government endeavour have been the improvement of <Col N="413" /> roads, the provision of rural electrification, the provision of employment in the west of Ireland and the bestowal of vast financial aid upon the agricultural community in the west of Ireland and indeed throughout Ireland generally.</P>
    <P>I am of the firm opinion that the special problems which face us are not problems which can be wholly solved by Government action.  The solution of many difficulties and problems that exist in my part of the country is in the hands of the people who live there. The big thing that is lacking is local leadership.  I would advocate that a strong determined effort be made to develop the co-operative system in the west of Ireland.  It is plainly obvious to anybody that any capital investment in our biggest industry, agriculture, should be of a wholly productive nature.  It is a great waste of hard-earned money to see farm machinery being purchased by small farmers who have not and never will have sufficient work to justify the purchasing of this expensive machinery.</P>
    <P>The Government should have a special responsibility in this matter and should ensure that where capital investment is being made in farm machinery, the people wishing to buy should be able to prove that they have the work to justify the purchase of the machinery and will be able to make maximum use of it while it is in their possession and, where they cannot, that arrangements will be made for three or four neighbours to come together and use the one machine. There is money tied up in farm machinery in the west of Ireland which could, if employed in a different manner, employ more people, produce more goods and give greater amenities in other spheres if the money were there and left available.</P>
    <P>This is a sad reflection on a policy which has been allowed to continue of people being freely allowed to purchase this expensive machinery where they did not have the work for it.  The co-operative system has been proved in this country time and time again but it has succeeded only where there were capable men at the head of the co-op. Ever since the time of Paddy the Cope <Col N="414" /> in Donegal, the Irish people have understood that the solution to many of our problems lay in this co-operative movement.  If some effort could be made to educate leaders who would go into the rural community and organise the people there into forming a viable co-operative unit and that all their efforts would be concentrated into a productive unit, the outdated and old-fashioned methods which exist at the moment could be gradually erased from the Irish agricultural scene and efficiency introduced, we could produce much more at a much less cost, have a much greater return and give much more employment eventually.</P>
    <P>When one considers that the small farmer in the West is the producer and the merchandiser, one can see the problem that faces him.  He must sow the seed, cultivate it and carry it through various stages of bad weather and attacks from different types of diseases.  The same is true of his cattle.  He must rear the young calves and bring them to the stage where they are a finished product and can be sold at a fair.</P>
    <P>The outmoded practice of Irish fairs is an ailment in the Irish agricultural scene.  Let us face it.  The people involved in agriculture who hold the greatest wealth are the middle-men, the cattle jobbers and the cattle buyers who lurk in the doorways in the dark at two or three a.m. on fair days waiting to make a clever purchase from an innocent Irish farmer.  The Government should attack these practices and organise a proper marketing system for the agricultural product.  The farmer should be relieved of his responsibility to produce his product and to bring it to selling point. There is no other business in the world that I know of where the producer is expected to see his product right through from the very beginning to the consumption line.  Vast techniques are involved in the merchandising of other consumption goods.  With the adoption of more modern methods&mdash;a greater rationalisation of our marketing systems&mdash;we could probably bring great benefit and increased wealth to the small farmers in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>As far as the special difficulties involved <Col N="415" /> in that area are concerned, it is important to remember that economic progress will not be desired in any community where the people themselves do not realise that progress is possible.  Father McDyer, who has been given some praise in this country, is a man with a mission.  He is doing a job of work in which a lot more of us could involve ourselves and which local leaders and local communities throughout the country should take up. As I see it, his main mission is to try to create among the people of rural Ireland a confidence in themselves and in their own ability and to instil some type of leadership in them so that they can make greater use of the resources which are at present available to them. He has a hard job.</P>
    <P>So long as the expression &ldquo;Save the West&rdquo; is attached to the efforts of Father McDyer and the other good people who have interested themselves in our problems, I do not think they will ever make any progress.  When one hears the expression &ldquo;Save the West&rdquo;, one feels one is being associated with something of decay.  That creates and instils a feeling of lassitude and promotes a lackadaisical attitude.  It creates the kind of feeling that rather than have a slow death let us hurry on and pass peacefully away when, in actual fact, what is needed is to instil a greater pride in our resources and in our ability and a greater awareness of the wealth at our doorsteps.</P>
    <P>It can be seen, no matter where you go in the West.  Compare the industrious farmer with others in the neighbourhood and you will see that one man can make a tremendous living out of it and rear a family in a happy environment and can provide them with a good social standing and a good education while, side by side, you will have the man with the same resources who is unable to make any progress and who is merely struggling.  These are the people whom we must help.  We must show them that they have the solution to their problems in their own hands.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in 1957, there were something like six agricultural advisers in County Galway.  Now, there are 22. I feel that there should be an agricultural <Col N="416" /> adviser in every parish in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care whose plan it is.  Any plan which will assist and develop this country is good and should be adopted.  I feel that far too much is being left to the Parish Priest and, indeed, to the three men one looks to in any parish in Ireland&mdash;the Parish Priest, the local Sergeant and the national teacher.  My colleague beside me has said &ldquo;TD&rdquo; but there is not one in every parish.  The tremendous amount of leadership these people have shown should be recognised.  However, they are privileged people in our communities and stand a little above the ordinary resident in a rural town or a rural area.  If the leadership is to be 100 per cent successful, I feel it must come from the people themselves.</P>
      <P>It is opportune to mention at this stage that the junior chambers of commerce throughout the west of Ireland have offered their assistance to Father McDyer in his campaign.  They will spend their time each week in training people in leadership in the villages and towns in the west of Ireland.  This is praiseworthy work and the whole country will wish them well in their efforts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt and myself have made constant representations to the Minister for Finance in the past year in regard to the necessity&mdash;which I think was realised although I think the pressure was needed&mdash;to increase the pensions of State servants.  I am particularly grateful to the Minister for what he has done in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still one great blot on our community and that is the position in which a widow with young children finds herself after losing her husband who had held a good job and who was not a contributor to our social welfare scheme.  There is no greater tragedy in this country than to meet and see the difficulties facing a young woman who finds herself in that position.  Because of the size of her husband's salary who was in what is termed &ldquo;a good job&rdquo;&mdash; now, over £1,200; then, over £800&mdash;he <Col N="417" /> would not be a contributor to the social welfare scheme.  These people never dreamed that tragedy would ever come to their door.  Every Deputy has met such cases and has felt completely hopeless in not being able to help. Sometimes, with a new house, there are weekly or monthly payments to be made on a loan.  It is absolutely impossible to exist on the widow's non-contributory pension.  I discussed this matter with the previous Minister for Social Welfare who informed me that that matter is under constant consideration in that Department.  I had hoped for a possible announcement in the Budget of relief or benefit for such unfortunate people.  If it is not there this year, it may come.  I advocate it very strongly.  I urge the establishment of a national widows' pension fund to which it should be obligatory for every married man to subscribe who is not subscribing to the social welfare fund.</P>
    <P>We are particularly grateful to the Minister in his excellent Budget for one single item which has been of vast benefit to, I can safely say, 90 per cent of the farmers in my constituency, that is, the derating of agricultural land. Even though this item may not have meant very much in income to the Government, or to the local county councils, it was still a very big burden on those small farmers, particularly in my constituency because of the poor quality of the land in some areas. The abolition of employment orders is another improvement in the giving of assistance to these people, the less well off section of the community.</P>
    <P>The greatest incentive and encouragement given to the people in the West is the very strong commitment in this Budget towards the development of tourism and the assistance which is now being made available to the smaller man in the tourist trade, to the farmhouse holidays and guesthouses.  I do not know for how long these grants will be made available but they are available this year, and I hope and expect that they will be available for a number of years. In the Gaeltacht and in my constituency a grant is available for the extension of a guesthouse of up to 70 per cent of the total capital cost.  I knew, and anyone who studied the <Col N="418" /> tourist trade knew, that was absolutely essential to meet the rising demand for accommodation.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest successes we have had in the past number of years was the fantastic growth in our tourist trade, aided and assisted by the Department of Transport and Power, and very ably assisted by the present Minister.  No one in this country has done more for tourism than Deputy Childers.  Despite his tremendous successes, over the past two years I have heard constant harping and criticism of him by Front Bench members of the Fine Gael Party who were nothing but jealous of his ability and the success of the efforts which he has put into those Departments over which he was given responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of our life in Ireland to which I feel some attention should be directed, that is, the ever-increasing number of supermarkets which seem to pop up all over the country.</P>

      <P>I would suggest very strongly that the Government should not wait too long and, if necessary, they should introduce legislation to control the retail trade in our country.

      <P>If they are to be ousted now after performing such a tremendous social benefit, we cannot but be accused of being ungrateful.  I know that in our Constitution we have the power to see that business is not swallowed up by big operators.  I suggest that there may come a time when our Constitution may be contravened if something is not done about this matter.  If one considers the helter <Col N="419" /> skelter in the retail trade today, and if one looks at the overall position one can see that this trade which provided good solid employment for our people in which they could get married happily, rear their families, give them an education and be highly respected in the community, is now purely a handout affair in which the employment content is confined to young girls.  This will greatly affect the employment potential in the country.</P>

      <P>This is something which deserves the attention of the Government.  In the Report on Full Employment, it is interesting to note that the gross national product in 1965 was comprised, as to 22 per cent, of agriculture, 33 per cent, industry, and 46 per cent, services.  The projection of that committee was that the gross national product in 1980 would reach something like this : agriculture 12 per cent, industry 44 per cent, and services would stay more or less the same at 44 per cent.  This is a very striking statement and it emphasises very strongly that the future employment potential depends largely on industry.  It is estimated that to reach full employment on this projection 240,000 new jobs would need to be provided by 1980&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This is like the 100,000 new jobs you promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that 70 per cent of the jobs would have to be provided through industry.  That is a staggering proposal and it will mean that a large amount of our capital <Col N="420" /> resources will have to be invested in industry, in providing buildings and machinery.  This investment which will have to be stepped up from its present rate will necessitate waiting a number of years before the fruits will begin to show.  When one hears the Opposition Parties shouting for more money for this and more money for that, one wonders do they consider how the capital available to the Government should be distributed if we are to create a developing economy.</P>
      <P>The introduction of industrial estates is a good move.  This has got off the ground fairly quickly.  I understand that an estate is under construction in Waterford, and in Galway, we are laying the services for one at the moment. I hope these estates will be 100 per cent successful and that the lessons learned from them will be used in other areas. I hope we can entice people who own large sums of money and have them invested abroad to bring back that money and invest it here to promote industrial and other productive enterprises which will give good employment for our people.</P>
      <P>The Government have contributed to the vast growth which has taken place in Galway city.  In the past ten years, 27 industries have been State-aided. On behalf of the people of Galway, it is not unfair for me to state publicly the thanks of the people of that city for the development which has taken place there and which was initiated largely through the efforts of the Government.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
