    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying last evening, the various items which are going to increase our costs due to devaluation are first and foremost the 14.3 per cent on finished goods, and secondly, all our raw materials, which will have to bear this 14.3 per cent. On top of that, there is the increase in petrol prices which will raise distribution charges at home.  There are also the higher interest rates which will raise the costs of all businesses operating on borrowed money, and to my knowledge, most businesses operate at least 50 per cent on borrowed money, and in the case of importers, it is the total amount.  Importers will have to pay higher shipping rates, whether the other countries have devalued or not, due to the increase in the price of petrol.  Importers will have to pay more money because the £ is worth less.  There is also overland freight. This applies to many items because they do not all come to the docks. Some of them are carried overland.</P>
      <P>Another thing that will affect us is the withdrawal of the export rebates in England and the ten per cent corporation profits tax.  This again will increase the price of any goods we import from England.  Any goods with a duty on them will automatically be increased. If you have £100 worth of goods coming in, if you add on the 14.3 per cent, that is £114.3, and the ten per cent duty is £11.8 approximately.  If there is ten per cent duty to get the same physical money out of the increased article it would be somewhere in the region of 8.5 or 8.6 per cent rather than an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of ten per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said we will get increased exports to Britain.  I wonder is that true.  In England there will be a <Col N="1115" /> depressed market and we will have to try to sell to people who have less money.  It is pretty definite that there will be no wage increases, or very few. Costs will be going up by three per cent as Mr. Wilson said on television, but when he says three per cent, we can expect a couple of points extra. We have to sell to this market in which there will be less money.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says that tourism will be increased.  I wonder to what extent.  At the moment 80 per cent of our tourism is based on Irish people coming home or business people coming in from England, the Continent, or America.  Since Spain devalued, they will be getting the cream of this additional tourism anyway.  American visitors to Ireland are usually on package tours which include two days in each European capital.  In some cases they spend one night in Dublin and leave the following morning and are in a position to say that they saw the capital city.  The same applies in the case of American visitors to Paris.</P>
    <P>The Minister should check with Aer Lingus my suggestion that the only routes paying are to the capital cities and continental resorts.  Flights to Malaga have been discontinued and that probably also applies now to Madrid and the Iberian islands. American visitors are not interested in coming here for a week or fortnight unless they have relatives here or some other tie.  I agree that Bord Fáilte have made great efforts in promoting tours based on fishing and other sports.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned goods that would be affected by devaluation.  He listed very few.  In my view the only goods not affected but which could be very slightly affected are milk and byproducts of milk.  These products could be affected very slightly because of an increase in animal fodder.  That would be a very small thing in the south of Ireland where the majority of the creameries are located and where cattle are dry for three months of the year and are fed on hay.</P>
    <P>Some items were not mentioned.  It is estimated that coffee will go up in Great Britain by from 3d to 5d a 1b. and tea will go up by approximately <Col N="1116" /> the same amount.  Other things that will go up are jute, houses&mdash;I will deal with that subject later&mdash;watches, rubber. The Minister yesterday asked Deputy Dillon where does rubber come from. About 70 per cent of the rubber that is used is synthetic and is manufactured in the United States of America or a royalty is payable where it is produced in England under licence.  This is money going out of the country.  The price of cars will increase because of the increase in steel and other materials imported into England.  We import sand from Belgium for glass production. This will be increased.  Machinery, flour, timber for furniture and for every other item will be increased.</P>

      <P>I agree.  They will have to come down to that price. I agree on that.  Spirits imported from France or the Continent other than Spain will be increased.  Electricity will go up due to the increase in coal. Paper will go up.  Gas will go up, again due to coal.  Even the normal blade that we use will go up.  Machinery, soaps, edible oil, lead, copper will go up.  In fact, there are very few things that will not go up.</P>

      <P>It does not export much more to England.  The Minister mentioned that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would see that nothing extra was added, that there was no mark up by the importer, wholesaler or retailer.  I wonder will the Minister for Finance not mark up his profit out of the duties on goods coming in?  Say there is a 10 per cent duty.  On £100, that represents £10.  The goods now cost £114.3 minimum.  There are additions for carriage, transport and freight.  It could be £117 or £120.  Ten per cent on £120 is £12.  He is making an extra £2.  On £114.3 he is making an extra £1 8s. 8d. on this devaluation.  Will <Col N="1118" /> the Minister for Finance do the same as he makes every businessman, industrialist or importer do, that is, take the same physical profit, not percentage profit?  Will he do that if he is insisting that the citizens should do so?</P>
      <P>The shipping companies are not under price control but they were allowed to increase their freight charges about two or three days after devaluation was announced.  Could the Minister state now that the importer, wholesaler and the retailer can now automatically apply whatever increases are being charged to them and undertake to leave the books open for inspection? Otherwise it will take the Department of Industry and Commerce about three years to go through every item in every company.  Even to meet them and to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to them would take two years.  Why should not the Minister for Industry and Commerce make a statement that all these items can go up by the amount of the increase charged to them; that they should get an auditor's certificate that the price is correct and then leave their books open to inspection by the Department? Otherwise there will be a great deal of unemployment.  People will not import if they have to carry this burden themselves.  Importer's profit should be very small&mdash;in the region of ten per cent gross.</P>
      <P>The Minister or somebody on the Government benches said that the effect of this devaluation in respect of goods from non-devaluing countries should not be seen for a certain period. I do not know if the Minister knew that devaluation was going to happen but for the last 15 months French people exporting to this country sold subject to devaluation or charged one per cent to insure themselves against devaluation.  Then there are the people with perhaps a year's, six months or three months credit; with devaluation, they will have to pay extra and they will lose on what they sell in Ireland. They will not import any more if they are not allowed to put up prices straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the bulk of goods from non-devaluing countries was machinery.  That is not true.  Only one-sixth of the imports from these <Col N="1119" /> countries consists of machinery.  The bulk of the goods consists of raw materials, fruit, vegetables and so on. I cannot see imports of machinery being reduced to any great extent.  If spare parts are required for existing machinery, they will have to be purchased in the country of origin.  A man needing a new machine will buy a replacement from the country of origin of the original machine because his operatives will have become accustomed to that type of machine.  If he does not do that, he will have to scrap his machine and buy a different type. This might cause him grave inconvenlence.</P>
    <P>Most Irish manufactured goods are manufactured from imported raw materials.  The prices of all those will go up.  Only agricultural byproducts will remain possibly unaffected. Another thing about which we should be very wary is the fact that non-devaluing countries will now have stronger money than we have and, if they invest in Ireland, they will get a better return for their money.  It is my belief that they did not devalue because they appreciated the situation. No one should be allowed to invest in the retail end of our economy.  Should they be permitted to do so, the repercussions on our economy could be quite serious because, if manufacturers from abroad were permitted to enter the retail trade here, they would naturally push their own products.  The situation could be perilous, indeed, if we entered into the Common Market. A continental biscuit manufacturer engaged in retail trade here would be most unlikely to carry Jacob's or Boland's biscuits.  The Government should introduce some legislation to prevent any foreign capital going into the retail trade here.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the cost of living will go up by two per cent.  Experts in Britain&mdash;they can be just as wrong as the Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash; reckon that there will be an increase of sixpence to 1/6d in the £ on the housewife's purchases.  That will represent a 2½ per cent to a 7½ per cent increase.  Yet the Minister says only two per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> Has the Minister any idea of the amount of timber we import from devaluing countries as against non-devaluing countries?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get it for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain it is estimated that the cost of a £4,000 house will go up by about £80.  Here we import most of our plumbing fittings through Britain.  That will mean an increase in price.  With the interest and the increased cost of materials, the cost of a £4,000 house here will be increased by £100.  The grant of £275 has been in existence since 1948.  The Minister for Finance takes back out of that grant, through turnover tax and wholesale tax, something in the region of £140 to £150, leaving a net grant of £135.  With devaluation, that will become a minus figure.</P>
      <P>The man who borrows £5,000 to purchase a house gets tax remission. Suppose the repayment is £10 per week and he is allowed 9/- or 7/-, that means his repayment figure is £6 17s.  The man who borrows £2,000 gets no tax remission.  He will pay approximately £4 per week.  This housing grant should be paid only to those who really need it.  That would help to reduce the cost of living for the lower wage earners.  It might, too, prevent wage claims from trade unions.  Wage claims come about when the breadwinner finds he can no longer make ends meet.  Occasionally wage claims may be of the status character, but that is a rare occurrence.  If the interest on houses could be reduced, it would be of tremendous benefit to the lower paid worker.  With regard to this 14.3 per cent, or whatever it may eventually end up at, sort of safeguard or incentive on the world market&mdash;the European market mainly, I suppose&mdash; how soon can we gear ourselves to these markets?  If England and Ireland, or the devaluing countries, are successful, what are the chances of retaining them?  Consider the amount of money we will put into machinery.  Will this be a dead loss if the other countries devalue or when the pound gets so strong that it is coming up to the pre-devaluation rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Some 20 per cent of our exports go to non-devaluing countries.  I reckon we shall have to export another 20 per cent extra goods to those countries in order to get the same amount of money. This 20 per cent extra goods have also to be paid for as regards freight, petrol, various increases, and transport in the country of destination.</P>
    <P>Devaluation will give us a temporary advantage for new and probably better markets.  To retain this advantage, costs cannot go up.  The greatest culprit in relation to these costs is the Minister for Finance.  Government expenditure should not be increased.  There should be more efficiency in all Government projects and in the spending of their money.</P>
    <P>I should like to see taxes cut, thus preventing an exorbitant wage increase. The Minister says we shall have greater exports and therefore greater profits.  If these profits are made, surely we can pay for the reduction in the tax?  Then the worker or the wage-earner will not be looking for the same increase if he can buy things cheaper.  The workers should have money to spend on luxuries or semi-luxuries.  I reckon we cannot have a good export market unless we have good home consumption for the article and a lot of it purchased. The more of every article that is purchased in this country, the more that item can be produced cheaper and can be exported at a cheaper rate.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance himself produced the pamphlet <i>Work for All.</i> In that, he mentions that, by 1980, another £400 million should be invested in this country.  The most practical way in which that money can be re-invested in this country is by profit re-invested &mdash;so let us not make &ldquo;profit&rdquo; a dirty word.  Profit has to be made for reinvestment. As far as possible, tax concessions&mdash;particularly where export is concerned&mdash;should be given straight away.  Exporters have got tax rebates, grants for replacement of machinery. I consider this a very good thing.  Very often, however&mdash;this happens in every country, not necessarily in Ireland but in Ireland up to a point&mdash;when a company reaches a certain stage of profit, they say: &ldquo;We are getting enough out <Col N="1122" /> of it.  Let us not kill ourselves.&rdquo;  That is particularly so if one man has very nearly a controlling interest.  He is not hungry enough to make more money and thus to make more money for his country.  To give this man incentives, either for machinery or in tax rebates, is really getting the Government and the country nowhere.</P>
    <P>I consider that some system should be worked out whereby, along with the manufacturer who exports getting an incentive of machinery replacement or a grant towards it, the workers in such industry should get an incentive.  I do not mean a straightforward bonus and, because they get it, they do not come into work the next day.  I mean that, at a certain point of production, where there is profit, repayment of capital investment, after that, there should be some division for the workers.</P>
    <P>We must remember that, while there are a certain number of manufacturers, exporters and business people, there are about 20 times more workers.  I have heard tremendous criticism here from the Labour benches of bad employers. The Minister himself was present and heard it.  Most certainly, there are bad employers.  There are bad trade union officials.  There are bad employees. Luckily, they are only probably about 5 per cent.  You will get &ldquo;bad&rdquo; everywhere.</P>
    <P>If you are making a fortune out of business and you give a basic wage, the worker gets a bit bored.  If we want efficiency, we must get the worker who is willing to earn an extra £2 or £3 a week for hard work.  We must give him that incentive and, in that way, we shall get that 5 per cent.  You will get the bad worker or the bad employer&mdash; whoever it may be&mdash;to come up to standard.</P>
    <P>We have had experience of business with bad management but that is not so much the case now.  Most of these businesses go to the wall.  If there were this incentive for workers, the worker might do much more than management has done or will do.  The Minister should look at this matter and when he is giving those incentives to exporters he should, with the unions, the employers and the Department of <Col N="1123" /> Labour, work out some incentive to these workers to get a certain amount extra, over and above the minimum wage, if they work hard enough for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Two factors have taken place recently which have had profound repercussions internanationally, have highlighted our total and utter economic dependence on the economy of the United Kingdom.  They are, first of all, the devaluation of sterling which, of course, was not an unexpected event, shall we say, over the past five or six weeks, and, secondly, the restriction of the expansion of EEC by the likely consequential effects of the statement at the press conference by General de Gaulle recently which is bound to have international repercussions and again shows our strong dependence on the British economy and that our application was knit entirely&mdash;in spite of denials from the Government benches&mdash;into that of the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to the advice of OECD, an international organisation to which we belong for the purpose of receiving advice on matters national and international in our economy, we have built ourselves into the British economy to the exclusion of everything else.  The Minister for Finance had no alternative, in the light of the policy created by the Government themselves, but to devalue one minute after devaluation was announced in Westminster, which, in effect, is what happened here.  This means that there had been discussions going on beforehand between the ex-British Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt. Hon. James Callaghan, and our own Minister for Finance.  I wonder if the Minister would like to clarify whether any precautionary measures had been taken to deal with this obviously impending state of affairs within the economy of the United Kingdom, an economy, as I have said, with which we are fully and totally blended.  Had any precautions been taken&mdash;not so much by the Minister himself who of course is the Minister concerned with the issuing of credit finances and so on&mdash;to deal with the growing excessive percentage rates of charges there would be on imports of <Col N="1124" /> raw materials on which we, with our industrial policy, are practically entirely dependent?</P>
    <P>The Minister appeared on television to announce devaluation and I must admire his ability in dealing with a difficult situation, although I did not agree with a lot of what he said.  He tried to put the best complexion on it. He said our total percentage of imports for raw materials for the servicing of industry was only 35 per cent and he worked out a mathematical calculation which was worthy of the greatest economic genius of the day, that our rise in the cost of living would only be two per cent.  The Minister's words have already been belied by the subsequent turn of events.  Almost immediately afterwards there was a considerable rise in freight costs and nowhere more apparent perhaps than in the air. It was announced that Aer Lingus charges were to be increased considerably. I suppose the answer to that may well be that it was an inevitable result of the Suez crisis and so on, that the cost of raw materials, oil, fuel and so on, for aeroplanes would go up.  At the same time, one of the major reasons why they introduced that so soon afterwards&mdash;and this must have been a source of embarrassment to the Government and particularly to the Minister for Transport and Power who sees everything in the economic garden as being beautiful&mdash;was that they had to increase charges, they intended to increase charges, but extra charges were involved as a result of devaluation over and above the two per cent.  Therefore they increased their charges and put in the other charges on top of them, hoping that nobody would notice.</P>
    <P>That seems to have been one immediate sequel to devaluation.  It is fair, therefore, to ask the Minister for Finance that question in light of the fact that there must have been considerable discussion going on between him and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and he must have been privy to the events that were going to take place.  The proof of that is that one minute after the British announcement of devaluation was made, the Minister for Finance was able to state in Dublin <Col N="1125" /> that we were going to devalue as well. I am not saying anything against him for that because if the decision was going to be taken, it was only right that it should be taken at once so that everybody would know where he was. It does prove, however, that there had been extensive discussions beforehand and for that reason extensive precautions should have been taken to prevent in every possible way any hardship or any unemployment that might flow from increased costs for raw materials.  What precautions were taken in regard to stockpiling of raw materials here in order to cushion our economy as far as possible?</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton raised the question of timber imports.  I am one of the people who has always felt that we import too much timber but, be that as it may, Irish timber has been blackguarded by the fact that it is cut down today and used tomorrow and the theory has grown up that Scandinavian or Russian timber, which grows more slowly in a colder climate, has a better potential than ours.  The timber we require should be imported from the devalued areas.  This would be a very simple thing to do and a just thing to do as well because the devalued areas are areas which are not associated with the communist hegemony.  In any case we would definitely lose on our imports of timber from Russia.  If we are not <i>au pair</i> with the £ or sterling within the confines of the Iron Curtain countries, such as Russia or Poland, we will have to pay more for timber.  It would not be justifiable to do that.  First of all, we would be supporting an economy the outlook of which is entirely inimical to the outlook of everybody in this country and, secondly, we would be giving them the advantages of trade which it would be of no benefit to us to give because we get nothing in return.</P>
    <P>To return to the press conference of General de Gaulle which, to my amazement, appears to have surprised so many people, it was quite obvious that that was going to happen, that the application of the British Labour Government was not going to meet with success on their road into Europe. When they were in Opposition&mdash;and of <Col N="1126" /> course Opposition Deputies express themselves rather more freely at times than Government Deputies&mdash;they had more or less indicated that theirs was not a policy of going to Europe, that they considered that would be inimical to the interests of Britain.  Then they did a <i>volte face</i> when they came into power and, as I suppose they were entitled to do when they got the books and saw the various economic difficulties facing Britain as a result of present trading relations, decided they would have a go at trying to get into Europe. For some reason, everybody, including economists, decided they would be sure to get in and that we would go in afterwards. On the basis of that, we scrapped the Second Programme for Economic Expansion which had not shown any great value beyond that of the paper it was written on.  Then we produced the Third Programme for Economic Expansion, written probably again by an economist in the background. I regret to say that in my humble opinion economists always seem to look the wrong way and not to be right in their forecasts.  They are always right on their figures but unfortunately the economic facts do not support the figures.  Anyway, we introduced a third policy and the third policy was based on the oft-stated fact &mdash;I am not accusing the Minister of having said this&mdash;by the former Taoiseach and the present Taoiseach, that we could assume we would be in the Common Market by 1970.  What happens to the third policy for economic expansion?  Is it unreasonable to ask that question?  The Second Programme for Economic Expansion lies in ruins. The third programme is based on a link with the United Kingdom and on the assumption that we, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark and the other applicants would be members of the Common Market by 1970.  I think it is fair to suggest that it looks as if that will lie in ruins as well.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to a clear statement from the Minister for Finance as to what the future policy of the Government is.  I would like to suggest to the Minister for Finance, who, I feel, is an influential Minister as regards the projections of policies <Col N="1127" /> issued by Fianna Fáil for the future, that they might take another look at the situation and might decide that the overall policy of being the be-all and end-all economically to Britain should be reconsidered.  I am a very fair-minded Deputy even though I am making these polite but somewhat strong criticisms of Fianna Fáil, and there is no getting away from the fact that the present policy of a link with the United Kingdom, which was accepted on this side of the House as being a slow process whereby we all went into Europe, now lies in ruins.  Therefore the Government must look for a new policy.</P>
    <P>I have not yet had an opportunity of reading the Minister's speech in full but there is no evidence in his speech that there is a new policy in the offing, and if there is not a new policy in the offing, what will the future hold?  Sterling has been devalued as a matter of expediency: Britain had no alternative.  They had no chance of getting a loan which was essential to keep the pound stable.  We have just as much interest in seeing that sterling survives as any other country in the sterling area.  If the bottom falls out of sterling, then the bottom will also fall out of the dollar.  If sterling takes a knock, there will be a sort of crisis. There will be anxiety all over the world to preserve some form of capital existence.  All the countries of the world are interested in seeing the maintenance of a stable monetary system, because any financial crisis upsets trade and interferes with the economy.</P>
    <P>One thing did emerge from General de Gaulle's press conference.  I am not to be taken as an out-and-out admirer of General de Gaulle but I do recognise him as a realist, as a man with considerable strength of character.  He is a parliamentarian who knows where he is going.  He takes his own decisions in the light, I suppose, of the expert advice he gets.  One thing which did emerge from this press conference which is of considerable interest is that he indicated that an international monetary fund would be the most realistic approach to dealing with these continual crises that are taking place <Col N="1128" /> within the sterling area and even within the dollar area.  That is not alone his idea.  That is an idea that was advocated when I was a member of the Council of Europe two years ago.  A report was brought in which pinpointed the fact that every country in the world is becoming more and more dependent on other countries, that the fluctuations that take place in regard to the balance of payments have their effect in different countries, and no country is as dependent as one with a small economy like ours.  The Minister attended some form of international monetary conference in South America of recent months, and I think those were the matters which they discussed. When he returned, he gave a press conference and indicated his view in favour of this sort of international monetary control.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning these things to the House to try to help the Government in the predicament in which they find themselves now.  I am trying to say to the House that their foreign policy lies in ruins.  Their foreign policy was based on the assumption that we would be in the Common Market by 1970.  I have tried to show that their economic policy lies in ruins in that we are entirely dependent on the British economy.  At the moment Britain is a debtor country, owing vast sums of money in order to maintain itself in existence.</P>
    <P>Therefore there has to be a radical change of policy.  It will be very difficult for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to come in here, after their complete mesmerisation by the British Prime Minister and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, and indicate that Ireland intends to take an independent line and move realistically with the position in which the world finds itself today.  The avenue of escape seems to be the formulation of a new policy based on this international monetary system of which I have spoken.  This is a simple system with overall monetary control based on an international standard whereby countries who prove they are worthy of loans can be afforded such assistance where it is necessary to cushion them against <Col N="1129" /> a disastrous balance of payments.  Even the smallest country in the world can be affected by economic disturbance of any sort.  Their trade goes awry with whoever they are dealing with and they are obliged to impose restrictions, quotas and so on, which is divorced from the aim and objects of countries in the world today who are striving to get freer trade.</P>
    <P>There is the let-out for the Minister, to formulate a new policy giving us a certain amount of independence.  What really happened in the United Kingdom &mdash;I regret to find myself going back to this subject but I will have to do so as it is the policy of the Government&mdash;is that they failed to pay their way.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer first said he would not devalue the pound and later found it necessary to do so.  He believed that under the policy they had, they would be able to pay their way, but they were not able to do so.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do?  Are we going to stay in that narrow, economic sphere in which we find ourselves, or are we going to look further afield? We could do that under a new financial policy.  We could look for wider diversification of trade.  The Minister may say that is exactly what the Government are doing.  One encouraging sign on the wireless this morning was that the Minister for Agriculture is restricting the import of fertilisers from Poland or the Soviet Union, I think, because they do not trade with us.  That is the sort of thing I like to see.  We should try to trade with countries from which we are likely to get trade.  I would probably arouse considerable indignation in socialist circles by saying I think there would be no harm in our taking tobacco from Rhodesia where we would get it at a reasonable price, and not have to pay a price in excess of that, a price we will have to pay for our imports from outside the sterling area.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I should like to say in an endeavour to make things easy for the Government so that they can escape from the unfortunate stranglehold they have created for themselves.  They are tied hand and foot.  I do not think anyone with my traditions can be accused of being anti-British, <Col N="1130" /> but I am realistic and I like to see my own country prospering and going ahead.  I do not like to see 50,000 or 60,000 unemployed, and with no prospect of employment in the future.  Nor do I like to see the cream of our nation emigrating.  Some of those who have passed their school examinations and even those with university degrees cannot find employment in their own country.  I do not like to see that happening.  I should like to see the country prospering and going ahead.  I suggest that no matter what the Minister says about a two per cent increase in the cost of living, that figure was worked out by some economist, and he was wrong.  It was worked out on the basis of 35 per cent of imports but imports do not stay at 35 per cent. That is where the figures went wrong. That 35 per cent is expanding into greater production.</P>

      <P>I did not say that at all.  I think the Deputy is confusing two different things.  There is the general price level and the cost of living.  I said that the effect of devaluation should not mathematically result in more than a two per cent increase in the general price level.</P>

      <P>The cost of living is on a narrower basis altogether.  The general price level includes the price level of every item&mdash;all the items that go to make up the economic structure. The cost of living is a very special index prepared on a very special basis.</P>

      <P>What else is the cost of living depending on except the price level?  If my wife or the Minister's wife goes to a shop and has to pay, as a result of devaluation, 1d or 2d more for a loaf, is not that an effect on the cost of living?  With the crisis in Britain at the moment and with the slaughter of beef&mdash;and we have certain restrictions here&mdash;the price of meat has gone up.  That must affect the cost of living.  Anyway to continue&mdash;I do not think the Minister and I are likely to agree on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputy was thinking in terms of imports from non-devaluing countries coming into the country at a certain cost and then going into the general stream of production and becoming a greater percentage than the percentage I gave, but the percentage I gave related to imports from non-devaluing countries as a percentage of the total figure&mdash;the total gross national product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I accept that the Minister is right on that point, would he not agree that the increase is not entirely dependent on the raw materials themselves but on freight charges and many other considerations? I cannot argue with the Minister because he has facts put before him by experts.  I have no one but myself.  I am not a very intelligent fellow as the Minister knows, and I <Col N="1132" /> cannot see things as clearly as he can. Would he not agree that two per cent is a very conservative figure, a very dangerous figure?  The Minister suggests that he did not give that figure&mdash; that the rise in costs would not mean two per cent on the cost of living.  I cannot follow that: I am not keen enough to see that point.  If there is a two per cent rise in costs, you are extremely lucky if you can contain yourself to two per cent on the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That was proved more than anything else by the turnover tax&mdash;one of our greatest national disasters.  The turnover tax was 2½ per cent and the increase in the cost of living was considerably beyond that.  I will give way to the Minister if he wants to contradict me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that a rise in the general price level must inevitably affect the cost of living and the cost of living index.  I want to try to make a distinction between two things.  There is a very real distinction. The cost of living index is scientifically prepared on the basis of a specified list of items, whereas the general price level is a different thing altogether. The whole spectrum of the economy is reflected in the general price level. Where I gave the figure of two per cent, it was worked out on the basis of the percentage of GNP represented by imports from non-devaluing countries.  On that basis, I worked out that those imports from non-devaluing countries should not have an effect of more than two per cent on our general price level.</P>

      <P>I do not want to detain the House.  The clocks have stopped so I do not know how long I have been speaking.  There must be some review very soon of our social benefits.  I suggest that the Government should look at what the effects are likely to be of this change in the circumstances within the State, because it means a considerable revolution.  The value of the £ is changed virtually overnight to 17/-. That is what it boils down to, not necessarily entirely within the confines of our own country.  But it does mean a devaluation of the purchasing power of the £ or an increase in costs, whichever way you like to put it.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Government should not fix themselves to two per cent because, whatever increase there is, the social dependants should be entitled to more than two per cent, and I would ask the Minister for Finance to be as generous as possible when the occasion arises.</P>

      <P>This debate in many respects has been rather a disappointing one for this House.  I do not want to add to the disappointment, but somebody should point out the utter failure of the Fine Gael Party as an Opposition.  Instead of a serious economic debate where there could be a proper discussion with the homework done on a problem like this, we have had the usual, recriminatory type, general admonition, general allegation, that the Government and the Minister in particular either had not done their job or did it badly, a fuzziness about the implications and altogether an utter lack of a point of view or a constructive stand for an Opposition.  They have even forgotten that the job of an Opposition is to oppose.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether we would like it or not, but what I am saying is that the Fine Gael Party has now completely failed.  If there is a personal matter, if there is a campaign against a person or anything like that, you will be in the field, but in regard to your job as a Parliamentary Opposition you completely fail. How many things have got through this House with the tacit acquiescence of Fine Gael when they should have been opposing if they were a Parliamentary Opposition?  I say this in all deliberateness because listening to the performance of the Opposition as far as Fine Gael is concerned in this debate, I still do not know where they stand.  There are a number of platitudes mouthed that everyone will agree with, such as, of course, devaluation was inevitable for us once it occurred across the water.  This is simply used as a kind of stick to beat the Government. Everybody admits that.  Has anybody from the Opposition benches there attempted to give us a constructive analysis or even a destructive analysis that could be graced with the name of a serious analysis?  No, not a word.</P>
      <P>One of the defects in this Dáil at the moment is the failure of the principal Opposition Party to do their job here in the House.  With their pettifogging small talk, I am in the position now that I can find nothing to bite on to answer them but I am glad to say that I can say something to the Labour Party in a constructive and, I hope, as it should be, argumentative vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that, I should like to say something about the subject before us.  The £ has been devalued.  That devaluation was a decision in which this country had very little choice and there is no <Col N="1135" /> point in going into the ramifications of our existing trading and financial pattern.  It is sufficient to remark, as has been remarked on every occasion that this thing has been discussed, that there has been a compulsive feature leading to the ultimate decisions, and this is, namely, that the financial patterns and financial arrangements for a small country like this are very largely dictated to by trading and economic conditions.  We have no large external commitments.  We have no large responsibilities in wide international monetary matters and, therefore, our financial arrangements appear to me to be practically wholly dictated in this country by our economic and social relations.  Every Government&mdash;I will say that&mdash;and every Party&mdash;I will say this&mdash;have tried since the beginning of the State when they were in power to develop the economy here in the best way for the benefit of our people.  So, I see very little point in trying to argue as to whether this devaluation was done voluntarily or not.</P>
    <P>Addressing myself to the Labour Party, out of all this some very serious and important lessons are to be found. It is not an accident, neither is it their fault, that two successive Labour Governments in England should have had the misfortune to have to weather a very adverse economic situation, on both occasions involving devaluation. It, therefore, is of some interest to enquire why that should have been, quite apart from the mere timing that such a Labour Government were in office on both occasions.  But, before developing that point, I again want to be quite clear on what the likely effects are and what was the problem in devaluation both for Britain and incidentally for us and also to underline the sincerity and the effort which the British Government made in this matter in their own field.</P>
    <P>Reading the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in <i>Hansard</i>&mdash;I understand he has since resigned&mdash;one cannot but feel the sincerity of what was said and one cannot but feel a certain sympathy with a man, and men, who had fought so valiantly and <Col N="1136" /> who in the end had to do the hard thing.  We have had many instances of this in history.  I can think of an example in the last war when, after a gallant stand, a military unit had no alternative but to surrender.  Although politically, from a socialist point of view and from the point of view of economic policies, I would be poles apart from the Labour Party in Britain, I cannot but feel a certain sympathy and I should like to take his opportunity of paying tribute to them for the battle they fought.</P>
    <P>With these preliminary remarks, let us analyse now the situation.  Having seen what the situation was, let us see why it developed as it did.  What was the situation?  I can do no better than take an authoritative source.  I can do no better than base myself on what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said on 24th July of this year.  He dealt with the economic situation.  He said it was the policy of the British Government to resist devaluation.  He said they would fight to save the economic situation. He put the reasons very clearly, reasons of objective validity regardless of who said them and where.  I quote now from the Chancellor's speech in <i>Hansard:</i></P>
    <P>The very fact that this is happening could lead to speculation that might be dangerous, and I therefore tread on it very firmly now.  Fortunately the Government's position is too well known for this to become a serious matter.  The fundamental fact about devaluation as a deliberate act is that it consists in making the produce of the labour of our people cheaper while making the product of foreign labour dearer.  For every hour's working at home we command less of world resources.  The purpose of this is to ensure a sudden and large-scale shift in resources from home use to export.  The means by which this can be done is by increasing taxes or reducing Government spending programmes, or both.  That is what one has to do to make devaluation work.</P>
    <P>Let there be no dodging about this.  Those who advocate devaluation are calling for a reduction in <Col N="1137" /> the wage levels and the real wage standards of every member of the working class of this country.  They are doing this, and the economists know it.  I do not think that some of my hon.  Friends have hard hearts &mdash;they are just good men fallen among economists, bad economists. There are good and bad economists.</P>
    <P>If there were devaluation in this country, any effort on the part of the organised workers to counteract it by securing higher wages should be ruthlessly resisted.  If the benefits of devaluation were to be secured we would need another incomes freeze in circumstances when prices would be going up fast....</P>
    <P>The TUC has gone on record as being opposed to devaluation.  I am not surprised....</P>
    <P>This is a nostrum among economists who are quite clear-sighted and cold-hearted about its purpose. Unfortunately it has been picked up by a number of people who clamour for devaluation because they believe that it is a way of avoiding other harsh measures.  They are deluding themselves.  The logical purpose of devaluation is a reduction in the standard of life at home.  If it does not mean that, it does not mean anything, because if it does not result in wages being held back, or if wages cannot be held back, and if one reinflates at the same time as one devalues, one loses any arguable benefit of devaluation....  Devaluation is not the way out of Britain's difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would recommend Deputies of the Labour Party in particular to read that speech.  We can only admire and sympathise with the Chancellor in the problem he had to face.  He frankly took responsibility.  On 22nd November, he had this to say:</P>
    <P>This is the old argument.  It is almost a wearying economic argument now.  We go through the regular motions of it time after time&mdash;productivity, prices and incomes, getting the exports going on, and so on.  I think that hon.  Members must be as tired of listening to it as I am of <Col N="1138" /> talking about it.  There are no new truths in this field.  Everything that I said on 24th July is true, and it cannot be escaped.  All these things are so, and they are not altered, but I do not think that we get anywhere&mdash;and this is why I refrain from exhortation as I was asked to do&mdash;by hectoring, or lecturing, or moralising, either to the workman on the bench, who is not listening anyway, or to the man who reads the <i>Financial Times</i> who regards all this as a lot of political claptrap.  There is no moralising about this, but nor do I like the cheap cynicism that extends to almost every line and vein of our country at the present time. </P>
    <P>Frankly, I think, through all this&mdash; and this is certain tragedy&mdash;here is a performance with a certain touch of greatness and it is sad to see that that should be the outcome.  But, now, let us ask why&mdash;and it is here that I specifically address myself to the Labour Party.  I am sorry there is none of them here to listen to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a reasonable case, which is more than what can be said for the Deputy's Party.  There is a touch of greatness in all this.  Quite apart from the complications of defence commitments and world situations which were there and undoubtedly were serious factors for the British Labour Government, both now and in the past when they had to experience the same type of humiliation, there were economic factors at home at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Labour Party, as I was saying or intended to say, will agree with me that nobody can impeach the purpose and the resolution of the present British Government in facing, according to their lights, the problems which confronted them, and particularly <Col N="1139" /> the economic problems.  One must pay them that tribute.  If I may make an aside, my own criticism would be that an over-addiction, perhaps, to certain doctrinaire approaches in certain quarters might have been contributory but that is beside my point here at the moment until I come to it later. That Government fought hard, fought very hard, to save the £, fought very hard to put the British economy on a competitive basis.  That Government failed because there was not there, in the community as a whole, a will and a purpose and a confidence in the future and what could be done, to back that Government up.  The basic fault was that British industry, with its disruptions and other things, was not able to fight in the hard world economic market.</P>
    <P>All this talk, these platitudes or truisms to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred are, on the other hand, real hard facts.  If a country or a community does not produce enough and does not earn its way, difficulty and poverty are the inevitable penalty for the failure to earn one's way and succeed in the battle of life.  I have often said it in the past, again, a truism, and many in this House have made the humble and simple comparison between the individual making a success in life and paying his way in the community.  That analogy is toilworn and wearisome, but it has much in it and, whether it be the community or the individual, there is much inescapable truth in the fact that one must compete to live.</P>
    <P>The British Government had, of course, the problem of confidence which stems from these things&mdash;the lack of confidence.  There were political issues, too, there&mdash;I will freely admit &mdash;but, basically, it was a question of the faith of a people in being determined to survive and doing it.  Those of us who have had the opportunity, on occasion, since the last war to go abroad will have seen what other countries were able to do in adversity. Perhaps it is a lack of some of that spirit in these climates that is as much responsible for the difficulties today as anything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> When one sees what Germany did&mdash; Germany, defeated, divided and penalised, who could fight back to the position in which she is today.  France, under a great leader, who restored the morale of that great country, is now in, I would say, a commanding position. Why?  the reasons are not far to seek. But, in seeking these reasons, we must appreciate what has been done.  France was defeated, divided, occupied and all of these other things&mdash;and she is the Queen of Europe today.</P>
    <P>The Japanese&mdash;that great people of the East&mdash;the first victim of nuclear power, have recovered and have a happy and a prosperous people, a people who were so devastated as to be little short of the point of annihilation. Any of us who have seen them in recent years, and their recovery, can only marvel.  They could command the ship building trade of the world, practically, within that short space of years.  In this town here, you will see Japanese motor vehicles and motor cycles popular with our people, popular because they are a good product.  The Japanese were able to sell them, the whole half of the world away, at competitive prices.  Mind you, they had their world competitors in these fields much nearer home.  It was not a question of a vacuum.  It would be invidious to mention the names of scooters but they attest the fact.</P>
    <P>I have seen the Japanese motor industry. I have seen the way Japanese workers work.  I have seen the interest the Japanese take in producing their machinery.  I have seen the intense interest and the intense way they share in the building of their industry and the pride they get out of their success as well as the remunerative reward.</P>
    <P>Now, remember, those who talk socialism, and so forth, that the whole tradition and the whole structure of Japan was anything but socialistic. Nevertheless, that great people could achieve what they have achieved. Those of us who have had the privilege of seeing it can only marvel at what they have done.  As I am talking on that&mdash;though I think the myth has long ago exploded&mdash;it is a myth that it <Col N="1141" /> is done on sweated labour.  It is a myth that the standard of living of the Japanese people is low.  I have never seen anywher happier, better fed, better clothed children.  The people themselves, in their factories and in their houses, may not have the same idea of certain luxury spending that we have but I, for one, would prefer the cultural attitude of these people to some of the things on which we, and people like us in Europe and across the Atlantic, can find occasions for expenditure. It was not only in ship-building or in manufacturing for export that a people like this could develop in their own home; they developed their education, their roads, their tourist traffic.  It would be an education for a lot of people to see what a country like that can achieve especially when you consider the time in which it was achieved and the base from which it was achieved.  It is time that people like ourselves in this part of the world reflected on the realities of life.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege of speaking to the heads of the trade union movement and to employers and others in Germany and the co-operation and the realism of these people was something to be admired and, indeed, imitated. It is no accident that they too have recovered.  There it is for us to see&mdash; the French, the Germans and the Japanese.  They can do it, why cannot people on this side of the world do it? Even behind the Iron Curtain, which political and other recriminations have made it popular to decry and to see the position in almost a warlike atmosphere, let us not delude ourselves or fail to realise the near-destitution from which the Soviet Union raised itself to its present day achievements.  These things did not happen by accident. Where there is a will there is a way. The will must be the will of the whole community and there must be co-ordination and support from the various elements of the community to achieve the welfare of the whole.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am addressing myself to the Labour Party and I do this in the belief that there are many people who take what is called the labour point of <Col N="1142" /> view who are as sincere as anybody else in wishing to get the results that we all profess to desire and to which we pay the due lip-service when the occasion arises.  I should like to point out the difficulties in which the British Government and the Chancellor were in and for Deputy Tully's benefit, in case he might be misled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know; I am not making any point about that.  It is because of the utter failure of the Party on that side to do the Opposition's job that I am addressing myself to the Labour Party as the people who appear to be taking the subject seriously.  There is a balance required in this and if we are going to look for causes, let us look at all the causes.</P>
      <P>There has been talk about profits and there is always talk on the Labour side about management, but it should also be remembered that there are problems arising from costs and restrictive practices. There is no use in either side blaming the other.  That does not help to get us any further.  There is probably a lot to be done on both sides but the essential thing is to secure the necessary co-operation from all sides. I can sympathise with Deputy Tully sometimes if he feels that all the blame is to be laid in certain quarters, but whatever contribution there is to inefficiency in the competitive world in which we have to live and survive there are certain other factors: it may be the lack of enterprise in management, or the failure of management, but it can also be restrictive practices, costs and, above all, stoppages, the moral effect of which can go very much further than the actual circumstances which brought the situation about.  I say that because it arises in this context here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I was quoting the British Chancellor's speech of July and later of the 20th November and in between there was a series of disasters.  There was the dock strike and other disasters in which he and the British Government, loyally, did not seek to find excuses.  One must admire them for <Col N="1143" /> that.  It was the atmosphere of uncertainty, of unrest, the adverse affects of the dock strike and other strikes, which all added up to make the Chancellor's problem insurmountable.  In Britain and in the markets of the world the effect on confidence was, in proximate nature, something more than the straw on the camel's back. The brave, and I believe very sincere, battle that was fought by the Chancellor and the British Government will be remembered but when the inevitable came, not the least of the forces operating to defeat the battle, so well and so long sustained, with a very large measure of success, was the effect of these disturbing incidents I have mentioned.  There we have it.  It is a fact now.  The problem on both sides of the Irish Sea is to deal with the problem that is still there, to take whatever advantages there are in the situation, and to cope with the main disadvantages that are inherent in it. This can only be done by the concerted efforts of the community, and in a sense, for us here in Ireland, this calls for as much patriotism and co-operation amongst all sections of the community as any other emergency.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, if there was any criticism I would have of the British Labour Government, it would be that in their policies there were two weaknesses. One was that the Labour Party would appear, in certain of its elements of policy, to be sectional.  That is almost a fatal fault if it is allowed to develop.  The other one is the commitment to doctrinaire policies.  Life is not just a fixed state where you can solve problems for all time.  It is a fluid thing.  A certain element of pragmatism must go into it and one must adjust to the historical situation at any particular time.  That is another thing to be guarded against.  I would confine my criticism of the performance of either of the Labour Governments of Britain that I mentioned to that, but I would deplore that they could not have got more support, more co-operation and more wholehearted confidence and belief in the possibility of success for what they were doing.</P>

      <P>Yes&mdash;not a little, a lot.  When people turn in on themselves recriminating, that is a sign of defeat.  The thing to do is to get together and plan for the future.  What I am appealing for in this argument to my friends in the Labour Party is that all factors will be taken into account.  It does not do, as I said in the simple illustration I gave, just to talk about prices, profits and management. We must be equally realistic about restrictive practices, costs and demands. It is futile and dangerous to talk about restrictive practices, wages demands and so forth if we are not realistic about the other matters I mentioned and <i>vice versa.</i> I do not think I can put it any more fairly or sympathetically than that.</P>
      <P>There were some speakers across the floor, who, as usual, tried to insinuate something into what the Minister said that was not a fair reading.  What is the impact of devaluation in concrete terms?  Immediately, of course, imports from outside the sterling area are bound to go up in price.  That is an inevitable consequence of devaluation, but the purpose of the exercise is to sell your own goods more cheaply, but you have to buy dearer.  At home the actual value, from an overall international point of view, of savings and reserves will decrease. However, the Minister is perfectly right when he says there should be no immediate increase in the price of purely domestic commodities.  For instance, it is natural that coal from America should go up.</P>

      <P>Has it?  I was not aware of that.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer said on the 20th November, and again I quote <i>Hansard:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no need for all <Col N="1145" /> prices to rise, and the Government intend to maintain a careful check on the movement of prices to ensure that there are not unnecessary increases. Because some rise in prices is inevitable, the Government will take, at the right time, the steps that may be necessary to protect the most vulnerable section of the community from hardship.</P>
    <P>Everything that the Minister for Finance has said either before this debate or on this debate is correct and justified.  Another thing we should take into account here is that just as confidence was such a vital thing in the whole battle of the £, if we may call it that now, so for coping with the economic and financial problems that are before us from this day forward, this element of confidence will continue to be of importance.  It is doing ourselves a disservice if we fix on the points of difficulty and aggravate them by over-emphasising them, not that they are not important.  This constitutes an attack on confidence which in turn can only bring further adverse effects.  On the other hand, if we take an optimistic approach while realistically dealing with the problem&mdash;I am not suggesting for a moment we should evade them&mdash; we can make the most of the situation. The Minister is perfectly right to point out as objectively as he can what are the advantages and disadvantages and not to overemphasise the disadvantages in a situation like this.</P>
    <P>The Government are not just one side of a debating society.  The Government have to implement policies, to do things.  They have to solve problems, many of which are well high insoluble and very few of which admit of a clearcut simple solution.  That is the way Government forces are built even in authoritarian countries.  The Government will have to face these problems as they arise and deal with them as best they can.  That has been the case for all previous Governments and will be the case for all future Governments.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the co-operation of the whole country, and all the people, and all the House, with the Government in office to deal with the problems that are there.  Recriminations <Col N="1146" /> do not get us anywhere.  It would have been much better if instead of taking advantage of every wind that blows to make shallow attacks on the Ministers and on the Government, as the Fine Gael Party have done, we had constructive, informed, realistic, and relevant debates on our economic issues. Then perhaps this Parliament would be more effective, and then perhaps all of us who have our duty to the public to do might have been facilitated in doing what we are seriously trying to do, and the Government in particular, in doing their work as the Government of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting, as indeed it is tempting, to follow Deputy de Valera through his labyrinthine criticisms of the Fine Gael Party, but apart from a few general observations, he left the labyrinth unlighted. As I interjected while Deputy de Valera was talking, he used to be a reasonable man when he earned his bread among reasonable men, but from the ivory tower of his authoritarian executorship, he appears to have deteriorated considerably.  In his long dissertation on the virtues of the Japanese, the Germans, the French, and the British of course with their socialist limitations, he branded himself as a dyed-in-the-wool Tory, poles apart from the Labour Party here or in Great Britain.  May I come back to a discussion of mere Ireland and the effects of devaluation?</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement seemed to fall under three main headings.  First, he dealt with the West and what he chose to call western development; then he dealt with devaluation; and the third part of his speech comes under the heading of decentralisation. In some strange way decentralisation appears to be associated with what is called the revitalising of the west of Ireland.  I will have something to say on that when I come to it.</P>
      <P>Dealing with western development, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1966-67 a supplementary provision of £5,000 was taken for Special Aid to Projects in the West. In this year's original Estimate the provision was for £20,000.  I <Col N="1147" /> announced in my Budget statement, however, that this provision of £20,000 would be increased to £250,000 in order to create a fund, to be known as the Special Regional Development Fund, out of which payment would be made to assist worthwhile projects in the West.  I am taking a Supplementary Estimate along with the Main Estimate for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Then we come to an extraordinary paragraph:</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Fund has given a great impetus to the efforts of the County Development Teams and the Team Secretaries and will go a long way towards furthering the Government's policy of revitalising the West. </P>
    <P>I want to say here, as I have said elsewhere, that I have absolutely no faith in county development schemes or county secretaries.  That lack of faith is strengthened by the fact that after their appointment, they set off on massive tours of inquiry which they call surveys.  They meet the local branch of the NFA, Muintir na Tire, Macra na Feirme, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, and local development associations.  They try to find out from them what is needed in particular areas.</P>
    <P>Every Government Department, and every section of every Government Department, dealing with the problems of the West since the State was set up, have enough material for the advancement of that area to keep all the people in the West working for the next 100 years, to keep the population up, to keep the people static, and to keep the economy there alive.  Whenever anything is to be postponed, whenever anything is to be put on the long finger, when there is no money available, as there is no money available now, for a rivitalising of the West, or anywhere else, we must have a survey.  We must appoint people with relatively high salaries, unlimited expense accounts, and travelling expenses, to make inquiries as to what is needed in a particular area when everyone from the Minister to the local official operating <Col N="1148" /> in the area already knows.  Everyone knows where a pier should be built. Everyone knows where assistance should be given for the advantage of the local fishermen, but county development teams and their secretaries must travel and have discussions far into the night with the local people as to what is wanted and why a pier is wanted.</P>
    <P>There has been enough hoodwinking of such remnants of unsuspecting people as are left there now to be fooled, the rest having given up the ghost and gone abroad to Great Britain or America having got fed up of the pittances they got at home which offered them no future or no opportunities of stabilising their families in those areas, and having refused to listen any longer to the cajoling, the promises and the pie in the sky.  The remnants are left and it appears to be the solemn purpose of this Government through the various Ministers charged with what they call the revitalising of the west to fool the remnants further.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister for Finance what is wanted, without any survey team, where they should begin and where they should extend things that are already there.  There are all kinds of activities which must necessarily be spread out in order to keep the whole of the area vitalised and I will come to it in a minute.  I am not discussing the merits of the kind of decentralisation which is proposed but I do not see just now&mdash;I may be convinced later&mdash;how, in the words of a correspondent to the papers, an increase of a Civil Service population in the town of Castlebar, putting more money into the cash registers of the supermarkets and the shops in that town, will stop emigration from Achill, Ballycroy or from the Erris country from which I come.  I cannot see it.</P>
    <P>One reads in today's paper of the complaint being made generally by the county engineer of lack of facilities, lack of staff, of staff working overtime and that he cannot get them to stay there.  How you are to get a different group of people to stay there, I do not know.  But, if it is necessary to put them in a country town, why a country <Col N="1149" /> town that already benefits considerably from the fact that it is a county town, that has county council offices, all the county administration, all the hospitals and everything a town could have? What was wrong with Ballina or Claremorris if revitalising of that kind was necessary?  What was wrong in putting an exra 700, 800 or 900 people into Ballina, a town that has been very sadly neglected by way of industry, instead of into the already over-crowded town of Castlebar?  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that aspect as to why that town was chosen.</P>
    <P>For the moment there would appear to me to be only one reason for choosing the two towns.  The choice of Castlebar, I can understand, being in a strategic position in the West but with no greater claim than Ballina, Westport or, indeed, Galway, Claremorris or Sligo.  I see no reason for the choice of Athlone in the context of revitalising the West.  These two towns happen to be the places from which two Ministers of this Government come.  Whether they live there or whether they do not, it is extremely interesting.  I can tell the Minister that it is an operation that will be followed, not alone by me but by several other people, with great interest.  We will watch with unfailing vigilance the acquisition of lands for building purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to inquire as to who will be operating on behalf of the various commercial interests.  We will have to inquire as to where the contracts for the building of the mass of offices will go.  We will have to inquire as to whether certain consortia will benefit architecturally and otherwise from the professional work required for these purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> Although I have no quarrel with the transfer just at the moment, provided it is done, as the Minister promised, on a voluntary basis as far as possible, having regard to the percentages shown by a recently-taken ballot, I am wondering how the Minister is going to achieve voluntary agreement with the 82 per cent or, certainly, over 75 per cent in both Departments who are now against it.</P>
    <P>This probably is best reserved as a subject for discussion at some later time but I do not see inherent in the transfer a method of revitalising the West.  I know it has been hailed by local newspapers and by local representatives of all persuasions but I say that this enthusiastic reception does not take into consideration the purpose for which the transfer of the two Departments is stated to be adopted, namely, the revitalising of the West. Will the establishment of a Government Department in the town of Castlebar cure emigration?  It will not be the whole Department.  Let nobody think that the Secretary and the Assistant Secretaries and the higher echelons of the Department of Lands are going to Castlebar.  They will be here with the Minister.  It will be a division, large sections going out while the principal section will remain here near the seat of Government.  Will this transfer stop one person from emigrating or migrating from the neighbourhood of Castlebar?  Will it open one of the many empty houses from Castlebar to Achill, into Ballycroy and across the whole vast area to the north coast?  Will it put into production any one of the small holdings that lie fallow and unproductive around these empty houses?  I do not think it will although I should like to think that it would.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us how he thinks this transfer might solve some of these things, not all, or even how in time it might tend to do this, because I am afraid that this is the last gimmick left about the West.  Whether it is a good thing or a bad thing is another matter, but I am afraid it falls under the general heading of &ldquo;gimmickry&rdquo;. Something that is going to <Col N="1151" /> happen in two or three years' time&mdash;it will take longer than that&mdash;is not really a subject for immediate photographing of a Minister, with officials, pointing out land and altogether giving a most tremendous impression of great activity, activity which brings in its trail a prosperity never known before, but a prosperity which is still very far away.  All of this is, of course, beautiful propaganda for certain people.  In fairness to the Minister for Justice, he has not gone to Athlone yet to be photographed in a yacht sailing up and down the river, or looking at the land from vantage points, but no doubt it will come.  This hawking around of the external trappings of honesty and sincerity of purpose is no substitute for the truth and, if the truth is not there, as a permanent substructure of any proposed policies then the policies will collapse, and collapse only to increase the cynicism growth rate which appears to be the only genuine growth rate in this country at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now, instead of all that or, indeed, side by side with it, a great many things could be done by way of the provision of more and more fertilisers at reasonable cost, or even at subsidised cost; there could be the provision of more work in forestry; there could be a major harbour on the Mayo coast for fishing; there could be the provision of a large creamery separating unit somewhere near Ballina to cater for Sligo and Mayo.  These are the kinds of things that are part and parcel of the land on which they are situated.  They are close to the raw materials there available.</P>
    <P>There used to be a sect called the Malthusians who believed in the artificial limitation of a population, but they found this could not be done by words alone.  The Fianna Fáil Party appear to me at the moment to be the opposite of the Malthusians: they apparently feel they can have an artificial increase in population.  But they will find that this cannot be done by words alone.  Unless the work is there, unless there is stability and unless the people remain at home, unless there is a stoppage to this closing of houses <Col N="1152" /> and departure of families, all the civil servants in the world in the town of Castlebar, unless they are called upon to do things far and away beyond the line of duty, will not help to revitalise the West.</P>
    <P>We are told very complacently by Ministers of this Government and, in particular, by the Minister for Finance, that we are paying our way; everything is grand; there is nothing really to worry about.  Incidentally, by way of interjection, I asked the Minister if he still adhered to the view he expressed that he could see no reason why the cost of living here should be affected as a result of the devaluation of the £ in Britain.  He told me he did not accept he made that statement.  I knew I saw it somewhere.  I have it here now in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 19th November.  The subtitle is: &ldquo;No Reason for Cost of Living Increase.&rdquo; That is on the front page.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey, Minister for Finance, said last night that he could see no reason why the cost of living should be affected here as a result of the devaluation of the £ by Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has taken any steps to correct that as being a wrong presentation by the press of what he said, or a wrong condensation of what he said, or anything else, but I should like him to deal with it because I do not expect he will quarrel with what the newsmen say at this particular stage and I do not imagine that he will deny that he said something at a certain time.  It is not very material, but it is material from the point of view of the preservation of the dignity of ministerial office and it is important, from the point of view of the integrity of the gentlemen of the press who present the news, that it should not be denied that somebody said something which was published and which was not corrected immediately. I do not think the Minister really believed, if the Minister said that, that there would not be any change in the cost of living.  Of course there will.  As I see it, the £ now will purchase roughly 17/3 worth of goods from the countries which have not devalued.  Surely <Col N="1153" /> that must give rise to an increase in the cost of living?  I am not concerned with the technical differences between price levels and the cost of living.  If a price level goes up it means a rise in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>All I am concerned to do is to keep Fine Gael speakers right.  There are three terms in use in this debate: one is the general economic situation; another is general price level; and the third is the cost of living.  I admit they all interact on each other but, when we are speaking about them, let us be clear about which we are speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly clear and I am very grateful to the Minister for agreeing these things interact.  That is all I am saying.  If there is an increase in the price level, if it affects those items within the cost of living index group, then it must affect the cost of living.  Our concern must in the main be directed towards those people whose incomes are largely of social welfare origin or whose incomes, if they are working, are low enough, God knows, in these days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government might have considered some alternatives earlier <Col N="1154" /> than in fact it did, once it had not done that, and once the £ had been devalued, the Government had no option except to devalue.  Any Department of State, and the Department of Finance in particular, must keep its ear to the ground and must have known about these things long in advance.  The people with the money knew it.  They were shifting it long in advance.  If there was an alternative course, or even part of a course open to them they should have taken it, if it was going to be of advantage and I think the Minister is now bound to tell the House and the country what the alternative courses were, how they were considered, if suitable, and why they were not adopted, instead of taking the straight and easy line, when the time came. When the £ was devalued, there was nothing you could do about it.  You just had to get up and do it, and no more about it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to answer these questions.  Why was devaluation &mdash;that is, by the same amount as the devaluation in Britain &mdash; the best course?  I want to know if the Government prepared for devaluation by studying alternatives and, if so, what these alternatives were and, if they did not, why they failed to do so.  We want to know too, what advice they got and, if that advice contained reasons for following the British course of devaluation, what these reasons are. To say that we had to do it because of parity with sterling does not appear to me to be a valid reason, that is, if you have neglected to do anything about parity up to the time of emergency. Will our hands be tied in future in this country and bind us to any kind of devaluation that takes place?</P>
    <P>A further question poses itself at this time, a question that arises from the relative lowness of the amount by which sterling was devalued.  Is this, at this time, merely a partial devaluation as a test to see if they can get by on this much now and, if not, at some future time, not too far away, will there be a further devaluation?  If that is true, are the Government gearing themselves to meet such a situation?</P>
    <P>As I have said, reference has been <Col N="1155" /> made to the fact that we are paying our way here.  Does anybody ever think at all about what has been borrowed and what must be paid back?  As I understand borrowing, it is something that you get for some time at a cost which you must pay back: you must pay the service charge as well as the capital.  I think that is the experience of everybody.</P>
    <P>Since 30th September, 1957, that is, a little over ten years ago, a Government formed by the Fianna Fáil Party have borrowed £489 million.  They got £54¼ million from turnover tax; they got £5¾ million from wholesale tax; they got £24 million from prize bonds. Yet, in those ten years, the national debt has more than doubled from £342 million to £771 million.</P>
    <P>Is that a situation within which we can reasonably be described as &ldquo;paying our way&rdquo;?  I do not think so.  Perhaps there will be a good explanation for it.  I should like to hear it because, when you bring this down to a question of population unit, these figures represent a situation the same as if every man, woman and child in the State had borrowed £560 each in the past ten years.  Imagine the effect within a family if, say, a husband and wife and their six or seven children in ten years, borrowed £560 each.</P>
    <P>Since 1957, as well, the local authorities have borrowed a total of £128 million.  Still, in spite of obtaining all the kinds of things which I find it diffiserious cut-down in this country in the provision of money for employment in rural areas.  The amount of money available for road works is seriously cut this year as well as a reduction for the smaller road works from the Special Employment Schemes Office.  These are the kinds of things which I find it difficult to reconcile and, as Deputy Esmonde said, the First Programme for Economic Expansion is now not very much read as a fairy tale.  The Second Programme still attracts the odd one who must be wondering how it could possibly have gone wrong, having been introduced with such a fanfare of trumpets and its accuracy vouched for. The prosperity which was to come <Col N="1156" /> from the great principles it contained would be unbounded.  Where is that prosperity?  That Second Programme is in the fairy tale department, too.</P>
    <P>We now have a third Programme which, if I understand it correctly, is based upon the assumption that we are going into Europe by 1970.  It seems to be the underlying principle upon which this Government works out everything in recent times that 1970 is the great year, the year of opportunity, the year when we are to enter Europe. But, surely to goodness, in view of the situation of the past few days, we must at last realise the futility of such thinking. I am not talking about the press interview of General de Gaulle alone who made it very clear that 1970 is certainly not the year of vision for the British or for ourselves.  I am thinking of a statement made a short time before that by his Foreign Minister, Monsieur Couve de Murville, who said that, even if General de Gaulle went, French foreign policy would remain the same.</P>
    <P>How, then, can we continue to live in this world of make-believe, basing our assumptions for the future on entry into Europe by 1970?  This is 1967.  We are almost into 1968.  The years pass all too quickly, in every sphere of activity.  How long can we continue to lead the people into the very false belief that whatever is wrong now will be righted by our entry into Europe by 1970?  It must be perfectly obvious to even the least discerning that we are not getting into Europe by 1970 and that, even if General de Gaulle goes, French foreign policy will still present itself as an obstacle to British entry.  As of this very moment, we have done nothing and are doing nothing about associate membership because, as the Taoiseach blandly says &mdash; and I think rightly says because he cannot say anything else&mdash; our application for full membership is still there and we are awaiting a meeting of the Foreign Ministers concerned in December.</P>
    <P>If you have an excuse, use it.  This was not an occasion for the Taoiseach to bare his breast or for the headline in the newspaper, when the Taoiseach <Col N="1157" /> was going to Paris, &ldquo;Lynch Smooths the Way for Entry into EEC&rdquo;.  Did anybody ever hear such balderdash? How long the people will be prepared to put up with such treatment is another question.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera spoke about the Japanese, the Germans and the French. I think he was addressing himself to the Labour Party and I think he was placing the accent on work.  His point was, I think, that work and co-operation are the solution but not anything disruptive such as strikes, and so on, for which he blamed the final failure of the £ in Great Britain.  May-be he was right.  He said that where there is a will there is a way.</P>
    <P>Of course, all of these sayings still have some of the validity they had when they were originally thought out, but leadership, to my mind, is the thing that counts.  Leadership is the thing that will provide, in the end, the answer to all our problems, social, political and otherwise.  However, this leadership must be inspiring and it must be honest.  We hear a lot about ability. Somebody, somewhere, defined ability as the capacity to appear solemn.  If there is any one person in this Government who possesses that ability in full it is the Minister for Finance because, mark you, to appear solemn in the face of the difficulties which he has to face, and surmount if at all possible, demands rare ability.</P>
    <P>If I might return to the cost of living for a moment, I should like to say that it is going to go up and the Government should take some steps to offset it, particularly in cases where it might result in hardship.  Already we have seen where transport and passenger costs have risen considerably.  That is only a start.  Something should be done straight away for social welfare recipients.  In this regard I would be inclined to confine it to old age pensioners, particularly those living alone, if it makes any impact on them.  I would not be so concerned about social welfare recipients who have land and are able to draw upon their own raw materials to assist them, but certainly I would do something in the towns and cities for these people.  I <Col N="1158" /> would also try to offset any increase in housing costs by increasing the grant. Indeed, there is something to be said for what Deputy Belton has said, that this grant should not be readily available to people in a very high income group.  After all, the grant does not help anybody very much when it is taken into the overall costs of a house. The average purchaser of a house is not highly skilled in costing and I am inclined to think that the £275, or certainly most of it, goes into the pocket of the builder straight away.  The same might be said about petrol or oil and something should be done to assist people who will be affected.</P>
    <P>I am sure when the Minister is replying he will deal with this question of price levels and the cost of living. Everybody accepts the fact that this is going to give rise to an increase in the cost of living.  If it is kept at the two per cent, at which the Minister says the price level will be kept, it would not be too bad, but having regard to past experiences, I am inclined to think it will be higher.  These things always have a tendency to be higher than anticipated, often for reasons outside the control of the people who make the mathematical calculations.  Nevertheless, if it is as low as that I would think, having regard to our proximity to England, and enjoying and suffering with them parity with sterling, we must take our rap side by side with the advantages we enjoy as a result of our very large trade with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate, I want to say that the Minister should look realistically at the west of Ireland.  If he looks in his own office, or in any of the offices for which he is responsible, he will find hundreds, if not thousands, of letters from Deputies who went long before me recommending that certain things should be done in certain places. They were examined by the officials then charged to examine them and the Minister should stop this nonsense in 1967 of having surveys which are only costing more money when everybody knows where the thing should be done, how it should be done and what it will cost.  Indeed, if it had been done long ago, it might have helped to keep <Col N="1159" /> people at home and not have allowed the West to go.  What I am afraid of now is that after so long a period of promise, promise which has not been matched even to the smallest degree by performance, the people will refuse to believe&mdash;&ldquo;wolf&rdquo; has been cried so often.  I am not complaining about this, but I come from these parts and I cannot help having a certain amount of feeling in the matter, feeling of such an emotional content that from time to time it may cloud the real reasons. Nevertheless, when I go down there and spend time in the various parts of my constituency, all of which are known to me, and when I see, even as late as the weekend before last, two more houses on a main road closed and barred, I am disturbed.</P>
    <P>These were houses in which there were young families.  If a bachelor or a spinster is involved and if the house goes into disrepair eventually and then the bachelor or the spinster dies and the house is closed down, that is a different matter.  That is something probably for which the economics of the day may or may not have been responsible.  It might be that after very careful study it was the choice of the person concerned not to marry and to have a family.  But we see young men with wives and children, some of them not even of schoolgoing age, packing up, in spite of the fact that in his last Budget the Minister extended the employment period orders to all the year round, which I do not think is the solution.</P>
    <P>That is a statement that could cost me, and probably will cost me, an awful lot of votes down there because it will be represented that I am against this kind of thing.  I am not against people receiving social welfare benefits if they deserve them.  I do think the real solution for the west of Ireland begins with the decision of some Government to turn all this money into productive effort.  I cannot for the life of me see the economics of paying £4, £5 or sometimes even £6 or £7 a week to an ablebodied man and not ask him to do anything for it.  Surely there should be attached to <Col N="1160" /> this money a condition that will make a man drain his land, make a man clear his field of rushes, see to it that he keeps an extra cow, see to it, in a creamery area, that he supplies milk to the creamery?  This is probably what Deputy de Valera was talking about but did not spell it out, that productive work is the answer to the problem of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Whether civil servants going to Castlebar are going to give that wonderful inspiration of productive work to the rest of the country, I do not know: they may.  I do not know the Minister for Finance that well; all we can do is study him, study his utterances, see what he does and see how he works.  However, I am inclined to think he is realistic in his approach, and that he would agree that the continuation of employment period orders, the increase in the amount of dole money being given out in that way for nothing, is not the way to revitalise the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to make that statement, and have made it, irrespective of whether it will cost me a seat or not in this House.  I want to go farther and say that the Government who would bring about that situation wherein this money would be turned to productive effort, even if they were put out of office the next time because the succeeding Government would not change it, would be the first Government that would be doing something for the west of Ireland.</P>

        <i>(Dublin):</i> Maybe I am wrong, but that is the belief I have.  As these things develop, we shall create employment for <Col N="1161" /> doctors, dentists and various other professional people who are bound to generate as the population builds up in this district.  Deputy Lindsay also criticised our borrowing and said it was in the region of £750 million.  I am quite convinced that if we had borrowed that amount 20 years ago and could afford to service it, we would be building our houses, hospitals and other essential buildings at a much cheaper rate than they can be built today.</P>
      <P>A lot of criticism has come from the Opposition benches over the past few days of the decision in regard to devaluation.  This matter has been trotted across the floor of the House as if it were something of a national disaster, as if our whole economic structure had collapsed.  Indeed I view this as a normal business transaction, something which we would have to do if we were to keep our trade and our competitiveness with other countries. The Minister was criticised for complacency in telling the people about devaluation.  I saw the Minister make his statement at the bankers' dinner and later on television.  I got the impression that he dealt with the matter in a rational manner, realising there was no need to create alarm, that this was not going to be a setback to our economy.  He also adopted the line that this would be an incentive to our economy, that we were offered opportunities to go into other markets where devaluation had not taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must impress upon our industrialists the advantages that have been created for them.  If we can get a foothold in these markets with a good product at a competitive price, good design and well marketed, even if this present increase is eroded, I believe we can keep our product on sale there. It is vitally important that it should go out from this House that this decision is not a drawback to our economy, that it is an opportunity that should be availed of by our industrialists, trade unions, employers and employees of all descriptions.  The air of depression which has been generated by the Opposition in this House over the past two or three days is dangerous to our economy.  It is dangerous <Col N="1162" /> for the Opposition to be spreading this type of false doctrine.  We must remember the impression given to industrialists who intend to come to this country from America and the continental countries if they hear the doctrine which Fine Gael and Labour have been preaching for the past few days.  We must adopt an enlightened and positive outlook and see the real advantages which devaluation will bring.</P>
    <P>The same advantages exist for our tourism.  If we capitalise on these advantages, for instance, in relation to tourists from North America and from the non-devaluing countries of Europe, I believe we can further expand our tourism.  We can expand it with more hotels, good facilities and competitive prices.  It is vitally important that we should retain this 15 per cent, and to tourists this is the incentive they will have to come here.  Indeed I was hoping that Spain and other countries would not devalue, but there is no doubt that they took the same view as we take.  They have to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>As regards this idea of being tied to sterling and the effects of sterling on our economy, I believe that if we had our own currency, we would have to take the same decision as we took last Sunday.  We must always protect our markets and our best markets will be always with our neighbours. Denmark and the other countries that devalued did so to protect their own interests.  As I say, if we had our own currency and if devaluation took place, we would have viewed it in the same light.  Our industrialists and our business concerns must be protected. They must be protected to keep our industries going and our people working. Now we have an opportunity to expand our industries and I have great hopes that in the future, especially in 1968, our output will go up still further.</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago we were entering a difficult phase in this country and our industries and our balance of payments were running into difficulties.  These difficulties were brought about by factors outside the <Col N="1163" /> control of this Government.  I remember two years ago there was a realisation that things were not going as well as we would like them to go.  Certain measures were taken then.  Indeed they were quite unpleasant measures but they had to be taken to rectify that position.  If we look back at the past 12 months, we will see the virtue of those decisions which were then taken.</P>
    <P>Last year our output was up something in the region of four per cent. That has come about in adverse conditions when we were exporting to our chief customer, which had a sick economy, but even still we expanded our gross national product by four per cent.  I believe that was a remarkable achievement in adverse conditions.  If we now capitalise on this incentive which I believe we have in devaluation, I would not be surprised if our gross national product were to expand further than anything we have witnessed in the past ten years.  We have it within our grasp at this juncture, and it is up to us to ensure that we make every effort to capitalise on it. We must grasp the opportunity which is offered.  I am not alone in saying this.  A Fine Gael spokesman, Senator Garret FitzGerald mentioned it in yesterday's <i>Irish Times.</i> We have the opportunity now.  The type of criticism we have heard is completely false, and it is detrimental to the expansion of our economy.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about price increases and what the total effect will be.  What this amount will be has been exaggerated from the Opposition benches.  No one can deny that it will be of a small nature, but we must look at it constructively, having regard to the countries which have not devalued. We must take in the broad picture spread over all the commodities.  Then we will see the exact effect.  The Minister admits it will be something in the region of 1½ or two per cent on an over-all basis.  I believe that with increased productivity, we can plough these benefits back to the people through bonuses and various systems like that.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that increased production, increased profits, increased <Col N="1164" /> pay, increased prosperity, are the principles on which we must work in the coming year.  If we can stick to these principles, prosperity, pay and production, we will find as we reach the end of 1968, that the country will have advanced considerably.  If we take the attitude of the Opposition, if we take a negative and abstract approach, there are three other Ps which we can also expect: pandemonium, problems and poverty.  We now have to choose which road we will take.  I certainly opt for the progressive attitude.  Let us look ahead to developing new fields in Europe for our industrialists.  Let us ask our hoteliers and Bord Fáilte to concentrate on tourism.  Let us sell the advantages of our tourism to the Continent, America and other places.  Let us show them that if they come here on holiday, it will cost them 15 per cent less than it did last year.  We have many qualities to sell.  We should do all in our power on a promotional basis to this end.</P>
    <P>Again I have the utmost confidence in the economy in 1968 and I have no doubt that with Fianna Fáil in office we will attain that target.</P>

      <P>Devaluation could be an unqualified catastrophe for this country unless the Government in the years ahead are prepared to give a lead, to give better leadership and better government than they have given in the past ten years.  We do not want the Minister coming in here in a year or two when things are going badly in the country and saying, as the Taoiseach said innocently when he was Minister for Finance a few years ago: &ldquo;What went wrong with my Budget?&rdquo; We should all know that devaluation will mean a rise in the cost of living.  It will mean a greater rise than the Minister has told us.  We know that already freight has gone up by 15 per cent.  The price of timber has gone up.  The price of coal has gone up by £1 10s a ton. The Taoiseach told the people at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis that they have always told them the truth and will continue to tell them the truth, but I must doubt his word.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The people should be told the truth.  We read in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> today that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has agreed to an increase in the price of coal.  Yesterday he told us in the House that there would be an inquiry into an increase in the price of coal and that he would not allow it.  The people should be told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  There is little use in saying that since we trade largely with Britain and they have devalued also, prices will not be affected.  That is completely wrong. The Government know that Britain buys large amounts of raw materials from countries outside the sterling area. They will increase in price and therefore when they are manufactured and sold to us, we must also pay that increase.  It will certainly be passed on to us.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker mentioned that the British market was of great importance to us.  It is a pity some people did not realise that 30 years ago.  If they had, this would be a much better country today.  Perhaps it is better late than never.  Let us remember that there is no denying that devaluation will hit the balance of payments because our imports from non-devaluing countries will increase in price.  The Minister cannot deny that. In the case of France, Germany, America and, I think, Canada, we buy almost twice as much from them as they buy from us.  So that, on balance, we shall lose, not gain, as the Minister has stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Devaluation will also hit us because increases in prices will reduce the purchasing power of our money and will depress our economy still further.  Our economy has been sufficiently depressed over the last three or four years by Government action.  While we are told we are out of the wood, that is very doubtful.  Increases in prices are bound <Col N="1166" /> to cause hardship to workers and social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Let us return to Diddledum Dandy and the famous article in the Press in 1949, by Deputy MacEntee.  Fianna Fáil talk about responsibility in Opposition but they were not very responsible when they were in Opposition at that time.  We are entitled to mention the things Deputy MacEntee said at that time.  I remember 1949 and what was being said in the local commons throughout the country.  The people were told that their money was losing value, not to invest in the Government. They were told in my county to use every trick, to say anything they could about the Government, to hell with the country, to bring down the Government as quickly as possible, that Fianna Fáil wanted to get back into power.  That was their policy at that time and, unfortunately, it worked.</P>
    <P>I remember 1951.  The Government of that day had borrowed money to build houses and hospitals.  The people were told the country was in debt, was sunk, to put the Government out.  Unfortunately, the people believed that propaganda.  Today, we know, the national debt is six or eight times what it was at that time.  I mention this to show that we are a responsible Opposition who are prepared to put the country before Party.  At the same time we will remind the Minister of some of the sayings of members of his own Party in days gone by.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in opening the debate, said that not to have devalued would have been an indefensible decision in view of the close trading relations between Britain and ourselves.  As I said earlier, we welcome that idea.  We preached it for a long number of years and are glad that the Government are converted to it.  It may be no harm to quote what Deputy MacEntee said in 1949:</P>
    <P>By devaluing its currency and forcing its citizens to accept something less than their original 20/- the State becomes nothing better than a shyster debtor weakening public confidence in the integrity and capacity of its administration.</P>
    <P>We are not making that charge today. <Col N="1167" /> If we were to make it the Minister would shout that we were irresponsible. Deputy MacEntee made that charge against the Government of that day.  He is a man who prior to that had been Minister for Finance and, I suppose as a reward for making those reckless charges and helping to put the Government of that day out of office, he was rewarded with another Ministry, I think the Ministry of Health, immediately after the next general election.</P>
    <P>Devaluation seems to be a virtue if carried out by Fianna Fáil and a vice if operated by any other Government. It might be no harm to quote what the gentleman who is now in Arus an Uachtaráin had to say.  The financial position of the country does not affect him too badly now.  At Volume 29, column 560, the then Deputy de Valera, who is now the President, said:</P>
    <P>We all know that if there is to be any progress made in this country at all in regard to industrial reconstruction it can only be done by having the proper financial machinery for doing it and the existing banks and the existing system in our mind are not quite fitted for that.  We also believe that we ought to have complete financial independence which means having a central bank with complete control of our own monetary policy.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about Irish problems and said that</P>
    <P>And we ought not to be pulled at the tail of England and dragged into inflation or deflation according as it suits British commercial policies.</P>
    <P>What is happening at the present time? Are not we being dragged into deflation? Of course, these words were grand when spoken by then Deputy de Valera.  There was wild clamour at that time about breaking the connection with England, sending her ships to the bottom of the sea.  Now it is a grand thing to hear a young Deputy telling us that we are closely tied to the British economy and that if Britain devalues we must devalue at the same time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> The Government cannot ride two horses at the one time.  Here in this House they make one type of statement and when they get their people into the commons down the country they are anti-British even yet and for breaking the connection with Britain, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have had the opportunity for the past 40 years to do what the man who is now the President proposed at that time and they did nothing about it.  Indeed, there are many people who think that after 50 years of native government we should be able to stand on our own feet but it would seem that we are not.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee also referred at that time to the Coalition manipulating the currency.  If he was right at that time, who are the manipulators now? Will Fianna Fáil use devaluation now as an excuse for manipulating our whole economy and covering up their tracks of failure and diverting attention from the broken promises of the last three years?  The last few years have been years of failure.  There has been no money for house-building.  That is held up.  It is well known that in Dublin there are families of two, three and four persons in, as Deputy Dillon said, rat-infested homes while we have skyscrapers being built by insurance companies and others, and Rachmanites coming in and letting buildings fall down in order to get tenants out so that they can build colossal skyscrapers. There are no houses being built in the city of Dublin or throughout the country.  It is impossible at the present time to get money for house-building.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to sewerage schemes.  The money does not seem to be there for these schemes.  The dead hand of the Department of Finance has fallen on them.  A few years ago the Department of Local Government sent out a circular advising every county council to go ahead with regional water supply schemes. The Minister of the day met the General Council of County Councils and told that body they were not sending in enough schemes.  Architects and engineers were employed. <Col N="1169" /> These men have to be paid.  Now we have a letter telling us that the Department of Finance have not got the money and advising us to go back again to group schemes.</P>
    <P>Let there be no denying that the policy of the Government in the past few years has been chaotic.  We are entitled to ask now will Fianna Fáil try to use devaluation to extricate themselves out of the difficulties into which they have landed the country. In that article Deputy MacEntee wrote in 1949, Diddledum-Dandy, he said:</P>
    <P>Devaluation has made us all very much poorer, very much poorer than we should have been, and this country of ours much more difficult to live in.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government and I would like to ask the present Minister to tell us now if what Deputy MacEntee said in 1949 was true.  If devaluation made the people much poorer than they should have been in 1949 and this country of ours much more difficult to live in, is it not true that the effect of the Fianna Fáil Government riding in behind John Bull today, devaluing within a minute of Britain's devalution, will be to make the people left in the country much poorer than they should be and the country much more difficult to live in? If that statement were true in 1949, then it is equally true today.  Deputy MacEntee also stated that the Government in 1949 were dooming the Irish people to go down with the British ship.  If that were true in 1949, then it is equally true today.  Is the Minister for Finance dooming the Irish people today to go down with the British ship?</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy MacEntee in 1949 stated:</P>
    <P>We shall begin by considering what was the value, prior to the 18th September last of the Irish £.  Prior to the Sunday on which Mr. Costello, Mr. MacBride, Mr. Norton and their colleagues adopted Sir Basil Brooke's policy of keeping in step with Great Britain, the Irish £ was worth 4 dollars, 2½ cents.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask if at one minute <Col N="1170" /> past nine on Saturday night Mr. Lynch, Mr. Haughey, Mr. Blaney, etc., were adopting Mr. O'Neill's policy of keeping in step with Great Britain. Will the Minister deny now that Deputy MacEntee was wrong in 1949? Or are we doomed now to go down, the sick child of Europe, with the British ship?  The Minister should tell the people who was right.  Was it Deputy MacEntee in 1949?  Or is the Minister right now?</P>
    <P>We are also entitled to ask the Minister if devaluation will affect those living on fixed incomes, pensioners, and those in receipt of unemployment benefit, etc.  I think it is well known that it will.  These people have to buy coal, the price of which has gone up. The price of bread will increase.  It is well known that in July last year, when the millers were in July last year, dence with the Department about the price of bread and flour, everything was kept secret until after the results of the Waterford and Kerry by-elections. It was only then the people learned they would have to pay another 2d on the loaf of bread.</P>
    <P>Everyone will suffer as a result of devaluation.  The fact is the cost of living had been increasing prior to devaluation.  The Minister may possibly make some provision for social welfare recipients and others in next year's Budget.  That will mean that these people will gain no advantage until six or eight months after the Budget.  Meanwhile they will have to endure hardship because devaluation will affect them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the decision to devalue was a free choice of the Government after careful consideration of the various alternative courses of action.  If it were a free decision of the Government, then they must have known prior to the announcement that the £ was to be devalued, that devaluation was coming; the announcement was made in London at 9 o'clock and a few minutes later by our Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at an Irish Minister making that statement.  After all, it was the President who talked about being tied to the British £ and Deputy MacEntee in his own melancholic <Col N="1171" /> fashion described us as going down with the British ship in 1949.  The people are entitled to know what alternative courses were considered and they should have a detailed explanation of why those alternatives were rejected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the rise in the price level should not exceed two per cent.  Does he believe that that is true because no other member of the Fianna Fáil Party is of that opinion?  Most people believe that the increase will be anything in the region of four to five per cent.  It will certainly be more than two per cent when we remember that we take twice as much from countries like France, Germany, Canada and the United States as they buy from us.  Britain buys a large proportion of her raw material in the dollar area.  When that is processed by her and exported here its cost is bound to be increased by anything from 5 to 10 per cent.  The Minister must give a clear explanation of how he arrives at a figure of an increase of 2 per cent. I wonder if it is another example of the kind of airy fairy promise made by Senator Dr. Ryan in this House in relation to the Health Act, 1953, when he told us that it would not cost more than 2/- in the £.  In many counties, it is now costing as high as 18/- in the £.  We trust the forecast of the Minister for Finance on this occasion will not be as far out as was that of Senator Dr. Ryan.</P>
    <P>Is it likely that the 2½ per cent turnover tax which, in practice, became 10 per cent, or more, will be increased? The people desire that information. The Minister spoke about &ldquo;a moderate effect on prices as a result of devaluation&rdquo;: I have dealt with that.  We are entitled to somewhat more information than those few lines, in passing, in the Minister's opening speech.</P>
    <P>In 1949, Deputy MacEntee complained of the colossal sum being locked up with sterling.  Why did Fianna Fáil not change the position since then?  Can the Minister give us any information about the colossal <Col N="1172" /> sum now locked up with sterling and his intentions about it in the future?</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that &ldquo;improvements in social welfare in the past have by no means been confined to compensation for the rise in the cost of living&rdquo;.  Do the Government really believe that statement?  It was established here not so very long ago &mdash;I think in answer to a question by Deputy Corish&mdash;that a lesser percentage of the national income now goes in social welfare benefit than in 1957.</P>
    <P>We know the Government's attitude to income increases.  &ldquo;Give everybody an increase if there is an election or a by-election in sight and to hell with the economy and with national production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is opportune to ask what has produced the situation in which this country finds itself today.  We must ask ourselves if this country is progressing, bearing in mind that our financial commitments are much greater than ever before.  It is now costing almost three times as much to run the country as it cost in 1956.</P>
    <P>It has been stated on many occasions that the yardstick by which to judge a country is the number of boys and girls born and reared there, getting work there, marrying, living happily and bringing up their families there. Despite the huge increase in taxation, we must admit that Fianna Fáil policy has been a dismal failure.  Those of us who were in places such as the West, on the occasion of a by-election a few years ago, or in West Limerick &mdash;I know what the Deputy is about to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am thinking of smoke from the new homes which have been built.  We saw the conditions under which some people in Limerick have to exist.  It is dreadful to have to castigate an Irish Government, after so many long years of office, because we still have so many people on the housing list and small farmers living in shacks in some parts of Ireland.  The evils that would follow the Government's inflationary policy were pointed out to them on numerous occasions from this side of the House but our warnings were disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> It is the duty of any government to control the economy, to balance all the factors, one with the other.  It is the duty of the Government to avoid periods of boom and periods of slump. Certainly, in that regard, they have failed in their duty.  They took a gambler's chance in 1962 on gaining admission to the Common Market. They hoped that such entry would cover up their faults and their failures. They had no policy and when we did not succeed in getting into the Common Market we had the chaos and the financial mess of the past three or four years.  The same thing has happened again.  The door to the Common Market seems to be closed.  Whether or not General de Gaulle offered the Taoiseach associate membership we cannot say because the Taoiseach does not seem to be very clear about it.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government give a more positive lead than they have given in the past, our future will be hard as a result of devaluation.  The more we reflect on the history of the past few years the more we must realise the Government's responsibility for our present plight and the necessity for having them removed from power as soon as the people can opt for that. One thing we must say is that the Government have never hesitated in the past to use the people's money to buy them votes.  They are clever politicians&mdash;more luck to them as long as they are able to get away with it.  At the same time, the Government must explain to the people the reasons for their twists and somersaults over the past few years and their utter disregard for the sacredness of the truth.  When the Taoiseach was speaking at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis under this huge banner with the slogan about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, he spoke about never having misled the people and said that Fianna Fáil always told the people the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It reminded me of the bandy-legged little child who was going to school and his father said to him: &ldquo;If you ever get into a fight with another boy, start shouting &lsquo;bandy-legs, <Col N="1175" /> bandy-legs&rsquo; at him before he gets the opportunity of shouting it at you.&rdquo;  It is the same with the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  We know that they do not.  As far as they are concerned, some are much more equal than others and if they have the Fianna Fáil card, they will get the job, whether it is in the Clones post office or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>In regard to telling the truth, they have misled the people in the past about the financial position of this State.  Indeed, the man who made that statement about the truth was the very man who had to come in as Minister for Finance and ask: &ldquo;What went wrong with my Budget of last year?&rdquo; I believe that every political Party who seek office have a responsibility to tell the truth and not mislead the people, to tell them how they will use the power entrusted to them.  Let us face up to the fact that things are bad in this country and even at present the Government are trying to keep the full truth from the people.  They are not telling the people how devaluation will affect the people.  We have had a financial crisis during the past few years and we are entitled to say that that crisis and all the evil results accruing from it arose from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly am not. Those results arose from a White Paper entitled &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo; which was issued in 1963.  The purpose of that publication was to underline the fact that at that time we were living beyond our means, that we were spending too much and that we would have to pull up our socks and work harder. The White Paper urged State Departments, State-sponsored organisations, the trade unions and so on, to make no more demands for higher wages until there had been increased production and increased exports.  We must give full credit to the trade unions and to everyone else concerned that there was a good response and until the autumn of 1963, we had stability; wage demands were few and strikes were fewer still during that year.  Then the Government <Col N="1176" /> introduced the turnover tax.  That was a tax that was imposed for the first time in the history of the State, a tax on bread, butter, tea, sugar, fuel, medicines for human beings&mdash;if you wanted to get a pill to make a dog run faster you did not have to pay a turnover tax on it, as there was no tax on medicines for animals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party and other Parties here pointed out the ill-effects that this ill-conceived policy would have.  We pointed out that a tax on the necessaries of life was bound to increase the cost of living and how it would kindle again the flames of inflation with all its harmful effects and that it would do irreparable harm to the economy.  There was a bitter debate here for two or three months.  All of our forecasts have proved to be right.  There was a sudden jump in prices after the imposition of the turnover tax and the cost of living started to rise.  While the Government were calling for restraint, the workers' pay packets were not going as far as they did before.  At that time Fianna Fáil speakers here were arguing that the turnover tax would only have a minimal effect on prices.  I remember the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Lenihan, then a Parliamentary Secretary, telling us, as did some of the Ministers, that the tax would not be passed on, that many of the manufacturers would absorb it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know if Fianna Fáil were so innocent at that time as to believe that a policy of restraint could be maintained in conditions of higher prices which Fianna Fáil had created. It was a major tactical error and it was the starting point of the chaos and financial crisis we have had for the past three to five years.  The next move was a very clever political move by the Government.  The death of two TDs suddenly closed the gap and then the then Taoiseach.  Deputy Lemass, <Col N="1177" /> changed horses in midstream.  He took up his pen and wrote a letter to the trade unions saying that the gap between spending and incomes had suddenly closed.  He was asked to quote figures but he did not quote figures.  Because two by-elections were coming up, he painted a different picture and a 12½ per cent increase was given as a bribe to the electorate.  They won the Cork and Kerry by-elections and £40 million was injected into the economy.  We were again riding roughshod over inflation.</P>
    <P>Having won the two by-elections, the Taoiseach immediately switched horses again and uttered dire warnings during 1964 and told us that the 12½ per cent was more than we should have given. It was now back with the employers. We had taken a mortgage on the future, and he stated there could be no more wage demands.  The argument may have been valid in the light of the statistics but it did not sit logically with what Deputy Lemass and the Government had been saying before the Cork and Kerry by-elections.  Once more the Government were contradicting themselves. Once more they were not telling the truth to the people.  But what about it?  As far as they were concerned everything was all right: they had won two by-elections.  The circus continued. Two other by-elections were held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the chaos existing today is due to the inflationary policies promoted by the Government for the past three or four years, and the fact that when elections were about to take place, the Government were prepared to inject money, even to the tune of £40 million, into the economy.  The fact that they gave these injections to the economy with the people's money to win those by-elections has got us into the crisis we have been in for the past few years and the financial position we are in today.  As well as discussing devaluation, we are also discussing the Estimate for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy is correct in that.  We are <Col N="1178" /> discussing the Minister's Estimate and devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am correct in assuming also that the position in which we find ourselves today is due to the high taxation policy of the Government.  I think I am correct in saying&mdash;I think other speakers dealt with this&mdash;that while the cost of running this country was £108 million in 1956 it is £300 million today.  During the same period the Government have borrowed £400 million and they propose to borrow more.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of any Government to tell the people the truth.  The people were misled in the past.  When Deputy Lemass was in Opposition, he announced, and I quote from volume 157, column 49, of the Official Report of 8th May, 1956:</P>
      <P>We announced that we had made up our minds on that fact and so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that, if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>How has Deputy Lemass kept his word to the Irish people?  By increasing taxation from £108 million, at which it stood when he made that statement, to around £300 million, which it is costing to run this country today.  How can you reconcile that with the statement made by the present Taoiseach at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis that Fianna Fáil have always told the people the truth, that they have never misled them?  Was that not misleading the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remember also we have a National Debt at the present time of £800 million, and the local authorities owe a further £220 million, roughly. That means that between the local authorities and the State our National Debt today is £1,020 million, and it is costing almost £90 million of the tax-payers' money to service that debt.  It is costing today almost as much to service the National Debt as it cost to run this State in 1956, when Deputy Lemass, the then Leader of the Opposition, said he would not increase taxation <Col N="1179" /> but would reduce expenditure if any Budget difficulty arose.  Are we not entitled to say to the people and to this House that the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party have deliberately broken their word to the Irish people, that they have fooled them, that instead of reducing expenditure, they have increased it from £108 million to £300 million and have also increased our National Debt by over £400 million during the same period?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that we were made the laughing-stock of the world when we went to borrow money. If anybody wants to borrow money, he can go to his bank manager and borrow so much, and if he works hard enough, he may be able to pay it back at the right time.  However, if he borrows too much and squanders it recklessly, as has been done by the Government, then the day of reckoning can come and come very quickly. Indeed for us the honeymoon may be over.</P>
    <P>As a result of Deputy Lemass's broken promises, we had a financial crisis last year and the year before. The Government had to go to America and look for a loan of £5 million.  That £5 million is the same as if one of us went around to our neighbour and asked for half a crown.  They were refused.  They then went to England and floated a loan.  They got less than a quarter of the amount, and the underwriters had to put up the balance. They went to Germany and borrowed £7 million or £8 million, and from the Bank of Nova Scotia, they borrowed a further £7 million or £8 million.</P>
    <P>This inflationary policy of the Government has got us into the mess we are in today.  The Government should have known, because all the indicators from the previous four or five years were in the wrong direction. In 1962, we had a deficit of £13 million in our balance of payments; in 1963, it was £23 million; in 1964, it was £31 million: in 1965, it had increased to £45 million.  The danger signs were on the horizon for years, and Deputy Childers was warning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Here is what Deputy Lemass told us in 1956:</P>
      <P>We announced that we made up our minds that, so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Instead of reducing expenditure, he trebled expenditure and borrowed a further £400 million.  It is this which has put the country in the position it has been for the past five years, where there has not been sufficient money to build houses, where this year road grants all over the country are being cut and the country councils have to let men go.  This Christmas these people will certainly be affected by devaluation.</P>
      <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Employment Period Orders were in operation last year, but not this year, contributed largely to the differences in the comparative Live Register totals for the period up to the 1st November. Since then, there has been a continuous reduction in the differences.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Analysis of the Live Register as at mid-November, due to be published about the 8th December next, will set out the changes, and the reasons therefor so far as they can be determined, since the corresponding date last year.</P>

      <P>I understand that redundancy has occurred at a firm in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  As it is not the practice to disclose information about the private affairs of individual concerns, I am not prepared to give further information in respect of the firm concerned.  In a large industrial and commercial complex such as Shannon there will inevitably be fluctuations in the level of employment in individual concerns.  I am informed by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company that they have been asked to assist in placing the redundant workers with other firms in the <Col N="1185" /> Industrial Estate and that they are now actively engaged in doing this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Fares and rates on international air services are settled by unanimous agreement among the member airlines of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) subject to Government approval in each country. Following devaluation IATA held a special conference.  It was agreed that air fares from devaluing countries, including Ireland, to non-devaluing countries should be increased so as to keep the fares in line with the fares for the reverse journeys.  These increases, if implemented without exception, would upset the balanced pattern of air fares to resort areas in France, Italy and Portugal on the one hand and to Spain on the other.  This was not acceptable to the airlines of France, Italy and Portugal who insisted on corresponding increases in air fares to Spain.  To achieve the necessary unanimity, the other airlines concerned agreed to compromise increases in fares to Spain.  These are&mdash;</P>
      <P>Normal fare&mdash;16? per cent</P>
      <P>Excursion fare&mdash;8½ per cent</P>
      <P>Inclusive tour fare&mdash;5 per cent</P>
      <P>The excursion and inclusive tour fares are used by most travellers.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus have sought my approval for these increases and I do not anticipate withholding it.  I am not aware of the attitude of the Spanish Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated at my press conference on 29th November, a decision has not been made not to introduce such a measure, nor has a decision been made at this juncture to <Col N="1187" /> introduce it.  The full co-operation of everyone in ensuring compliance with the veterinary regulations and precautions will be an important factor in deciding on this issue.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned at the press conference, I understand that the Six Counties would not have the power to ban movement of persons into that area from Britain, and, in such circumstances, really effective control of the movement of such persons south over the Border would not seem to be practicable.</P>
      <P>Another aspect would be the many hard cases, such as sick people, children, persons coming to funerals of near relatives, and so on, and there could be considerable pressure to make exceptions from any ban in such cases. This would involve some kind of permit system, but, even if this was administratively practicable, there would still be the risk of people with permits picking up the infection immediately before travelling to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the question would logically arise of banning movements of all ships and planes from Britain to this country, as well as persons, because, if this were not done, there would still be a considerable movement into the country of persons who are members of crews, <i>et cetera,</i> as well as a movement of goods, involving some degree of risk.  Such a step would, of course, put an end to all trade between the two countries for the time being, with far-reaching consequences for our economy.</P>
      <P>These are some of the considerations involved, and I should add that, if any such prohibitions were imposed, they would probably have to remain in force for months rather than weeks if they were to be really effective.</P>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, we are continuing to keep the whole question under constant review in the light of developments.</P>

In the past few days, in consultation with the Six County veterinary officers down here with my officers, we have decided as from now to have Border check points and disinfection points.  In addition, which is more important to the shoppers, all baggage at the Border will be scrutinised item by item for the same <Col N="1189" /> reason as we are scrutinising them at the airports and the seaports.

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by my predecessor, on 25th June, 1964, to a question about the same case.</P>
      <P>When representations were made on this merchant's behalf, my predecessor agreed, in the special circumstances, to provide him with export facilities, and he was informed of this on 15th April, 1964.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister should be aware that the firm to which he refers, Fred Sherriff &amp; Sons, Veneer Merchants, of Bailieborough, County Cavan, did in fact, go out of existence because of the way in which the matter was dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the time and he also must be aware that the firm who succeeded in putting him out of business have since gone out of business themselves, mainly because of bad workmanship?  In the circumstances, would the Minister not consider having an investigation into the matter, with a view to seeing if something could be done for this reputable firm of Fred Sherriff &amp; Sons who gave employment for a long period in Cavan and were put out mainly due to the fact that the Department of Industry and Commerce at the time were a little bit too soft with one of these fly-by-night firms who came in and got an industry started?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the notes here which says the firm is, in fact, out of business but if the Deputy says that they are out of business, I accept that that is the position. I must say I regret that.  As the Deputy knows, there was a considerable discussion about this matter three years ago and a question and supplementary questions were put to the present Taoiseach who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce in the matter also.  Presumably, whatever export facilities were given to the firm at that time should have enabled them to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They were too late.  When the matter was discussed, the present Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Taoiseach at that time were apparently under the impression that the reference was simply to one consignment of logs which had been the subject of a court case.  Apparently, the broader issue, the fact that the firm had lost its entire business because of faulty workmanship on logs and that the new firm was the cause of the trouble, completely escaped everybody discussing it.  In the circumstances, perhaps the Minister might ask the Minister <Col N="1199" /> for Industry and Commerce to have a further look at the file because I believe a grave injustice is being done to a very good firm.</P>

The Government have already provided valuable facilities to encourage the establishment and development of industries in all areas.  It is for private enterprise to take advantage of these facilities and local interests should do their best to encourage private enterprise to set up industries in their own areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress, I was dealing with the policy of the Government for the past six or seven years.  It is the inflationary policy of the Government in that period which <Col N="1202" /> has got the country into the mess in which it is today.  As I said, all the indicators were pointing in the wrong direction.  The danger signs were on the horizon.  The Government should have taken note of them.</P>
      <P>In 1956, we had a deficit in our balance of payments of £30 million; in 1963, it was £23 million; in 1964, it was £31 million; and in 1965, it was £45 million.  Can the country survive unless the Government change their policy?  Many people claim it cannot survive.  Unless there is a change of policy, the country is doomed.  Is it the policy of the Government to make the rich richer and the poor poorer?  Is it the policy of the Government to permit our population to dwindle?  That is what is happening.  In 1965, the Taoiseach&mdash; he was then Minister for Finance&mdash; innocently asked what went wrong.  He should have known.  It was the inflationary policy of the Government.  It had reduced the country to the plight in which it was then.  We are living on borrowed money and on borrowed time.  All the signs were there and the chaos in which the country finds itself today was brought about by Fianna Fáil mismanagement.</P>
      <P>As a constructive Opposition, with the national interest at heart, it is not only our right but our duty to ask ourselves what lasting value have we got from the huge Government expenditure over the years and from the financial policy of the Government. Where is this country heading? In 1965 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Jack Lynch, told us he was going to reduce taxation to the 1953 level.  Remembering the huge outlay of public money since, if we were in a position to say that emigration had stopped and that unemployment had been substantially reduced, we would have some grounds for satisfaction. Unfortunately that is not the case.  In 1956, wives were exhorted to get their husbands back to work.  There was a promise of 100,000 new jobs.  That promise was made to get the people's votes.  I do not blame the people for voting for Fianna Fáil on foot of that promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened?  In the past ten <Col N="1203" /> years, 400,000 of the youth of the country have been driven out of the country because of Fianna Fáil financial policy.  Homes have been sold and whole families have emigrated.  We are still exporting close on 30,000 young people a year, and that despite this huge expenditure of over £300 million of the people's money.  We have 10,000 more people unemployed as compared with this time last year.  That figure will increase now as a result of devaluation. It will increase ever further because of the 25 per cent cut in road grants to county councils.  That cut was made despite the fact that taxation on cars was increased by 25 per cent in 1966.  That cut means that many county councils will have to give their workers a Christmas box of three months at home.  That is not right in a Christian country.  If there is a shortage of money, I see no reason why the Government should cause the weaker sections of the community more suffering.  Others will be paid for 52 weeks in the year.  Already some county councils have let workers go. The majority will have to let them go from now until the end of the year. That is absolutely wrong.  But this is the result of the Government's financial policy and the result of the vast outlay of public money in the last few years.  If there were more people in employment today we could say the country was on the right road.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Let-Lemass-Lead-On stating that the acid test by which the Fianna Fáil Government could be judged would be by the number of people they put into productive employment.  What are the facts?  Last week I asked a question and I was told by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that there are 163,000 fewer people at work today than there were in 1951.  Is that what the 1916 men died for?  These are the people who pay lip service to the Proclamation and who hang up over their Árd Fheis that they cherish all our children equally.  The Taoiseach said Fianna Fáil always tell the people the truth and that is why they are in government.  Did they tell them the truth when they promised them <Col N="1204" /> 100,000 new jobs ten years ago?  Did they keep that promise by having 163,000 fewer people at work in Ireland today?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil do not seem to be concerned with the ordinary people.  There was a time when they were perhaps, but they no longer seem to be concerned. Their idea seems to be to export them; if they emigrate they cannot be dissatisfied at home; they cannot organise against Fianna Fáil; they cannot vote against them.  The Government should remember that the safety valve of emigration may not always be there.  What would happen were Britain to close her doors to our emigrants?  Had Britain closed her doors ten years ago, we would have 450,000 unemployed in this country at the moment.  So long as the Government can get rid of people by exporting them they seem to be quite happy and content to pursue a policy of making the rich richer and the poor poorer.</P>
    <P>We have a record low population. Deputy Crinion said that, for the first time in 100 years, our population showed an increase at the last census. There was an increase of 55,000 between 1945 and 1951 and there was a very small increase at the last census. The financial policy of this Government has driven and still continues to drive people out of the country.  The £ has become a jet propellor: if you change it it is gone immediately.  It is worth only 13/- or 14/- compared with its value ten years ago.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were promising 100,000 new jobs and saying to our Irish women: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands out to work&rdquo; they did not explain that the work would be in London, Birmingham or Coventry. They did not explain that the £, in ten years, would be worth only half what it was then worth.  Our people are ground down by taxation, national and local.  Not since the days of the Economic War has there been such poverty among a certain section of our people &mdash;small farmers and small businessmen. We are pricing ourselves out of markets.  If this policy continues, our industries will not be able to hold their own even on the Irish market when tariffs are reduced or abolished.  That is a very real danger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> The eyes of the Government are closed to our plight.  They said, for example, that the reason for the catastrophic drop in cattle prices last year was the closing of EEC markets.  Those markets were closed on 1st April, 1966. Yet, at the end of May of that year, the Minister for Finance said the price of cattle would increase by £5 or £7 a head.  Did he not know that the EEC markets were closed six weeks before that or were the Government deliberately trying to keep the truth from the Irish people?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis that Fianna Fáil always tell the truth to the people.  In fact, they have misled and fooled the Irish people as best they could and especially at election time when they wanted their votes.  A very real danger is the Government's high taxation and the position of our industries in the light of the Free Trade Area Agreement. I do not know if we have an agreement with Britain about tariff reductions. We were reducing our tariffs in preparation for entry into EEC and the reduction so far brought about is definitely harming our industries.  Many people are losing their employment.  A further reduction is due in January. Already, the reduction is steep.</P>
    <P>General de Gaulle has made it clear that we shall not get into the Common Market in the next five or seven years and, that being so, the Government should review the policy of tariff reductions and discuss the matter with Britain with a view to obtaining a longer term for the protection of our industries.  If we have a further tariff reduction in January the jobs of many of our kith and kin will be jeopardised because certain industries will seriously be affected.  To continue with this present financial policy is the road to disaster.  It is essential that this warning be heeded.  If it is not heeded, we are surely committing hara-kiri.</P>
    <P>With the loss of value in the £ and the fact that we purchase in non-devaluing countries, it is essential that our people realise that it is in all our interests to &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; whenever possible. That should be emphasised at every opportunity.  As the Minister for <Col N="1206" /> Finance is in charge, he should give the lead in this connection.  It is the duty of the Government to control the economy and to balance all factors one with the other.  They are the only people who can see the full picture.  It is their duty to extract our people from the financial morass in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>The more we study events in this country in the past few years the more we are made to realise that the Government respond to every wind that blows. They are always trying to do what they believe will get them votes.  They use the people's money to buy votes for themselves.  The inflation we have had for the past few years has been due to the fact that, election after election, the Government inject money into the economy to bribe the people into voting for them.</P>
    <P>There are difficult days ahead.  Certainly devaluation will hit us.  It behoves the Government to give the country a better lead than they have done in the past.  It is the duty of employers to ensure that there is better management.  Indeed, many of them should work harder.  In the national interest, and in their own interest, employers and unions should accept certain changes.</P>
    <P>Whenever Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, the financial policy enunciated by them seemed excellent but what they preached to the people when in Opposition and what they perform when in Government are two completely different things.  The moment they get back into power, public expenditure and local expenditure start careering upwards.  Indeed, in our present dilemma I suppose they are merely running true to form.  Many people now believe that, despite the continued upward swing in Government taxation, it fails to reflect the real gravity of the crisis.  I want to recall what Deputy Seán Lemass stated when in Opposition. He said in 1956 he would not allow taxation to increase beyond the 1953 level.  When he got into office, taxation increased from £108 million to £300 million and the national debt was doubled from £400 million to £800 million.</P>
    <P>Let us learn from the mistakes made <Col N="1207" /> by Britain.  The large amount of money which Britain borrowed has got her into her present crisis.  It should be remembered that the honeymoon is over.  You can borrow for a certain length of time but now it is costing as much to service the national and local debt&mdash;£90 million&mdash;as it cost to run the country 12 years ago.  It is time for the Government to sit up and take notice.  If they continue with their present financial policy and continue running to England, Germany, America and the Bank of Nova Scotia, we will be in the same position as England was a few months ago, in the position of a man who borrows too much money.  It is time the Government realised that.</P>
    <P>Never before in the history of the country was it more necessary to have a period of stability for our producers, whether they are farmers or industrialists, so that they can equip themselves for the more competitive period that lies ahead.  Even if we do not enter the EEC in the next five or six years, with the reduction in tariffs that has taken place because of the Free Trade Agreement, that competitive period will be there.  When the Government increase taxation the producers must increase their costs and when costs are increased, the cost of living is increased. Then the workers are entitled to seek more wages and you have wages chasing prices and prices chasing wages.  If we are to have a period of stability, the Government's financial policy will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>The only way in which tax revenue can be increased without increasing the cost of living, without causing inflation, without having bad industrial relations, is by a growth in national production which will provide a larger taxable income.  If the Government give the lead to the people to work harder and increase production, then we can bake a larger national cake and from such a larger cake the Government can, without increasing taxation, get more revenue and the different sections of the people, whether they are workers or farmers, can and should get a just share.  All sections of the community are entitled to organise to demand their rights and to get them.  The <Col N="1208" /> workers are entitled to do it and the farmers should be entitled to do it. However, we do not want to see increased taxation if we can help it because it will do untold harm to our people in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government should be more careful to ensure that we do not price ourselves out of existing markets.  The inescapable fact is, as the Government must know, if public spending maintains its upward course, it will outstrip the real growth in the economy.  A flabby cost structure has been inflated like a balloon over the past few years by the Government and there is a grave danger that the balloon will collapse. It cannot be denied that Government policy has been calculated, both in regard to its timing and its general direction, to raise prices and costs.  The time has come for the Government to endeavour to have a period of stability in the years ahead.  There is no denying the fact that small shopkeepers, business people, small farmers and people on fixed incomes are heavily and unfairly penalised because of Government financial policy, because of the turn-over tax, etc., and now they are being further hit because of devaluation.  The Government are making a grave error in believing that a man can always find the money to pay his taxes or rates.  It reminds me of the time when I heard the Taoiseach saying that they always told the people the truth.  I remember when Mr. de Valera spoke in Mullingar and promised complete de-rating to the people.  At that time the rates were between 5/- and 6/- in the £ and we all know what they are today.  That is another example of how they always told the people the truth and kept their promises.</P>
    <P>This country has at its disposal a highly effective weapon in taxation which, if properly used, can create and expand wealth internally and attract wealth from foreign sources as well.  So far, however, taxation has been used by the Fianna Fáil Government as an instrument for dissipating, destroying and discouraging wealth instead of attracting it and building it up.  In that regard I welcome the Government's conversion to the idea of using taxation to encourage industrial enterprise.  Full <Col N="1209" /> credit is due to Deputy Sweetman and the late Deputy Norton for introducing in 1956 two Bills which were designed to provide incentives to manufacturers from abroad to come here and start factories and to invest here.  The Government of that day believed that instead of boys having to emigrate to Birmingham, Coventry, or London to look for work, it would be much better if we could get industrialists with money and the technical know-how to come here, to start factories here and provide employment for our people. Deputy Costello, Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman were on that side of the House when those Bills were introduced and Deputy Seán Lemass was on this side.  He bitterly opposed both Bills and voted against them.  He said that at some time in the future his Party would be in a position to alter those laws and that he would knock them off the Statute Book.  The Minister is looking at me as if he doubted me.  I have not got the quotations but I can give the Minister the references and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is that then the Government which the Taoiseach at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis said had always told the truth to the people; that they would always tell the truth, and that the reason they were in power was that they told the people the truth?  I stated here that they have hardly ever told the people the truth, that they have misled them.  Deputy Lemass misled them in 1957 when he told them that the financial policy of the Government was to cut down on the Budget, that they would not increase taxation.  They kept that promise by imposing taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat myself, but Deputy Lemass at that time vigorously opposed that Bill and those concessions that were given. Today Fianna Fáil are getting credit <Col N="1210" /> for the industrialists who came in, and remember, one of the first to come in was Whitegate in Cork, with £12 million.  If Deputy Sweetman, the late Deputy Norton, Deputy Costello and the Government of that day had not given those concessions, we would not have the industries that came in in the past ten years.  They came in because of the grants they got under the 1956 and 1957 Acts and also the taxation concessions they got for many years. Anyway I welcome the Government's conversion to these proposals.  It is a course that the Government should continue to pursue and expand so as to build up the wealth of our citizens and, indeed, to attract more outside capital for investment in our factories.</P>

      <P>Instead, he runs across the years.  He always seems to run back to 1932, and on the return journey, he takes up the same point and exercises himself in the same manner about them.  He painted this dismal picture of some of the deserted villages in the west of Ireland.  I should like to remind him that the most famous deserted village was one in his constituency, the area he now represents. This area which he represents indicates the social and economic change which took place many years ago.  One is almost convinced, when one listens to Deputy L'Estrange, that if he were then the representative of that area in Parliament, this would not have taken place.  This would have meant that now we would not have the farms of anything from 200 to 800 acres there.</P>

      <P>The people who were taken from the middle of the country would not be now the small holders in the west of Ireland; probably Goldsmith would not have had the subject for his famous poem, and not alone would he have died poor but would also probably have died unknown.</P>
      <P>We, the Deputies of this House, are sent here to make legislation and to make regulations, and to see that they are just.  We must also see that they are justly administered, and, if they happen to be unjustly administered, have them repealed.  We have the duty to levy taxes and to see that the money so collected is properly spent.  Furthermore, we are elected at local level and every few years we have to return to the local people to account for our stewardship.  This means that each and every one of us has a vital interest in seeing how the administration of the Government and the Departments affects our local areas.</P>
      <P>This Estimate of the Minister for Finance deals more or less specifically with the area from which I come, the western area.  The constituency I represent is in this area, and anything the Minister for Finance or any other Minister for Finance brings before this House to help this area must be welcomed by us.  Everything helps, and I do not think that people who come in here on one day and blame the Government for trying to do something, and on another day blame the Government for having tried something, are sincere about the problem or that they themselves have a plan or policy for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it is now necessary to enumerate once again some of the schemes which have been introduced to help us.  The pilot area was one started as an experiment.  It has proved successful, and the extent of the area has been trebled.  Those to whom it now applies are very enthusiastic about it.  I have no doubt that if the Government <Col N="1212" /> are convinced that it is worth following up, we shall see it extended in the next few years to the entire western area.</P>
    <P>Industry is something we want in the western area.  Various methods have been tried to induce industry to go there.  Tax concessions were given to the bigger industries, and they did not seem to work to that extent.  Now the small industries are being tried, and this is a welcome development, something that is being received enthusiastically and, to my mind, something that will lead somewhere and retain some of the people of the West in their native places.  Around my own area, three or four places have benefited by it already.  I understand all the establishments are very pleased, and those who are getting the work are delighted to have an opportunity of staying at home.</P>
    <P>Other schemes that have been tried have been put on a firm footing.  I refer to a handcraft industry in my own native parish called the Slievebawn Handcrafts.  This started as a local effort and at a certain stage, they found themselves running into financial difficulties; then the Department of Finance came along and helped them. It is now a going concern.  The people here again are enthusiastic, and this is an indication of what a government should do through its department of finance, which is the department controlling its money.  More recently still another handcraft industry, somewhat analogous, has been started in the Carrick-on-Shannon area.  I have no doubt that if this can be developed successfully, this too will help the people of that area in County Leitrim. Again this would not have started without the help of the Department of Finance and the Minister and for this we are grateful.  It shows that the Government are in earnest about helping in any and every project that shows that it may be successful.</P>
    <P>The latest thing that strikes my mind is the question of decentralisation.  This has been criticised in the House.  To my mind, it is an excellent effort. People throughout the country have been asking for this for years.  It is something that could not be done <Col N="1213" /> without a lot of thought.  A number of people may be adversely affected by it; nobody likes to have his family and home uprooted, but I feel that this side of it is exaggerated.  I do not think the impact will be as great as we are led to believe from reading letters to the newspapers.  Again it conveys to us, the Deputies who represent the west of the country, that here we have a Government and a Minister for Finance who are in earnest about what they are doing and what they propose to do.  It is not merely a question of saying something; they are doing it and they have promised to do more and this more will be welcomed too.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult task to try to resist economic forces as we find them in the country but the Government have in the past made various efforts to reverse those economic forces.  The question of tax incentives is one example and probably the most important one is grants to industries.  I feel that time will show that decentralisation will be successful and will be worthwhile.  This has been done in other countries and in other circumstances.  Why should not we, the Irish people, be able successfully to bring about something in our circumstances?  I have no doubt we can do so with enthusiasm and if certain people&mdash;I am not referring to the civil servants who are being disturbed but to others who started to wail about it and to say right away that it will not be successful and that it cannot be done&mdash;change their approach.  I feel our approach to this should be to welcome it.  It has been decided to do it and we should just get on and do it in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been offered of surveys. A survey means the acquiring of information and all these things are essential. The more information one has about a subject, an area or a difficulty, the better one is able to deal with it and make provision to right what is going wrong.  Those surveys have helped in the development of our economy and I think it is very wrong to criticise them.</P>
    <P>There are other things no doubt that we in the West would like to see done to help us along.  Forestry is one which does not come under the Minister for Finance directly and drainage is <Col N="1214" /> another.  Although they do not come under the Minister for Finance directly, his Department provides the money for doing those works.  I would like to urge on him that as each Department makes its claim from the financial kitty for extra money for forestry or for drainage, to be in a benevolent mood when he is dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The employment of our people is a big answer to our problems.  It is good to learn that over the past five years the number employed in industry has increased by, I think, something like 14,000.  A significant thing mentioned somewhere in the past few weeks was to the effect that over this period industry was absorbing those who are leaving the agricultural land.  This surely is a step forward.  This is the one thing we were hoping our economy would eventually succeed in doing and it is good to learn that it has done so. Criticism has been offered of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion but surely this is the answer. If we have succeeded in doing this, the Second Programme must be a success. Perhaps it was not a success to the extent that we would have wished but then it is not given to any of us to be omniscient.  We cannot see beyond an hour or two, if we can see that distance at all.  To make war on any programme just because it did not reach its target is, I think, wrong, especially when we are developing it as a new policy.  It brings us back to this question of enthusiasm and confidence in ourselves. If we are to condemn everything that does not reach 100 per cent expectation, then we are creating a wrong spirit in our people and they will lose confidence in themselves.  This figure must be used as the hallmark of success and to convince all critics that the Second Programme for Economic Expansion had some merit.</P>
    <P>In this House in the form of questions and at various times, there has been criticism of the building of office blocks by foreigners, the advent of foreign insurance companies, the advent of foreign finance companies, the advent of foreign banks to the city. Perhaps this may be a legitimate criticism to one extent but surely in one part of one's speech, one cannot <Col N="1215" /> criticise these things and at a later part point out how important it is that money should be brought into the country for investment and that inducements should be held out by the Government to bring in this money. The Labour Party have made their position quite clear on this question of finance.  They would compel the banks to invest their money in this country.  The Fine Gael Party should state definitely that if they are returned to power, they will take over the offices of companies which they do not want in the country.  To my mind, this is the essence of argument.  It is all right to argue but one should be in a position to state what he will do if he gets to power.  I feel this is an important aspect of our public life.  I have no doubt the Minister and the Department of Finance have all those activities under survey and that they and the Government, when the time arises, will deal with those people if they abuse their position in the country.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot about devaluation inside and outside the House.  It is a big problem and very hard to understand. It appears to be one of those occasions where people are not producing the goods up to the standard, quality or the amount that they allege they are doing, so when this final effort is translated into money, it is found that this money is not up to the standard either and to bring it into standard with foreign currency, it has to be devalued.  We have had lectures often on the remedies for it but I will not go further into that.</P>
    <P>In this House today we have been reminded by certain people about what the Fianna Fáil Party said in the past. The Minister for Finance has been challenged and asked whether he will contradict those statements and what he will say about them.  This does not contribute to the debate in this House. The people who made those statements should state exactly how they feel about devaluation.  That is what they should do.  It is no good coming in here and nothing what others say. They should say what they think about it and if they are as near to taking over power as they say they are they <Col N="1216" /> should say what they think should be done on this occasion.  They should not continue to go back down the years or other things.</P>
    <P>A lot has been made in the House today, too, of the state of Britain as we see it, particularly in the last year, &mdash;that it has become a decadent nation. I can recall reading in some magazine or other some years ago that at the time of Napoleon somebody in one of the papers went to the trouble of compiling a list of the occasions on which it had been said in the previous 200 years that Britain was on the way out. There were about 20 quotations.  If somebody did research and collected a similar number of quotations since 1800 he would find many indications that Britain was on the way out.  Anyway the British Empire is definitely on the way out.  Where it is going as a country is another thing.  The fact that the Scottish and Welsh nationalists have got seats in Parliament may be an indication that Britain as a nation is on the brink of breaking up.  One wonders how Great Britain as a political unit has got over her difficulties in the economic world.</P>
    <P>We are always inclined to feel that people are not patriotic under those circumstances.  It is one of those things that have grown with us.  I have a feeling that in Britain, particularly in England, you have a conglomeration of people now.  People of various nations are coming in there, Irish, Pakistani, West Indians, to work and earn a lot of money.  They have no sense of loyalty but perhaps the opposite, still living in past history. Their main interest is to draw their wage packet and the bigger it is the better for them.</P>
    <P>This is in contrast to the other countries of Europe, for example, France and Germany, who depend purely, or more or less, on the loyalty of their own people.  I do not know how many would agree with me in this. The Welsh and the Scots find it is time to start thinking about their own problems in a new manner.  Some thousands have done it successfully and it will be interesting to see how these will progress from year to year.  I know that on previous occasions the <Col N="1217" /> nationalists in those areas won seats and lost them again but at that time it was purely under nationalist causes. Now there is economic pressure and this is one of the greatest pressures that can best people or individuals.</P>
    <P>To get back to our own local problems, I should like to state, irrespective of what is being said in this House by members of the Opposition, that the western problems are in the hands of a Government and a Party that are interested in them.  They are making some progress and I hope we will continue to do so.  I feel confident that we will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidly, I was very disappointed with the approach of the last speaker to the problems of the west of Ireland.  He appeared to give the impression to the House that everything in the garden was rosy, that this Government was the only one showing interest in the west of Ireland. When I am finished I hope the boot will be on the other foot.  I am glad, as a Deputy from the west of Ireland, to have this opportunity to say a few words on this Estimate, especially on the items relating to western development, on the amount of money allocated by the Minister for projects there and to point out that much more is required.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the serious problems that obtain in the west of Ireland today, I would have accepted the statement by the Minister on western development as a huge joke, a mere sop, as we say in the west, to gag the mouths of the people who voice their opinions on the problems, the very serious problems, in the western areas. Indeed, the mouths of many in the west have already been gagged.  A strange silence has fallen on the west of Ireland in recent times.  It is a silence to my mind born of frustration in trying to get a Government to understand the problems that exist there and failure to come to their aid before it was too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is it too late now.  The attempt to stop the tidal wave of emigration from the west should have taken place about ten years ago, before 44,000 youths, including entire families, <Col N="1218" /> had left the province of Connacht.</P>
    <P>I remember travelling by train in the winter and watching the railway stations at Ballymote, Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon and Dromod.  The boys and girls came down from the hills and up from the valleys, heading for one focal point, the railway station.  I watched them boarding the trains, their mothers and fathers weeping, waving handkerchiefs until the train disappeared from view.  I chatted with those people during the long journey to Dublin, I learned of their frustration and cynicism which had grown to such an extent that nothing could cure them. I watched them getting off the train at Westland Row, crossing the platform and getting on the boat train.</P>
    <P>During the past two years or so, this is not happening to the same extent.  During the past year, very few are to be seen.  The reason is that most of them have gone and so far as the remnants who are left behind are concerned, even at this late stage, the Government are not realising their responsibilities to the West or properly coming to its aid before vast tracts become playgrounds or national parks.</P>
    <P>In another part of my constituency, north Leitrim&mdash;poor north Leitrim, divested of population&mdash;I not so long ago travelled a road I knew very well. I taught in a school which had a road leading to it from Glenfarne and Kiltyclogher.  The road leading to the school was black with children, up to 35 of them or more.  I travelled that road two years ago to find only two people living on it, one, an old age pensioner living alone and the other, a man of 60 years, also living alone.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments are responsible for the position that obtains in the west of Ireland today.  They did not listen to the voices of the bishops, to the voices of the Save the West Committee, raised so often in appeals to save the West.  It is all right for the Government to say now they are coming to the help of the West.  What they are doing is barely scratching the surface of a tremendous problem.  When I spoke to the 44,000 people who left Connacht during the past years, they told me they had <Col N="1219" /> waited in vain for something to turn up.  They thought surely that the voices of the bishops would be heard and that employment would be found for them.  They waited for the 100,000 jobs Fianna Fáil had promised them.  But they left in despair and frustration.  Some of them told me they would never return to the country in which they were born and reared, the country that had let them down so badly.  That is the true picture of the West, not the picture painted by Deputy Gibbons.  Was the Minister serious last year when he made supplementary provision of £5,000 for special aid projects in the West?  Imagine £5,000 for the West.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Token&rdquo; is correct, but at least it showed that the Government at last realised the problems of the West.  Remember, it is only five years ago, when I was talking here about the West, that a Minister got up and said special problems did not exist in the West, that we were doleful willies coming in here crying about the West where everything was rosy.  There is a big change of heart on the part of Fianna Fáil.  However, when the Minister provided £250,000 this year, did he seriously think that this pittance would help to arrest the tidal wave of emigration from the West?  There are special regional development organisations. How much of this money will go in the salaries of the county development officers, to pay for offices and office staffs, and how much will go directly to do something for the benefit of the people?</P>

Who is serious?  This is only a sop to close the mouths of the people in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nothing of the sort.  It is a concrete, positive contribution, and if the Deputy were sincere, he would welcome it as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome it.  We are grateful for small mercies.  It may be a concrete offer but it is on a miserably small scale.  If the Minister and the Government were sincere when millions of pounds were poured out to foreigners&mdash;some of it went down the drain, too, in the Avoca mines&mdash;why did they not talk in terms of millions to save the West?  On the matter of this regional development plan, I sat down at a table to discover what was in it, what could be done.  I welcome it if some benefits accrue from it.  We sat down at a table in my town of Ballymote, which has a population of 1,000 and where the only industry has been the railway station, to see how industries could be established, but it seems farcical because of the way things are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I have said, something concrete has been started, and I hope things will improve.  The Minister, in his statement, spoke of revitalising the West.  In that there is admission of the problems that exist there.  Of course, I welcome the decentralisation of Departments policy, the move West.  I can see a good reason for sending one of the Departments to Castlebar, but I cannot see any reason for sending one to Athlone at this early stage. <Col N="1221" /> Athlone is not the centre of the West. It is not the centre of a depressed area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean to say there is no emigration from Athlone, that there is no emrigation from anywhere only from the West?  He will admit there has always been emigration from the West and on a larger scale than now.  They were known as &ldquo;the tatie-hokers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Athlone is not so depressed an area as the north-west.  If you look at a map of the west of Ireland and look where the greatest depressed areas in it are you will find that they are in North Leitrim.  Surely the focal point in the north-west was Sligo town, which is only six miles from North Leitrim.  If we were serious in our revitalisation of the West a Department should have been allocated to Sligo town.  I hope in future that that will happen and I would suggest the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>Decentralisation will not revitalise the West.  There are too many houses shut down.  It will not open up those houses again.  There are too many small farms waterlogged and it will not do anything for them.  So far as we in the west of Ireland are concerned the youth are revitalising England and other places, to which they had to emigrate.  If we are serious in revitalising the west of Ireland productive work is what we want.  We want productive employment for our people. On many occasions it has been stated here that in regard to the west of Ireland there is a great amount of money spent on social welfare benefits. We in the west of Ireland are proud people.  There are people, of course, who must draw unemployment assistance but there are quite a number of young people who do not want unemployment assistance.  They want productive work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have any amount of projects for productive work in my constituency. We have the River Arrow and the River Owenmore.  This may not be pertinent on this Estimate but the money must come from the Department <Col N="1222" /> of Finance.  In 1903 the River Arrow was seventh on the priority list and in 1961, almost 60 years afterwards when I asked the Minister for Finance in this House if there were any proposals in his Department for the drainage of the Arrow and the Owenmore he said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We then got the matter going and I understand it is No. 17 on the priority list.  That was good caretaking, from 1903, being seventh to 1967 being No. 17.  If that is the manner in which we are trying to revitalise the West then we might as well forget about it.</P>
    <P>There are 117,000 acres, admitted in this House, waterlogged land in my constituency.  If the money we were talking about a while ago were allocated for drainage work in that part of the country you would have productive employment for the young people who are emigrating and, secondly, you would have the land drained for the farmers who stay at home.</P>
    <P>The other matter I would like to refer to is industrialisation of the West. We are grateful for the small industries but it is no solution to the problem there.  We want some heavy industries which will employ male labour mostly. The only heavy industries in Sligo, I might mention, were established under the inter-Party Government.  Some of the first heavy industries in the West, after the Industrial Development Authority was formed, were opened by an inter-Party Minister.  I understand that we are now promised in the North West a milk powder plant.  We are very grateful, indeed, for that.  It is not to the Government we are grateful, I might say, but to the dairy societies who have done this.  It will be noted in this, too, that the west of Ireland again was the last spot in the country for which a milk powder plant was mooted in spite of the fact that it is a milk producing area.  One was established in the south of Ireland and also in the North, but the West had to be left to the last.  At any rate, I hope that in the future a larger amount of money will be provided for the west of Ireland to aid projects in the West.  In the meantime, we have to wait for the crumbs that fall from the Fianna Fáil table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard quite a few speeches so far in this debate and to listen to some of the speakers you would think that the country was beset by one of the greatest depressions of all time.  Last night, listening briefly to that master, as I term him, of doom and foreboding, Deputy Dillon, speaking, you would swear that we had better quickly look around to see what we are going to do to save ourselves.  I should like to remind some of the members of the Opposition in particular that we in this country have been progressing at an excellent rate in comparison with many other countries in Europe, and certainly in comparison with Britain, a country to which we are supposed to be tied hand and foot.  It was once said that if America got a cold Britain got pneumonia.  The same could have been said about us over here: if Britain got a cold we would get pneumonia.</P>
      <P>This has been shown to be very far from the true situation.  Our annual growth rate from 1957 to 1967 averaged 3 per cent.  In the year of Britain's great difficulty, 1956 to 1957, our growth rate was running around 4 per cent.  Last year, 1966, when we were experiencing a recession, the Government took measures to offset any great unemployment that might occur.  The great difference here was that the action the Fianna Fáil Government took compared with the action, or should I say the non-action, the inter-Party Government took in 1956, shows that today the measures the Fianna Fáil Government took in 1966 have been shown to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit restriction has been eased quite considerably but at no time during the height of that difficult period was there lack of capital available for industrial expansion.  Anybody who required money for industrial expansion found that it was there for them. We have heard a lot of talk about the tremendous failures of the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion.  The First Programme for Economic Expansion was a tremendous success in that all the targets set out in it were exceeded.  The recession which occurred half way through the Second Programme set back certain of these targets.  Nevertheless, when 1970 <Col N="1224" /> comes, it will be seen that many of the targets will have been exceeded.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, we have a tremendous opportunity in this country.  In many quarters, I have heard high praise for the excellent Budget the Minister presented to us this year.  In particular, accountants regarded it as a really excellent measure.  This shows that the measures taken by the Minister were the right ones.  I speak to many people outside this House.  There is no feeling amongst anyone I have met that the country is going down the drain; rather is there a feeling that it is going places.  While Government Ministers are exhorting the people to greater effort for higher production, we have from the Opposition benches the kind of opposition which thrives on breeding dissatisfaction, saying that people are not being paid enough and that the social welfare recipients should get more.  They will tell you a thousand and one ways of giving out money but not how to raise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We should have the wherewithal to give it.  One of the troubles in Britain today is that she is giving so much in welfare benefits without the people earning it, without production.  I should like to read an excerpt from <i>Time</i> magazine, dated November 24th, 1967, in which they state an axiom which applies to this country also:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ability of a nation to earn its way in the world rests primarily on its productivity: its capacity to marshall its human and mechanical resources to produce goods that can compete with those of other nations in the world's marketplace.  Only then does it earn enough income to buy the things it imports.  For most of the postwar years, Britain's productivity has failed to keep pace with that of its competitors.  Among the major industrial nations, Britain since 1951 has had the slowest rise in productivity, the lowest rate of investment in private enterprise and the largest rise in its export prices. In its case, the equation is doubly <Col N="1225" /> exacting; poor in natural resources, Britain must import much of its food and the raw materials for the goods it makes.</P>
    <P>This is exactly what this Government have been saying: in order to receive better social welfare services, you must produce.  We have always believed in paying for all these benefits from the earnings of the people.  We do not borrow to pay them.  The Minister said, quite rightly:</P>
    <P>The decision to devalue was a free choice of the Government after a careful consideration of the various alternative courses of action.  It was a business decision based solely on an assessment of how our national advantage would best be served.</P>
    <P>From time to time a number of people here say we are not really free from Britain.  Many people interpret freedom from Britain as meaning a complete break-away economically as well as politically.  To me, freedom or independence means the right to determine one's course of action, economically as well as politically.  This is exactly what we are doing and what we have been doing.  We are not dependent on Britain politically.  Economically, we are very much tied in with the economy of Britain.  She is our best customer and we are one of her best customers.  I have not got the exact figures, but they value our custom and we value theirs.</P>

      <P>We have a tremendous opportunity to increase our exports to those countries that have not devalued, countries such as the United States, where our goods can be more competitive than ever.  We have an opportunity now to make Ireland even more attractive for the tourists from these countries. It is up to our exporters who purchase their raw materials from countries which have not devalued to make sure, before they buy in these countries, that they cannot obtain them from countries that have devalued and so save themselves considerable costs. I am sure they will do so.</P>
      <P>Devaluation may well have come at a good time for us.  I do not think we are going to lose by it at all.  Our exports are up 30 per cent on last year, which was a record year.  We are producing goods which are more and more required by foreign markets.  We have markets in the new African states, where we can improve our trade considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of time has been given, particularly on television and radio, to the question of decentralisation.  This question has been mooted for years.  Of course, there are always people who try to sow discontent and distrust among those who may be affected.  The Minister has given us assurances that any cases of undue hardship will be examined with a most humane approach: I accept this.  More of us here should be willing to accept it.  In England, decentralisation has been going on for years and it is an accepted thing.  It is amazing, but we have become a nation of pressure groups.  No matter what we do, there is always some group to rise up and say: &ldquo;You cannot do that.&rdquo;  If you go back on it, you will find another group of people rising up and saving: &ldquo;You should have gone ahead with it.&rdquo;  It has become a feature of the <Col N="1227" /> times that pressure groups make themselves heard.  I believe that when this move takes place, the people involved will be quite satisfied and happy with the arrangement.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the State Laboratory.  At the moment when goods are coming into this country, they can be held up due to samples being sent to the State chemist for analysis.  I know they are doing a very good job there, and are working extremely hard, but from time to time raw materials and goods arrive by air because of the urgency with which they are needed, and on previous occasions when I was waiting urgently for a client's raw materials to arrive, I was told it was held up because samples had gone to the State Laboratory.  Perhaps the Minister could have a talk with someone about the possibility of having a special department to deal with these deliveries that come in by air.  I know that when one gets in touch with the Department and says that these things are needed urgently, the State Laboratory will facilitate one as quickly as they can.  More and more as our industrialisation develops, it is becoming necessary to ship goods urgently by air.  I would ask the Minister to say a few words to the appropriate person about that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister says:</P>
    <P>The Government's general attitude to income increases has often been stated.  The Government favour a progressive increase in workers' real incomes according as national production rises and Government policy is directed towards raising national production&mdash;and with it individual productivity&mdash;as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to that for one moment to say that unless this message is carried right down from management to the floor, we can never expect to make the most of the opportunities which we now have.  It has often been said that we are at the crossroads of history, as it were, when we are either going to go up or go down.  One great advantage we have is that because of our low population, as it were, and our close proximity to everyone, it is <Col N="1228" /> easier to relay messages from the top management down through the ranks.</P>

      <P>The people are very well acquainted with the Government's policy, and know the truth or the untruth of many of the statements Opposition speakers make.  Throughout this debate, we have been hearing reports about the dissatisfaction of the workers, and how badly off they are.  The workers themselves know exactly how they are doing.  When they go home with full wage packets at the end of the week, they know whether or not they are badly off.  There is not one Member of the House who does not want to see the workers going home with their wage packets twice or three times as full.  We want them to have two cars if possible, two television sets, and a continental holiday, if they want it.  We would prefer them to spend their holidays in Ireland and use their money here.  The workers are great spenders.  The workers who come here from England are great spenders.  We want all this because if the workers are doing well, the country is doing well.  That has always been the philosophy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I listened again to a lot of&mdash;I hate to use the word because it is used so often&mdash;clichés about the things the inter-Party Government did when they were in office.  The vast majority of the workers are old enough to remember what they did when they were in office.  It was very interesting to listen to some of the arguments in relation to devaluation.  Some thought we should not have devalued, and some thought we should have devalued even more than Britain, which is completely and utterly impractical as one realises when one reads through the Minister's speech.  I have never in my life read a more sane and sensible document.  Any reasonable person reading it must be impressed by the arguments he puts forward.  It is terrible to think that a large number of people in the country will not have the opportunity of reading it.  If only the average citizen realised that he could get a copy of the Minister's speech by writing in to the <Col N="1229" /> Stationery Office, he could read it in its entirely, and also the speeches of the Opposition, and weigh up all the arguments.  The tendency has always been for the Opposition to underestimate the intelligence of the average citizen.  That is a terrible mistake for them, did they but realise it.  They have seen so little of office that even now they have not caught on, and I do not think they ever will.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>On 13th July, 1965, the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, in answer to a question by Deputy Cosgrave intimated that if the pound sterling was devalued the Irish pound would be devalued as well.  Nobody asked for reconsideration of this reply.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that there has been no sincere attempt by the Opposition in this regard.  I realise it must be most difficult to be in Opposition at this time, because the Government have been handling the affairs of the country so well that there is very little they can really criticise.  This will be seen again this Christmas.  Last year when the country was supposed to be &ldquo;bust&rdquo;, according to Deputy Dillon, we had a record spending spree.  This Christmas also there will be a record spending spree.</P>

The people of this country will find that the cost of living will not rise to anything like the degree members of the Opposition Parties in this House hope it will.  The Minister has given it as his estimate that it will rise by approximately two per cent.  If that is the maximum, it is not very much in comparison with what the position might have been if our financial affairs had been in a bad way.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated previously that it looked very like as if we would end this year with a surplus.  Although I have not got the facts, being an optimist I still believe that we can end up with a surplus.  I do not know what the Opposition will have to say about that then.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister say that.  There are a lot of people waiting to see the predictions of the Opposition come true.  Of course, they will not.  The Opposition seem to thrive on doom and disaster. It is a terrible thing that Irishmen could hope for disaster to befall the country but it amounts to that.  If there were speeches containing a grain of constructive criticism or even a word of praise one could accept that there might be some sincerity in them but none of the speeches has been constructive.  The only time a Minister will get constructive criticism is from his own Party because they are the people who have the country's welfare at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker was talking about promises made by Fianna Fáil and Deputy L'Estrange also referred to <Col N="1231" /> those promises.  We have been able always to stand before the people, no matter how difficult the times might be, and to say that if we were returned to power taxation might go up and that it was very likely that it would.  I remember listening to one speech made by Mr. de Valera during an election campaign.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the promise made by the Coalition Parties before they formed a Coalition.  I think it was the Fine Gael Party who promised to reduce taxation by £10 million if they were elected.  I was reading through some of the debates not so long ago in the Library in which they were called upon to carry out the promises they made.  When it comes to promises, Fianna Fáil have always promised that they would have the interests of the people of this country at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these depended on the country's ability to produce enough to pay for the schemes.  We have to recognise that even though we are somewhere isolated from the mainstream of Europe what happens in Europe very much affects us.  If the circumstances in Europe deteriorate we have to tighten our belts.  This is one thing that our people have never been afraid to do.  Now we are on the road to expansion.  We are becoming industrialised. We are fortunate in that we do not have to import food in order to live.  Everything is in our favour. The Government are giving every encouragement that any Government could give.  The Government can only set the guidelines.  It is up to the people themselves to make the most of the <Col N="1233" /> opportunities available.  The Minister for Finance controls the purse strings and it is he and the Government who decide how best to spend the money. As an accountant, he has, I think, shown a great deal of wisdom in his custodianship of the public purse.</P>
      <P>The full effects of devaluation will not be felt for another six to 12 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on whether these commodities were purchased prior to or after devaluation.  Certainly the vast rise in the cost of living forecast by some speakers will not come about and, once more, the people will have an opportunity of knowing who told them the truth and who misled them.</P>
      <P>Despite all the Opposition arguments no speaker has really taken the Minister's speech and refuted it item by item.  I should not really be telling the Opposition how they should do their work.  But there has been no constructive criticism, no concrete suggestions made to help to remedy the situation. It is always easy for those who have no responsibility to find fault and to say what should or should not be done. That is one of the easiest exercises of all.</P>
      <P>Industry has progressed and is progressing. Various incentives are there for those who wish to avail of them. There are grants for modernising factories. These should be grabbed with both hands by the industrialists.  The money is there.  There is money provided for retraining workers and also under the Redundancy Payments Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that it will be there when it is required.  The workers will appreciate that.  It was said that devaluation coupled with the increased interest rate would have the effect of depressing the economy.  The Minister has already pointed out that, if we keep our costs stable, there will be no depression.  The economy will not suffer.  He further stated that devaluation would provide a boost to exports and therefore to industrial expansion. We have got our fingers on the pulse. We know the hard work that must be done in order to hold our position in <Col N="1235" /> highly competitive world markets. What we must do, what we are, in fact, doing is developing more modern techniques and know-how.  The Minister has given a sizeable grant to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to encourage invention.  This is all part of a programme&mdash;I use the word advisedly&mdash;of preparedness for the years that lie ahead.  The best government in the world could not achieve this without the will of the <Col N="1236" /> people.  What this country has achieved in the short period of its existence as an independent State more than justifies the sacrifices made in the past and with continued wise guidance and leadership, we will progress to even greater heights.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 5th December, 1967.</P>
